Divis was also last seen floating face down in the river, full of stab-holes. Aulus is set against Kerra and her tribe who now stand on the brink of war with the Regni. And they haven’t had any dinner. And we are reminded of Veran’s, “The gods don’t deal, Rome. The gods don’t deal”, in case we weren’t sure who is really running this show. The Irish raven, Hella, must have got to Cait just in time because the youngster is lying on the ground tied-up while Hella sits nearby, eating. “I’m death,” Hella tells her before loading Cait on to her horse and galloping off, we presume to Aulus to collect her reward. Vitus gets promotion to prefectus since the precipitous flight of Lucius last week. Antedia is disappointed to see “pretty boy” not attending their negotiations and had obviously planned to “seal the deal” with him once their talks were complete. Aulus takes Antedia to the crest of the hill and shows her the size of his legion. Even she looks mildly impressed, saying, “It’ll do”, the trace of a smile playing on her blue lips. “I’d love to see copper-knob’s face now,” she grins. Copper-knob is indeed troubled by the sight of thousands of soldiers approaching her citadel but brushes Amena off when she dobs in Lindon for burning the grain store. Meanwhile, Divis pulls off the greatest coup of the series when he floats down-river into the path of a bear. Half-dead himself, he grabs it, kills it and uses its teeth and guts to make a rudimentary surgery kit, suturing his own deep stab wounds and staggering off in the direction of the druid camp having asked Big Pebble which way to go. Hooray! ‘It is her’ “Someone’s having a fucking laugh,” says Phelan for the umpteenth time to Ania as he begins to tire of the hippy life and endless bowls of bowel-stimulating pulses. “Fancy a fuck?” asks a passing hag in the bleakest sexual exchange since Threads as the pair wait for their audience with Veran. When Ania finds out she isn’t the goddess of war after all and just some spaced-out hippy chick, Phelan’s mind is made up. He’s had enough of Glastonbury and wants to go back to Foxton’s where at least you can get a cold Diet Coke, thanks. Hella sells Cait to the druids for a bag of gold and heads off into the woods with a final, “I’m bored now”. I liked her. Kerra insists she must go and speak to Aulus alone, which turns out to be a mistake as he grabs her knife, stabs her and cuts her heart out, throwing it on the fire. A terrified Cait is unwrapped by Veran who breaths in her face, “It is her”. What his breath must smell like after 10,000 years doesn’t bear thinking about. He’s furious to see Divis and won’t tell him how the prophecy ends. “You want to know what happens next?” says Veran as all the main players prepare themselves for war. It’s like they’re asking us. Subtle. ‘Hope is the small daughter of a blind father’ Before he murders Kerra, Aulus makes her watch as his legion cleanses the Regni camp with fire. “Let me show you how the empire really works,” he growls at her, double-crossing his former allies spectacularly. Antedia’s unfortunate son is fatally skewered as the queen tries to make it to safety, which is sure to annoy her. Veran tells Phelan of “a new light” somewhere out there and he tells the golden-haired former royal to go and find it, whatever “it” is. Amena is crowned queen of the Cantii with the Romans’ blessing as Antedia stews in the Cantii dungeons beneath, chanting, “The gods are dead.” “Hope is the small daughter of a blind father,” repeats Veran as Cait awakes in the centre of the stone circle, unknown runes carved into her forehead. Looking around, she spies Divis at the edge of the circle, watching her. “I know what happens next,” he says. Was there ever a more confident signpost for a second series? I don’t know if I’d hurl another sack of gold at this if I were Sky/Amazon, but maybe with some new writers (hey, what about some female writers – crazy thought) the triumvirate of Cait/Antedia/Amena could make for a fun power dynamic? What a ride. Thanks for sticking with me. What did you think? Should it be brought back to life with smoky twigs or left hanging? Notes from the end of the woad Veran’s colleague tells him that the moon told him that Aulus must be allowed his victories so that he becomes “drunk with glory”. That part of the plan seems to have been left dangling in mid-air. What happened to Cheech and Chong? Did they get slaughtered by the Assyrians last week? Would they have even noticed? Is Cait actually Boudicca? And if she is, what’s the big deal about the leader of a failed uprising against the Romans which changed basically nothing? (Roman historians, back me up here.) Is a series two without Kelly Reilly even a thing you’d watch? I know people come back to life with amazing regularity here, but I think even she would struggle without any ventricles. Also, is Cait’s dad OK?"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"sport/2018/mar/14/ruby-walsh-suspected-broken-leg-fall-al-boum-photo-cheltenham-festival-horse-racing","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-14T15:10:10Z","webTitle":"Ruby Walsh has suspected broken leg after heavy fall at Cheltenham Festival","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/mar/14/ruby-walsh-suspected-broken-leg-fall-al-boum-photo-cheltenham-festival-horse-racing","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/mar/14/ruby-walsh-suspected-broken-leg-fall-al-boum-photo-cheltenham-festival-horse-racing","fields":{"headline":"Ruby Walsh has suspected broken leg after heavy fall at Cheltenham Festival","bodyText":"Ruby Walsh, the most successful jockey in Cheltenham Festival history, will miss the remainder of this year’s meeting and possibly the rest of the 2017-18 jumps season after aggravating a recent leg injury in a fall on the second day of the Festival meeting on Wednesday. Walsh, who missed four months of this campaign after breaking his leg in a fall at Punchestown in November, was riding Al Boum Photo in the second race, the RSA Novice Chase. His mount hit the second-last fence and fell, and then appeared to roll on to Walsh’s leg. Walsh was shielded from the grandstands by sightscreens as he received first aid for several minutes, and the concern of his family was clear as his father, mother and two sisters all hurried down the course towards the second-last. Walsh needed considerable support to make his way to a waiting ambulance, and was then taken to Gloucestershire Royal Infirmary to have an X-ray. Jennifer Walsh, who is also her brother’s agent, said later in a statement: “Unfortunately, Ruby has aggravated the same injury he suffered last November. He will see a specialist next week in Dublin.” Walsh, who is 38, returned to racecourse action just five days ago, and rode two winners at Cheltenham on Tuesday. In addition to missing the last two days of this year’s Festival, he seems likely to miss the Grand National meeting at Aintree in mid-April. But Willie Mullins, who retains Walsh as his stable jockey, did seem hopeful on Wednesday night that Walsh might return in time for the Punchestown Festival in late April. “The information I have is that he has a stress fracture on the old break,” Mullins said. “He might need a cast for maybe three weeks or a month and then he could be back. Instead of being back for Galway [in July], he could be back for Punchestown. That would be a fantastic result.” Mullins said that Paul Townend is expected to ride Un De Sceaux, last year’s winner, in the Ryanair Chase at Cheltenham on Thursday, but riding plans for Friday’s Cheltenham Gold Cup, a race that Mullins has yet to win, remain uncertain. “I haven’t really thought about it, to be honest,” Mullins said. “I’ll leave it up to the jockeys. Paul [Townend] will be offered the ride on Killultagh Vic [Walsh’s intended mount], but he might want to stay on Total Recall, in which case David [Mullins] or Patrick [Mullins] could ride Killultagh Vic.” Walsh has been the leading rider at the Cheltenham Festival nine times in the past decade, and was leading the race for this year’s title when he sustained his injury. In all, he has ridden 58 winners at the Festival meeting, 23 more than the next rider in the all-time list, Barry Geraghty, and had realistic prospects of becoming the first jockey to ride 60 winners at the meeting before the end of the week. Walsh has sustained many injuries over the course of his long career, including a broken shin when his foot collided with a running rail during a race at Pardubice in the Czech Republic in 1999. He recovered in time to ride Papillon to victory in the Grand National at Aintree a few months later. He also had his spleen removed after it was ruptured in a fall at Cheltenham in November 2008. Katie Walsh, Ruby’s sister, rode the final winner on Wednesday’s card as Relegate finished fast to beat another Mullins-trained runner, Carefully Selected, who had been due to be ridden by her brother. “This is a fantastic day,” said Katie Walsh. “I really appreciate it and I’m very lucky to be here to do it. [But] my heart goes out to Ruby. His bad fortune has turned into a marvellous day for me. All I can think of is him, to be honest. Once he’s up and he’s talking, that’s the main thing.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"housing-network/2018/mar/19/affordable-homes-low-cost-rent-uk-planning-policy-government-developers","type":"article","sectionId":"housing-network","sectionName":"Housing Network","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-19T07:07:13Z","webTitle":"Developers are skimping on low-cost housing.

Time to get tough","bodyText":"The government has missed another opportunity to put the building of affordable housing where it belongs – at the heart of planning policy. Affordable homes that are built when developers get planning permission for a housing scheme make a vital contribution to meeting need. The government’s latest consultation on reforming the way developers work with local authorities shows the two existing schemes secured contributions from developers last year worth £4bn – and resulted in more than 43% of the affordable housing built in England in 2016/17: 18,000 homes of the total 41,530. But its target of providing 50,000 affordable homes each year in England can be achieved only if developers continue to contribute at least the same number of affordable homes. That figure is based on the government’s commitment to provide 225,000 affordable homes during this parliament (2015-20). So it is extraordinary that when the government listed its objectives for a package of planning reforms, announced earlier this month, increasing the supply of affordable housing wasn’t one of them. At a time when more and more people are in need of genuinely affordable homes, the statistics are sobering. Recent research by the Guardian has highlighted that only a tiny proportion of the homes granted planning permission in the past two years in some of our biggest cities have been affordable. Contributions from developers towards local houses and infrastructure are collected in two ways: section 106 agreements, which are negotiated between developers and local authorities; and the community infrastructure levy, introduced in 2010 as a faster and more transparent way to ensure that developers make a reasonable contribution to the costs of providing necessary additional infrastructure when new houses are built. The government has two concerns about section 106 deals. It wants reassurance that robust requirements for affordable homes are being set out in the initial agreement, and it wants to be sure that any such targets are then adhered to. It has suggested that contributions by developers might be set nationally, and be non-negotiable – but this is intended perhaps as more of a threat than a viable reform. Making policies more open to local scrutiny could help. The revised National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) encourages councils to agree affordable housing contributions at pre-application stage, thus avoiding contentious and confidential “viability” assessments, often done once significant work has already taken place, which frequently conclude that including affordable homes would fail to provide enough profit for the developer. But the new requirements focus firmly on home ownership and private renting. Any separate specification for what is urgently needed – building for low-cost renting by social landlords – is entirely absent. The weakness of the new proposals will show in areas where local plans aren’t in place or where their affordable housing requirements aren’t enforced, and viability assessments are still required. New guidance calls for such tests to be done on an open-book basis – but there is nothing on how councils should challenge evidence provided by developers if they argue that a council’s affordable housing requirements are no longer feasible. In 2013, a study of the 82 largest housing developments in 10 major cities by the Bureau of Investigative Journalism found that only 40% complied with local targets for affordable housing. And last year, Shelter research carried out in 11 local authorities across England showed that 2,500 affordable homes were lost in just one year on schemes where developers submitted viability assessments – equivalent to a 79% reduction in affordable housing compared to the levels required by council policies. The problem is that the government doesn’t want to antagonise builders or delay developments by toughening the requirements it places on them. The only alternative is to provide councils and housing associations with more funding to build the houses themselves. Only a massive increase in such funding could replace the developer contributions on which so much new affordable housing now depends. • John Perry is senior policy adviser at the Chartered Institute of Housing.

It follows four scientists and a paramedic – all female – who enter the Shimmer, a quarantined zone from which no living creature has emerged alive. With “no compass, no comms and no coordinates” to guide them, as paramedic Anya (Jane the Virgin’s Gina Rodriguez) neatly puts it, “either something kills them, or they go crazy and kill each other”. Told through an efficient series of flashbacks, recounted by Natalie Portman’s serious, clever cell biologist Lena, we gradually learn the creepy nature of the Shimmer, itself a wobbling wall of light that looks like the prismatic rainbow swirls that might collect on top of a sudsy bowl of water, and the mutating horrors it contains. Beginning as science-driven sci-fi, the film shifts gears into horror-thriller territory, before abandoning those narrative beats in favour of an ambitious, “conceptual” final half-hour that scrambles a little to wrap itself up. Dumped on Netflix, due to studio anxieties about its supposedly limited box-office potential, I was pleasantly surprised to discover that the film doesn’t suffer on a small screen (though it might sing on a larger one). However, to call it highbrow is both to underestimate audiences and to overstate the film’s intellectual designs. Garland seems to be going for something more poetic and mood-based, with images of Portman climbing into a scorched hole in a white, webbed room, and a burning lighthouse lingering long after the film ends."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"politics/2018/mar/14/we-lost-half-our-embassy-how-russia-retaliated-in-1985-spy-row","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-14T17:00:13Z","webTitle":"‘We lost half our embassy’: how Russia retaliated in 1985 spy row","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/mar/14/we-lost-half-our-embassy-how-russia-retaliated-in-1985-spy-row","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/mar/14/we-lost-half-our-embassy-how-russia-retaliated-in-1985-spy-row","fields":{"headline":"‘We lost half our embassy’: how Russia retaliated in 1985 spy row","bodyText":"The last mass expulsion of alleged Russian spies from London took place in September 1985, at the height of the cold war, when the British government ordered 25 Soviet diplomats to leave. It triggered a wave of tit-for-tat expulsions that were halted only after the British ambassador in Moscow, irate at facing the effective closure of his embassy, pleaded with ministers to quit while they were ahead. “Never engage in a pissing match with a skunk, he possesses important natural advantages,” Sir Bryan Cartledge advised in a telegram to London. Margaret Thatcher had ordered the expulsion of Russian diplomats after the defection of Oleg Gordievsky, a former head of KGB operations in London, who had named KGB personnel operating in the Soviet embassy in London. Within two days of Thatcher’s move, the Russians retaliated by giving 25 British nationals – including journalists and diplomats – 48 hours to leave the Soviet Union. The list included the two Foreign Office/MI6 officers who had got Gordievsky out of Russia in the boot of their car, embassy staff, the BBC correspondent Tim Sebastian and journalists from the Observer, Daily Mail, Telegraph and Reuters. “Their retaliation was numerically proportionate. That was bad enough because, as they always do, they pick the Russian speakers because they know that is going to cause the maximum damage. So I lost all my Russian speakers at a stroke and a third of my staff,” Cartledge told the British diplomatic oral history project in 2007. “The question then was: what did London do next? Mrs Thatcher and the foreign secretary, who was by then Sir Geoffrey Howe, were in favour of expelling a further half dozen Russians who they wanted to get rid of. I argued against this when I was told … partly on purely practical grounds. I couldn’t afford to lose any more staff, but also because I couldn’t see where this was going to end.” Despite his warning about the skunk-like nature of the KGB, a further six Soviet officials were expelled from London: “So I lost another six as well, which meant that we’d lost half our embassy and it took a long time to make that up. For about three months we were in a freeze zone as an embassy and we couldn’t get any appointments.” Downing Street papers released in 2014 showed there were lengthy deliberations over the scale of the initial expulsions. Howe favoured expelling nine but Thatcher’s decisive blue pencil circled 25 on the final options paper. They also considered restricting free travel for Soviet diplomats to within 20 miles of London. The careful deliberations were also marked by a concern that expulsions could put back into the deep freeze the newly developing Anglo-Soviet dialogue that had begun earlier that year with Thatcher declaring the new Soviet premier, Mikhail Gorbachev, as “a man one could do business with”. The Downing Street papers show that on the day Gordievsky’s defection was revealed to the world, Thatcher told the US president, Ronnie Reagan: “We are making it clear to the Russians, on my personal authority, that while we cannot tolerate the sort of intelligence actions which Gordievsky has revealed, we continue to desire a constructive relationship with them.” Cartledge, the British ambassador, agreed: “The Russians are realistic enough to expect us to take vigorous action on the basis of [Gordievsky’s] revelations to us,” he said. “The nature and strength of their reaction will depend on how far we can convince them that we nevertheless have not abandoned the larger objectives of a sustained dialogue.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2018/mar/19/from-tomb-raider-to-a-wrinkle-in-time-why-hollywood-has-daddy-issues","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-19T10:00:16Z","webTitle":"From Tomb Raider to A Wrinkle in Time: why Hollywood has daddy issues","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/mar/19/from-tomb-raider-to-a-wrinkle-in-time-why-hollywood-has-daddy-issues","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/mar/19/from-tomb-raider-to-a-wrinkle-in-time-why-hollywood-has-daddy-issues","fields":{"headline":"From Tomb Raider to A Wrinkle in Time: why Hollywood has daddy issues","bodyText":"While Hollywood has been smashing its own patriarchy off-screen, we’ve also been seeing a curious absence of fathers on it lately. Especially in family movies. Dead parents have long been a reliable source of sympathy for young heroes, but it’s dads who seem to be dying or disappearing right now. Coincidence or conspiracy? This week it’s the rebooted Tomb Raider – the quarry of Lara Croft’s intrepid adventure is not some priceless artefact but her missing-presumed-dead father, who disappeared under mysterious circumstances. Once Lara gets an inkling of where he went, it’s anchors aweigh. Next week we’ve got another missing dad: Chris Pine, playing a scientist who got lost somewhere in the fifth dimension while mucking about with quantum entanglement, or something. Again, his daughter Meg’s mission to find him sets in motion A Wrinkle in Time, Disney’s expensive sci-fi extravaganza. Like Lara Croft, Meg is not a sweet, innocent girl. She’s stubborn, angry, and resentful – all principally as a result of her absent father, who others assume has abandoned his family. The story’s original author, Madeleine L’Engle, was shipped off to a Swiss boarding school aged 12, ostensibly on account of her father’s ill health. Her fiction is full of searches for fathers. Anyone who saw last year’s amazing documentary The Work, in which tearful prisoners in an intense therapy workshop all blamed their fathers for their criminality, will know how deep this issue runs. In family movies, absent fathers are often the root of problems. In The Hunger Games, Katniss’s dad dies in a mining accident when she’s 11; her mum is virtually catatonic with depression. Chris Pratt spends the first Guardians of the Galaxy movie haunted by his father’s mysterious absence, and the second one haunted by his presence. Star Wars has built a whole universe on daddy issues. And let’s not forget the daddy of all dad-issue film-makers: Steven Spielberg. Absent or distant fathers are a running theme throughout his work, from Richard Dreyfuss in Close Encounters and Roy Scheider in Jaws (who abandon their families to go hunting aliens and sharks, respectively), to the orphaned heroine of The BFG (who finds a BF father figure). Then there’s Indiana Jones who, like Lara Croft, goes on a quest to rescue his long-disappeared father in The Last Crusade. Indy then becomes an absent father himself in Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (his son grows up to be Shia LaBeouf, which kind of explains things). No surprise that Spielberg’s next movie, Ready Player One, centres on a teenage hero who lives with his aunt and is drawn into a virtual world created by a wise old man. But nowhere did Spielberg play out his father fixation as magnificently as in ET. Poor Elliott is in yet another single-parent family, with a working mum just about holding it together. When they ridicule his alien sighting, Elliott glumly says, “Dad would believe me,” and everybody stops laughing. Sure enough, ET becomes the stand-in man of the house. He unites the family, offers Elliott companionship and advice, and then, in one of the most heartbreaking scenes in the movies, abandons him again. Spielberg once described ET as “my story about my parents who got divorced when I was a teenager … and the effect it had on me … that picture was about looking for a surrogate father, looking for someone to fill the void of the missing parent.” These stories often spring from that void, but they can help fill it, too.

Federal prosecutors announced the charges against Jun Ying, the former chief information officer of Equifax’s US Information Solutions, on Wednesday. “As alleged in our complaint, Ying used confidential information to conclude that his company had suffered a massive data breach, and he dumped his stock before the news went public,” said Richard Best, director of the Securities and Exchange Commission’s Atlanta regional office. “Corporate insiders who learn inside information, including information about material cyber intrusions, cannot betray shareholders for their own financial benefit.” Equifax announced on 7 September that it had discovered a months-long data breach that potentially exposed the personal information of 143 million people in the United States as well as some 700,000 in the UK. Its shares were trading at almost $143 before the announcement and fell 18% after the news broke. They are now trading for about $122. The complaint alleges that Ying and other executives were told of a “VERY large breach opportunity” at Equifax in an email on 25 August. According to the lawsuit Ying sold about 6,800 Equifax shares “after he learned of the breach but before the company had announced it publicly, amounting to an illegal trade based on insider information”. Ying sold those shares on 28 August for about $950,000. According to the SEC, he would have made $117,000 less if he had sold those shares after the breach was made public. The suit also alleges that an hour before Ying sold his shares he “used a search engine to find information on the internet concerning the September 2015 cybersecurity breach of Experian, another one of the three major credit bureaus, and the impact that breach had on Experian’s stock price. The search terms used by Ying were: (1) “Experian breach”; (2) “Experian stock price 9/15/2015”; and (3) “Experian breach 2015.” The research revealed that while the Experian breach was far smaller than Equifax’s, the disclosure of the breach negatively affected the share price."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/mar/14/united-airlines-dog-japan-kansas-mistake","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-14T16:11:54Z","webTitle":"Dog gone: United Airlines mistakenly flies family German shepherd to Japan","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/14/united-airlines-dog-japan-kansas-mistake","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/mar/14/united-airlines-dog-japan-kansas-mistake","fields":{"headline":"Dog gone: United Airlines mistakenly flies family German shepherd to Japan","bodyText":"United Airlines is investigating after mistakenly flying a Kansas family’s dog to Japan. KCTV reports that Kara Swindle and her two children flew from Oregon to Kansas City, Missouri, on Tuesday on a United flight. They went to a cargo facility to pick up 10-year-old Irgo, a German shepherd, but were instead given a great Dane. Swindle, of Wichita, Kansas, learned Irgo had been put on a flight to Japan, where the great Dane was supposed to go. Airline officials in Japan put Irgo on a flight back to Kansas City. It was not clear when the dog would arrive. The news of Irgo’s unplanned odyssey comes as United admits another dog died after a flight attendant forced it to travel in an overhead bin on a Houston-to-New York flight. On United Flight 1284 on Monday, a woman who was flying with children and a small dog was pressured by a flight attendant to put her dog in overhead storage during the three-and-a-half-hour flight. According to fellow passenger Maggie Gremminger, the woman wanted to keep the dog, which was in a small carrying bag, under her seat, but the flight attendant insisted that she put the animal overhead. “At the end of the flight, the woman found her dog, deceased. She sat in the airplane aisle on the floor crying, and all of surrounding passengers were utterly stunned,” Gremminger wrote in a series of tweets alongside a picture of the woman and her children. United called the incident “a tragic accident that should never have occurred, as pets should never be placed in the overhead bin”. This is not the first time United has come under scrutiny for its treatment of animals. Last year, the carrier was sued by the owners of a giant rabbit that died on one of its flights. Some 24 pets died while flying with US carriers last year, 18 of them with United, according to the Department of Transportation.

Everyone from Eminem to Mase (do YouTube his shaky ballad Jealous Guys) to Lil Wayne has tried it – and, quite honestly, in 2018 anyone can do it with a bit of Auto-Tune and clever production. But going from singing to rapping? That’s different. Rapping is a skill and, like herpes, you’ve either got it or you haven’t. No one apart from Cardi B wakes up one day and just decides they’re going to be a rapper. Unless you’re Beyoncé, that is. Two weeks ago, Queen B dropped bars on DJ Khaled’s Top Off alongside Jay-Z and Future – leading Chance the Rapper to tweet that “Beyoncé is my favourite rapper”(same, Chance, same). On Tidal, Jay’s streaming service, the song has been attributed to “B” rather than Beyoncé, leading fans to speculate that a rap alter ego may be on its way. Of course, “B” has flirted with rap before, on Flawless in 2013 and Feeling Myself in 2014 with Nicki Minaj, among others. This is pretty rare behaviour in pop, however; usually, rapping is like performing at a dictator’s birthday party – something stars do once then never mention again. There was Kylie’s brief verse on Secret (Take You Home), Simon Webbe rapped on Blue’s All Rise, and Madonna spat bars about her coffee choices on American Life (“I’m drinking a soy latte/ I get a double shot-ay”). But it doesn’t always go to plan. Robbie Williams, a man who has managed to pull off everything from tiger Y-fronts to a swing album, could not pull off rapping on Rudebox (“Up yer jacksy/ Split yer kecks”). Diplo has stuck very firmly to production since his trying-very-hard verse on Three Loco’s We Are Llamas, while Justin Bieber’s bars on the producer’s track Bankroll were so ill-received that he took it offline and reissued it without him. It’s easy to see, then, why Rihanna is also approaching rap with the same caution you’d approach, say, Azealia Banks. She was sort-of rapping all 2017 – on N.E.R.D’s Lemon, going toe to toe with Kendrick Lamar on Loyalty, outshining Bryson Tiller on Wild Thoughts – stoking rumours of a full rap album. Going head to head with Bey and Riri in the 2018 rap game? Taylor Swift, maybe. Before Reputation, Taylor Swift rapping was just a threat parents would use on misbehaving kids. But now, with her almost-bars on Look What You Made Me Do and Ready For It, she’s proved she has the potential to be, if not the new Stefflon Don, at least the new Iggy Azalea. Tay’s already an expert in diss tracks, she loves putting expensive cars in her videos, she’s mates with two rappers (Future and, er, Ed Sheeran) – it’s all working out perfectly. Do it, Taylor. We can’t see a white middle-class rapper upsetting anyone. Absolutely no risk attached to this move at all."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"sport/blog/2018/mar/14/tiger-woods-revival-masters-ewan-murray","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-14T15:09:57Z","webTitle":"Tiger Woods revival ignites Masters buildup but glory may have to wait | Ewan Murray","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2018/mar/14/tiger-woods-revival-masters-ewan-murray","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/blog/2018/mar/14/tiger-woods-revival-masters-ewan-murray","fields":{"headline":"Tiger Woods revival ignites Masters buildup but glory may have to wait","bodyText":"Bookmakers are apparently revelling in these fevered times for golf. By Monday afternoon, the only absent bulletin was the price for Tiger Woods to walk unassisted on Rae’s Creek when taking to the 12th green during his first round at the Masters. That may be in the post. Woods’s surpassing of expectations has been timely. With the first major of the year, the Masters, only three weeks away, the 42-year-old finds himself listed among the second favourites to prevail. Woods can be backed at shorter odds than Sergio García, the defending champion, Justin Rose, a modern day Augusta specialist, and Bubba Watson, a double winner in the past six years. As recently as September Woods admitted he was unsure whether he could ever play competitive golf again as back issues refused to subside. Now he is fuelling a spike in television ratings which only serves to endorse his value to a sport that occasionally grasps desperately for relevance. Two things are undeniable. Woods has surprised all onlookers with his latest return to the PGA Tour, which has included 12th place at the Honda Classic and last weekend’s second at the Valspar Championship. That the 14-times major champion is trying to piece together arguably the greatest comeback in the history of sport is also of benefit to the rest of the Masters field, who will gleefully talk up Woods’s chances while shifting the spotlight away from themselves. On Tuesday Woods spoke of his “frustration” at missing the Masters of 2016 and 2017. “I love playing Augusta National, I love it,” he said. “And I know how to play it. “Sometimes I don’t play it well but I know how to play it. Just being out there on those greens, hitting putts and being creative … there’s no other golf course like it in the world and there’s no other golf tournament like it. It’s a players’ heaven. “It has a deep place in my heart. I am very eager to get back. I feel like I am physically able to do it again and it’s going to be a lot of fun.” That even Woods is keen to add to this wave of optimism will have wider meaning. He has, after all, always been happy to place doubt or fear into the minds of opponents. At this stage in his career he has little to lose. Nonetheless, perhaps we have skipped a few steps of reality. It is also surely fair to view a year of competitive Woods golf before making strong claims of imminent glory. Woods has not won a major title since 2008. His last top-10 finish at the Masters – an event he has not claimed since 2005 – was five years ago. Albeit this is the formative stages of a comeback, Woods is still to enjoy anything approaching the leaderboard significance that should have the likes of Justin Thomas cowering with fear. He has not emerged successfully from a battle with Thomas or his peers. Phil Mickelson, who produced a stunning performance this month to claim the WGC Mexico Championship at the age of 47, looks a more salient Masters bet than Woods. Mickelson is seeking to become the oldest winner in Masters history. That Augusta National is not particularly penal off the tee plays into the left-hander’s favour. Another man no doubt delighted to fall under the radar is Paul Casey. The 40-year-old Englishman took on status as the man who killed Santa Claus on Sunday, his brilliant 65 proving five strokes better than Woods on the day. Casey can be bracketed among those with too much talent not to win a major but that drought is ongoing. Casey is admirably free from shackles when on the golf course. “I don’t stress about technique, I never have,” he said. “I figure everything out, I pick the target and hit it.” A Casey game perfectly suited for Augusta is illustrated by his last three finishes there – sixth, fourth and sixth. More worthy of attention perhaps was the ending of a wait for a PGA Tour win that had stretched back to 2009. Casey cut a distraught figure after falling short at the Tour Championship in September but has recovered in emphatic style. He is the only player in this PGA Tour season to produce three closing rounds of 66 or better. “At Augusta, a 40-something could take on anybody,” Casey said. The 40-something on everybody’s lips plays at the Arnold Palmer Invitational from Thursday. Woods has won at Bay Hill eight times. “That doesn’t automatically mean I’m going to win this week,” he cautioned. “I still have to do the work.” It remains one in progress. Excitement attached to Woods is perfectly fair but it requires occasional context."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2018/mar/14/arsene-wenger-jack-wilshere-england-contract-arsenal","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-14T22:46:00Z","webTitle":"Arsène Wenger out to woo unhappy Arsenal fans in Milan return leg","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/mar/14/arsene-wenger-jack-wilshere-england-contract-arsenal","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/mar/14/arsene-wenger-jack-wilshere-england-contract-arsenal","fields":{"headline":"Arsène Wenger out to woo unhappy Arsenal fans in Milan return leg","bodyText":"Arsenal versus Milan ought to be one of the glamour fixtures of the season. Not this time. When the sixth-placed team in the Premier League takes on the sixth-placed team in Serie A at Emirates Stadium on Thursday night, it will be in the Europa League rather than the Champions League and, to borrow a line from Gazzetta dello Sport, it has the feel of a clash of lost nobility. Arsenal have stabilised a little since the nightmare defeats by Manchester City in the Carabao Cup final and the league, followed by another at Brighton &amp; Hove Albion, with the 2-0 win in Milan last Thursday – in the first leg of this last-16 tie – being talked up by the optimists such as Arsène Wenger as the catalyst. His team also beat Watford 3-0 at home on Sunday. Yet a principal subplot of Milan’s visit will be the Emirates Stadium attendance and, specifically, how many Arsenal fans actually want to watch their team. It is worth noting they have paid for their seats as part of season-ticket packages. The stadium was half-full for the 3-0 defeat against City two weeks ago – on a bitterly cold night – and roughly two-thirds so for Watford on a more clement Sunday lunchtime. “It was early on Sunday,” Wenger said, overlooking the fact that the 1.30pm kick-off was not that early; thankfully he did not mention Mother’s Day. “I have played in front of sold-out stadiums for 22 years and I am grateful. If there are one or two games and the stadium is not completely full, we have to look at ourselves and get the fans behind us again.” “Hopefully there won’t be so many empty seats,” the midfielder Aaron Ramsey said. “But we’re just focused on trying to win a football game. Hopefully our performances on the pitch will encourage many to come back.” Arsenal – and Wenger – are locked in a battle to regain the trust of the support but it feels as though their latest assignment offers them a hiding to nothing. With the hard work seemingly done at San Siro, progress has come to be taken for granted. Elimination, on the other hand, would reignite crisis. Milan were awful in the first leg despite their recent revival under Rino Gattuso. Arsenal dare not muck it up, particularly as their season has come to rest on this competition. The first goal has assumed tremendous importance. If Arsenal were to score it the tie would be over, but if they conceded it would not be difficult to imagine the panic. Remember Östersund in the last 32 when Arsenal flirted with disaster in the return leg at the Emirates? “Europe gives you a psychological problem,” Wenger said. “When you have won away from home, you have to finish the job at home but it is not easy because it always puts the team who is playing against you in the position of having nothing to lose.” Wenger will pick his best team from near full-strength ranks; only the cup-tied Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and the injured Alexandre Lacazette are missing. “Your job is to get everybody to suffer,” Wenger told his audience of journalists. “Our job is to get as few people to suffer as possible.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"politics/2018/mar/14/free-trade-and-human-rights-as-vital-pillars-of-post-brexit-foreign-policy","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-14T16:16:17Z","webTitle":"Free trade and human rights as vital pillars of post-Brexit foreign policy | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/mar/14/free-trade-and-human-rights-as-vital-pillars-of-post-brexit-foreign-policy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/mar/14/free-trade-and-human-rights-as-vital-pillars-of-post-brexit-foreign-policy","fields":{"headline":"Free trade and human rights as vital pillars of post-Brexit foreign policy","bodyText":"Last October we wrote to the Brexit secretary and chancellor asking for the release of impact studies on 58 sectors of the economy and a Treasury report exploring alternative free trade arrangements post-Brexit. We believed everyone had a right to this information and that political elites should not leave people in the dark about the future of their country. The government failed to heed our requests, so we initiated judicial review proceedings supported by crowdfunding. Last Tuesday, the high court refused us permission but two days later the Exiting the EU select committee published a document containing a summary of the sectoral studies – at least in part – which incorporated the Treasury’s work on the trade effects of Brexit. With information now in the public domain that is more recent than what we were seeking, we have decided not to continue our appeal. This battle for transparency was won by political pressure and huge public support. It is also clear that litigation helped keep the government under pressure and maintained a focus on the public’s right to know. We are also enormously grateful to the lawyers who agreed to support this important piece of public interest litigation free of charge and all those who supported crowdfunding. The information now available for all to see confirms our suspicions – namely that under any Brexit scenario, leaving the EU will be harmful to the UK economy and to British jobs. The government’s attempts to keep a lid on this information has further undermined their case for a hard Brexit, or indeed for any sort of Brexit at all. Molly Scott Cato MEP Jolyon Maugham QC (Good Law Project) • The foreign affairs select committee is right to lament the lack of strategy and funding behind the government’s aspiration for a post-Brexit “Global Britain” (Foreign Office policy of Global Britain is ‘superficial branding’, 12 March). Since Britain is the home of free trade and human rights, and both are essential for our prosperity and security, these should be two central pillars of this country’s post-Brexit foreign policy. There are specific policies that Britain could adopt to strengthen human rights overseas. The Department for International Trade should ensure future trade deals, where possible, include obligations to improve human rights in the partner countries. The Department for International Development should match the funding provided by the Foreign Office for the Magna Carta Fund, which supports organisations in other countries improve human rights. The UK should increase its financial contributions to the international criminal court. We should remain a proud signatory and champion of the European convention on human rights. Finally, in the Brexit negotiations, Britain should offer – on a conditional basis – continued funding of the European Development Fund.

In a stunning visual riposte to the public inertia that has followed mass shootings in the US, crowds of students at an estimated 3,000 schools across the country marched on running tracks, through parking lots and around building perimeters, carrying signs that read “Enough” and chanting, “Hey hey, ho ho, gun violence has got to go”. The walkout fell one month after a student gunman killed 17 people at Marjory Stoneman Douglas high school in Parkland, Florida, in the deadliest high school shooting in the country’s history. Survivors of that massacre joined other student activists to organize Wednesday’s demonstration, which was promoted by the Women’s March movement that sprang up after the election of Donald Trump. “There were lots of emotions, many people were crying. We were thinking of the 17 we lost,” said Florence Yared, a third-year student at Stoneman Douglas, who joined 3,000 of her schoolmates on the school’s football pitch, where exactly one month ago many were running for their lives. Students elsewhere filled sidewalks in Brooklyn, kneeled in hallways in a Georgia high school, stood silently in a row in Virginia, and sat in a group with backs turned on the White House. Most demonstrations were planned to last 17 minutes, one for each of the Parkland victims. In some school districts, student leaders and administrators agreed ahead of time on plans for the protest that did not include a physical walk-out from the school building. At Booker T Washington high school in Atlanta, Georgia – once attended by Martin Luther King Jr – students decided to kneel in the hallway for 17 seconds, in memory of the 17 students who died in Parkland, Florida. “Dr King carries a legacy even in death,” said Markail Brooks, a senior. “So I feel as if it’s an obligation to carry on what he wanted and what he was trying to fight for and that’s why this day is very important.” At an elementary school in Alexandria, Virginia, children synchronized their watches and a captain in each room led students outside two minutes before the planned 10am protest start time. “Some parents have felt that we’re not old enough to know about it,” said one student, Carter, 11, about school shootings. “They think because we’re fifth-graders we don’t know anything about what’s happening.” Another student, Henry Gibbs, 10, said: “Just the sensation that we are going to make a difference makes me feel proud.” In Chicago, public schools changed class schedules to accommodate the walkouts, while the archdiocese announced that about 80,000 students at 200 Catholic schools would participate in assemblies to discuss gun violence. The protesters called for new gun safety legislation, including a ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, and the introduction of universal background checks. They also opposed the additional fortification of schools with fences and armed guards, policies endorsed by the NRA, America’s powerful gun lobby group. The NRA’s “national school shield” proposal to prevent school shootings calls for the “hardening” of school sites with not only armed guards and armed teachers but also the elimination of trees, parking lots and some windows, and the construction of fences. “Let’s work together to secure our schools and stop school violence,” the NRA said as the walkouts began. Shortly afterwards, the group tweeted a picture of a semi-automatic rifle with an American flag sticker and the caption: “I’ll control my own guns, thank you.” Neither Trump nor the White House offered a statement. At the Academy for Young Writers high school in Spring Creek, Brooklyn, New York, students used the walkout to also bring attention to discrimination against people of color, women, and other groups. “Our protest brings together many things and I do empathize with those in Parkland in Florida, but this is Brooklyn, East New York, and we have our own separate struggles and I wanted to advocate for that as well,” said Nathaniel Swanson, 16. “We have policing [issues]. Discrimination in housing [and the] workforce. Gentrification is really getting bad in Brooklyn. Gun violence … these are the things that happen in our community.” The youthful protesters seemed to be the latest indicator that a carapace of resistance to gun policy changes in the United States could be cracking. Recent polling has indicated that as many as seven in 10 Americans want stricter gun laws, the highest such figure in 20 years. A recent Monmouth University poll found that 83% of Americans support requiring comprehensive background checks for all gun purchasers, including private sales between two individuals. Among NRA members, 69% support comprehensive background checks, the poll found. The gun policy reform group Everytown for Gun Safety reported a 25% leap in members in the two weeks after the Parkland shooting, and at least 20 corporations changed age limits for buying guns or stopped selling some semi-automatic rifles altogether after the shooting, according to activists. “While Congress sits on its hands, students like my son will stand and walk out of school this morning to demand action on gun violence,” tweeted Shannon Watts, the founder of the gun safety group Moms Demand Action, on Wednesday morning. “Next we march. Then we vote to #ThrowThemOut.” Gun safety activists are focused on the midterm elections in November as an opportunity to expunge pro-gun legislators, whose ranks are increasingly out of proportion with the national mood. As protesters filled the streets, the Senate judiciary committee convened a hearing on school safety in light of the Parkland massacre. Republican chairman Chuck Grassley gave voice to “the imminence and necessity of passing some legislation quickly” but he hewed in his questioning to minor proposals that even the NRA supports, such as the banning of certain gun accessories. Multiple gun control bills are currently pending in the US Congress, including bills that fit with the student protesters’ demands relating to assault weapons and background checks. But Congress in the past has repeatedly taken up such legislation only to shelve it, year after year, including in the wake of the 2012 shootings at Sandy Hook elementary school in Newtown, Connecticut. Ninety-six Americans are killed each day by guns, and Americans overall are “25 times more likely to be murdered with a gun than people in other developed countries”, gun control advocates say. In Connecticut, Washington and New York, the signs were hoisted by growing hands: “Disarm hate”, Protect kids not guns” and “We call BS.” On the football pitch in Parkland, Florida, the students listened to a recording of the song Shine – “heaven let your light shine down” – as sympathy banners sent from around the world draped an adjacent building. Then, 17 minutes later, the students filed back inside. This article was amended on 15 March 2018 to clarify that students at Booker T Washington high school in Atlanta, Georgia did stage a form of protest, but that it was one that administrators approved and that did not involve a walk-out."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/mar/14/jim-bowen-bullseye-host-and-comedian-dies-aged-80","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-14T13:58:28Z","webTitle":"Jim Bowen, Bullseye host and comedian, dies aged 80","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/mar/14/jim-bowen-bullseye-host-and-comedian-dies-aged-80","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/mar/14/jim-bowen-bullseye-host-and-comedian-dies-aged-80","fields":{"headline":"Jim Bowen, Bullseye host and comedian, dies aged 80","bodyText":"Jim Bowen, the comedian and broadcaster who was best known for hosting the darts-based gameshow Bullseye, has died at the age of 80. A former teacher and one of a generation of comedians who earned and learned their trade in front of the audiences of working men’s clubs and other venues on the northern club circuit, he became a household name when he started to present Bullseye on ITV in 1981. A number of strokes – in 2011 in 2014 – left him struggling to walk and talk but did not affect his trademark cheery disposition. “I’m very well and I’m expecting to make it! Between your ears you feel 35 but when it gets to your legs and arms your body doesn’t know,” he told the Daily Mirror last year. Bowen died at the Royal Lancaster infirmary on Wednesday. Born Peter Williams in Heswall, Cheshire, on 20 August 1937, Bowen became a teacher at schools in Lancashire and subsequently deputy headmaster of Caton primary near Lancaster. Part-time work as a standup comedian during the 1960s followed from his involvement in local dramatic societies before the advent of Granada TV’s The Comedians gave him the chance to appear on national television. Other television opportunities followed, including appearances on Granada’s The Wheeltappers and Shunters Social Club as well as Thames Television’s late-night chatshow Take Two. He left teaching to embark on a new career and presented Bullseye, which mixed general knowledge questions with darts, for 14 years until 1995. His catchphrases on the programme became well known, including his warning to contestants that if they gambled and lost then all they would receive was their “BFH” (bus fare home). “Nothing for two in a bed” referred to how contestants would win a prize by hitting the appropriate part of the dartboard but would lose the prize if they hit it twice. Television drama appearances included an appearance as a crooked accountant in ITV’s 1982 drama Muck and Brass, as well as guest appearances on BBC1’s Jonathan Creek and Channel 4’s Phoenix Nights. John Plews, who produced Bowen’s live shows for many years, told the Guardian: “He was just such a lovely bloke. He was in person exactly as he was on stage or on television and just loved spending time having a laugh with fans or anyone else. “I produced a lot of his stage shows in the 1980s and 90s, right up until the mid-90s, and my overall memory is one of having fun. The style of comedy that is most popular today may have changed but the young comedians still seemed to look up to him and namecheck him.” Among those paying tribute to Bowen was the comedian David Baddiel, who imagined a conversation in which God asks Stephen Hawking – who also died on Wednesday – to explain how the universe came into being. As Hawking begins to explain that there are infinite alternative universes, Bowen interjects with a catchphrase: “In other words, look what you could have won.” Bowen began presenting on BBC Radio Lancashire in 1999 but resigned after three years when he referred to a guest on his show using a racist epithet. He admitted that although he had apologised for the remark almost immediately, he believed his showbusiness career was over. However, he returned to the limelight in 2005 when he performed a solo show at the Edinburgh festival fringe about Bullseye, called You Can’t Beat a Bit of Bully. He returned to Edinburgh in the summer of 2006, performing at Jongleurs. Bowen is survived by his wife, Phyllis, a son and daughter and two grandchildren."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/mar/14/danger-school-playgrounds-children-saws-bricks","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-14T15:38:11Z","webTitle":"Life is fraught with danger.

School playgrounds should be too","bodyText":"Risk is a part of life, and schools are very much in the business of preparing children for life – not just as scholars but as human beings, citizens and custodians of the world. So news that a primary school in Essex has introduced bricks and saws into its playground to help children understand risk should be celebrated, not condemned. On the surface there is perhaps much to feel anxious about. But a moment’s reflection is enough to realise that children are frequently exposed to worse things on the way to school, and if a slide and a swing are the greatest hazard our children ever face as they grow up, then I can only assume they are raised in an isolation tank. No amount of bubble wrap can cushion the fact that the world is perilous. The question is, how do we best equip children to deal with it? The easy answer – the wrong answer – is to attempt the impossible and to hide them, as the Buddha’s father is said to have tried, from death and disease. Risk is everywhere. Some people blame health and safety rules for creating playgrounds devoid of opportunities to learn from adversity: a curious attitude towards one of our greatest but most maligned social innovations – risk management. Although to many it’s a dreary administrative chore, it is also responsible for countless lives saved, limbs gone unharmed and disasters averted. We mock it at our peril. Some regulations may seem petty, but set that against the benefits of prohibitions and standards that keep us upright and breathing. In reality, there are few reasons for schools not to help children experience managed risk, and the fear of falling foul of some imagined regulation is often greater than the actual restriction. Of course there is a paradox: we want children to be as safe as possible, but avoiding risk simply makes us more likely to walk into calamity when we encounter it. Better to teach children to swim than to hope they never fall into a river. Children therefore need to be exposed to risks. We immunise them against calamity by acclimatising them to a hazardous world rather than locking them in towers. We could even see risk as a portal to opportunity and possibility instead of a hazard. Playgrounds already contain sharp corners and hard surfaces; rain creates bogs in every park. I’d much rather teach children not to put their hands in a blender than tell them to fear it. The alternative is to create children who dare to do nothing and are terrified of everything. I applaud any school that teaches children to manage risk, to view life as springboard rather than a deathtrap. It is hard to see how a school could do more to adequately train children to deal with the slings and mud pits of outrageous fortune. Parents – children’s fiercest safeguarders – have praised the scheme. A local councillor has expressed approval for it. My hope is that the school isn’t pilloried by witless controversialists addicted to outrage. That’s a risk far harder to manage. • Tom Bennett is a teacher, and the Department for Education’s independent adviser on behaviour in schools.

But, while it’s good to find a play that tackles big issues, there is a faint air, in a highly compressed 85-minute piece, of boxes being systematically ticked. The action starts with Angela, a 17-year-old violinist from Hong Kong, applying for a music scholarship to a prestigious Ivy League university. Birch, the acting dean of admissions who has never achieved pay parity and a top post because of her gender, is sceptical and senses something troubled about Angela. Mercy, Birch’s black British aide and a political activist, takes up Angela’s cause especially when she discovers that the student is being penalised for having earlier brought unproven charges of rape against a teacher. Meanwhile Ben, an imported diversity expert, is wary of accepting Angela despite her exceptional talent. Ng argues, with conviction, that self-acceptance is ultimately more important than recognition by elite academic institutions. She also writes with sympathy and understanding about the stigma and trauma that accompanies accusations, however justified, of sexual assault. For good measure, Ng also deploys Bach’s St Matthew Passion to reinforce Angela’s need for resolution to her personal problems. But the sole male character, Ben, is such a smarmy creep that he instantly arouses one’s suspicions, and the play, with its references to Black Lives Matter and America First, is simply too short to properly address all the topics raised. Anna Ledwich’s production, played on a traverse stage in the Downstairs space, is crisp and clear, and the four actors all do a good job.

The organisers of Mipim, the property industry’s annual “champagne, yachts and fun” bash in Cannes, have repeatedly warned delegates to “respect all individuals” and reminded the 25,000 attendees that “under no circumstances does Mipim register prostitutes”. “What other industry on the face of the earth in 2018 needs to remind businessmen that they can’t bring prostitutes to an industry conference,” asked Jane, a 29-year-old delegate from Manchester. “That alone tells you how backward property is.” While most property bosses have condemned the behaviour at the Presidents Club gala dinner in January, some of those closest to the event continue to defend it. Harvey Soning, a multi-millionaire property developer and a trustee of the Presidents Club until it was dissolved in the wake of the scandal, told the Guardian at a champagne-fuelled beach party that “definitely nothing” untoward happened at the black-tie dinner in the Dorchester hotel. Soning, 72, the founder and chairman of developer James Andrew International, said he still could not understand the uproar and continued to defend the all-male party until a PR man stood in front of him and told him to “go away Harvey”. Soning traditionally hosts the most popular party during the week-long Mipim jamboree, but the James Andrew bash was a rather muted affair this year. Coutts, the RBS-owned bank which has served the Queen and every member of the royal family since George IV, pulled out of co-hosting the party at the last minute and barred all staff from attending Mipim. HSBC and Bank of America Merrill Lynch also withdrew their delegations from the conference. Chris Grigg, the chief executive of British Land, the UK’s second-biggest property company, said the Presidents Club scandal had revealed the “sleazy underbelly” of the industry and businesses needed to do more to banish unacceptable behaviour and promote diversity and inclusion. Grigg said there were “a lot of dinosaurs” in the property industry and forward-thinking executives needed to work together to clean up the sector’s image. He said British Land had worked hard in a bid to increase diversity among its staff but he feared that the Presidents Club furore may have put off more women from joining the industry. The Association of Women in Property says female staff make up just 15% of the workforce in property and construction, and occupy even fewer roles at executive levels. Filippo Rean, the head of real estate at the conference’s organiser Reed Midem, warned delegates that “attitudes towards equality, diversity and behavioural norms in the workplace are under scrutiny” and sent the event’s code of conduct to all attendees. The code defines inappropriate behaviour as “any form of verbal or physical abuse; the use of depreciative or discriminatory language, gestures or actions; any form of harassment, racism or sexism; inappropriate physical contact; or any targeted comments which may cause personal offence to other individuals”. Ronan Vaspart, the director of Mipim, promised “if we receive a complaint we will take action”. He did not respond to questions about whether there had been any complaints. While the organisers explicitly banned prostitutes from conference venues, sex workers were frequently seen walking the beachfront Promenade de la Croisette. An exotic dancer, who gave her name only as Alex, said Mipim continues to be one of the busiest weeks of the year and “girls have come in from Nice, Toulon and Marseille”. Alex, who works at a cabaret bar tucked away on a backstreet behind the five-star beachfront hotels, said more than 35 men she thought were in town for Mipim had paid for private dancers on Tuesday night alone. “Most are from your country [the UK],” she said. She said in previous years girls from the bar were hired to work as waitresses at private parties on yachts and in hilltop villas but no requests had been made this week. Tamsie Thomson, the director of the London festival of architecture, said the Presidents Club scandal had “just scratched the surface of the discrimination and harassment that women and other minorities are routinely subjected to in our industry”. Thomson launched the “the elephant in the room” campaign to encourage women and others to challenge any inappropriate or uncomfortable behaviour and distributed pink elephant badges to raise awareness. The Guardian did not see any male property executives wearing the badge. At least three events at Mipim were dedicated to women and increasing diversity, including a women in property breakfast on the beach and a “women’s cocktail” evening. The cocktail evening was co-hosted by Nathalie Palladitcheff, the president of Ivanhoe Cambridge, a Canadian real estate investor which cut all ties with Residential Land, a luxury London property company owned by Bruce Richie, the co-chair of the Presidents Club. Palladitcheff said women had to “stand up and change this industry”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2018/mar/17/ivanka-trump-russia-mueller-investigation-organisation-subpoena","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-17T05:00:12Z","webTitle":"Russia investigation may turn to Ivanka Trump as Mueller examines empire","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/mar/17/ivanka-trump-russia-mueller-investigation-organisation-subpoena","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/mar/17/ivanka-trump-russia-mueller-investigation-organisation-subpoena","fields":{"headline":"Russia investigation may turn to Ivanka Trump as Mueller examines empire","bodyText":"Ivanka Trump is likely to face new legal scrutiny by Robert Mueller following reports that the special counsel has demanded documents from the Trump Organization, where she served as a senior executive. Trump, who is married to Jared Kushner, a senior White House adviser who was recently stripped of his security clearance, has been described by her father as a “natural-born dealmaker” and was known to have played a leading role in deals between the Trump Organization and a Russian national who has come under scrutiny and bragged about his ties to top Kremlin officials. Mueller, the former FBI director who is leading an independent criminal investigation into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin, has issued the Trump Organization with a subpoena for documents in recent weeks, including documents related to Russia, according to a report in the New York Times. While it is not clear precisely what deal or deals Mueller is examining, Democratic congressional investigators this week claimed in a memo that they had learned that the Trump Organization was “actively negotiating” a deal in Moscow during the election campaign that involved a Russian bank that was under US sanctions. The deal never went through and it is not clear which bank the congressional investigators were referring to. The president has repeatedly denied having had any business dealings with Russia when he has been asked about it by reporters, and has described the criminal investigation into his campaign as a “witch-hunt”. Ivanka Trump served as a senior executive at the Trump Organization, with a special focus on acquisitions, before leaving her post to serve her father in the White House last year. By all accounts, including in flattering business profiles of the first daughter, she has been described as an integral part of her father’s empire. That role has also led to legal trouble in the past. In 2006, when she was 24 years old, Ivanka Trump and her brother Donald Trump Jr, signed a licensing deal to build the Trump SoHo with two businessmen who would go on to be close business partners of the Trump Organization, Felix Sater and Tevfik Arif. Sater and Arif ran a real estate group called Bayrock and were born in the former Soviet Union. The SoHo deal is an area of focus for Mueller, according to Bloomberg. Sater, a felon who became an informant against the mafia, did not respond to requests for comment. Last year, the New York Times published emails that showed the Russian emigre boasting in 2015 that he could arrange a deal for the Trump Organization to open a new property in Moscow with the help of Vladimir Putin. In the emails, Sater recalled how he had arranged for Ivanka Trump to “sit in Putin’s private chair” during a visit to Moscow that they took together in 2006. The revelation was interesting in part because it showed that Sater had remained in the Trumps’ orbit even after Donald Trump said in a 2013 deposition that he barely knew Sater. Ivanka Trump has said she was not involved in any discussions about a property deal in Moscow in 2015 – at the time of the presidential election – and has not commented on the claim that she once sat in the Russian president’s chair. An attorney for the Trump Organization said the company was fully cooperating with Mueller’s subpoena request. Although the Trump SoHo project was launched with fanfare and was meant to mark Ivanka Trump and her brother Donald Jr’s full entry into their father’s business, it has been heavily scrutinised by prosecutors and the press since it opened in 2010. A report by the New Yorker, ProPublica and WNYC in 2017 alleged that the Trump project was closely investigated by prosecutors in the Manhattan district attorney’s office in 2012. According to the New Yorker account, both Ivanka and Donald Jr were close to being indicted following an investigation into whether the pair misled investors about how well condos in the building were selling. The article alleged that prosecutors had evidence, including emails between the siblings, that showed they were aware they were using inflated figures to lure buyers to purchase condos. The issue also became a subject of a civil lawsuit by investors, which was settled by the Trump Organization. Neither Ivanka Trump nor Donald Jr were ultimately indicted after the New York district attorney, Cy Vance, decided not to move ahead with the charges, according to the New Yorker account. It also described how, weeks after Vance’s office said it would drop the investigation, a top attorney for the Trump family, Marc Kasowitz, contacted Vance about hosting a fundraiser for the district attorney. The lawyer would later donate over $30,000 to Vance’s campaign. “We did the right thing,” Vance told the New Yorker, defending his decision to drop the case. Trump SoHo went into foreclosure in 2014 and was taken over by a creditor. There is no suggestion that Ivanka Trump is under criminal investigation. A separate report by CNN early this month said that US counterintelligence officials were scrutinising one of Ivanka Trump’s other deals: the Trump International Hotel and Tower in Vancouver. Officials who spoke to CNN said that the scrutiny could be a hurdle for Ivanka Trump as she tries to obtain security clearance for her role in the White House. The Vancouver property is one of a few properties that have opened since Trump took office. Alan Garten, executive vice-president and chief legal officer for the Trump Organization, told CNN that the company’s role in the property was limited to licencing and managing the hotel, but was not involved in financing."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2018/mar/17/ilford-ms-store-to-help-build-pop-up-hostel-for-rough-sleepers","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-17T07:00:16Z","webTitle":"Ilford M&S to help build pop-up hostel for local rough sleepers","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/mar/17/ilford-ms-store-to-help-build-pop-up-hostel-for-rough-sleepers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/mar/17/ilford-ms-store-to-help-build-pop-up-hostel-for-rough-sleepers","fields":{"headline":"Ilford M&S to help build pop-up hostel for local rough sleepers","bodyText":"A Marks &amp; Spencer store that was criticised for driving homeless people away with a high-pitched alarm has helped to launch a new initiative to tackle rough sleeping. Last July the Guardian revealed that the Ilford, Essex, branch of M&amp;S was using an alarm at intervals throughout the night to deter a group of people who had been regularly bedding down behind the store. After the report M&amp;S removed the alarm and pledged action to “help fund practical measures to support those affected”. The manager of the store, James Mugford, said in a blog post that the call the company had received about the alarm from the Guardian was “one of my most difficult days”. He admitted that “having the alarm wasn’t right”. Now M&amp;S has pledged to back the Salvation Army’s radical plan to support rough sleepers – a pop-up hostel in the form of 42 studio flats in shipping containers on land provided by Redbridge council. M&amp;S has got other businesses involved including Next, Debenhams and Metro Bank to launch a fundraising initiative called #RedbridgeTogether to help The Salvation Army and the Refugee and Migrant Forum of Essex and London (Ramfel) charity deliver the project. M&amp;S has got other businesses involved including Next, Debenhams and Metro Bank to launch a fundraising initiative called #RedbridgeTogether to help The Salvation Army and RAMFEL deliver the project. M&amp;S says it is the first time it has been involved in an initiative to tackle rough sleeping. Mugford said one rough sleeper had been taken on for two weeks’ work experience. “He’s now working permanently in our store and doing a great job – we have two more people starting. The fact that in one of the world’s richest countries the average age a rough-sleeping man will die is 47 years old is just not OK.” What is unusual about this initiative is that the 49 of the 65 rough sleepers counted in Redbridge are migrants with no recourse to public funds. But instead of handing them over to the Home Office for deportation, M&amp;S and the other organisations involved in the project are offering them support to try to regularise their immigration status, access healthcare and find jobs. A planning application has been submitted for the pop-up hostel. The migrant rough sleepers will receive immigration advice from Ramfel. Eight of the shipping containers will be reserved for migrants with no recourse to public funds. The remaining studio flats will be rented back to the council to use to accommodate other homeless people. Instead of paying private landlords for B&amp;B accommodation the council can use the money to provide support to break the rough-sleeping cycle. John Clifton, the local Salvation Army captain, said that four rough sleepers in Redbridge had died on the streets since January of this year. “We see the same rough sleepers coming to our winter night shelter each year. We want to end the deaths of rough sleepers on the streets and break the street homelessness cycle. If this model succeeds we want to replicate it in other parts of the country,” he said. Paul, 25, a Lithuanian who had been sleeping rough for five years and was among those driven out by the M&amp;S store’s alarm, welcomed the initiative. He said he had just found a job and was now renting a room. “I think it’s brilliant. One of my worst fears when I was sleeping rough was that someone would come and kill me while I slept. That’s why we all slept in a group behind M&amp;S – to try to stay safe.” • This article was amended on 19 March 2018 to clarify that M&amp;S is backing the Redbridge Together initiative, and the Salvation Army will be managing the day to day running of the hostel."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"artanddesign/2018/apr/01/former-swimming-baths-in-south-london-to-reopen-as-art-gallery","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-01T14:43:24Z","webTitle":"Former swimming baths in south London to reopen as art gallery","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/apr/01/former-swimming-baths-in-south-london-to-reopen-as-art-gallery","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2018/apr/01/former-swimming-baths-in-south-london-to-reopen-as-art-gallery","fields":{"headline":"Former swimming baths in south London to reopen as art gallery","bodyText":"Part of a Victorian swimming baths and the iron tanks that supplied the water are to open as one of the UK’s most eagerly anticipated new contemporary art spaces, at the birthplace of the Young British Artists. Goldsmiths, the south London art college whose students have included Bridget Riley, Antony Gormley and YBAs such as Damien Hirst, Sarah Lucas, Gillian Wearing and Gary Hume, is to open a 1,000 sq metre gallery designed by the Turner prize-winning collective Assemble. It will have an affinity with overseas university galleries such as the Wattis Institute in San Francisco and Portikus in Frankfurt, and a feel of places such as the ICA and South London Gallery in London, but it will not be exactly like them, its director, Sarah McCrory, hopes. “The whole point is not to be like anywhere else,” she said. The £4m gallery, which will open in September, has been funded in part by an auction of work donated by alumni, which raised £1.7m. It is one of the most exciting gallery openings of the year for several reasons. For one, it bucks a trend. “In a troubling time for cultural institutions, it is really nice to be part of something that is opening rather than a story that is about closure or cuts,” said McCrory. “I also really hope that the impact of spaces like this can be seen by those that fund them because I think it is a tragedy that so many are disappearing, often secretly and quietly … they just suddenly disappear.” The gallery is also the first building from Assemble, an architectural collective of young and radical designers, artists and architects who won the Turner prize in 2015 for their project helping residents in Toxteth to renovate their homes and gardens. Assemble won the commission in a competition, selected by a panel that included Gormley and the architect David Chipperfield. They promise to expose the hidden character of what was the plant works and water tanks for the Victorian Laurie Grove baths. The main baths building will continue to be used as studios for students. Assemble were recruited before McCrory was appointed but she could not be more excited. “I love working with them, it is like working with artists,” she said. Many original features will be kept, including the iron tank walls, which will enclose two of the upstairs galleries, in deliberately stark contrast to the white cube spaces below. McCrory, formerly a Frieze Projects curator and director of the contemporary art festival Glasgow International, said the new Goldsmiths Centre for Contemporary Art offered a huge number of curating possibilities with a variety of spaces, some of them challenging. “Probably one of the reasons why I ended up getting the job is that a lot of my previous jobs have been curating in odd spaces,” she said. “In Glasgow it would be fire stations and swimming pools and dungeons. “Of course this is a building with a roof and walls and lighting, something I’ve wanted to do for a while; at the same time there is still an element of working with artists to make the building make sense, to use the idiosyncrasies of the building.” Goldsmiths CCA will open to the public on 8 September with a show across the whole building devoted to the New York-based artist Mika Rottenberg, who is known for her often absurd and surreal videos and sculptures addressing themes of labour and feminism. It will be her first solo exhibition in London and Rottenberg is creating two new works examining the human body’s physical and psychological potential and limitations. McCrory hopes the gallery will be a great resource and inspiration for Goldsmiths students and staff, but it will be very much a public gallery, for everyone. Further down the line, McCrory is planning displays of new work by the Estonian artist Kris Lemsalu and a posthumous exhibition of work by Alexis Hunter, an influential figure from the feminist art movement in Britain in the 1970s who was known for her staged photographic works."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"money/2018/mar/19/letting-agents-abusive-practices-urgent-regulation-flat-health-hazard","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-19T07:00:17Z","webTitle":"‘Urgent regulation needed’ to stop abusive practices by letting agents","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2018/mar/19/letting-agents-abusive-practices-urgent-regulation-flat-health-hazard","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2018/mar/19/letting-agents-abusive-practices-urgent-regulation-flat-health-hazard","fields":{"headline":"‘Urgent regulation needed’ to stop abusive practices by letting agents","bodyText":"When Alex Cannan moved to London to take up a new job, he found a room to rent for £145 a week on Spareroom.com. It was advertised by an individual called Sara, but when he applied he found himself dealing with a letting agent, Citiside, which confirmed the room was available to view. On arrival at the agency, he was informed that the room had already been let, but was shown photos of a similar room that came with a regular cleaning service. “I was told it was not available for viewing and that if I asked them to reserve it before I made a decision I would have to pay a £500 holding deposit, which was non-refundable after three days,” Cannan says. “Foolishly, I was pressured into taking it based on the photos. When I moved in I found the room was filthy and covered in black mould, and the cleaning rota had not been updated for three weeks.” Cannan’s new employer paid for him to transfer to a hotel as the accommodation was a health hazard. “Since then I’ve written to Citiside several times to cancel my contract, citing misleading advertising and hygiene violations, but the manager has told me to hire a lawyer if I want to rescind it,” he says. “I believe the majority of tenants attracted by Citiside’s cheap prices are on low incomes, so it gambles that they will not be able to afford to take it to court.” Online forums tell a similar tale. Numerous prospective tenants claim to have been lured to Citiside’s offices by seductive ads of rooms that turned out not to be available, then pressured into accepting an alternative without viewing it. Reviewers make allegations of poorly maintained accommodation and Citiside’s refusal to return their deposit when they complain. Since many responded to ads on third-party websites in the names of individuals, they were not forewarned by the estate agent’s dismal online reputation. Citiside has pledged to abide by The Property Ombudsman’s code of practice, which includes a commitment to fair and honest advertising, and an effective complaints procedure. TPO confirms it has received complaints about the agency and has helped to resolve disputes “amicably” on a case-by-case basis. Citiside, however, continues to be a member of the scheme, although its website, with misspellings and sections containing gobbledygook because no one has bothered to write them up, contains no official complaints procedure as required by the code of practice. When the Observer rang Citiside for a comment, the agent hung up and two emails have been ignored. The fact that such agencies can continue with impunity exposes the inadequacies of property regulation. Instead of a single body with regulatory powers, tenants and purchasers have to navigate four redress schemes that investigate unresolved complaints. Estate and letting agents are not allowed to trade unless they sign up to TPO, the Property Redress Scheme, Ombudsman Services, or the Housing Ombudsman, all of which have differing codes of practice. Large sectors of the housing sector such as new developments, landlords and home improvement have no redress schemes at all. It is left to overstretched trading standards authorities to intervene if an agent is suspected of abusing the market. Tower Hamlets council fined Citiside £10,000 in December for not adequately displaying its fees. The agency is appealing against the charge. “The council’s environmental health and trading standards officers will investigate any further matters that are brought to their attention in relation to this or any other company operating in the borough,” said a spokesperson. Last month, Ombudsman Services said it would withdraw from handling complaints about the property sector because the system offered a “broken solution to a broken market”. “For an ombudsman to be effective it needs a regulator,” says the service’s chief ombudsman, Lewis Shand Smith. “There are rogue letting agencies out there but we can investigate only individual problems, with no powers to address the root of them, whereas a regulator can step in when systemic failures are identified.” The service plans to wind up its redress scheme for surveyors and managing, estate and letting agents by the summer and focus on advising the government on regulatory reform. The government is consulting on proposals that include a single housing ombudsman to handle complaints. Crucially, landlords and developers may be obliged to sign up and companies could be named and shamed to stamp out shoddy practice. The housing secretary, Sajid Javid, said last month: “The current choice of schemes risks leaving thousands without answers, with others having to manoeuvre between at least four different services just to work out where to register a complaint.” According to the housing charity Shelter, increasing numbers of tenants like Cannan have been left at the mercy of unscrupulous letting agents and landlords. It is calling for new laws to enable them to challenge insanitary conditions. “The dearth of affordable homes is forcing desperate people to rent from a minority of dodgy letting agents and landlords, who subject tenants to sub-standard properties, whether it’s a flat covered in mould or a house infested with vermin,” says Shelter’s chief executive, Polly Neate. “The proposed fitness for human habitation bill would give renters greater rights to legally challenge poor and unsafe conditions – meaning letting agents will have to ensure the landlords on their books keep their properties up to scratch. We strongly urge the government to help make that a reality.” In the meantime, Cannan has moved back into his substandard room to spare his employer escalating hotel bills while he battles to terminate his tenancy agreement. Citiside removed the mould when he threatened legal action, but he says the place remains insanitary. “The law is being broken on a daily basis but the majority of tenants do not have the money for legal action,” he says. “Lives are being ruined as people are stuck in properties unfit for habitation, with no option to leave.” New builds, new problems There is no ombudsman scheme that covers new developments, except for warranty issues, which can be referred to the financial ombudsman. When things go wrong, purchasers have to rely on the warranty issued by the National House Building Council (NHBC) or another approved provider. Although the warranty is for 10 years, developers only have to rectify problems that arise in the first two years following completion. After that, homebuyers have to claim on the warranty provider’s insurance, which only covers serious structural issues. As a last resort, new homeowners can appeal to the Consumer Code for Home Builders adjudication scheme. But it costs £120 to lodge a complaint and its findings are not legally binding. Also, it only applies to developments that are registered with the three main warranty providers: NHBC, LABC Warranty and Premier Guarantee. Moreover, a builder can invalidate the warranty, as Nadine Owen discovered when, a year after she moved in to an estate in Lincoln, the developer, Beal Homes, dug up the driveways and aligned them with the road to meet council adoption requirements. As the works, which were carried out against Owen’s wishes, were not authorised by the NHBC, the driveways are now exempt from the 10-year Buildmark warranty and the houses will not be covered if damage such as flooding arises from alterations to the gradient and drainage system. Beal told the Observer that no part of the warranty had been invalidated as it did not include drives. The NHBC insists it has and it does. The financial ombudsman, meanwhile, has ruled that the NHBC should have rectified numerous other defects with the property after Beal failed to resolve them. Beal says it has complied with all requirements. “The NHBC is still finding substandard aspects in the house,” says Owen. “It’s important to highlight how little an NHBC warranty is worth and how it can be taken away through no fault of your own.” This is not an isolated incident, says Paula Higgins, chief executive of the HomeOwners Alliance. “Situations like this are one of the reasons we need an overhaul of the regulatory system in the housing market,” she says. “The redress system is disjointed and ineffective, and buyers of new homes are losing out as a result.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"business/2018/mar/17/former-carillion-finance-directors-investigation-frc","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-17T10:49:25Z","webTitle":"Former Carillion finance directors expected to face investigation","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/mar/17/former-carillion-finance-directors-investigation-frc","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/mar/17/former-carillion-finance-directors-investigation-frc","fields":{"headline":"Former Carillion finance directors expected to face investigation","bodyText":"The accounting watchdog is expected to announce an investigation into potential misconduct by two former finance directors at Carillion, the failed government contractor. The Financial Reporting Council’s conduct committee is understood to have agreed that there are sufficient grounds for a probe into the conduct of Richard Adam and Zafar Khan. An announcement is expected early next week. A spokesman for the FRC declined to comment. Frank Field and Rachel Reeves, the MPs leading a joint select committee inquiry into Carillion’s failure, welcomed the regulator’s decision to investigate individual directors. In evidence to the business select committee in January, the FRC chief executive, Stephen Haddrill, told MPs the watchdog was examining whether an investigation was required into any misconduct by “members in business”, rather then a mere breach of regulations. The FRC can prevent a finance director who is a member of a professional association from practising. It can also table significant fines against those found to have “fallen significantly short of the standards reasonably to be expected” or brought discredit to the accountancy profession. The Insolvency Service is already investigating the conduct of directors employed at the point at which the outsourcing giant collapsed, but “also of any individuals who were previously directors”, following a request from the business secretary, Greg Clark. The FRC has so far restricted itself to examining the ethical and technical standards of the accountancy firm KPMG over its audits for Carillion between 2014 and 2017. The work and pensions committee chair, Frank Field, welcomed the FRC’s decision to widen its probe to include directors but said regulators should have acted sooner. “If the select committees hadn’t undertaken this review, all the horrors of Carillion would have been swept under a carpet, lumpy as the carpet would have been afterwards,” he said. “Great news the FRC is acting but where were they when all this was blowing up? What Britain desperately needs is a regulatory system that is on the front foot.” Reeve said: “To uphold our standards in corporate governance and to help ensure that we avoid a future business disaster akin to Carillion, it’s important that Carillion directors face the full force of the law for their role in the collapse of the company.” Carillion went into liquidation in January, with pension liabilities and debts each exceeding £1bn. It had just £29m in cash at the point of its collapse. Carillion relied on large contracts, some of which proved much less lucrative than it expected. Last year it slashed the value of them by £845m, of which £375m related to public-private partnerships (PPPs) such as Royal Liverpool University hospital. The company employed 20,000 people in the UK and held 450 public sector contracts. Earlier this month the Canadian firm, BGIS, pulled out of a deal to buy a significant number of those from the firm, putting at risk 2,500 jobs that had seemed saved. Adam, who had managed Carillion’s finances from April 2007 to December 2016, offloaded £534,000 of shares on 1 March last year, three months after retiring from the company. He sold a further £242,000 of stock handed to him in May as part of a bonus scheme. Shortly afterwards, the auditor KPMG forced the Carillion to slash the value of its contracts by £845m and issue a profit warning. In a letter to MPs on a joint select committee conducting an inquiry into Carillion’s demise, Adam said: “I sold the shares on these dates because they were the days that I was invited to do so by the company.” Giving evidence, he conceded that he knew the company was in a “challenging” position when he left, but added: “Could I just say, because I have been out of the business for over a year, how saddened I am by all of the events.” Khan was finance director between August 2016 and September 2017, when he was axed with a £425,000 payoff. He claimed to MPs that he was dismissed after he “spooked” the rest of the board with a presentation warning that the company’s finances had worsened. He denied he had been “asleep at the wheel”. Giving evidence to MPs, Emma Mercer, who succeeded Khan, said those who had been in post before her had taken an “aggressive tone” in their valuation of contracts that later underperformed. In a sign of the continuing ripples caused by Carillion’s failure, Phil Bentley, the chief executive of Carillion’s former chief competitor, Mitie, warned in a statement on Friday that the year ahead would remain “challenging” for his firm.

The firm at the centre of Facebook's data breach","bodyText":"What is Cambridge Analytica? Cambridge Analytica is a company that offers services to businesses and political parties who want to “change audience behaviour”. It claims to be able to analyse huge amounts of consumer data and combine that with behavioural science to identify people who organisations can target with marketing material. It collects data from a wide range of sources, including social media platforms such as Facebook, and its own polling. With its headquarters in London, the firm was set up in 2013 as an offshoot of another company called SCL Group, which offers similar services around the world. In an interview with the website Contagious, Cambridge Analytica’s founder, Alexander Nix said it had been set up “to address the vacuum in the US Republican political market” that became evident when Mitt Romney was defeated in the 2012 presidential election. “The Democrats had ostensibly been leading the tech revolution, and data analytics and digital engagement were areas where Republicans had failed to catch up. We saw this as an opportunity.” Why is it in the news? Over the weekend, the Observer revealed that in 2014, 50 million Facebook profiles were harvested by a UK-based academic, Aleksandre Kogan, and his company Global Science Research. Kogan assembled the information through an app on the site – it collected details of Americans who were paid to take a personality test, but also gathered data on those people’s Facebook friends. Kogan had a deal to share this information with Cambridge Analytica. But according to a whistleblower, Christopher Wylie, most of this personal information had been taken without authorisation. He said Cambridge Analytica used it to build a powerful software program to predict and influence choices at the ballot box. Wylie, a Canadian who previously worked for Cambridge Analytica, has lifted the lid on this and other practices at the firm, which he describes as a “full-service propaganda machine”. He contradicts claims made in the past by Nix, who in February told British MPs that the company did not use Facebook data in its work. In a statement published on Saturday, the company denied any wrongdoing and said it did not harvest Facebook data, and none was used in the 2016 presidential election. It said it fully complied with Facebook’s terms of service and it had deleted all the data it received from GSR. Kogan also denied GSR had done anything wrong. This isn’t the first controversy for the firm. It has been accused of offering to target foreign donors for the UK’s Brexit campaign and in November it was reported that Nix had contacted the Wikileaks founder Julian Assange to ask if he could help with the release of emails linked to Hillary Clinton. The company has also been accused of over-selling itself, with some in the tech world saying that it does not have as much influence as it claims. What does Facebook say? It has suspended Cambridge Analytica and several individuals from its site while it investigates. It denies there was a data breach, and says it had granted Kogan permission to access the information. However, in sharing it with Cambridge Analytica and allowing it to be used for commercial purposes, he broke the terms of the licence. “People knowingly provided their information, no systems were infiltrated, and no passwords or sensitive pieces of information were stolen or hacked,” it said. It said it learned about the issue in 2015 and removed the app and demanded that the data was destroyed. Who runs Cambridge Analytica? The company is part of SCL Group and shares some of its directors. The main player is 42-year-old Nix, an old Etonian who joined SCL in 2003 after studying at Manchester University and working in corporate finance. Nix developed the political arm of the business. Last year, he told Techcrunch of plans to publish a book about the company, provisionally titled ‘Mad men to maths men’. The managing director of Cambridge Analytica’s political division is Mark Turnbull, who spent 18 years at the communications firm Bell Pottinger before joining SCL. What are Cambridge Analytica’s links with Donald Trump? Robert Mercer, a key Trump supporter and donor, gave $15m in funding to Cambridge Analytica. Mercer, who also funded the rightwing website Breitbart, was introduced to the firm by Steve Bannon. Bannon, who was on its board from 2014 to 2016, headed the last phase of Trump’s election campaign and then served as his chief strategist. The company worked on three candidates’ campaigns for the presidency, including Trump’s. On its website it describes analysing millions of data points to identify the most persuadable voters and the issues they cared about and then sending them messages to “move them to action”. Voters in 17 states were polled every day, and online advertising and social media used to send them messages. The company claims that in this way it boosted donations and turn out and contributed to Trump’s victory. As we now know, some of the data came from profiles to which the company was not supposed to have access, rather than being freely available to harvest. What other campaigns has it been involved with? The company has worked on political campaigns in countries including Kenya, Colombia, India and St Kitts &amp; Nevis. What about Brexit? In February, Nix told MPs that his firm didn’t work for campaigners for a leave vote, although this has been hotly disputed by the co-founder of Leave.EU, Arron Banks. What happens next? There are likely to be questions for Cambridge Analytica and Facebook to answer. Nix may be asked by MPs to explain his position over Facebook data. In the UK, Cambridge Analytica and Facebook are one focus of an inquiry into data and politics by the Information Commissioner’s Office. Separately, the Electoral Commission is also investigating what role Cambridge Analytica played in the EU referendum. In the US, Robert Mueller has asked for emails from the firm as part of his inquiry into Russia’s involvement in the 2016 election. • This article was amended on 19 March 2018 to correct the spelling of Colombia."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2018/mar/16/conviviality-uk-drinks-retailer-seeks-rights-issue-after-catastrophic-financial-errors","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-16T14:40:22Z","webTitle":"Conviviality seeks £50m in rights issue after financial errors","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/mar/16/conviviality-uk-drinks-retailer-seeks-rights-issue-after-catastrophic-financial-errors","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/mar/16/conviviality-uk-drinks-retailer-seeks-rights-issue-after-catastrophic-financial-errors","fields":{"headline":"Conviviality seeks £50m in rights issue after financial errors","bodyText":"Conviviality, owner of the Bargain Booze and Wine Rack chains, is seeking to raise more than £50m in an emergency rights issue next week after a series of catastrophic financial errors that have resulted in the suspension of its shares. On Friday the drinks retailer, which also operates the wholesaler Matthew Clark, told the City it was considering asking shareholders to inject fresh funds into the business. Investors were receptive to bailing out the company, a well-placed source told the Guardian, with the company looking to raise at least £50m. Shares in the company, run by its chief executive, Diana Hunter, were suspended on Wednesday after two profit warnings in the space of a week wiped more than 60% off its stock market value. The shares were suspended at 101p after a precipitous fall that began last week when it blamed a shock profit warning on an arithmetic error made by a member of its finance team. At that time the retailer said profits would be 20% lower than the £70m expected by the City, with £5.2m of the £14m hole that had opened up in its forecast down to a spreadsheet error, while the remainder was a reflection of weakening profit margins. Conviviality is a major player in the UK drinks industry, with sales of £1.6bn in 2017. It supplies more than 700 off-licences – a mix of company-run and franchise stores. Its wholesale arm, which includes the Matthew Clark and Bibendum businesses, is the market leader with 23,000 pubs and restaurant customers including the JD Wetherspoon chain. The blow to management credibility dealt by last week’s profit alert was compounded by this week’s admission that it had not budgeted for a £30m tax bill that falls due at the end of March and as a result was in urgent talks with its banks about funding. The tale of woe means Conviviality now has a market value of just £185.5m compared with £567.3m before the first unscheduled trading update. It has also cancelled its interim dividend to save £8.2m. In a statement Conviviality said it had asked accountants from PwC to lead a “review of the business and its future finding requirements” and that its customers and suppliers “remain supportive” of the company. It also added: “The company has engaged with HM Revenues and Customs regarding the £30m payment due on the 29 March 2018. HMRC has been receptive to our needs and these discussions continue.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"cities/2018/apr/11/adelaide-elizabeth-holden-500-car-industry-manufacturing-loss","type":"article","sectionId":"cities","sectionName":"Cities","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-11T06:00:01Z","webTitle":"Holden on: can Adelaide shift gears after the loss of its car industry?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2018/apr/11/adelaide-elizabeth-holden-500-car-industry-manufacturing-loss","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/cities/2018/apr/11/adelaide-elizabeth-holden-500-car-industry-manufacturing-loss","fields":{"headline":"Holden on: can Adelaide shift gears after the loss of its car industry?","bodyText":"Tegan Gromball squints uncertainly at the muscle cars roaring around the bend. It used to be that when the gleaming crimson and white Holden VF Commodore blasted over the finish line, she felt like she had played some small part in its victory. “Even before I started working at Holden, I was a Holden supporter,” she says, standing behind the formidable barricades that shield Supercars Championship fans from flying debris. “It’s weird knowing that the cars aren’t what we’ve made, but are coming from other places. That’s a bit sad, obviously. When they’re not Australian-built, winning races won’t have some [sense of] achievement that we were part of it.” For four days every March a familiar droning sound, like a swarm of hornets, descends on the capital of South Australia: the Adelaide 500 Supercars road race. The noise infuriates inner-city residents but is a siren song to the petrolheads from the working-class northern fringes, who undertake the hour-long journey into town for the big race. Like many other outer suburbs residents making the pilgrimage this year, Gromball found the trip tinged with melancholy. It is the first Adelaide 500 to be held since Australia lost its automotive manufacturing industry – and the north of Adelaide was its beating heart. Six months on, the city is still coming to terms with the news. It is no coincidence that of Australia’s two motorsport tribes, the fans at the Adelaide 500 are mostly wearing Holden red rather than Ford blue. Since the company was founded here in 1856 as a horse saddlery, the Holden brand has been synonymous with South Australia. The company shifted with the times, from saddles to car parts, before being bought out by the US giant General Motors, which built a Holden factory in 1960 in the shining new satellite town of Elizabeth, 24km north of Adelaide. The planned community was a utopian vision for how modern life was then conceived: steady jobs and orderly streets. Holden’s Australian workforce peaked at 23,914 in 1964, across seven facilities. Car production continued to climb, but as the process became more automated, jobs dropped off, until Holden closed all facilities other than Elizabeth’s in 1988. By that point, Elizabeth was well on its way to being a down-on-its-luck suburb rather than a gleaming community of the future, gradually consumed by Adelaide’s creeping city limits and a despair brought on by Australia’s shift from manufacturing to service industries. The most devastating blow came in 2013, when the federal government withdrew subsidies for the car manufacturing industry, prompting General Motors to initiate a four-year plan to cease production in this far-flung, high-wage outpost. Gromball was there when the last locally made car trundled along the production line and out the door. Now working in pest control, she doesn’t get a weekday off for the Adelaide 500 anymore, but she still made it for the Sunday. Gromball worked on the production line for seven years, as did her husband. She’s at the race with her brother-in-law, who did 10 years there. She’s also brought along her daughter, Terleah, 10, and son, Dylan, eight. Both wanted to work at the plant when they grew up. Terleah hopes the factory will be turned into a museum, and wrote to the state’s former premier, Jay Weatherill, suggesting as much. She got a “very nice” letter back, but no promises. Adelaide, like the rest of South Australia, is focused on looking forwards. The city increasingly defines itself by its arts scene, and hosts Australia’s largest arts festival, the Adelaide Fringe, which in 2016 accounted for 39% of all ticket sales to multi-category events across the country. The month-long event coincides with the Adelaide 500, with the droning of the cars clearly audible during dramatic pauses and between arias. It infuriates festivalgoers and residents of the leafy middle-class suburbs, who dismiss the Adelaide 500 as the annual migration of the bogans from up north. This kind of snobbishness represents an extra hurdle to those in Elizabeth and Adelaide’s other northern communities, where the intergenerational impact of the loss of manufacturing is a serious concern. At the time closure plans were announced, there were 1,600 manufacturing jobs at the Holden plant, but the factory drew on networks of local suppliers who employed thousands more. While the Australian unemployment rate is 5.8%, Elizabeth has 31.1% out of work, while the northern suburbs of Adelaide sit at 7.7%. David Wark, head of the St Vincent de Paul Society for South Australia,, says he and his colleagues had put on extra meal services in preparation for the closure of the plant, but the number of additional people seeking assistance still surprised them. “Vinnies” has experienced a 20% rise in the number of people needing help and a 40% rise in demand in the northern suburbs. “The need is deeper,” Wark says. “We used to provide a food hamper until their next bit of income, but now it’s food hamper plus assistance with rent, assistance with bills. It’s not only the staff of Holden, but also suppliers – even the deli down the road. We’re finding people are hurting and businesses closing down.” Tracy Ingram, the manager of Centacare’s Outer Youth North homeless service, used to get young people in difficult circumstances back on track via apprenticeships with Holden. “Now,” she says, “that opportunity is no longer there.” Between July and December 2017 , 56 people came to Ingram’s Elizabeth branch because of family breakdowns or relationship issues, compared with just six people over the same period a year earlier. “Families get frustrated through the lack of opportunity, turn to drugs and alcohol, lash out at their young people, they lash back, get kicked out and come to us,” she says. “When finances dry out from whatever payout you were on, those things erupt. If they don’t see a future for a job, that’s when frustrations happen.” Back at the Adelaide 500, amid the noise and chaos of the racetrack and motorsport crowds, oil and gas worker Jim Smith has taken refuge in a quiet tent filled with old Holdens. Smith worked on the production line straight out of high school in the 70s, but “went bush” a few years later to enter Australia’s now-lucrative resources industry. “In hindsight it was a good move,” he says, as he inspects a handsome 1959 model. “I had mates from school who were Holdens from day one through to its close – 40 years’ worth of service. It’s disappointing for South Australia and the manufacturing industry. There’s virtually nothing left now.” Smith gazes over at the cars he left behind. “Still, they’re always going to be Holdens,” he says. “You can’t take the badge off what’s already been produced.” The Ford fans at the Adelaide 500 know how their old rivals are feeling. Darren White made the trip over from Melbourne, where the last Ford plant closed down in 2016. “They’re both gone now, no more local manufacturing,” he says. “It’s a bit sad for both sides, but it is what is.” Data from the most recent Australian census reveals the number of manufacturing workers in the country has fallen 24% over the five years to 2016, and a 2014 University of Adelaide report predicted the end of the car industry would put up to 200,000 jobs at risk across the country. The report’s co-author Professor John Spoehr says that the transitional measures put in place since means he is optimistic that not all is not lost for former manufacturing hubs like Elizabeth. For proof, he just needs to look out his office window. Spoehr works in the far south of Adelaide at Tonsley Park, an innovation hub built inside the shell of the Mitsubishi car factory that closed down in 2008. “Now this place employs more than it ever did as a car factory,” he says. South Australia has turned to the manufacture of renewable generation and associated battery storage products as the new bedrock of its economy, with a solar panel and home battery producer among the tenants at Tonsley Park. The old Holden factory is on a four-site shortlist to host a home battery factory set to supply the entire Asia-Pacific region, and Spoehr predicts another green technology is about to get going in the northern suburbs. “Like a phoenix out of the ashes, the car industry will rise again,” he says – in the form of electric, autonomous vehicles. “We’ve got the skills and the capabilities; it is relatively affordable; there’s a range of international players looking at doing assembly here,” he says. “It’s not fanciful to think within the next five years we’ll have an electrical autonomous vehicle industry.” One such international player is the British billionaire Sanjeev Gupta, who is seeking to use the Holden factory assets to produce electric cars. Gupta has already intervened to save the local steel industry and chose South Australia as the site for his plan to build the biggest battery storage project in the world. But General Motors is resisting Gupta’s overtures, as it did in 2016 when a Belgian entrepreneur wanted to continue producing cars at the factory. Gromball, like many former automotive manufacturing workers, has become jaded by all the false starts. “There are so many stories – you don’t want to get excited for something that isn’t going to happen,” she says. She would be thrilled to work in an electric vehicle plant, although she’s not sure about the push to bring Formula E electric car racing to Adelaide. “It’d be interesting to watch a few,” she says politely. “But watching an electric wouldn’t be the same. It’s missing the grunt of the V8. The noise, the power, the excitement a V8 gives off. Oh, and the smell. Oh yeah, that smell.” In collaboration with Guardian Australia, Guardian Cities is devoting a week to Australian cities.

Leach is not only the leading English spinner in the County Championship over the past two seasons but recently claimed 18 wickets for the Lions as the standout bowler during an otherwise chastening 3-0 defeat by West Indies A. Whether a first Test cap follows for the 26-year-old remains to be seen, with the two-Test series which begins in Auckland next Thursday under floodlights not expected to demand a second spinner alongside Moeen Ali. It is nevertheless a blow to Crane, who made his debut in Sydney at the end of England’s 4-0 Ashes defeat. The 21-year-old leg-spinner has been set a 10-week recovery period and will miss the start of Hampshire’s summer. England’s third day of warm-up cricket continued in Hamilton on Friday with the bowlers claiming 13 wickets against a strong New Zealand XI. Ben Stokes did not bowl due to a back issue – he is due to play the final day as a specialist batsman – and Stuart Broad was again overlooked for the new ball. Broad is one Test wicket from 400 but has struggled for away movement to the right-handers over the past year and gone two years without a five-wicket haul. He was first change behind Mark Wood in England’s first two-day warm-up while Chris Woakes opened up with Jimmy Anderson in the second. Anderson admitted the 31-year-old, who claimed 11 wickets at 47 in Australia series, has been stung by the demotion as the England captain, Joe Root, looks to life beyond his established new ball pairing. “Obviously he is disappointed. He’s a very proud bloke,” Anderson told Sky Sports. “I can see what Joe wants to do with looking to the future, but also having that experience to come on first change. “Stuart has done a lot of work on his action during the time off between the Ashes and now. He’s looking really threatening.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"business/grogonomics/2018/mar/18/labors-dividend-tax-policy-is-smart-bold-and-dangerous","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-17T21:00:34Z","webTitle":"Labor’s dividend tax policy is smart, bold – and dangerous | Greg Jericho","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2018/mar/18/labors-dividend-tax-policy-is-smart-bold-and-dangerous","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/grogonomics/2018/mar/18/labors-dividend-tax-policy-is-smart-bold-and-dangerous","fields":{"headline":"Labor’s dividend tax policy is smart, bold – and dangerous","bodyText":"The belief that there is no difference between Labor and Liberal hasn’t been true for a while now, but this week, with the ALP’s policy to end the Howard-Costello enacted cash refunds for excess dividend imputation credits, everyone knows where the line between the parties is drawn. And it marks Bill Shorten as a leader prepared to argue for the prime ministership instead of hoping to win it by default. Remember the old days of the small-target strategy? Forget that. This week, the ALP saw Shorten stand up and tell everyone to take their best shot. Any policy that negatively affects retirees is a bold – and possibly politically dangerous – move. But it is also very much in keeping with Labor’s policy on negative gearing and capital gains tax. There again, they sought to undo a Howard-Costello policy that made things very favourable for older, wealthier people. Among the many problems with John Howard and Peter Costello, one of their greatest was the desire to shovel as much money as possible to older people who didn’t need it. This not only took money out of the budget, it also did so in a manner that ensured problems that would remain long after their political time had expired. It was also a policy that has served to entrench wealth inequality. While income inequality often gets the attention, wealth inequality is even bigger, and with it comes intergenerational inequality. The richest 20% of Australians hold about 40% of the national income but nearly 65% of the national wealth, and a majority of the wealth is held by those over 55. And our tax system is designed to help them not only keep it, but to garner more and then give it to their children (who then garner more and then give it to their children, who then ...) Our retirement system is based around tax-free holdings of wealth – through the family home, which is exempt from capital gains tax, and tax-free income from superannuation. With those exemptions comes revenue forgone, and the cost of paying for our ageing population is an issue that is hitting us square between the eyes. The prime earning age for workers is between 25 and 54. Between those ages, you are no longer studying, and not really thinking about retirement. These workers not only power much of our production, but also our tax revenue. And right now the cohort is shrinking. Currently just 41% of the population is aged between 25 and 54. The last time it was that low was in 1987, when the first baby boomers were entering their 40s. Back then, it wasn’t a problem because only 10.5% of the population was aged over 65. But now those 40-year-old baby boomers are retiring and those over 65 account for 15.5% of our population. That jump is the equivalent of about 1.2 million extra people aged over 65 – people who mostly don’t work (and nor should they be expected to), or pay income tax, but whose pensions and services need to be paid for by the revenue derived from those prime-aged workers. So what is to be done? You could – as is the government’s current policy – increase the retirement age to 70 (this policy is still on the Department of Human Services website). That might be fine for someone like me typing away at a desk but not for many others. You could “crack down on welfare cheats”. The problem is, despite protestations from the government and conservative media, there aren’t many of those. On Friday, the government announced that it had saved $43.4m – $17.8m in this financial year – from “more than 1,000 wealthy welfare cheats”. That’s from a $46.1bn annual budget for Newstart, DSP and Family Tax Benefit (and the aged pension is another $45.4bn). Or you could, as the ALP is doing, seek to find extra revenue by cutting out rorts that were designed as electoral sweeteners and favours to the Howard-Costello key demographic. When this imputation cash rebate was introduced, not many were affected but like any good tax rort, accountants soon caught wind. Add in the 2006 decision to make income from superannuation tax free for those over 60, and suddenly you had a lot of people with a high actual income but very low or zero taxable income taking advantage of it. Further add in this weird belief that the retirement nest egg must not be touched, and you get a lot of idiotic reporting – such as in the Herald Sun, which had the case study of a woman with an income of $160,000, who we should feel sad for because she will lose her $12,775 rebate. She could, of course, sell some of her shares, but that would actually be using superannuation for its purpose and not as a tax-free inheritance fund. So it is a smart and needed policy, but also a dangerous one because it affects an area shrouded in confusion and thus very much susceptible to fear-mongering. However, it also delivers the ALP big money. At about $5bn a year – rising to $8bn – this is not that much lower than what would be raised by applying a GST on fresh food. Yes, the Labor party will use some of it to get the budget back to surplus, but it is also very likely to use it for tax cuts and education and health spending commitments – and they will all be fully paid for. As I noted with Malcolm Turnbull’s promise of tax cuts, you need to ask how they’re being paid for. With this increase in revenue, the question becomes what it will be spent on – and the benefit of that spending could well be worth any political pain the ALP might suffer now. – Greg Jericho is a Guardian Australia columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/mar/16/winter-paralympics-day-seven-medals-for-brenna-huckaby-and-bibian-mentel-spee","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-16T12:29:32Z","webTitle":"Winter Paralympics day seven: Medals for Brenna Huckaby and Bibian Mentel-Spee","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/mar/16/winter-paralympics-day-seven-medals-for-brenna-huckaby-and-bibian-mentel-spee","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/mar/16/winter-paralympics-day-seven-medals-for-brenna-huckaby-and-bibian-mentel-spee","fields":{"headline":"Winter Paralympics day seven: Medals for Brenna Huckaby and Bibian Mentel-Spee","bodyText":"On day seven of the Winter Paralympics in Pyeongchang Germany wrapped up double gold in the long distance sitting biathlon, with Andrea Eskau claiming her second gold of the Games in the 12.5km, while compatriot Martin Fleig won the men’s 15k event. There were also golds for Russian athletes Anna Milenina and Mikhalina Lysova in the 12.5km standing and 12.5km visually impaired categories respectively. Fleig said: “It’s an unbelievable feeling and an unbelievable day for me. We had perfect skis, perfect clean shooting which is important for the individual race. It’s awesome.” Eskau explained how her tactics in the longer race was to focus very much on the shooting. “I took more time than the other times, because it depends really on the shooting. One miss will hurt you very much, so I stayed a little bit calmer and took more time because I was sure I could even catch some time in the tracks if it’d been necessary, but it was not.” In the biathlon, athletes have a minute penalty added to their time for each target they miss in the shooting. Bibian Mentel-Spee claimed her second gold of the Games in the women’s banked slalom. Mentel-Spee, who has recovered from multiples surgeries to treat cancer, won by a margin of nearly three seconds. The USA’s Brenna Huckaby also took a second gold medal in the snowboarding, in the banked slalom SB-LL1 class. Huckaby made headlines earlier this year by becoming the first amputee to feature in the annual Sports Illustrated swimsuit issue. Huckaby said that, in doing the shoot, she “wanted to represent women with disabilities the right way.” She says that after the issue appeared she had supportive messages. One woman told her “If I had seen these pictures when I was younger, that would’ve made such a difference in my recovery after cancer.” Huckaby had her right leg amputated following complications with bone cancer, and says that “I started snowboarding to find a purpose. Everyone wants to feel important and snowboarding made me feel that. When gymnastics was ripped away from me at 14 I was lost and in a deep hole, snowboarding was my ladder out.” New Zealand’s Adam Hall and Finland’s Sini Pyy have been announced as the winners of the Whang Youn Dai Achievement Award at the Paralympics. Named after South Korean Dr. Whang Youn Dai who worked to promote disability sports in her home nation and around the world, the award is presented at every Paralympics to athletes who “best exemplify the spirit of the Games and inspire and excite the world”. Hall competed in the alpine skiiing, winning bronze in the Super combined standing, having grown up with spina bifida. Pyy took part in the biathlon in Pyeongchang, having lost mobility after a car accident when she was aged 17. She will compete again on Saturday in the 5km event. Tomorrow’s wheelchair curling final will be between Norway and China after two tight semi-finals today. Norway edged out hosts South Korea 8-6 in a match-up that had to go to a deciding extra end. In the other game, China were 4-3 victors over Canada, scoring in the final end to take a match that was not without controversy. In the seventh end a stone hit Canadian skip Mark Ideson’s chair, leading to a dispute about where the ‘burned’ stone should be placed. South Korea and Canada will now contest for the bronze medal before tomorrow’s final."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2018/mar/16/sam-clucas-swansea-critics-twitter-carlos-carvalhal-fa-cup-tottenham","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-16T12:00:04Z","webTitle":"Sam Clucas: ‘One fan wrote: if he plays above League Two I’ll eat my hat’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/mar/16/sam-clucas-swansea-critics-twitter-carlos-carvalhal-fa-cup-tottenham","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/mar/16/sam-clucas-swansea-critics-twitter-carlos-carvalhal-fa-cup-tottenham","fields":{"headline":"Sam Clucas: ‘One fan wrote: if he plays above League Two I’ll eat my hat’","bodyText":"Rejected by Leicester City, released by Lincoln City and turned down by MK Dons after scoring a hat-trick in a trial game, Sam Clucas has proved a few people wrong along the way, including one particular supporter. “I used to look on the fans’ forum when I played for Hereford and you would see people saying: ‘He’s the worst player we’ve ever signed.’ There was one – I actually took a screenshot of it on my phone – who wrote: ‘If he ever plays higher than League Two, I’ll eat my hat.’ That’s one that always sticks in my head,” the midfielder says. Defying the critics has become the story of Clucas’s career, with last summer’s move to Swansea presenting a familiar set of challenges for a player whose colourful CV includes a stint operating the till in a cafe at Debenhams. Jeered off when substituted at the Liberty Stadium against Brighton in November, Clucas was given a standing ovation by the same fans two months later after he scored twice in a 3-1 victory over Arsenal. That road to redemption is a well-trodden path for Clucas, only these days he has mechanisms in place during the bad times, especially when it comes to social media. “I used to be one of those players that types his name and sees what people are saying but it does get you down at times. So I thought to myself that I had to block it out because it was getting to the point where I was losing confidence going into games, thinking I was going to get slated. Now I’ve turned all my Twitter notifications off, so if I have a bad game I don’t see: ‘Clucas was rubbish, get out of my club.’ “Fans are obviously trying to vent their frustration but they don’t realise the knock-on effect it has. And obviously if that player is going to a game not full of confidence, it has a knock-on effect to the team. It’s the most frustrating part of being a footballer because, to be honest, it’s hard to bite your tongue at times. Some of the tweets, I think: ‘I wouldn’t say that to anybody.’ So if you’re going to be on social media, you’ve got to develop a thick skin, because it can be a vicious place.” A likeable character, Clucas talks candidly about handling criticism and with no trace of anger. In the case of Swansea, he accepts he was always going to be an easy target once things started to unravel under Paul Clement. Signed from Hull in August in a deal worth about £15m, he was arguably not any worse than anyone else during Swansea’s dismal first half of the season, but he was the first player through the door after Gylfi Sigurdsson departed and became a scapegoat for a struggling team amid growing supporter unrest. “I fully understand that. I’m a football fan, I support Manchester United and I do the same thing when they make signings,” Clucas says. “They were big boots to fill, even though I’m not the same player as Sigurdsson. It does get you down. But then I’ve got to tell myself I’m playing in the Premier League and I’m good enough. It’s hard but I’ve proved before I can turn fans’ opinions around. I’ve had the same at most clubs. I just seem to get off to a slow start – and it doesn’t help when you’re losing games.” Swansea were doing that far too often before Carlos Carvalhal’s appointment at the end of December. The turnaround has been nothing short of remarkable. They have lost only twice in Carvalhal’s 16 matches, collecting 18 points from 10 league games to climb to 14th, and on Saturday they host Tottenham in their first FA Cup quarter-final in 54 years. Asked what, specifically, Carvalhal has done to bring about change, Clucas replies: “With the old manager, every day we would be working on shape. From Monday to the matchday it would be more tactical. But the new manager has come in and just concentrated on playing through the lines and playing with freedom. You’re not stuck in your positions, you’re free to come in and link up. I think that has given the boys a lot of confidence. It has certainly helped me.” What also shines through when talking to Clucas about Carvalhal’s impact is that the quirky, slightly eccentric manager who appears before the media is the same person the players see on a daily basis. “Even if we don’t get a result, he’ll come in on Monday and say: ‘Forget about it. You’re good enough players.’ Then he’ll just come out with one of his quotes and everyone starts laughing,” Clucas says, chuckling. “He also tells stories in his meetings. Every day before the meeting starts, we all say to him that we want one, and he tells us a story about back in Portugal or wherever. It just makes it an enjoyable place to be. And I think if you’re in a happy environment in the week, you take that into the games. We’re a lot more confident now and we know we’ve got the backing of the fans.” Clucas is refreshingly down-to-earth, which is perhaps not surprising given his nomadic route After being let go by Leicester aged 16 because he was too small – he is now 6ft 2in – he played for non-league Nettleham, Lincoln, Jerez Industrial (in Spain), Hereford, Mansfield, Chesterfield and Hull before joining Swansea. Not that he appears old enough to have had that sort of career. “Everyone looks at me and thinks I’m 18, which is a good thing apart from when you’re on a night out and you get ID’d everywhere still when you’re 27.” Life has certainly changed from the days when he was earning £6.20 an hour in Debenhams, yet Clucas likes to remain in touch with his roots. He is looking forward to going to Wembley to watch Lincoln, his hometown club, play Shrewsbury in the Checkatrade Trophy final and has also made a few trips back to Lincoln College, where he studied while playing non-league football, to see his old tutors. “They’re all so proud,” he says. “They’ve even opened a room at the college, I think, called the Clucas Room.” Plenty of people have helped him along the way but he feels a huge debt of gratitude to Glenn Hoddle, who offered him a place at his academy in Spain and helped rebuild confidence after Clucas was cut by Lincoln. The two remain close and Hoddle was quick to send a complimentary message after Clucas scored those goals against Arsenal. “He always watches out for me,” Clucas says. “And it’s really nice to get a text from someone like Glenn. But I don’t think I’ll be getting too much encouragement from him for this Tottenham game.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/mar/16/hawking-happiness-and-homeopathy-its-been-a-week-for-black-holes","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-16T11:59:02Z","webTitle":"Hawking, happiness and homeopathy – it's been a week for black holes | John Crace","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/mar/16/hawking-happiness-and-homeopathy-its-been-a-week-for-black-holes","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/mar/16/hawking-happiness-and-homeopathy-its-been-a-week-for-black-holes","fields":{"headline":"Hawking, happiness and homeopathy – it's been a week for black holes","bodyText":"Monday One of the more bizarre Westminster set-pieces took place today when the Speaker, John Bercow, granted an urgent question about claims of bullying of parliamentary staff by MPs. As Bercow was one of those MPs against whom these allegations had been made, you might have expected him to excuse himself from the Speaker’s chair and allow his deputy to oversee the session. Not a bit of it. Bercow took centre stage, nodding his head even more theatrically than usual, as most MPs tried to avoid mentioning him by name. Though not all. Conservative James Duddridge broke ranks – the Tory backbenchers, many of whom dislike the Speaker for what they see as his pro-Labour, anti-Brexit bias, had been instructed not to score political points ahead of the prime minister’s statement on Russia – to question Bercow’s position. The embarrassment in the chamber was excruciating. To add to the sense of the surreal, the leader of the house, Andrea Leadsom, announced she would be recommending an independent inquiry into the bullying claims to the House of Commons commission, the cross-party group responsible for the administration of the Commons. As Bercow is chair of the commission, this effectively meant he would be in charge of appointing the people who would be investigating him. To round off a bad day for the Speaker, his car was photographed with a “Bollocks to Brexit” sticker in the window. Tuesday When Spurs announced they would be building a new state-of-the-art football stadium on the site of the old White Hart Lane, they promised that the fans would be “front, left and centre” of all their plans. That promise lasted as long as it took for the brochure inviting season ticket holders to choose their seats at the new ground to land on my doorstep. It quickly became apparent that two-thirds of the seating in the lower area of the ground where I used to sit had been given over to corporate entertainment and that if I wanted to remain in roughly the same place – assuming all the seats hadn’t already been taken – then I would have to fork out a 50% price hike for the privilege. If that wasn’t bad enough, the club has come up with an extraordinary eight-phase application process, which means that some families – and many groups of friends – who have sat near to one another for years and years are now likely to be separated unless they are all prepared to sit in the least popular areas of the new ground. Needless to say, all these unpleasant details were tucked away right at the back of the brochure. The opening pages were given over to the glories of the fabulous new artisan bakery and microbrewery that would be available inside the new stadium. A word to the Spurs board: most of us go to the football to watch the game and hang out and moan with our mates, not to pick up a loaf of sourdough. If the club isn’t careful, Spurs’ new 62,000-capacity ground could be half empty for fixtures against less glamorous sides within five years. Wednesday On the day that Stephen Hawking, one of the greatest minds of any century, died, YouGov conducted a poll into how many people had read his book A Brief History of Time. Eighty-five per cent of people said they had never owned a copy, while only 4% responded that they had bought the book and read it from cover to cover. I count myself in an even smaller group than that. Not only did I read every word of the book, I also bought and read his two subsequent books – The Universe in a Nutshell and A Briefer History of Time – that he wrote for those who had been too dim to understand his first book. So I must confess that for all Hawking’s many achievements in the area of theoretical physics, his attempts to educate me ended in failure. I came to be able to repeat that at the moment we call big bang, the density of the universe and the curvature of spacetime would have been infinite so all theories of cosmology break down. But not to understand what the hell that meant. Nor did I ever get to grips with the problems of resolving singularity through supersymmetery, string theory or 10-dimensional space. Hawking once wrote that if we learned why the universe existed, it would be the ultimate triumph of human reason, “for then we would know the mind of God”. To which I would add, we’d also know a great deal more about the mind of Hawking. Thursday My first thought when I wake up most mornings is: “Well done, John. You’ve already failed at the day and you haven’t even got out of bed”. And that’s one of the high points as generally things go steadily downhill from there on. My sense of emptiness and disappointment in myself is profound. I am unable to hold on to any of the good things that happen to me for more than a few moments, while the bad things fester and gnaw away at me from the inside. So while part of me feels the need to apologise to the rest of the country for personally dragging the UK down a few notches to 19th in the UN happiness rankings, I mostly feel relieved to be living somewhere so miserable. Just imagine the pressure of living in Finland, which tops the charts. Or in any of the other Nordic countries that occupy the rest of the top four places. Knowing that the people around me were having the most brilliant time while I was unable to extract any enjoyment from my country being the best governed, the police the most trusted and the banks the most stable would send me into an even greater spiral of depression. Friday Given that the health service is already heavily strapped for cash and that some patients are being denied treatments because they are deemed to be too expensive, the news this week that the Royal London Hospital for Integrated Medicine – formerly the Royal London Homeopathic Hospital – will no longer be able to provide homeopathic remedies on the NHS from next month comes not a moment too soon. The head of NHS England, Sir Simon Stevens has described homeopathy as “at best a placebo” and at worst a misuse of public funds. No doubt there will be some, Prince Charles possibly among them, who swear by homeopathy and will be devastated it is no longer freely available. But serious homeopaths should look on this as a win-win situation. Homeopathy has always worked on the “less is more” basis: some formulations have one part per trillion of the active ingredient and others are diluted so far that scientists have been unable to locate a single molecule of the substance involved. Homeopaths have explained this anomaly as water’s ability to retain the memory of something that was once in it. So on this basis the RLHIM should be more effective than ever now that it will be powered by the memory of NHS cash. Digested week, digested: “Russia should go away and shut up.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/live/2018/mar/16/champions-league-quarter-finals-draw-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-16T11:25:51Z","webTitle":"Liverpool draw Manchester City in Champions League quarter-finals","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2018/mar/16/champions-league-quarter-finals-draw-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/live/2018/mar/16/champions-league-quarter-finals-draw-live","fields":{"headline":"Liverpool draw Manchester City in Champions League quarter-finals","bodyText":"The Premier League leaders, Manchester City, have been drawn against Liverpool in the quarter-finals of the Champions League.

Well Real Madrid aren’t getting an easy route through the competition this time. The draw in full: Barcelona v Roma Sevilla v Bayern Munich Juventus v Real Madrid Liverpool v Manchester City The team drawn first will host the first leg, which will be played on 3/4 April, with the return the following week. Liverpool and Manchester City have never played each other in Uefa competition. Last year’s final will be replayed! Twice! Their head-too-head record is pretty even: 22 goals per team, Juventus have won eight, lost nine and drawn two. Sevilla have never played Bayern Munich in Uefa competition. Just to clarify, it’s a bowl, not a hat. Anyway, we have our first pairing. And Barcelona are first out of the hat! Shevchenko on Ukraine hosting the final. He seems pleased: It’s a big honour for us to host the Champions League final. People in the Ukraine love football and it’s a great moment, an important moment also for the young generation, to see the best teams in the world. Thankyou for this chance. Shevchenko’s hot take: “There’s a lot of great teams – Barcelona, Real Madrid, Manchester City. It’s all the great teams. Juventus. It’s a very difficult, very tight competition.” He will be joined for the actual ball-fondling bit by Andriy Shevchenko, this season’s Champions League ambassador (because the final will take place in his native Ukraine). The draw is about to actually happen, and Giorgio Marchetti, Uefa’s deputy general secretary, is our drawmaster. I have literally no idea what’s happening here. None. Pedro Pinto, Uefa’s head of media, is our MC, and is getting things started in time-honoured fashion: with a moody slow-motion video package! 11am: here we go! We have our first live photo, of the trophy in all it’s enormous glory. It must be an absolute nightmare to keep clean, mind. The fingerprints! “It will be quite intriguing to see if Real Madrid is to have it the easy way yet again, as they faced Tottenham in 2011, APOEL Nicosia in 2012, Galatasaray in 2013, Borussia Dortmund in 2014 and VfL Wolfsburg in 2016 at this stage of the competition,” writes Ozgur Celtikci. “I do seriously hope for a clasico, though.” Though there was also Atletico in 2015 and Bayern Munich last year. Anyone who replies to a question about who they would like to play in the quarter-finals by saying, as Mattia de Sciglio does here, “nobody in particular”, is, I would suggest, a fibber. The question on everyone’s lips this morning: will there be any footballing-celebrity draw assistants? And the answer is: er, I’m not sure. But Andriy Shevchenko’s there! Here’s the preview of the draw in today’s edition of Marca. They call it “the greatest draw in the world”, which is perhaps overstating things but, hey, we’re all excited here. I know it’s a picky thing to whinge about, but could Uefa not just use the same big plastic bowl for all their draws, rather than having a bespoke Champions League quarter-final bowl? Is this what the world really needs? Hello world! So, it’s draw time again. Fans of the genre may find what follows disappointingly brief and confusingly straightforward. Uefa is as fond as any of us of a complicated draw. Most Uefa draws involve complex coefficients, opaque seedings and assorted regulations to prevent clubs from the same association or the same group from being pitted against each other. Not any more, though: the best things in life are free, and this draw is one of them. Eight balls representing eight teams shall be placed in a single bowl, and they will be removed from the bowl in random order. With no two teams from the same city remaining in the competition, there are no complications to worry about here. So, we need to know little more than the identity of the remaining teams, and they are (in order of current bookmaker favouritism): Manchester City Barcelona Real Madrid Bayern Munich Juventus Liverpool Sevilla Roma First legs shall be played on 3/4 April, and return matches the following week. Draw fans should note that the next one is on 13 April. The Premier League leaders, Manchester City, have been drawn against Liverpool in the quarter-finals of the Champions League. City secured their place in the last eight by beating Basel, having won the away leg 4-0, but then lost 2-1 at home in the second leg.

The US entertainment industry is not awfully keen on Trump, having strongly backed Hillary Clinton in the 2016 election, but is even less keen on its movies and TV shows being ripped off by the world’s most populous country. The Motion Picture Association of America estimates that 90% of the viewings of its output in China are illegal, and that the Chinese are particularly partial to ripping off Game of Thrones, which for the past six years has been the most pirated TV show on the internet. The MPAA is urging Washington to get tough with China over intellectual property and Trump – who sees trade not as a win–win exercise but more akin to the bloody dynastic struggles in Game of Thrones – appears ready to do so. The signals coming out of the White House are pretty unambiguous. Having campaigned as a protectionist, Trump intends to govern as one. He thinks “trade wars are good and easy to win” and that the spoils go to those who negotiate hardest. Those who thought the president was all talk and would eventually be reined in by the “grown-ups” who favoured free trade have been proved wrong. The grown-ups have either departed or been sidelined, with Trump surrounding himself with people who are more sympathetic to his America First agenda. The opening salvos in what could soon become a full-scale trade war were fired a few weeks ago when Trump announced tariffs on imported steel and aluminium. All things considered, the response from other leading trading nations was restrained. There was no knee-jerk retaliation from China or the EU: rather a willingness to let the World Trade Organisation in Geneva decide whether Trump’s action could be justified on his purported national security grounds. But the White House has got the taste for protectionism and wants to go further. The next round of sanctions will specifically target China. After that it looks like being Europe’s turn. Trump’s beef with China goes beyond piracy of Hollywood movies. The administration says Beijing has forced American companies to transfer their technology across the Pacific as the price of doing business. Technology transfer is one of the ways in which developing countries close the gap with the west, but rich countries tend to guard their patents jealously. Peter Navarro, the president’s director of trade and manufacturing – and an arch-protectionist – says the US is being abused by China. Trump agrees and has already said he is looking for big damages. China has until now sought to portray itself as the champion of free trade, even to the point where Xi Jinping went to Davos last year and described protectionism (by which he meant Trump’s protectionism) as “locking oneself in a dark room”. But Beijing has said appeasement would not be an option were the US to announce more tariffs. As for the EU, it ran a $92bn trade surplus with the US in 2016. Both the EU and the US impose tariffs on each other’s goods, but the EU’s are higher on average. Measured in dollars, Germany is running an even bigger trade surplus than China and has been criticised for it by the International Monetary Fund, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development and even the European commission. The European Central Bank is not helping matters. As Albert Edwards, of Société Générale, has pointed out, the ECB’s stimulus programme has involved printing euros through its quantitative easing programme. This has had the effect of weakening the value of the euro and so making exports cheaper, because both official and market interest rates are well below where they would otherwise be. The US has been threatening action against China for manipulating its currency for years. Trump may well accuse the EU of the same offence in the belief that he can force the Europeans to make life easier for American exporters. He is not the only protectionist out there. Between them, the world’s 60 largest economies have imposed 7,000 new protectionist measures since the financial crisis of a decade ago, with Washington and Brussels each responsible for 1,000 of the new restrictions. The US president is at least honest about being a mercantilist; others tend to keep quiet about their protectionist proclivities. Trump sees trade negotiations as like one of his business deals: the aim is to get the other side to make concessions. He may be right in his assumption that other countries will blink first. America is, by global standards, a relatively self-contained economy: trade is 28% of GDP. That compares with 41% in China and 51% in Germany, leaving them in a much more exposed position. Predictably enough, Trump’s hard line on trade has prompted calls for the US to act through multilateral organisations, such as the OECD and the WTO. But, having been instrumental in creating the WTO in the early 1990s, Washington has turned its back on the Geneva-based institution in favour of a go-it-alone approach. This is very much in accord with the spirit of the times. Belief in globalisation has been shattered by the events of the past decade. Voters, not just in the US but across the developed world, have been turning to politicians who say that the answer to flatlining living standards is for the nation state to take back powers from remote international bureaucracies. Christine Lagarde, the IMF’s managing director, is right when she says the lesson of the 1930s is that trade wars are unwinnable, but Trump is not listening. Winter is coming."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"science/political-science/2018/mar/16/who-benefits-from-biomedical-science","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-16T16:30:14Z","webTitle":"Who benefits from biomedical science?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/political-science/2018/mar/16/who-benefits-from-biomedical-science","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/political-science/2018/mar/16/who-benefits-from-biomedical-science","fields":{"headline":"Who benefits from biomedical science?","bodyText":"The world spends more than US$240bn every year on biomedical research and development. For pharmaceutical companies, who spend more than US$145bn each year, the motivation is clear: the development of new treatments that can ensure future revenue. For governments and charities (who provide the other 30% and 10% of public research and development (R&amp;D), respectively), the justifications are more complicated. They certainly help support industrial innovation, but their stated priority is normally to address real health needs. With investments on this scale, we should ask where they are directed and who is really benefitting. In many areas of science, asking “who benefits?” is complicated. The links between funding and outcome are hazy. Health research is clearer, as much of the research is defined by disease area and the World Health Organisation has statistics on the actual burdens of these diseases, measured in disability adjusted life years (DALYs) (years of life lost due to death or disability caused by a disease). Is public research addressing the most pressing national or global health problems? Not according to studies published this week by Nature Index and La Caixa Foundation. The Nature Index study, of which one of us was co-author, shows for the first time the surprising similarities between public and private R&amp;D priorities in health. Big pharma R&amp;D and public research both appear to focus on some diseases that are prevalent in high income countries, such as cancer or skin diseases, leaving other areas relatively under-invested. These studies connected the percentage of publications focused on certain disease areas to the percentage of the total disease burden in high-income countries and worldwide. The graph below shows the mismatch between scientific priorities and health needs. While the data is based on broad estimates, the findings are consistent with previous studies using NIH funding data from the US and worldwide publications data. The disease burden in low-income countries for infectious and parasitic diseases such as malaria or tuberculosis remains very high, but global R&amp;D is still modest. Pharma companies have the excuse that these diseases represent a small share of drug markets. This doesn’t explain why public sector R&amp;D should follow the same pattern. The fact that the vast majority of global science is conducted in rich countries seems to be causing neglect of global health problems. The distribution of resources across high-income disease areas is also questionable. Diseases such as stroke, depression or chronic pulmonary disease also receive little investment in comparison to their health toll in both low and high-income countries. It is striking how similar the distribution of private sector publications is to that of universities and public research organisations (with a few exceptions such as diabetes). It seems that public R&amp;D is following rather than counterbalancing pharmaceutical research agendas. We can make some guesses on why this might be. First, researchers in public labs may also receive private funding that is related to market for a disease and the likelihood that the disease can be treated using a conventional biomedical business model. Second, notions of healthcare are still dominated by drug-centred therapeutic approaches rather than improving lifestyle and promoting healthier environments. And, third, in many countries the narrative of 21st century science is increasingly tied to economic needs (often seen as national priorities) rather than fostering wellbeing. The problem is not just in how problems are chosen but also with how solutions are designed. Market forces cause an over-emphasis on certain diseases and on pharmaceutical solutions rather than preventative public health approaches. We need to be more honest about who really benefits from global biomedical science. If funders want to, as they claim, use global science for global health, we need to talk about the current mismatch. Organisations such as the Gates Foundation, the Drugs for Neglected Diseases Initiative and the European and Developing Countries Clinical Trials Partnership have gone some way towards redressing the balance. New public initiatives now need to play their part. In the UK, the Global Challenges Research Fund is an opportunity, but this too runs the risk of copying rather than counterbalancing market priorities. Setting new priorities requires listening to real health needs, in both poor and rich countries.

The finance ministry admitted this week that it had altered 14 documents surrounding the sale of public land at an 85% discount to a nationalistic school operator with links to prime minister Shinzo Abe’s wife Akie. The revisions, made early last year, included removing references to Abe and the first lady before the records were provided to parliamentarians investigating suspicions of influence-peddling. An official from the local finance bureau that oversaw the transaction was found dead at his home in Kobe last week. Now it has been revealed the man, aged in his 50s, left a detailed suicide note stating he was worried he might be forced to take all the blame. He said his superiors had told him to change the background section of the official documents surrounding the Osaka land sale because they were supposedly too specific, according to public broadcaster NHK. He reportedly made it clear that he did not act alone but in line with finance ministry instructions. His family described him as an honourable man who “hated to do anything unfair”. He had told relatives in August last year that he was “worn out both mentally and physically” and his “common sense has been destroyed”. “I hope everything will be revealed. I don’t want his death to be wasted,” said a family member quoted by the Mainichi Shimbun. In a sign of the growing pressure on the government, Taro Aso, the deputy prime minister, cancelled his appearance at a meeting of G20 finance ministers in Argentina next week to fight for his political future. Aso is a key factional powerbroker so there would be risks to the prime minister’s own support base if Aso is forced out as finance minister. Abe has previously said he would resign if he or his wife were shown to be personally involved in the land deal with school operator Moritomo Gakuen. On Wednesday he again denied any involvement.

John Woodcock called for parliament to debate whether the government should ask its allies to advocate postponing the tournament or moving it to another country. “I would like to see a parliamentary debate on whether concerted government action together with other countries to postpone the World Cup or move it to another venue would be the right way to go,” Woodcock told the Daily Express. The Barrow and Furness MP broke ranks with his party leader this week to support the government in blaming Russia over the poisoning of the former spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia with a nerve agent. Woodcock led a group of about 20 Labour MPs in signing an early day motion “unequivocally” accepting the Russian state’s culpability for the 4 March attack. On Thursday the foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, said there were no plans to stop England competing in the World Cup, but he said there would not be any “high-level representation” at the event. Woodcock said: “This is a decision which should be shared between the government, the fans and the FA. I don’t want to see anyone dictated to and I am not calling for England to unilaterally withdraw from the tournament. But there is a growing appetite among MPs to push for concerted international action over the World Cup. It should be on the table because of the appalling magnitude of what Russia has done.” Another Labour MP, Ian Austin, said: “I am very concerned that [Vladimir] Putin will use the World Cup in the same way that Hitler used the 1936 Munich Olympics, as a public relations exercise for a brutal dictatorship.” On BBC Radio 4’s Today programme on Friday, Labour’s Stephen Kinnock said: “I also think we should seriously consider about making a coordinated approach to Fifa and talk with Fifa and other allies about moving the World Cup to 2019 and having it hosted in a different host country or countries. “Putin has invested billions of roubles in the World Cup and sees it as an opportunity to showcase his regime to the world.” The FA said it would “continue to work closely with the government and relevant authorities”. Theresa May, Donald Trump, Angela Merkel and Emmanuel Macron issued a joint statement on Thursday in which the foreign leaders endorsed May’s conclusion that it was “highly likely” Russia was behind the Salisbury attack. On Friday Jens Stoltenberg, the Nato secretary general, said he backed the British government’s response to the attack. He told Today: “We have been briefed by the British government. We have no reason to doubt the findings and assessments made by the British government, not least because this takes place on the background of a pattern of reckless behaviour by Russia over many years. “It’s important Russia gets a clear signal that it has consequences, costs to the way they behave. All Nato allies express strong political support to the UK. The United Kingdom is not alone, all allies stand in solidarity with the United Kingdom.” He said Russia had underestimated the “resolve and unity” of Nato allies when the organisation previously implemented sanctions. “We have what I will call a dual-track approach to Russia: it’s about strength, deterrents, defence, but it’s also about political dialogue,” he said. “We do not want a new cold war. We don’t want a new arms race. Russia is our neighbour so therefore we have to continue to strive for an improved, better relationship with Russia.” But he added: “To isolate Russia is not an alternative. It’s our neighbour, it is here to stay. It is in their interest not to confront us but cooperate with us.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/mar/17/south-australia-heads-to-the-polls-for-unpredictable-election","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-16T19:00:01Z","webTitle":"South Australia heads to the polls for unpredictable election","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/mar/17/south-australia-heads-to-the-polls-for-unpredictable-election","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/mar/17/south-australia-heads-to-the-polls-for-unpredictable-election","fields":{"headline":"South Australia heads to the polls for unpredictable election","bodyText":"More than 1.2 million South Australians head to the polls on Saturday for one of the most unpredictable elections in the state’s history. Few pundits are sticking their necks out in an election featuring two evenly-matched major parties and the unique influence of Nick Xenophon’s SA Best, who, by running an open ticket, have left pollsters guessing as to where preferences might go. The state’s 693 polling places across 47 districts will be open from 8am to 6pm, although a record number of early votes have been recorded for the election. Those ballots won’t be counted until next week, potentially leading to significant delays unless there is a decisive result on the night. The surge of pre-election-day votes could be an encouraging sign for the Liberal leader, Steven Marshall, who took the unusual step of voting early himself and urged others to do so too, while the Icac report into the Oakden aged care scandal was still fresh in the minds of voters. Marshall also has the backing of the Murdoch media empire, including the influential daily newspaper, the Adelaide Advertiser, which this week endorsed a change in government after 16 years of Labor. On Friday the premier, Jay Weatherill, began his last day of the campaign at the West Beach property where he famously ambushed the federal energy minister, Josh Frydenberg, a year ago to the day. Weatherill promoted his government’s efforts to stand up for South Australians on energy security, unveiling a $10m loan for UK billionaire Sanjeev Gupta’s Port Augusta battery storage project, which would be the largest in the world, superseding the Tesla battery built in South Australia last year. “This is the single biggest issue facing South Australians,” he said. “We can’t turn back now. The momentum is growing.” This time however, it was Weatherill who was ambushed, his message interrupted by protester Tadhg Porter, who confronted the Labor leader over allowing exploration for oil and gas in the Great Australian Bight, before being escorted away by security. Marshall spent the day campaigning at a series of small businesses including an Unley mechanic, spruiking his plan to cut taxes on businesses and deregulate shop trading hours. He promised the Liberals would fix South Australia’s high electricity costs, despite the independent arbiter finding his party had misled voters over a promise to cut bills by $302. Marshall also reaffirmed his pledge not to make a deal with Xenophon to form government. Xenophon spent Friday campaigning the only way he knows how, unleashing what might be his final political stunt in the seat of Hartley, where he is narrowly behind Liberal incumbent Vincent Tarzia. Xenophon, who did not release costings for his policies, waved a giant plastic bull’s head around in front of reporters, in reference to his election-eve advertisement depicting him in Pamplona fleeing the “bull” coming from the two major parties and the pokies lobby. “For the first time, in most seats, South Australians have a genuine choice between the major parties,” he said. “This has been a bit like an ultra-marathon, and we’re going to get across the line, we believe, in a number of seats to make a difference after Saturday.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/live/2018/mar/17/melbourne-storm-v-wests-tigers-nrl-round-two-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-17T10:52:06Z","webTitle":"NRL: Wests Tigers spoil Slater's party with deserved win in Melbourne","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2018/mar/17/melbourne-storm-v-wests-tigers-nrl-round-two-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/live/2018/mar/17/melbourne-storm-v-wests-tigers-nrl-round-two-live","fields":{"headline":"NRL: Wests Tigers spoil Slater's party with deserved win in Melbourne","bodyText":"It wasn’t supposed to be like this. In Billy Slater’s 300th NRL game, the favourites were supposed to prevail and vanquish the upstarts from Sydney. But it was not to be. Early in the piece Melbourne took the tap and go option when they could have got points on the board with penalties. I said they might live to regret it, and this proved to be the case. The first 37 minutes of the game were scoreless, but the less fancied Tigers were giving as good as they got and playing some great defensive football. And then Esan Marsters scored a penalty, doing what Storm failed to do and taking his points. Two minutes later, he did it again and the visitors led 4-0 at half-time. Quarter of an hour into the second half, Marsters got a third penalty and an upset was on the cards. But with 17 minutes to go, Ben Matulino was sin-binned and the home side took full advantage, which the Roosters had not been able to do in similar circumstances against the Tigers a week earlier. A minute after Matulino was sent packing, Suliasi Vunivalu touched down to bring Storm back into the game. An awful missed conversion by Cameron Smith was to prove fatal, though he did then score two penalties to put Storm in front. It looked like Slater would get his fairytale win, but the Tigers had other ideas. With three minutes to go Luke Brookes scored a try for the Tigers. Marsters missed the conversion, but it made no difference, Wests Tigers held on for a deserved win and the travelling supporters had another win to celebrate. The team that few fancied two weeks ago have got off to a brilliant start to the season, with two wins from two. 80 min: It’s all over and the Tigers are surpassing all expectations. What a game, what a night and what a team the Tigers are proving to be with two upset wins to start their season with a serious kickstart. 78 min: Esan Martsers misses the conversion, but the Tigers are leading 10-8 in the final moments of this compelling game. 77 min: Luke Brookes scores for the Tigers! The travelling supporters are ecstatic. 76 min: More pressure on Vunivalu, with an ugly bounce to deal with. Three minutes for the Tigers to salvage this game. 75 min: Suliasi Vunivalu fluffs the ball on the line. The Tigers are not giving up by any stretch and are giving it their all as the clock winds down to 80 minutes. 74 min: Forward pass from Billy Slater means no try to Melbourne. That would have ended the contest if it had been allowed. But the Tigers are still alive. 73 min: Big Sam Kasiano is off for a HIA and does not look too happy about it. Better be safe than sorry though, I reckon. 71 min: Smith scores again from a penalty. The Storm have done what the Roosters failed to do last week – take advantage of the Tigers being down to 12 men. This game has turned around since Matulino was sent to the sin bin, and the Storm have the lead for the first time in this game. 68 min: No mistake this time from Smith. They finally give up on the tap and go and take their penalty points. All square with just over 10 minutes to go. 65 min: And Cameron Smith misses the chance to level the game. That was a shockingly bad kick. 64 min: Suliasi Vunivalu touches down. Storm are back in the game, taking full advantage of having an extra man. 63 min: Ben Matulino is off. 61 min: Reader Bob Mills has been in touch by email: “Absolutely correct about St Patrick. But can we limit the stout puns - it’s too hot up here in the northern rivers to even think about it.” Believe it or not Bob, that pun was not intended! Might have been subconsciously though. I did spot it after I posted it. 60 min: Marshall kicks to touch again, slowing the game down with his side ahead, showing a cool head and great professionalism. What a player he is. What an asset to the Tigers. 59 min: Slater to Josh Addo-Carr, but he can’t hold it and the home side fluff their lines again. It’s looking like one of those nights for the Storm. 56 min: That man Esan Marsters scores again. I said earlier the Storm might regret not taking their penalty chances and that’s how it’s playing out. 55 min: More sustained pressure from the Tigers and they have another penalty. 53: Kevin Naiqama is off HIA after a heavy tackle. Elijah Taylor is on for him. 52 min: The Storm just cannot get any momentum going. Wests are playing like actual tigers. Literally. (OK, not literally.) 48 min: By the way, do not refer to this day as Paddy’s day. It’s St Patrick’s day, thank you. 47 min: This is real attritional play by the Tigers. They are defending well, attacking stoutly and taking their points when they can. And it’s working. 45 min: Storm’s management do not look happy at how this fame is going. I don’t blame them. 42 min: Nice kick from Cameron Munster for the Storm. His name intrigues me as that is the province of Ireland I’m from. Munster. Not Cameron. 41 min: Billy Slater’s 300th NRL game has been a bit quiet so far. He will desperately want to mark the occasion with a win though. The second half is almost upon us and for the second week running, Wests Tigers are defying the odds. 40 min: That man Masters scores another penalty, this one after the siren. What a strong finish to the half from the Tigers. I’ll be back presently. In the meantime I have some AFLW to take care of. 38 min: Esan Marsters scores from a penalty. No way were they going to do anything other than take their points. 37 min: Matt Eisenhuth is playing very well for the Tigers. But still no score. 36 min: Nine to four is the penalty count, so far. Storm having had the nine. 35 min: Thompson grounds the ball sufficiently to prevent the Storm from scoring a try. Boos around AAMI park, but it was the right decision. The Tigers will be happy to get to half-time without conceding. 33 min: The home crowd loudly boos Benji Marshall for wasting time with a penalty. Like he cares. 31 min: The clock is ticking towards half-time and both sides are desperate to get on the scoreboard. 30 min: If this was round ball football I’d describe it as real end to end stuff. But it’s not, so I’ll just say each side is getting a chance to attack, often due to errors by the other. 27 min: Marshall finds touch, taking the pressure off. Another scrum ensues. 26 min: Kenny Bromwich is on the field, playing his 100th NRL game. Long way to go before he catches Billy Slater, but congratulations to him. 23 min: We are more than halfway through the first half and still no score. Storm might now be rueing not taking easy points when they had the chance. 19 min: Benji Marshall kicks into the end and puts Storm under pressure. 18 min: Yet another scrum. Far more than you usually see. 17 min: Bit of biff between Brooks and Billy. I love alliteration. 16 min: Knock-on by Croft. He might have done better there, but it’s only his 7th game in the NRL. He’ll learn. 14 min: Great defence from Thompson saves a dangerous situation for the Tigers. This game is all about sharp defence so far. 11 min: Curtis Scott came close in the corner, held off by strong defence from the Tigers. That breaks what has been a relentless, but fruitless, few minutes by the Storm. 9 min: Another Storm penalty, and again they’d rather go for a try than take what would have been a relatively easy goal. They don’t get a try. 8 min: Storm got a penalty but chose not to go for an easy two points. They may regret that later. 6 min: Confusion among Melbourne’s back three could have let Tigers in, but they dodged a bullet and live to fight another day. 4 min: Good defending by the Storm stops the Tigers from sneaking in for a try. 3 min: Thompson is making headway as the Tigers make good use of having the ball. 1 min: A bright start from Storm. They do not want to be party poopers on Slater’s special day. We are under way in Melbourne. Slater runs through the banner with his kids Tyler and Jake. Tyler got a bit stuck, so Billy went back for him, natch. The Tigers are on the pitch. It’s almost game time. We are all waiting for Billy Slater. And here he is, to thunderous applause.

That’s two wins in a row for the Panthers, two losses in a row for the Rabbitohs. Storm trounced the Bulldogs 36-18 in the opening round last weekend, leaving them third on the ladder after the Dragons and Warriors, who also had comprehensive wins. That lends them to being firm favourites at home tonight, but as the Tigers showed last weekend in their unexpected win over the Roosters, sometimes the favourite comes second. Tonight’s game will be Billy Slater’s 300th NRL appearance. This is a very big deal. Hopefully he will not let the occasion hinder his usual game. On previous form, we do not have to worry about that. He is surely one of the greatest players the NRL has ever seen. Today, as I’m sure you are all aware, is St Patrick’s day.

Good evening league fans and welcome to the Melbourne Storm versus Wests Tigers live blog. While you’re waiting for me to write another scintillating post, remind yourself of the rugby league genius that is former Queensland premier Peter Beattie, aka the man who doesn’t know if the Cronulla team is called the Hawks, Seagulls or Sharks.

Tim Fischer, the former deputy prime minister and leader of the National party who alongside John Howard helped to pass landmark reforms after the 1996 Port Arthur massacre, says he believes a “wave” of firearm lobbying influenced by the US National Rifle Association is putting renewed pressure on Australian gun laws. Fischer told the Guardian he believed “NRA-inspired” lobbying coupled with the increased influence of rightwing parties such as One Nation in Canberra and the Shooters, Fishers and Farmers party in New South Wales had influenced a “pushback” against Australia’s gun laws, and called on politicians to stand up to pressure. “Waves of NRA-originated ideology do descend on Australia and have done since 1996,” he said. “I think we are seeing another wave of the NRA’s indirect influence descending on Australia at the federal and state levels [and] that’s deeply concerning to me.” Fischer’s warning comes in the context of an increasingly well-funded and organised gun lobby with ties to weapons importers and manufacturers. Last week the Guardian revealed that the home affairs minister, Peter Dutton, was considering establishing a committee to allow gun importers to review proposed changes to firearm regulations for “appropriateness and intent”. The proposal to establish the committee was put to Dutton during a private meeting with representatives from gun importer Nioa and the Shooting Industry Foundation of Australia (Sifa). A lobbying outfit whose directors include some of Australia’s largest gun dealers, Sifa has only five members and represents a departure from the membership-driven model of most shooting groups in Australia. But what it lacks in numbers it makes up for in funding and influence. Financial disclosures published with the Australian Securities and Investment Commission show that Sifa’s five members pumped $768,000 into the group in the 2016-17 financial year. Among the members is Robert Nioa, the managing director of the largest small arms importer in Australia. Aside from being a major donor to his father-in-law, the independent federal MP Bob Katter, Nioa’s company receives millions of dollars in defence contracts from the Australian government and Nioa himself is well connected politically. In December the defence industry minister, Christopher Pyne, attended the opening of his new office in Canberra, according to the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia. The federal lobbying register also lists Sifa as a client of Barton Deakin, a Liberal party-aligned lobbyist group. Barton Deakin’s federal director is Grahame Morris, a former chief of staff to Howard. When contacted by the Guardian on Friday, Morris said he had never heard of Sifa but after checking said a former consultant of Barton Deakin had done “some work” for the group. However, he said the group was no longer a client. “Do I want Australia’s gun laws changed? The answer is no,” Morris said. Earlier this month the Guardian reported that Australian pro-gun groups including Sifa pumped more than $500,000 into helping minor rightwing parties win seats in last year’s Queensland state election. Fischer said that while interventions such as Dutton’s were not “necessarily” a negative thing, the gun lobby’s motivations needed to be “watched closely”. “The whole point is that the core structure and content of the Howard gun reforms must not be done away with,” he said. “Creep and corrosion of the core of the gun law reforms is a danger.” While pointing to the pressure faced by Australia’s current politicians, he noted that he and Howard had faced fierce resistance to the changes in some parts of the country in 1996. “I got hung in effigy in Gympie, I got shouted at across the country but I did not take step back,” he said. “It was all pretty ugly, but 20 years on there have been no massacres and the case [in favour of the laws] rests pretty strongly.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/mar/16/this-south-australian-election-is-a-shemozzle-nobody-has-any-idea-what-is-going-to-happen","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-16T06:32:29Z","webTitle":"This South Australian election is a shemozzle!

The mortgage broking company was criticised on Friday for its lax compliance processes concerning the fraudulent behaviour of four of its brokers between 2013 and 2016, one of whom was first flagged as a potential problem because more than half of his loans were going to Westpac. The commission heard that Westpac home loans up to a certain loan-to-value ratio only required a letter of employment from applicants, with no other supporting documentation, such as payslips. After at least two brokers were terminated for falsifying letters of employment in several loan applications, Aussie Home Loans began reviewing brokers who were sending a high proportion of their loans to Westpac. The senior counsel assisting the commission, Rowena Orr, asked Lynda Harris, Aussie Home Loans’ general manager of people and culture, if this was because “Aussie had formed the view that Westpac had credit assessment processes that were more lax”. Harris said “if they were just requiring a letter of employment, as opposed to payslips, that would be something that brokers would become aware of. Westpac had a policy that it was going to be easier to provide necessary documentation.” Orr asked, “Is a letter of employment easier to falsify?” Harris agreed it would be. “So there was a greater risk of fraud at Westpac?” Harris responded, “if a broker is putting a substantial majority of loans to one lender, that is a trigger to investigate.” Aussie Home Loans came under fire for repeatedly “outsourcing” its compliance obligations and responses to its brokers’ misconduct, in Orr’s words. The senior counsel’s questioning revealed that in all but one of the four cases of broker misconduct examined by the commission on Friday, Aussie Home Loans did not inform the regulator, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (Asic), of their wrongdoing or the circumstances of their departure. The fraudulent behaviour of former Aussie brokers Shiv Sahay and Emma Khalil were not picked up by Aussie itself, but by the lender, which Orr suggested showed Aussie’s processes were insufficient at the time. Of the four brokers whose activities were examined by the commission on Friday, three of the brokers – Shiv Sahay, Emma Khalil and Madhvan Nair – were later convicted, and the fourth, Bernard Meehan was banned by Asic. Aussie only terminated the contracts of the brokers after the lending bank had concluded there had been fraud, and it did not tell clients of three of those brokers that they had been fired for misconduct, just that they had “left”. This included a family who were facing the loss of a baby while their loan fell through due to the misconduct of Sahay. Sahay had sold them a higher-value loan on the incorrect basis that they were eligible for the first home buyer’s grant, and the family had already paid out a significant sum to their builder when the loan collapsed. Further, Aussie did not report the brokers’ behaviour to the police or even in some cases to the professional association of which they were members, the Mortgage and Finance Association of Australia, in breach of their compliance obligations which they certified annually to Asic. It was only after Asic later pursued the brokers that fraud charges were laid. Harris confirmed that Aussie sometimes kept the trail commission of loans brokered by fraudulent brokers, saying it was up to the relevant lender to revoke the commission. The commission had heard on Thursday from the Commonwealth Bank that the structure of brokers’ trailing commissions – which last for a customer’s entire home-loan term – created a conflict of interest by incentivising brokers to sign customers up for longer-term, higher-interest loans. But Aussie Home Loans’ chief financial officer, Giles Boddy, said the company did not support any change to the way brokers are paid, and that he believed Aussie’s arrears were no worse than the banks’ at around 1%. Harris and Boddy told the commission that Aussie Home Loans, now a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Commonwealth Bank, had been working to strengthen its risk assessments and fraud detection processes since its former brokers’ fraud was uncovered. The hearing continues."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/mar/12/why-people-not-walk-up-down-on-escalators","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-12T12:15:10Z","webTitle":"Why do people no longer walk up or down on escalators?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/mar/12/why-people-not-walk-up-down-on-escalators","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/mar/12/why-people-not-walk-up-down-on-escalators","fields":{"headline":"Why do people no longer walk up or down on escalators?","bodyText":"Why do people no longer (with the exception of those using the London Underground) walk up or down on escalators?

It was a perfectly sensible model by which they understood the universe. The important word here is “model”. At the time, almost everyone thought that this was accurate. As with our contemporary idea of gender, the model closely matched the observation of physical “reality”. The philosophers and theologians of the middle ages believed that the sun went around the Earth and that to suggest otherwise was heretical, ungodly and just really, really stupid. Imagine scholars of that age writing on the internet about new theories that the Earth went around the sun – these opinions would read a lot like most of the comments we get today about gender. Basically: “This is just ignoring common sense”; “What is the world coming to?” and “Let’s burn these queer freaks.” Which they did. The middle-ages model was based on the principles of Ptolemy, and hundreds of years of celestial observation. Everything worked perfectly well until Copernicus and Galileo gave us the new and exciting heliocentric model. Copernican thought was revolutionary, but then we had Newton, and then Einstein, Bohr and Hawking. We keep observing the universe, and we keep changing the model to fit the observation, not ignoring the data that doesn’t fit. We could also still use geocentrism if we wanted – we would be able to predict solar and lunar eclipses, roughly, but nothing would work properly. The model of male and female is based on thousands of years of observation of genitalia and the binary qualities of sexual attraction and reproduction. Those were the externally observable facts. They correlated. And, yes, we could remain happy with that. But now we are gathering observations from people who feel profoundly uncomfortable presenting as the gender they are classified in. We know that somewhere between 0.3% and 0.5% of the world’s population experience gender dysphoria and don’t feel they “fit” with a binary model. Are millions of such people wrong? Or is the current model wrong? I identify as trans and bisexual – except that bisexual implies you like both sexes. I’ve recently realised I can’t really call myself that: I’m running out of sexual identities because they all rely on this idea that humans are either one kind or the other – gay or straight. I am attracted to all kinds of human, beyond narrow binaries of sexuality and gender. A “single spectrum of human” is an idea that we already apply to race, neurology, and other aspects of life: we are all human, all humans are equal, all humans are different. Many indigenous and non-western cultures have long acknowledged this. Trans identity is not new – it is only a surprise because we suppressed it for so long. People learn to hide it from early childhood, and from themselves. We have a cultural precedent here as well, with left-handedness. Being a “southpaw” was considered pathological and untrustworthy all the way into the 20th century. Yet when it became acceptable, many more people became lefties, because they were hiding their left-handedness to begin with. This was most immediately visible in the classroom, where a new generation no longer had to hide their aberrant ability. We even had ambidextrous people. When stigma was reduced, kids were the first to discover it was OK to be left-handed – or both. This correlates to what we see today with trans. Amazingly there are ways in which left-handers are still stigmatised and discriminated against in areas such as design, often in unconscious ways. It is very hard to rid ourselves of an incumbent model and structural bias. Changing our idea of gender is more challenging because we resemble the men who opposed the Copernican revolution: our society is heavily invested in the binary model that we believe to be true. It is much easier to disenfranchise people who break from the norm, or to say that millions of people are mentally ill (whatever that means), than to accept the existence of transgender people as evidence that our current model is flawed. The ancient model that divides us into two distinct “sexes” is deeply ingrained. As a trans person, I prefer an “all human” model: we all identify individually. We should accept this. If we have to adjust the words we use or build our toilets differently, then we should. I cannot believe that kids should be suicidal because I, as a taxpayer, don’t want schools to change some of their facilities. We know that isn’t the true reason for resistance. It’s because we don’t want to believe the model is broken. We don’t like change. These are structural things. It is this fear of change that manifests in our newspapers each week as a desire for trans people not to exist at all. You may still think, “Well, that’s fine, clearly you do exist – but men are men and women are women.” Which is OK. You are exercising the right to your own beliefs, and to treat people differently based on those beliefs. That’s called a prejudice and acting upon it is called discrimination. For transgender people, prejudice is often tolerated if unspoken, and yet that is changing. The progress of civilisation has mirrored the slow erosion of “commonsense” prejudices. The sun doesn’t go around the Earth, the colour of your skin does not indicate your intelligence, “women” should not be paid less than “men” for the same work. People occupy a broad circular spectrum of behaviours that are boyish, girlish, or something else altogether. Everyone is an individual human. How each of us define ourselves should be our own choice. Spreading that idea is up to everyone. • Tea Uglow is creative director of Google’s Creative Lab in Sydney.

It is a list of clinical trials, academic papers, cutting-edge treatments I could try if my cancer ever comes back. To know my disease, I reason, is to beat it. In that regard, I understand my genetic status and how that could affect my chances with various immunotherapy drugs. I know the name of a good surgeon in Germany who has had excellent results. Should my cancer come back, I have a plan, an exit strategy that isn’t death. When my father was told he had a terminal brain tumour, he thanked the doctor and went for a walk across the dunes with my mother. They sat in a cafe and drank coffee. Dad had a tuna and sweetcorn sandwich on white bread, a treat he allowed himself instead of his usual brown. Over the next few days and weeks, Dad didn’t spend his time frantically Googling treatment options. He didn’t launch a GoFundMe campaign to pay for expensive treatment in America. He just accepted the doctor’s verdict. It wasn’t ideal, he said, the brain tumour, the terminal diagnosis, but there was nothing that could be done. Three months later, he died. Since his death – and since my own experience with bowel cancer a few months after he died – I have been haunted by a question. Could Dad – and we as a family – have done anything to save his life? It began with little blackouts, which the doctors thought were epileptic fits. They happened at night, and sometimes when he was running. When they found the tumour on a scan, they thought it was slow-growing, but Dad knew something wasn’t right. The second scan confirmed what Dad suspected. It was a glioblastoma, the widow-maker of brain tumours. It was in the brain stem and couldn’t be removed by surgery. Radiotherapy was an option, but the doctor said it would be gruelling and might only give him a little more time. Dad was adamant. Thanks, but no thanks, he said, as if he had been receiving well-meaning but unwanted investment advice. Would I have accepted the doctor’s verdict in the same way? A tuna sandwich and a coffee. A walk across the dunes. My case was different, of course. I had a dull, commonplace, and treatable cancer, with a much rosier prognosis (about a 30% chance of death over five years) than Dad’s aggressive brain tumour. While Dad’s cancer was the Spetsnaz special forces, mine was the catering corp. But still. Still. When I had cancer, I learned the power of patient advocacy. I joined support groups and discussion forums on Facebook. Patients shared information about treatment options, interesting clinical trials: does anyone know a good doctor in New York who does laser treatment for lung metastases? Would hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy and surgery be too much for an 84-year-old? Some of the stories were astounding. There were people who were told there was nothing the doctors could do, only to get a second or third opinion and have their lives saved by a clinical trial. There were people who paid for treatment abroad and came home cancer-free. Could Dad have done the same? A few years after Dad died, I asked Mum why they placed so much faith in the doctors. I wondered about the fog of trauma, whether it had in any way impaired our collective judgment as a family. Doctors often recommend that cancer patients take notes or bring someone else with them for their appointments – especially the ones when they might be giving bad news. It’s good advice. You can enter a kind of dream state, the doctor’s words drifting over you, as if they were being said by someone else. Afterwards, punch-drunk, it can be hard to remember the details. Why didn’t Dad seek a second opinion, I asked my mother? I trod carefully, concerned she would think I was being critical rather than just curious, not wanting to make her feel that I thought she could have done more. She didn’t need to think about her answer. Why would they question the consultant, she said? All their lives they had had excellent doctors and healthcare on the NHS. Why would it be any different now? A few months before Dad’s terminal diagnosis, Mum had a heart attack. In rural Cornwall, the ambulance arrived in nine minutes and she was whisked to a specialist heart unit. “We had no reason not to believe the doctors,” she said. Since Dad’s death, I have done what I never did at the time. I have researched what killed him. Glioblastoma multiforme. I read the internet forums of the newly diagnosed. I looked at various treatment options, promising clinical trials on the horizon. Cancer treatment is full of what-ifs. We second-guess ourselves, our doctors. We doubt the choices we have made. What if we had pursued a second line of chemotherapy? The internet has complicated this already murky picture, changing the balance of power between doctor and patient. For better or worse, doctors, the old gatekeepers, no longer have a monopoly on medical knowledge. The democratisation of information can be a patient’s best friend, a path to advocacy and self-awareness. But as anyone who has ever Googled themselves into an early grave after experiencing a mild headache, it can be their worst enemy. While I was researching Dad’s disease, it became clear that his decision, like everything he did in his life, was rational and sound. The cancer that he had, in the place that he had it, carried a dismal prognosis. Yes, some people survived, but only very rarely. Most, like him, succumbed to their disease. Perhaps he could have got a few more months if he’d done something differently. Perhaps I could have convinced him to keep a file on his computer, just as I did, or sold him on a maverick cancer doctor in Singapore. But that wasn’t what he wanted. And Dad always knew what he wanted from life. He knew what made him happy. Spending time with his family, listening to the radio. Warming up from a run with a hot coffee. Walking on the cliffs with my mother and their dog. Endlessly tinkering with his computer in the study. Dad chose to die as he had lived: without fuss and without wanting to unduly trouble those he loved. He didn’t want to waste what precious time he had left trying to live longer. He wanted to see people rather than hospital wards. He went to visit old friends for lots of last suppers. He went with his mates from the Tandem Club for one last ride. While I was researching the tumour that cruelly cut short his life, I realised something else. My desire to find out whether Dad could have done something, whether he could have done more to save or extend his life, was not about him, it was about me. It was about my refusal to let go, my anger that he – my beloved father – was taken long before his time. • Luke Allnutt’s We Own The Sky is published by Trapeze at £14.99.

America’s medical profession broadly welcomed the idea and began to ask patients routinely how much pain they were in. The same year, the US drug company Purdue Pharma began aggressively marketing a new type of prescription narcotic painkiller, OxyContin, that it claimed was less prone to abuse or dependency than the morphine it mimicked, because it came in the form of slow-release pills. But these events set the stage for the opioid crisis that unfolded – and persists – currently killing more than 60,000 Americans a year. Prescriptions began flying off pads in doctors’ offices all over the country, as a class of drug traditionally associated with war wounds, post-surgical acute pain or patients dying of cancer became a routine treatment for chronic conditions like back pain or osteoarthritis. Now US experts, including leading members of the American Pain Society (APS), are declaring in the strongest terms yet that opioids are not the answer for chronic pain. For chronic conditions, “Opioids shouldn’t be on the table to begin with,” said Mark Jensen, editor of the group’s in-house publication, the Journal of Pain, and professor of rehabilitation at the University of Washington, Seattle. “There is no evidence that opioids are helpful. The evidence is they should be offered rarely, if ever.” A year-long study from the Veterans Health Administration, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association (Jama) earlier this month, concluded that opioids were no more effective against common forms of back and joint pain than acetaminophen, the active drug in brands like Tylenol. Lead author Erin Krebs wrote that “the results do not support initiation of opioid therapy”. Groups of military veterans recruited from primary care clinics were given different forms of painkillers. “Treatment with opioids was not superior to treatment with non-opioid medications for improving pain-related function over 12 months,” the report said. Pain accounts for more than half of primary care visits in the US, according to the Department of Health. The problem, APS leaders told the Guardian this week, is that opioids merely block pain without treating its source. Many experts now recommend a multi-disciplinary approach, such as physical and sometimes psychological therapies, before turning to prescriptions. But as medical experts shrink from opioids, “there’s no rationality” to the way that is being implemented, says the outgoing APS president, David Williams, a psychologist at University of Michigan. And that drives people to the black market and street drugs like heroin and fentanyl. “Are we throwing the baby out with the bathwater?” asked Mark Sullivan, a psychiatrist at the University of Washington in a January research article. Opioid painkillers , such as OxyContin or the many other brand and generic versions that also became bestsellers, do nothing to alleviate the underlying cause of the pain, says Dr John Loeser,an APS member, also at the University of Washington. “In the chronic pain world everything is [about] function, so it doesn’t matter what the person says, it matters what the person is capable of doing. With opioids you can usually make people say they feel better, but they’re not functionally better. “We always knew this,” Loeser continues, “but in the 1990s, drug companies came up with patentable opioids, and physicians, who get almost no education about pain in medical school, fell for the marketing.” Many physiciansabandoned long-held cautions around opioids. When the APS president, James Campbell, recommended in his 1996 address to the society using a numeric scale for patients to tell doctors how much pain they were in it was intended for use in hospitals. But the recommendation leached out to America’s primary care physicians. In 2000, the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations, a not-for-profit healthcare accreditation body, followed by the Veterans Health Administration, picked up the trend, asserting that physicians must respect patient self-reporting of pain, which routinely came to mean a prescription for a narcotic painkiller. According to a study in the Harvard Law &amp; Policy Review: “Purdue Pharma successfully contributed to and capitalized on the medical establishment’s changing view of pain management.” But in 2016, the Joint Commission reversed its position, stating it “does not endorse pain as a vital sign”. In November 2017 four West Virginia cities filed a class-action lawsuit against the commission, alleging that it issued pain management standards in 2001 that downplayed the dangers of opioids. “The concern back in the mid-90s was underdiagnosis and undertreatment of pain, and the Joint Commission really made a campaign out of it … and the healthcare profession adopted the mantra,” says Roger Fillingim, director of the pain research center at the University of Florida and a past APS president. And it was lucrative for doctors, as well as corporations. In a Cleveland Clinic Journal of Medicine essay in 2016, editor Brian Mandell reported: “Step forward in time, and pain control has become a measure of patient satisfaction, and … can be linked to reimbursement.” Simply put, a pain-free patient is a satisfied customer who is more likely to choose that doctor again. Opioids effectively became a marketing tool for a doctor to win the custom of the mighty American consumer. Americans do not suffer more pain than other nationalities. But they consume prescription opioids at a greater rate than any other population, according to research published in the Washington Post. And the very American combination of a world-leading, profit-driven pharmaceutical business, a domineering health insurance industry and a finely tuned consumer culture created the perfect storm. One of the shifts now taking place, Fillingim believes, is from the rights of the individual patient to what’s best for society, which, in the face of a national opioid crisis, are no longer synonymous. “There’s no such thing as a free lunch,” Fillingim says. But the difficulty with transitioning from treating pain with opioids to a multi-disciplinary approach, involving costly and slower-acting, non-pharmaceutical therapies, is that no one wants to pay for it, says the APS’s Williams. So what about that 1996 APS recommendation? “There was a misunderstanding about what pain levels are used for,” says Williams. “Pain levels are used to monitor for intervention and an improvement in function, they’re not absolute thresholds for throwing drugs at patients. There’s a need to assess pain but how you treat it is the issue.” And, 22 years on, what does the APS’s Loeser see now when he looks out across an America suffering the pain of addiction and death? “A disaster with no end in sight,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"small-business-network/2018/mar/19/how-to-make-better-decisions","type":"article","sectionId":"small-business-network","sectionName":"Guardian Small Business Network","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-19T11:59:11Z","webTitle":"How to make better decisions","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/small-business-network/2018/mar/19/how-to-make-better-decisions","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/small-business-network/2018/mar/19/how-to-make-better-decisions","fields":{"headline":"How to make better decisions","bodyText":"It is estimated that an adult makes about 35,000 remotely conscious decisions each day. Some of these are inconsequential. But others will have a huge bearing on our personal and professional lives. In the film Sliding Doors, Gwyneth Paltrow’s character would have had a completely different life if she had missed her train. If we multiply the number of life-changing decisions we make – where should I live, should I get married or not, should I change my job and so on – by the number of alternatives for each decision, we end up with something in the region of 10m potential lives. Given the number of decisions we make, and their potential significance, you might presume we’re good at it. But this is an illusion. The ability to make good decisions is not inborn. Fifty years of research in the fascinating field of behavioural decision science has demonstrated that we are all subject to many cognitive and motivational traps, which are known as biases. Don’t just think about the result At a Guardian Business Made Simple event in Manchester last month, I explained how you need to be aware of three traps in particular. The first is outcome bias. We tend not to draw a distinction between the process of making a decision, and the result. We judge the quality of the decision based on the outcome. But in a world of uncertainty the only thing we can control is the process. Consider an archer taking aim at a target with a bow and arrow. The archer has no control over whether the arrow hits the target, but they can control their actions – for example, they can practise, perfect their technique and develop their competitive experience. Of course, something might distract the archer, a loud noise nearby for example, and they miss. But focusing on the quality of the decision-making process is more likely to lead to a good result. Consider the problem from different perspectives The second biggest trap people can fall into is “narrow framing”, which means only giving a partial answer to the question: “What problem are we trying to solve? Why? Why now?” This is a crucial step in making good decisions. Indeed, Albert Einstein highlighted the importance of framing, and reportedly said: “If I had an hour to solve a problem, I’d spend 55 minutes thinking about the problem and five minutes thinking about solutions.” We all tend to simplify and interpret reality based on our experience, professional training and personal values. We each bring unique perspectives to a problem. But there’s a risk we adopt a narrow definition of the problem and neglect some important features. For example, human resources specialists may see a problem as an organisational or people issue, while engineers may see the same situation as a systems or technology issue. Avoid the problem of a narrow frame by developing a perspective in collaboration with others. This will enhance your understanding of the decision/ problem/opportunity and help you make sure you are not missing important concerns. Also, be aware of the “comfort zone” – we sometimes drag a decision that is strategic and complex into a category that we are familiar with, in which we may have solved a problem in the past. We apply the same reasoning and solve the wrong problem. Make sure you know all your objectives Finally, make sure you know what your objectives are when you’re making a decision. It has been shown that we often generate about half of the objectives that we later recognise as relevant for our decision. Ask yourself: “How would the ideal solution to this problem look?” This will help you to identify the positive features you would like to achieve. Then ask yourself: “How would a bad solution to this problem look?” This will help you identify the negative features you would like to avoid or minimise.

France’s capital is, like any other major city, a place with a radical spread of haves and have nots. What it looks like now, the nature of its living history and how it is under threat from gentrification and other market forces are the subjects of Hazan’s new study, which follows a walk across Paris from south to north, along “the Paris meridian”. In a review of Hazan’s essential and encyclopedic The Invention of Paris, published in 2002, Julian Barnes described the author as a “bookish psychogeographer, rescuing historian and committed Benjaminic flâneur; he is memory, conscience and scourge”. But where The Invention of Paris stayed within the périphérique that contains the 20 arrondissements of Paris, this book begins and ends in the banlieue, or suburbs, on a long walk from one community bookshop in Ivry in the south to another in Saint Denis in the north. The notion of Paris as “mummified and museum-ified”, Hazan writes, is “completely false”. Though he walks it end to end, even through the very heart of the historic city, he manages to remain in predominantly working class areas. As he wrote in his 2011 Paris Sous Tension (Paris Under Stress), the revolutionary quality of Paris is unchanged; the city remains “the great field of battle of the civil war in France between the aristocrats and sans-culottes – no matter what we may call them today”. What does the working class city look like today? The cafes and restaurants are not part of chains, but places where you can chat with the owner. The Métro stations are dirty and dilapidated; there are a lot of police and very few ATMs. Shops where you can wire money are plentiful, as are cheap supermarkets. Above all, the people you see come from the many corners of the Earth: “The cafes are Kabyle, the tabacs are Chinese, and the PMU betting shops always packed. On Wednesdays, groups of children set out on excursions, and whites are a minority in their multicoloured ranks.” The people, Hazan concludes, “have not lost the battle of Paris”. Though he provides a wonderful array of primary sources describing the various uprisings the city has seen, Hazan’s other points of reference are overwhelmingly male (and white). He himself is aware of it: “Breton, Benjamin, Nerval, Balzac, Chateaubriand – perhaps my references lack variety. But there is nothing I can do about it, this is my paper family, as good as any other.” This kind of excuse doesn’t fit with his politics, which are otherwise devoted to the downtrodden and the underdog. We don’t get to choose our families, true, but Hazan doesn’t seem to realise that he is replicating a form of power that makes those authors the go-to people when writing about Paris, and the bourgeois male viewpoint on the city the dominant one. He finds room for film-makers such as Claude Autant-Lara, Jean-Luc Godard and Jean Rouch, but strolls through Montparnasse without giving Agnès Varda so much as a namecheck (Roger Ebert called her Saint Agnès of Montparnasse). If you want to see how the Rue Mouffetard was once working class, check out Varda’s short essay-film L’Opéra-Mouffe. Walking through the 10th arrondissement Hazan does not omit reference to Thomas Clerc’s important book on that area, but walking through La Chapelle, a little to the north, there’s no mention of Anna-Louise Milne’s 75, which excavates the area’s history and attempts at rehabilitating a small street near there. The best moments in this book are those of personal writing, in which Hazan remembers the days when he worked as a cardiovascular surgeon. This backstory lends his walk a delightful specificity: he cannot pass a hospital without musing over someone who used to work there, or reflecting on the idiosyncrasies of the old system or the way the big business of even a state-run hospital system leads to the closure of small specialist hospitals, instead of “improving them to meet local needs”. Perhaps this scientific background explains why this is not a lyrical walk through Paris: Hazan rarely stops to analyse or ruminate. He is stacking up observations, practising psychic surgery on the capital, turning back a layer of skin to reveal the workings beneath. An ardent student of the anatomy of the city, Hazan is a keen observer with a remarkable memory: despite his limitations, he has written an unmissable account of Paris’s unique and defiant physiognomy.

It has been five years since Yoselyn Ortega, a nanny for a family in Manhattan, stabbed to death two of her three charges, and the trial is to establish if she knew what she was doing. Ortega’s lawyers argue she is not guilty by reason of insanity. In 2016, the case provided the basis for Leïla Slimani’s best-selling novel, titled Lullaby in the UK and The Perfect Nanny in the US, which opens with a scene of carnage in a Paris flat similar to the one Marina Krim encountered on returning home to her apartment in 2012 to find her children dead in the bath and their caregiver stabbing herself in the neck. To read coverage of both the book and the original crime is to understand that this is not the story of one family’s tragedy but of the assumed relationship between two women, a dynamic in which many other women are implicated. Before the trial, prospective jurors were asked if they had ever hired a nanny, or themselves acted as caregivers, and many of those who said yes were dismissed. Prosecutors claimed Ortega was motivated by resentment of her employer – by which they meant Marina Krim, not her husband, Kevin. Two years ago, when the New Yorker ran a piece about the incredibly tough lives of immigrant babysitters in New York, it was headlined “Mother For Hire”, a double meaning in which, once again, fathers in families that employ nannies were left blissfully unimplicated. Meanwhile, reviews of the Slimani novel described the horror of a nanny murdering her charges as “a working mother’s nightmare”. What has been particularly striking are slips in the care taken to absolve Marina Krim of blame. She is entirely blameless; there is no suggestion she was an improper employer. Nonetheless, the judgments are there. “Though Ms Krim did not work outside the home, Mr Krim’s parents said, they wanted a nanny to help out.” This is a line from an early report in the New York Times and the “though” in that sentence is extraordinary. Marina Krim’s father-in-law also told a journalist that his son’s wife “didn’t have a nanny so she could go out and play tennis – not that there’s anything wrong with that”, but because three kids is a lot of work and she needed an extra pair of hands. When Marina Krim testified last Friday, defence lawyers quizzed her about demands she made on the nanny, zeroing in on seemingly trivial domestic disputes until, after seven hours of testimony, she started to weep and said: “I’m sorry about this. I don’t understand. I don’t know what she was fishing for.” The defence lawyers were fishing for blame, and it is a powerful temptation: without blame, what happened is too terrifyingly random to bear; and if we can’t blame Marina Krim for provoking her children’s murder, we will blame her for hiring a nanny in the first place. • Emma Brockes is a New York-based columnist for the Guardian"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/2018/mar/09/power-to-the-people-but-which-people","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-09T12:00:35Z","webTitle":"Power to the people!

The complaint is that three decades of giddy globalisation has marginalised ordinary people. Instead of people owning money, these days money owns people – the land, housing and cities they live in, the ideas and political systems that govern them. So this week we went looking for cases where the people are fighting back, trying to reclaim their land, their communities, their democracies. In northern Brazil, Dominic Phillips found a happy story: after a 23-year struggle, 500 descendants of enslaved people were finally given title to their 220,000-hectare Amazon land. Half the world away, European tourism bosses in Berlin were debating new ideas to try to combat overtourism. The two stories, though very different, touch on the same theme: how do you protect the rights of locals from the vast unaccountable force of global capital? It’s a theme we will return to. There’s a certain feeling, post-Brexit/Trump that some people have fallen out of love with democracy too. Certainly both shock results were partly ascribed to protest votes by people who felt that democracy didn’t serve them well any more. So it may be that it’s time for democracy to raise its game. That’s certainly what happened in Ireland, where a one-off assembly of 99 ordinary people broke the deadlock in the abortion debate and paved the way for a referendum this spring. In the week in which the terms of the plebiscite were set out, Patrick Chalmers looked back at what the assembly achieved – and what it promises for other democracies. Watch his video report here.

We also smiled while reading about female trailblazers you’ve never heard of.

In Germany, where unions’ push for flexible working rights is gaining momentum. From January 2019, workers represented by the metalworkers union will have the option to reduce their working week to 28 hours for a total of two years – and claim the right to full-time employment afterwards. The idea that flexible working is not just an inconvenience imposed on employers but a right that unions should demand for their workers is beginning to spread to other sectors of the German economy, and IG Metall has called on Germany’s new government to enshrine the right to return to full-time employment in law.

His other novels seem more accessible but I always return to Jude. The book that changed my mind Elbow Room by James Alan McPherson. It’s a collection of difficult stories and McPherson did not make any attempt to make them less difficult or challenging for readers. The book helps me understand Emily Dickinson’s statement of feeling “as if the top of my head were taken off”. The last book that made me cry This Real Night by Rebecca West. I was at an airport when I read the last 50 pages and I wept unabashedly – and I’m a dry-eyed reader in general. The last book that made me laugh I Pose by Stella Benson.

You’ve been sharing your thoughts. ‘The only people suggesting austerity measures were doing so on ideological grounds’ I remember when austerity was first spewed forth it was sold as economic necessity. This seemed counter to what I knew about economic theory so I spent 4 months reading nothing but books on economics (thanks Lancaster University). From what I found, the actual best evidenced reaction to the crisis of 2008 would be to encourage economic activity and ensure that consumers were able to be active economically. The only people suggesting the austerity measures were doing so on ideological grounds and the only economic theories proposing it were untested hypotheses by, again, ideologically driven ideas.

I expected tales of visits to all the usual tourist traps along with photos, so when we met up following the holiday I inquired as to how they had enjoyed their sojourn in England, London to be exact. He said they had the absolute best time and that unlike the middle east, there was no shortage of good, wholesome Nigerian food to be had in their holiday locale. I was stunned into silence when he told me they’d spent 4-weeks in Peckham and were disappointed that the food wasn’t available all over the capital and thus hadn’t travelled too far from there. snakeandpygmypie Comments have been edited for length.

Scientists carried out tests on 125 amateur cyclists aged 55 to 79 and compared them with healthy adults from a wide age group who did not exercise regularly. The findings, outlined in two papers in the journal Aging Cell, showed that the cyclists preserved muscle mass and strength with age while maintaining stable levels of body fat and cholesterol. In men, testosterone levels remained high. More surprisingly, the anti-ageing effects of cycling appeared to extend to the immune system. An organ called the thymus, which makes immune cells called T-cells, normally starts to shrink from the age of 20. But the thymuses of older cyclists were found to be generating as many T-cells as those of young people. Prof Janet Lord, director of the Institute of Inflammation and Ageing at the University of Birmingham, said: “Hippocrates in 400BC said that exercise is man’s best medicine, but his message has been lost over time and we are an increasingly sedentary society. “However, importantly, our findings debunk the assumption that ageing automatically makes us more frail. Our research means we now have strong evidence that encouraging people to commit to regular exercise throughout their lives is a viable solution to the problem that we are living longer but not healthier.” Male cyclists taking part in the study had to be able to cycle 100km in under 6.5 hours, while women had to cover 60km in 5.5 hours. The non-exercising group consisted of 75 healthy people aged 57 to 80 and 55 young adults aged 20 to 36. Many other studies have also shown the remarkable health benefits of cycling. A study published in the BMJ last April found that regular cycling cut the risk of death from all causes by more than 40%, and cut the risk of cancer and heart disease by 45%. Experts also believe cycling boosts riders’ mental health, with multiple studies finding that those who commute by bicycle are happier and less prone to depression than those who use any other form of transport. A recent report from cycling and walking charity Sustrans also found that cycling does not just benefit an individual’s health but that of society as a whole, estimating that if Britain were to reach government targets for walking and cycling, the country would save about £9.3bn and reduce deaths from air pollution by more than 13,000 over the next decade. Prof Stephen Harridge, director of the Centre of Human &amp; Aerospace Physiological Sciences at King’s College London, said: “The findings emphasise the fact that the cyclists do not exercise because they are healthy, but that they are healthy because they have been exercising for such a large proportion of their lives. “Their bodies have been allowed to age optimally, free from the problems usually caused by inactivity. Remove the activity and their health would likely deteriorate.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"business/2018/mar/18/great-british-chef-shortage-eating-out-under-threat-brexit","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-18T11:30:06Z","webTitle":"The great British chef shortage: why eating out is under threat","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/mar/18/great-british-chef-shortage-eating-out-under-threat-brexit","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/mar/18/great-british-chef-shortage-eating-out-under-threat-brexit","fields":{"headline":"The great British chef shortage: why eating out is under threat","bodyText":"It was, says chef patron Alexis Gauthier, “not the last resort”, but almost. Last September, he needed to fill three positions at his central London restaurant, Gauthier Soho: a pastry chef; a chef de partie, to head up one of the stations in the kitchen; and a sommelier. Gauthier has held a Michelin star since 2011, but that is not enough of an enticement in an age where new restaurants seem to open every hour and there are not enough trained chefs and waiters to go round. Gauthier, a 44-year-old from Provence, decided to sweeten the deal: the winning candidates would each receive a £1,000 “golden handshake” in return for committing to work for one year. The unusual offer received some industry press and Gauthier, who has worked in London for 20 years, was pleased with the response. There were some strong applicants and all the spots were taken up within two weeks. Six months on, I check in with Gauthier: how are they getting on? “All three did not last,” he sighs. “One left after a week. The other two left after two and three months.” Each had their reasons: one chef went home to France, the other returned to Italy and the sommelier decided to go back to studying oenology. Gauthier doesn’t take the rejection personally and prides himself on being a fair boss. “I used to be an employee for many years myself, so the day I became an employer I did not want to be a bastard,” he says. Gauthier pays his staff comparatively well: they also receive a private pension, health insurance and each has access to a research and development fund, for trying out other restaurants and bakeries, that pays out between £250 and £1,000 a month per person, depending on experience. One pâtissier and sommelier saved up their stipends and went to eat at Eleven Madison Avenue in New York. Gauthier says: “We try to make sure they can develop their professional career with our help.” That, however, does not seem to be enough in 2018. In one way, Gauthier concedes that he is lucky: he is first and foremost a chef, so if he is one or two down in the kitchen – which is the case most days – he can fill in. Gauthier Soho does around 100 covers a day (50 for lunch, 50 for dinner) and, if really stretched, he can remove one dish from the menu and the quality of the service is not compromised. “As an employer, as a businessman, the sun is shining,” he says wryly. “I can work the extra hours and it’s more money in a way for me! But it’s unsustainable.” Gauthier is out of ideas about what to do next. “I swear,” he huffs, “if I’d given a £10,000 bonus, it would still be the same.” This is, most agree, a golden age for eating out in Britain: never before has such a high quality of food been so widely available. This boom, though, is threatened by a chronic shortage of chefs and waiting staff. The hospitality industry is responsible for six million jobs, making it the UK’s fourth biggest employer. But this notoriously precarious business appears to be more topsy-turvy than ever. For every heartening headline: “Record 44 new restaurants set to open across London in September,” from the Evening Standard in September, 2017; there’s a depressing one: “Number of UK restaurants going bust up by a fifth in 2017” from the Guardian last month. The situation, post-Brexit, will only become more complicated. The British Hospitality Association, with help from accountancy firm KPMG, published a report last year which suggests that the sector is staring into a recruitment black hole without EU nationals to bail them out: by 2029, the industry could have a deficit of more than a million workers. The report recommended that the industry will need to find at least another 60,000 workers per year on top of the 200,000 required “to replace churn and to power growth”. Of course, 2029 is a way off, but the pinch is being felt now, according to Adam Hyman from Code Hospitality, a consultancy on restaurants and recruitment. “Every single restaurant in London is constantly looking for people – and good people.” He tells of a London private members’ club whose head of recruitment went out to Australia last year to find chefs. Although the problem is perhaps being felt most keenly in London – where KPMG found that 25% of chefs and 75% of the waiting staff were from continental Europe – it is a nationwide concern, one that predates Brexit. Josh Overington took over Le Cochon Aveugle in York four years ago and won over diners and critics with his thoughtful take on classic French cooking. Yet, ever since opening, the 30-year-old Overington – who represented the north-east in 2017’s Great British Menu – cannot recall more than a week here or there when Le Cochon Aveugle has been fully staffed. “It’s been a constant struggle to find chefs,” he says. “We’re a very small restaurant, we can fit four chefs in at one time, and the chef de partie” – number three in the chain of command – “has, in particular, been an elusive position. We’ve had long periods where it’s not filled, and it’s still not filled even as we speak.” As for the causes of the chef shortage, he says there are a number of factors. “A lot of it is young chefs don’t have any patience. They just want to go straight to sous chef, head chef. Or they can sign up for an agency or work in a private home and the pay is better, the hours are better, you’re not being shouted at. You don’t really have any responsibilities and life is a lot better.” Agency chefs are becoming a controversial – but indispensable – part of the restaurant food chain, filling in the holes when they arise. A recent report on the Big Hospitality website asked whether these freelance individuals were “Kitchen heroes or mercenary zeroes?” It’s easy to see why chefs are attracted to agencies: with wages often up to 25% higher than for equivalent staffers. Overington, though, has vowed to never use them again: “They’re not good enough. I’m basically paying double for a member of staff who isn’t anywhere near the level they need to be to work in a kitchen.” Overington believes many restaurants will start offering simpler food and concentrate more on quality produce. This is fine, he says, but will make it harder than ever to operate “a game-changing” kitchen: “No one’s going to have the money; no one’s going to have the time.” He has maintained standards at Le Cochon Aveugle by working long hours himself but, like Gauthier, he knows this is a short-term fix. On honeymoon in Australia in January, Overington marvelled at how different the restaurant culture was: chefs were rested, fresh, rarely working more than 10 hours a day. “I had a long, hard think: ‘Do I really want to carry on doing it?’” Overington admits. “Every day coming into work short staffed and customers’ expectations are so high because they’re spending quite a lot of money. And you go, ‘God, how do I get by?’” It’s a similar story elsewhere. Dan Smith, who won best young chef at the 2016 OFM Awards when he was a sous chef at the Clove Club, set up on his own at the Fordwich Arms in Kent in December. “Staffing has been the toughest part of it,” he says. For the first month, Smith ran the kitchen with just the help of his fiancée Tash: “We were doing 25 to 30 covers for lunch, 40 covers for dinner. It was good fun for a little bit, but you can’t go on like that; you’d burn out.” Smith, who is 26, spent three years earning a professional chef’s diploma from Westminster Kingsway College, working in restaurants at night. He’s young, but he has a decade’s experience, and this background and commitment is increasingly rare: “If I put an ad for a chef up, the people that are applying are plumbers, labourers, with no kitchen experience. You see that more and more: there’s fewer chefs coming through and I’m sure the catering colleges will tell you the same.” It’s certainly a seller’s market: if you have the skills, you can pick and choose where you work. Serena von der Heyde, the owner of the five-star Georgian House Hotel in Victoria, London, has found it almost impossible to recruit chefs. “It’s a desperate situation,” she says. “When we put an ad in, we don’t get people responding. Or they don’t turn up for interview. Or they don’t turn up for their first day. It used to be that we were interviewing someone for the role. Now we’re trying to sell the role to them!” Von der Heyde has attempted to enter partnerships with schools and colleges, and with charities that connect businesses with ex-offenders and women returning to work after a period of crisis. “Recruiting people from these different sources takes 10 times as long and has a tenth of the success rate,” she says. “There’s so many people coming through that aren’t really ready to go into work, don’t have the self-confidence, so we try very hard with all of that.” So, why don’t young people want to be chefs and waiting staff any more? Anthony Bourdain styled chefs as renegades, Jamie Oliver showed the job could be lucrative and had the potential to change society, Gordon Ramsay lost his rag a lot – but, the more we looked into professional kitchens, the more it became clear that for many employees working in a restaurant meant antisocial hours, low pay and attritional conditions. “It’s not sexy to be cleaning a kitchen at 11pm,” says Gauthier. “It’s not sexy to come in at 8.30am to clean the inside of a fish or debone a rack of lamb.” He exhales, “For a lot of people it would be hell. For me, it’s beautiful. But if you don’t have the passion, you can’t force yourself into it. And the passion comes from perseverance [but], in a society where the majority of people want things fast, it goes against the idea of perseverance.” In recent years, too, young people interested in food didn’t have to follow the traditional route of earning their stripes in a kitchen. For a couple of years, everyone was launching food trucks or supper clubs: you got to be your own boss and maybe you’d be the next Pitt Cue or the new Bao. But those successes are becoming rarer. “This is a mirage,” scoffs Gauthier. “A lot of people have been excited to be an entrepreneur but you tell me the number who have succeeded? I can’t think of five. And there are probably 50,000 who have tried.” Meanwhile, the murky reputation of the professional kitchen appears to be catching up with it. “Another reason why there’s no chefs is because they get bullied, they work long hours, getting paid little money for that,” says Overington from Le Cochon Aveugle. “I’m not saying everywhere is horrendous, because it’s not, but I’m sure nearly 100% of chefs my age would have had horrendous experiences.” For consultant Adam Hyman, it all comes back to an eternal failure in Britain – in contrast to, say, France, Italy and Spain – to promote working in a restaurant as “just as respectable as being an accountant, a lawyer or a teacher”. He continues, “Hospitality has never been seen as a proper career in Britain. It’s been seen as something that you do on your summer holidays or in between proper jobs. And that’s now starting to catch up.” There are few obvious solutions to the chef shortage. Gauthier would like to see an overhaul of the apprentice system, perhaps to bring it in line with France, where each area has a state-funded catering school that provides staff for the local restaurants. “We need to start from scratch, by having people who are 14, 15, 16 going into the apprenticeships: they work one week in the restaurant, one week in school,” says Gauthier. “The school is funded by the government for chefs and for waiters and they graduate with a serious diploma that everybody is proud of holding.” Some of the bigger restaurant groups are taking matters into their own hands. Gordon Ramsay Restaurants, for example, has partnered with the University of West London to offer a three-year programme and certification up to NVQ Level 3 in professional cookery, patisserie and confectionery. So far 36 students have entered the scheme, 10 have graduated – in all catering courses, a high drop-out rate is expected – and a new intake for September will be selected this spring. Overington, meanwhile, is attempting to improve the quality of life for his staff. He recently announced that, from this summer, his restaurant will open for only four nights a week. “Since doing that, I’ve actually had more interest from potential candidates than ever before,” he says. “Which I’m actually really surprised at; I didn’t think it would make that big a difference. Obviously, it’s a massive risk to go down to four days for a little business like us, but it’s something we’re willing to do for our life-work balance.” Von der Heyde believes that the situation will become impossible if the government pushes forward with the plan to restrict the number of EU nationals allowed visas to work in the UK. “However much we want to think there’s a pool of British workers who are being undercut by foreign workers,” she says, “in London, in my patch, in my industry, it is simply not the case.” She issues a stark warning. “Twenty years ago, London had an awful reputation for its food and accommodation. Across the capital, you’ve seen standards rise. But the pressure that we’re under, it’s pushing us backwards. It’s going to push us to be the capital of budget service in the world.” Numbers may be down, times are definitely hard, but everyone you speak to still has genuine passion for what they do. No one proves that better than the Fordwich Arms’s Smith. “I could never imagine being sat in front of a computer all day,” he says. “Being a chef is so creative. You have the freedom to say, ‘what can we get today from the market?’ Or, ‘what’s the fisherman caught today?’ There’s very few industries that you can create things every day. Once people realise that, that’s the thing that will give them the drive to want to do it.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"global-development/2018/mar/08/nigeria-we-are-soldiers-we-will-save-you-how-boko-haram-tricked-dapchi-schoolgirls","type":"article","sectionId":"global-development","sectionName":"Global development","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-08T14:33:48Z","webTitle":"'We are soldiers!

We will save you': how Boko Haram tricked Dapchi schoolgirls","bodyText":"Evening was falling and hundreds of students were preparing to break the fast observed every Monday at the girls’ boarding school in the small Nigerian town of Dapchi. Watching them get ready to eat reminded Usman Mohammed, a school security guard, that it was time for his evening prayers. It was a school night like any other. Until suddenly it wasn’t. “The food had just been served when we started hearing gunshots,” he said. He rushed to see what was happening. Girls were running in all directions. He could see strange men in army uniforms, carrying weapons. There were vehicles painted in military colours, with machine guns mounted on their roofs. But if you looked closer, you saw that “Allah is great” had been inscribed in Arabic on their bonnets. “We immediately knew that these weren’t soldiers,” Mohammed said. “They surrounded the school and were shooting, even on the main road they were shooting.” The strangers were trying to round up the girls. He remembered them shouting: “Stop, stop! We are not Boko Haram! We are soldiers, get into our vehicles. We will save you.” Habiba Jekana, who suffers from sickle cell and had been off school with a fever, believed the men. Unable to walk, a friend lifted Habiba on to her back, carried her over to the truck, and hoisted both of them in. The men were in fact members of Boko Haram, the violent group that calls itself Islamic while raping, murdering and kidnapping on a vast scale in north-east Nigeria. Some of the Dapchi girls and their families had heard of the Chibok girls –276 schoolchildren abducted by Boko Haram in 2014 to global condemnation – but they were not expecting the same to happen to them. Dapchi is in Yobe, another state badly affected by Boko Haram, but the town had never been attacked before, and since Chibok, Nigeria had elected a new government, one that repeatedly claims that Boko Haram is beaten, decimated and on the run. Officials have contradicted each other about the 19 February attack and in some cases released outright untruths, however the Guardian has pieced together what happened through interviews with the girls who escaped, their families, staff at the school, and Dapchi residents who witnessed the attack. Sitting outside the market, Mohammadu Mdada, a local vigilante, watched as two cars pulled up at about 6pm. Men with rifles got out and asked some startled tricycle taxi drivers the locations of soldiers, the hospital and the school. Duly directed, nine more cars sped after the men, fanning out towards the three targets. A wave of motorcycles followed. Motorcycles have been banned across the region, and that was how Mdada knew it was Boko Haram. At the Government Girls Science and Technical College, Hafsat Abdullahi, 18, had just got out of the bath after fasting all day. She hadn’t even taken a sip of water when she heard the shots ring out. Hafsat and her friends assumed the sound was the school’s dodgy electricity transformer, but changed their minds when they saw military men. “They said: ‘Come, let us help you, we are soldiers.’ We thought they really were. A lot of the students just jumped into their trucks.” Hafsat didn’t see her, but one of those girls was Fatima, her little sister. A lone dormitory porter seemed to realise what was happening, said Hafsat. “He was shouting to all of us: ‘Don’t get into those vehicles!’ But the girls just kept jumping in. Then [the porter] turned round and drove some of us towards the fence. We jumped over it and headed into the bush.” Hafsat and three of her schoolmates bent down and sprinted away from the school, with bullets flying around their ears. “Allah helped us. None of the bullets hit any of us,” she said. Hundreds of girls hid out in the open that night. With 110 girls loaded into their trucks, Boko Haram drove out through the school gates. They went back past the vigilantes, who could do nothing, having only one musket between them. “The girls were shouting and crying, ‘Please help us! Save us’,” Mdada said. “The Boko Haram men had whips in their hands, flogging the girls. They said: ‘Keep quiet, you stupid things.’” While Habiba was being lifted into the kidnappers’ truck, her father was roasting meat at his butcher’s shop when people started sprinting past, followed by strange cars. “I knew it was them and that this was trouble,” Mainama Jakana said. He heard gunfire coming from the school and worried about his daughter Habiba, headed in that direction. But before he could get there, Jakana met the convoy loaded with captives. “I followed one of the trucks carrying them,” he said. “I could hear the girls crying in the back of the truck, so I called out to the men. I pleaded with them to let my daughter go. I said she was not feeling well and she was a cripple. They told me to go back home. I kept on chasing the truck until it turned into the dusty road into the forest.” There had been warnings. Four hours before, the vigilantes got a call from their friends in Guma, a village 35km away, to say that people dressed in military fatigues were heading their way. Then they got a call from another nearby village, Turma. They were too scared of the police to report it. “We were afraid that if, in fact, they didn’t come to Dapchi, or they turned out not to be Boko Haram, then we might be in trouble,” said Mdada. “You know the Nigerian police.” According to other villagers, the district police officer left town suddenly that morning without telling his men; something they saw as highly suspicious. The military, meanwhile, was conspicuous by its absence at the school. “There was not a single soldier around, none,” said Mohammed, the school security guard. “I don’t know where the soldiers went.” Few lessons appear to have been learned from the abduction of the Chibok girls, who were taken when Boko Haram was run by Abubakar Shekau. Since then, Islamic State has named Abu Musab al-Barnawi as its new leader, and the group has split. Although it is not known which faction carried out the kidnapping, it was doubtless attracted by the prospect of ransoms like those paid for the release of some of the Chibok girls. The next day in Dapchi, as girls trickled back from the bush, their parents and the school started to figure out who had been kidnapped. Almost immediately, the state government said many of the girls had been “rescued by gallant officers”. But the parents’ hopes were soon dashed; the governor arrived and told them no girls had been rescued after all. For the abducted girls’ families, there is little to do but wait. “We came home and started praying day and night. That is how it has been since then,” said Jummei, the morther of Hafsat and Fatima. “We implore the world to pray for us.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"teacher-network/2018/mar/10/secret-teacher-focus-assessment-by-exam-failing-students-coursework","type":"article","sectionId":"teacher-network","sectionName":"Teacher Network","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-10T07:30:07Z","webTitle":"Secret Teacher: the focus on exams is failing GCSE students","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/teacher-network/2018/mar/10/secret-teacher-focus-assessment-by-exam-failing-students-coursework","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/teacher-network/2018/mar/10/secret-teacher-focus-assessment-by-exam-failing-students-coursework","fields":{"headline":"Secret Teacher: the focus on exams is failing GCSE students","bodyText":"After three years of all-exam GCSE qualifications, their impact is becoming clear. The leap from GCSE to A-level has always been challenging but it is now even more so as many sixth-formers find themselves ill-equipped to deal with the depth and breadth of learning required to do coursework at A-level. I have seen sixth-formers cry when they have to come up with their own topic and text choices, conduct their own research and write up a final response. They have reached the age of 16 without developing the skills required to tackle the task. Their critical analysis, time-management and research capabilities simply aren’t there. And while internally assessed coursework is no longer part of GCSEs, it is worth up to 20% of an A-level qualification for some subjects. Never has information been so easily and freely accessible, but most sixth-formers have no idea how to conduct the most basic online search for keywords, such as “critics, Macbeth”, or visit academic websites like Google Scholar. I am not a Luddite. As a teacher, I experience on a daily basis the great advantages of accessing a huge range of information online. But I, like many of my generation, know how to conduct research with or without books. Our school library stocks are increasingly whittled down in favour of computers. Teenagers today may be more tech savvy, but many lack essential study skills. This is having a knock-on effect on universities – a recent study by the Cambridge Assessment exam board found that universities were having to run remedial courses to teach first-year degree students basic research and essay-writing skills. Changes to GCSE assessment have created a system that rewards the ability to cram in as much information as possible and regurgitate it under exam conditions. It is not only unbalanced, it is also unfair and ineffective. Teaching to the test is becoming the norm. In a 2015 study, the UK was found to be one of the world’s worst culprits for this style of teaching, leading to a noticeable drop in performance in literacy, maths and problem solving among 16-24-year-olds, despite 15-year-olds being close to average in those subjects. I suffered terribly from exam nerves as a student, and coursework was a lifesaver. It took pressure off me in the exams and played to my strengths. I loved having the space to research a topic in depth, to plan, craft and write a critical and thorough response. The act of drafting and redrafting is a valuable skill in itself. There is no time for revising and redrafting in an English exam. Even Amanda Spielman, chief inspector of Ofsted, has warned that children’s chances of getting a “broad and balanced education” are at risk due to the GCSE reforms. When asked which they’d prefer, my students give a mixed response. Some are delighted with the shift to all-exam assessment and others are dreading it. The NSPCC has reported a surge in the number of young people requesting help via their Childline support service, which it has attributed to exam stress. Many schools start preparing pupils for their GCSEs in year 9, setting past exam paper questions in class, for homework and end-of-term tests, leaving any creativity at the classroom door. We are at risk of disengaging students from our subjects forever. Controlled assessments, which were introduced to replace coursework in 2009, then scrapped by the then education secretary Michael Gove in 2013, were not perfect. They were a pain to administer and supervise, and were underpinned by woolly guidelines. Critics, such as the OCR exam board, believed controlled assessments were vulnerable to abuse by schools that wanted to improve results, and they arguably carried too much weight. In English, they were worth up to 60% of the final grade. But surely they could have been revised and updated rather than abandoned, so that those necessary study skills were preserved. A better system would have given teachers more control over how assessments are conducted, and awarded marks for research and planning, as well as the final piece. Instead, Gove threw out the baby with the bath water, leaving us with pupils who are ill-equipped to deal with the rigours of higher academic study and working life. In a teach-to-the-test culture, there is little room for the type of creative tasks that encourage a real broadening of knowledge. Is this what we want for our pupils? Or are we committing the worst sin of all – putting children off learning?

He was pursued by two young men on foot, and another on a bicycle. As traffic slowed at the junction of Princess Road and Moss Lane East, Hafidah tried desperately to open the door of a passing car, before turning to face his pursuers, waving a knife. They stepped back, and he ran off down Moss Lane East. Someone threw a hammer at him, but missed. The chase went on, joined – or followed – by seven other young men who made their way across Princess Road over the next 45 seconds. Hafidah was drunk, and he was scared. He knew some of the boys who were chasing him, and he knew they were angry with him. On Moss Lane East, he tried once more to get into a passing vehicle. As he ran across the street, he was hit by more than one car, one of which was a Vauxhall Corsa, driven by a friend of some of those pursuing him. A pathologist later found that he had suffered leg injuries suggesting “a glancing blow” at low speed. At around 5.14pm, near the junction of Moss Lane East and Denhill Road, roughly 100 metres west of Princess Road, several of Hafidah’s pursuers caught up to him. He was punched, kicked and stamped on, although witnesses remember the details and the number of attackers differently. According to statements taken by the police, a student walking home from college saw “at least three or four” people drag Hafidah to the ground, punching and kicking him. A man working in an office overlooking the scene saw “a couple of youths” fighting on the northern side of the road, and “six or seven youths” watching from a nearby grass verge. Another witness, a lab assistant, thought there were five attackers. A woman on her way home from work saw three young men knock Hafidah to the ground. He curled up into a ball while they kicked him around the legs, torso and head. “Don’t you think you’ve done enough? Get off him!” the woman coming home from work shouted at the assailants, according to her witness statement. All but two ran away; one of those two continued to beat Hafidah. The lab assistant thought the other young man was telling the attacker to leave it and run, but that the attacker ignored him. The attacker was “really angry”, she thought, and was shouting at Hafidah as he kicked him. She noticed that the attacker’s face was covered, and that he was wearing gloves, despite the weather that day, which was clear and warm. Then he bent over Hafidah and stabbed him in the neck. The attacker ran off after the others, most of whom were already at least 20 metres away. The assault had lasted 30-40 seconds. “No, no, no,” the lab assistant cried as she ran towards Hafidah. “Not another one of our boys!” A man on his way home from Asda tried to press the victim’s hood against his neck to stop the bleeding. With some of his last words, Hafidah asked this man to tell his family that he loved them. Paramedics arrived. The shopper and the lab assistant sat on the grass verge and cried. Hafidah died two days later in Manchester Royal Infirmary. He was 18 years old. In the weeks following his death, 17 young people were arrested in connection with the killing. The young man who stabbed Hafidah – who would eventually admit to the crime after he was sentenced to life imprisonment in September last year – was a 19-year-old named Devonte Cantrill. A six-month investigation led police to the same conclusion. In an interview room at Longsight police station on 15 November 2016, Cantrill was asked several times why he committed the crime. “We explained to your solicitor that our enquiries so far would suggest that you were the person that put a knife in Abdul Hafidah’s throat,” a detective constable told Cantrill. “I’m suggesting to you that you are the person that has killed Hafidah. Let’s be as direct as that.” But shortly after that interview, Cantrill and 12 other young people were charged with the murder. Most had no criminal history. Before the fight that led to Abdul’s death, most of the group had spent the afternoon hanging around a local park, listening to music or kicking a football around. One had spent it with his infant son, and two of the other accused were about to have a baby together. Prosecutors alleged they were members of a gang and had intended, as a group, to assist in the killing. Last summer, four of them were convicted of manslaughter, including Devon’ta Neish, 17, who was on a bicycle at the back of the group chasing Hafidah, and never got off his bike to attack him. Their sentences range from five to 12 years. Cantrill and six others were found guilty of murder. These included Nathaniel Jermaine Williams, 17, the driver of the Corsa, a keen footballer who worked part-time in Nando’s – who did not get out of his car during the fight – and his school friend Reano Walters, 18, who seemed from mobile phone footage shot in the aftermath of the attack to have been around 20 metres away at the moment of the stabbing. Williams and Walters had spent part of the afternoon driving around in the Corsa, just passing time and showing off to girls in the neighbourhood, Walters later testified. The prosecution had accused them of conducting a “high-visibility patrol” of their alleged gang territory. All seven young men found guilty of murder were handed life sentences, with a minimum tariff of 23 years for Cantrill, and sentences ranging from 16 to 20 years for the six who had not stabbed Hafidah. How did a stabbing by one young man lead to 11 convictions? The answer is one of the most controversial principles in English law. * * * There are a number of ways a person can be convicted for a crime in which they did not play the decisive role – or even, perhaps, any role at all. Collectively, they are known as “joint enterprise”, a principle of common law stretching back hundreds of years. In one well-known case, from 1952, Derek Bentley was convicted of murder after his accomplice in a burglary, Christopher Craig, shot a police officer. “Let him have it, Chris,” Bentley had said, perhaps telling Craig to hand over his weapon – or perhaps, as the prosecution argued, urging him to fire. Under joint enterprise, Bentley had provided what is known as “assistance or encouragement” and was therefore just as guilty as Craig, the “principal” offender. Bentley received a pardon in 1998, although he had been executed by hanging 45 years previously. A more recent controversial example was the conviction of Laura Mitchell and her boyfriend, Michael Hall. One night in 2007, the couple, and two other people they were with, got into a fight in a car park outside a Bradford pub, with a man named Andrew Ayres, over who had booked a taxi. Mitchell and Hall then left the scene so that she could search a different part of the car park for her lost shoes. In the meantime, the other two defendants went to a nearby house and armed themselves with knuckledusters and other weapons. In a second, more serious fight, which did not involve Mitchell or Hall, Ayres was killed. The two armed men were convicted of murder, but so too were Mitchell and Hall. Their convictions were upheld by an appeals court in October 2016. In another case often cited by campaigners against the abuse of joint enterprise, Jordan Cunliffe, who was then 15, was one of three people convicted of the 2007 murder of Garry Newlove. Newlove was killed by a kick to the neck by one of a group of local teenagers, who attacked him after he accused them of vandalising his car. Cunliffe argues that although he was present, he never touched Newlove – a claim supported by the fact that he suffers from a degenerative eye condition, and was registered as blind at the time. “If you can do that to a blind 15-year-old, you can do it to anyone – and obviously it’s been done to a lot of people,” his mother, Janet, said to the Guardian two years ago. Cunliffe remains in prison. There could be more than 1,000 similar cases. The government does not collect statistics on joint enterprise; officially, a joint-enterprise murder is just another murder, and it is difficult to be sure whether or not prosecutions are becoming more common. But one study, by The Bureau of Investigative Journalism (TBIJ), found that between 2005 and 2013, 1,853 people were prosecuted for homicides involving four or more defendants. Such cases consistently represented about 15-20% of homicide prosecutions each year. Joint enterprise has also come under increasing scrutiny in recent years because of a growing body of academic research that appears to show it is applied disproportionately against black defendants. According to one study, black people are serving time under joint enterprise at 11 times their presence in the population as a whole. All of these issues have been at the forefront of a campaign to reform joint enterprise law, led by Jengba (Joint Enterprise Not Guilty By Association), a group representing the family members of nearly 1,000 people locked up under joint enterprise. It’s not that joint enterprise is always wrong in principle. “An example I always give in which joint enterprise is not remotely problematic would be where four people attack the victim, three of them hold him down, and the fourth one stabs him,” said Simon Natas, a partner at ITN Solicitors in London, who has acted for Jengba. “They’re all guilty of murder. It doesn’t matter that the other three are not wielding the knife.” But the trouble is that homicides are not always so straightforward, especially in cases of spontaneous violence, such as a street fight. One defendant might throw a few punches without intending that anybody should use a knife. Should their commission of assault imply their guilt of murder? And what about defendants like Cunliffe, who were present at a killing, but did not participate, or Mitchell and Hall, who weren’t present at all? In their 2014 study, TBIJ found countless examples of people incarcerated for murder or manslaughter in situations like these. The increasing visibility of such convictions in the last decade-and-a-half has caused joint enterprise to suffer from what the Prison Reform Trust calls a “deficit in legitimacy”. Thirty-seven of 43 lawyers interviewed by TBIJ expressed concern about the way the law operates. Joint enterprise’s crisis of legitimacy has also been intensified by its grossly unequal application. In a study of the cases of 294 people under 26 who were given sentences of 15 years or more, researchers at Cambridge University found that those convicted under joint enterprise comprised more than half of their sample, and observed a stark pattern in the composition of this group: more than half were black or mixed-race. Black and mixed-race people are already over-represented in the criminal justice system, as a report by David Lammy MP, in 2017, documented in painful detail. But even taking their disproportionate presence in the system as a baseline, black and mixed-race prisoners convicted under joint enterprise were over-represented by a factor of three in the Cambridge study. The vast majority of homicides in England and Wales – like the vast majority of most crimes – are committed by white people, who make up 86% of the population. But the patterns found in the Cambridge study have been frequently reproduced by other researchers. It seems there is something different about joint enterprise. A Prison Reform Trust study of 61 joint-enterprise cases involving 157 defendants found that for defendants whose ethnicity was known, around two-thirds were from ethnic minorities. More than 40% were black. Almost two-thirds were under 25. Similar disproportionality has been found by researchers at Manchester Metropolitan University. Ethnic-minority joint-enterprise prisoners are younger than their white counterparts when convicted, are tried with a larger number of co-defendants and serve longer sentences. All 11 of those convicted in the Moss Side case are black or mixed-race. The youngest was 14 at the time of the attack, and the oldest was 20. Their family members say that the academic research confirms their fear that their loved ones have been convicted in part because of the colour of their skin. “The jury made up their mind as soon as they saw them,” said Devon’ta Neish’s aunt Anna, an administrator at a local school. “They saw black boys from Moss Side, they heard ‘gangs’, and that was it.” * * * A joint enterprise case, perhaps more than most murders, requires a narrative. The jury must be made to understand how a fractured and sometimes confusing evidential picture, involving multiple participants with different types and levels of involvement, should be assembled. After years of growing controversy, a landmark supreme court decision in February 2016 appeared to set a stringent new standard for joint enterprise convictions. In “R v Jogee”, the court ruled that mere foresight that a crime such as murder might occur was not sufficient grounds for convicting a secondary offender. Instead, the prosecution would have to show that a defendant also intended for the crime to be committed. Campaigners and legal scholars hoped this would put an end to disproportionate joint enterprise convictions, but the successful prosecution of the Moss Side case has cast this into doubt. In terms of the number of defendants, the Moss Side case was one of the largest ever joint enterprise murder trials. According to the prosecution, there was only one way to assemble the pieces of the story: the defendants were part of a criminal gang, determined to attack en masse a member of a rival gang. As the judge explained in his directions to the jury: “When two or more persons join together to chase and to attack someone, each is liable for the acts done in furtherance of their joint purpose.” In order to be found guilty under joint enterprise, a defendant must meet two criteria: the first relates to their actions, and the second to their state of mind. In the Moss Side case, the prosecution argued that each defendant had acted in some way to contribute to the fatal attack – by beating up Hafidah before he was stabbed, by helping to chase him down or by offering implicit support through their presence. In law, this is known as the “conduct element”: an action that facilitated the offence of the principal offender. Prosecutors must also demonstrate a “mental element”, relating to the state of mind of the “secondary” defendant – the one who did not directly commit the crime. According to the new standard set by the Jogee decision, to be found guilty, a secondary defendant must share the same intention as the principal defendant. In the Moss Side case, this meant demonstrating their intention to kill or, in the words of the judge in the Moss Side case, “at least cause some really serious injury”. But R v Jogee did not do away altogether with the question of “foresight” that a crime would be committed: while it was no longer enough to convict a secondary defendant just by showing that they could have foreseen a murder, the fact of that foresight could still be used as evidence of shared intent. The prosecution in the Moss Side case pointed to the presence of a hammer during the chase, and the possibility that a defendant other than Cantrill might have also had a knife, to suggest that the defendants must have foreseen that weapons would be used, fatally. If the Moss Side defendants could foresee the use of a deadly weapon and still continued the chase, the prosecution argued, they must have intended it. This seems to make the Jogee decision much more equivocal than many activists had first hoped. “If intention can be readily inferred from foresight, then nothing will have changed,” Beatrice Krebs, an associate professor in law at the University of Reading, said. “But it depends, of course, on what is happening in practice.” The Jengba lawyer Simon Natas disagrees that knowledge of weapons always demonstrates a defendant’s intention that serious harm should be caused. “You need to look at what that knowledge actually implied, what their conduct was in relation to the weapon, what their conduct was in the course of the incident,” Natas said. Hafidah was not struck with the hammer, nor was he stabbed by anyone other than Cantrill. If the others were carrying lethal weapons and intended to use them against Hafidah, why did they not do so? Some of the defendants say they only ran after the commotion to see what happened, or, like the 29-year-old Cordell Austin – the only defendant to be acquitted – to look out for the safety of younger boys. Those who appeared, in CCTV footage, to be near the front of the chase as it crossed Princess Road said they had disengaged before the fight began. (The fight itself was not caught on camera.) Nobody admitted to having participated in the attack itself, perhaps afraid of incriminating themselves, or of being forced to describe the actions of others. Some of the defendants knew Hafidah, and regarded him with a mixture of fear and hostility. Local youth workers knew him, and had had concerns about him – he was someone they wanted to protect, but they also knew he had been responsible for violence against others. Some of the boys had been attacked or threatened by him in the past, or knew of others who had been. Some, though not all, likely bore a grudge against him. In the five or so minutes before the chase began, the group were hanging around in a park by Westwood Street, chatting and listening to music. Hafidah was hiding in the grounds of a nearby derelict building. According to the courtroom testimony of several defendants, Hafidah began throwing stones at one of their cars. His judgment impaired by alcohol – he was around 1.5 times over the drink-driving limit – he might have been trying to engineer a confrontation. In this reading, the chase that ensued was spontaneous, with each participant having a different understanding of what was going on, and what would happen if Hafidah was caught. “Probably two or three of them actually wanted to have a fight with him,” according to Akemia Minott, a local youth worker who knew most of the defendants. “Others wanted to see what was happening. I think one had the intention to stab him.” But the claim that the defendants were members of a gang helped prosecutors argue that they shared the same joint purpose, no matter how peripheral their conduct was to the act of killing Hafidah. According to the crown’s QC, Nicholas Johnson, the chase was “a co-ordinated effort” involving all 13 defendants. Even the most trivial facts became evidence of this gang intention, including some that might have also suggested a lack of coordination. Devon’ta Neish, for example, took a slightly different route as he followed the others towards Princess Road. The prosecution argued that he was trying to “head off” Hafidah in the hypothetical event that he attempted to double back and escape. Rather than a spontaneous fight taken to another level by one angry young man, in the prosecution story, each defendant had played his role in the gang violence. Hafidah sustained dozens of injuries from the many blows he received on Moss Lane East, but the pathologist judged that none of these contributed to his death. After a woman shouted at the attackers to stop, only Devonte Cantrill continued to attack Hafidah. He had been the last to arrive at the scene on Moss Lane East. He was the only attacker to cover his face, to wear gloves, and to strike Hafidah with a weapon. According to one witness, he seemed to be in a state of fury. Cantrill had had some difficult times in his life, and it was not the first time he had been violent. By the time he was arrested for Hafidah’s murder, he had been kicked out of the bail hostel where he was living in Salford, and was homeless. He had a previous conviction for head-butting a PCSO, for which he received a custodial sentence. While inside, he attacked a prison officer. “I was an angry kid back then,” he told police when asked about these incidents. He also told them that once, when he was in Deerbolt young offender institution, he went to the doctor for help with his mental health. But, he said: “I didn’t even chat to her properly. I spoke to her and then two days, three days, I got shipped out.” * * * The rhetorical association of minority – especially black – youth, with gangs and violence is a persistent feature of the British criminal justice system. And alleged gang rivalry is a frequent element in joint enterprise prosecutions. Becky Clarke and Patrick Williams, researchers from Manchester Metropolitan University, found that almost two-thirds of joint enterprise prisoners reported that “gang” links had been alleged during their trials. There is not only a racial disparity in the application of joint enterprise; there is also a racial disparity in the use of “gang” evidence in prosecutions. Clarke and Williams found that 78.9% of ethnic-minority joint enterprise prisoners had been described as gang members by prosecutors, compared to only 38.5% of whites. Although young black people are more likely to be suspected by the police of being gang members, they commit a proportionally small amount of violence. In their study, published in 2016, Clarke and Williams found that 81% of the individuals on Greater Manchester police’s list of suspected gang members were black. Yet during the same period, black youth were responsible for just 6% of serious violence by young people in Manchester. Similar patterns were found in London, where Metropolitan police data showed that in 2015-2016 less than 5% of serious youth violence was linked to alleged gang members. “Serious youth violence does not equal gang crime,” the former deputy mayor for policing and crime, Stephen Greenhalgh, has said. To Clarke, the disparity between the policing priorities and the reality of offending is striking. “When you plot the youth violence data on a map, you see these hotspots in north Manchester and Wythenshawe, and little ones in central-south. About 70% of the people who represent all of the marks on those hotspots were white British.” But when you look at the map of alleged gang members, “there’s just this one big hotspot, right in Moss Side.” The evidence of gang membership that prosecutors bring to bear in joint enterprise trials is often of questionable merit, according to Clarke and Williams. In the Moss Side case, the prosecution alleged that a few of the defendants were linked to the gang “Active Only” with photographs from the defendants’ social media accounts in which they made what the prosecution claimed were gang “hand signs”. According to DCI Terry Crompton, who led the murder investigation in this case, this evidence represented “self-admission” of gang membership. The boys and their families reject this. “Get any boy from round here, they don’t like to just stand straight in a picture, they love to do something with their hands,” a sister of one of the defendants said. “You’re calling these boys gang members for doing what you’re paying rappers to do on the TV.” The 13 defendants were not a particularly close group, but it was easy to find links between them. Moss Side has been the heart of Manchester’s African-Caribbean and African communities since the 1950s, and it was easy for police to identify social or family connections between the defendants, which were then characterised as gang associations. “We know you’re best buds with Durrell Ford because all your profile pictures are the same on Facebook,” an officer trying to portray the boys as gang members said to Durrell Goodall, 19, an amateur athlete who was among the second group to chase Abdul across Princess Road. Ford was also 19, and the two boys had been friends since Goodall’s mother moved to Moss Side when he was seven, having found the east Manchester neighbourhood of Clayton too racist to raise a mixed-race boy. Two of the other boys played football together, others went to the same youth club, or were neighbours. For Crompton, these links were enough to suspect all the defendants of being gang members. “We have some clear evidence from self-admissions,” he told me, referring to the photographs in which some of the young men made hand signs. Some of the others “may or may not be” gang members, he added, “but they certainly associated together, at least on the day”. In court, the prosecution tried to finesse these ambiguities by suggesting that any defendants that were not actually gang members were “affiliated with or sympathetic to” the gang, but Crompton admitted that these were not terms he could define. Surprisingly, given the focus on the Active Only gang during the trial, a “senior police source” initially told the Manchester Evening News, 12 days after the murder, that it had been committed by a gang called the Moss Side Bloods. Months later, during police interviews in November 2016, several defendants were still being asked about alleged associations with that gang. But when I asked Crompton about how soon investigators had determined that Active Only was responsible, he said it had been “pretty quickly” after the killing. (When I reminded him of the Moss Side Bloods theory, he said he wasn’t sure that gang still existed.) It was hard to avoid the conclusion that the gang theory might have been formulated before police knew which gang to attribute the violence to. Similarly, Crompton doubted that you could map the territory allegedly controlled by Active Only – a direct contradiction of what a police expert witness said at the trial. There is a striking discrepancy between the more complex picture admitted privately by the senior police officer who led the investigation, and the certainty with which the prosecution presented the case in court. While youth violence is a very real problem, the “gang” framework is shaped primarily by police wishing to impose order on a situation that is fundamentally chaotic. This imposed order creates the narrative clarity that enables joint enterprise convictions. For the family members, this practice represents bad faith. “Some of the things they’re saying – you know they’re blatantly lying about your children,” said the mother of Reano Walters, who was convicted of murder and sentenced to life with a minimum term of 20 years. “You know they’re lying. Deep down in their hearts, they know that half of what they’re saying is a lie.” * * * In responding to the challenges of youth violence, some seem more interested in getting convictions than securing justice. “What you’ve got to decide is not: ‘Does the system lead to people being wrongly convicted?’,” the former Labour lord chancellor Charles Falconer told the BBC in 2010, while discussing joint enterprise. “I think the real question is: ‘Do you want a law as draconian as our law is, which says juries can convict even if you are quite a peripheral member of the gang which killed?’ And I think broadly the view of reasonable people is that you probably do need a quite draconian law in that respect.” But concerns about the dual injustice of joint enterprise – both in overcharging individuals for their roles in crimes, and in the racially disproportionate way the law is applied – have dogged joint enterprise for years, as reports by the House of Commons justice select committee noted in 2012 and 2014. Lucy Powell, MP for Manchester Central, believes that these fears have been proven right once again in the case of Hafidah’s murder. “Charging 13 people with murder, when clearly 13 people were not actually involved in the act of murder directly, I thought was disproportionate,” Powell told me. “And I think a lot of people involved, in the police and the CPS, deep down, think that as well. For another stabbing in a white community – like Clayton, which is also in my constituency – would joint enterprise have been used to this extent? I don’t think so.” In his 2017 report on race in the criminal justice system, David Lammy MP stated that the government should adopt an “explain or reform” principle for racial disparities across the system. What can explain the racially biased outcomes of joint enterprise? Does the requirement to speculate about the mental state – rather than simply the actions – of a defendant lead police, prosecutors and juries to assume the worst of certain people? “We always said in our research that the ‘why’ was racism,” Becky Clarke told me. “Understanding racism in its institutional forms, in its everyday forms, is fundamentally the ‘why’.” Ben Crewe, one of the co-authors of the Cambridge study, is deeply concerned about the ongoing use of joint enterprise in light of its demonstrable racial disparity. The fact that one particular practice of the criminal law seems to so disproportionately target young black men – even more than the rest of the criminal justice system – “must tell us something very concerning about this society,” Crewe told me. “Something’s gone wrong somewhere along the line.” For the young men in Moss Side and their families, the consequences have been devastating. Nathaniel Jermaine Williams, the driver of the Corsa, was sentenced to at least 19 years for murder. His brother cannot bring himself to explain it to his son, and has told him that Uncle Jermaine went to Australia to pursue his football career. Williams’s father, Remi, has suffered intense low moods. Durrell Ford’s mother will take a second job to cover the cost of travelling to County Durham to see her son in prison. Devon’ta Neish’s mother doesn’t know whether she’ll be able to travel to see her son at all. The mother of a 15-year-old sentenced to five years for manslaughter took months off her nursing job with stress, and still suffers from headaches and vertigo. Reano Walters, who will be at least 39 when he is released, is afraid he won’t be able to have children. The youth worker Akemia Minott, who has known most of the defendants for years, is consumed by anger. “I don’t understand how they can justify themselves,” she said of the police and the courts. “It’s not a game. This shit’s not a game, this is real people’s lives. These lives aren’t less valuable than yours, these lives aren’t inferior to yours, or insignificant in comparison to yours. So why is the criminal justice system of a supposedly civilised and advanced country able to use certain people as just pawns in their game of chess?” • Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, or sign up to the long read weekly email here."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2018/mar/08/uk-ministers-could-push-on-with-brexit-devolution-plans-despite-oppostion","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-08T11:30:45Z","webTitle":"UK ministers could push on with Brexit devolution plans despite opposition","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/mar/08/uk-ministers-could-push-on-with-brexit-devolution-plans-despite-oppostion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/mar/08/uk-ministers-could-push-on-with-brexit-devolution-plans-despite-oppostion","fields":{"headline":"UK ministers could push on with Brexit devolution plans despite opposition","bodyText":"UK ministers could table their new offer on post-Brexit powers for Scotland and Wales in parliament next week even if the three governments fail to reach a deal, it has emerged. Ministers from the UK, Scottish and Welsh governments are meeting in London on Thursday afternoon for a fresh round of talks to solve a long-running dispute over the sharing of the major powers that will be repatriated after Brexit. UK government sources are now playing down the chances of a deal before Theresa May, the prime minister, meets Nicola Sturgeon and Carwyn Jones, the first ministers of Scotland and Wales, for inter-governmental talks next Wednesday that will be dominated by Brexit. They remain deadlocked over the UK government’s insistence that up to 25 policy areas, including farming, fishing and food labelling, need to be controlled at UK level until common frameworks can be agreed between them. Scottish and Welsh ministers say this amounts to a “power grab” and are refusing at this stage to accept a UK government amendment to the EU withdrawal bill, which would confirm that a large majority of EU powers will be handed directly to the devolved parliaments on Brexit day. Mike Russell, the Scottish Brexit minister, has confirmed his government would accept the common frameworks but only if the amendment accepts Holyrood has to agree before they are implemented. UK sources say that amounts to a Scottish veto over UK policy. Sources have confirmed a BBC report that the UK government could table its amendment in the Lords next week, regardless of a deal, in a bid to force Scottish and Welsh ministers into defending their stance. Both devolved governments are pressing on with their own rival legislation at Holyrood and Cardiff Bay, home of the Welsh assembly, which would sidestep Westminster and repatriate EU powers into Scotland and Wales without a UK–wide deal. Lord Wallace, the Liberal Democrat peer who served as the UK government’s Scottish law officer in the 2010 coalition government, said there was now an urgent need for both sides to publish the material at the centre of the dispute. UK sources say ministers in London are prepared to do so, a step the Scottish government appears to support. Both sides claim that publication would prove their case. “What we’ve got is on the one hand the UK government saying we’re prepared to devolve a considerable amount of powers back to Edinburgh; we’ve got the Scottish government saying yes we agree that there’s got to be UK common frameworks,” he told BBC Radio Scotland. Wallace, a former deputy first minister of Scotland, said both sides distrusted each other but the dispute seemed to hinge on a very narrow point. “They can’t be that far apart, so I’m saying let’s see what they’re actually discussing.” “I think it would be far better if we actually knew far more of what was going on,” he said. “We hear stories about what one side is proposing; what another is rejecting. This could do with a healthy dose of transparency.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/mar/08/russian-spy-new-photo-police-sergei-skripal","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-08T12:33:28Z","webTitle":"New photo shows police without protective clothing near scene of poisoning","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/mar/08/russian-spy-new-photo-police-sergei-skripal","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/mar/08/russian-spy-new-photo-police-sergei-skripal","fields":{"headline":"New photo shows police without protective clothing near scene of poisoning","bodyText":"This picture shows police in ordinary uniforms working on the scene where Sergei Skripal and his daughter, Yulia, collapsed after being poisoned with a nerve agent. Clearly unaware of the severity of the situation, the officers do not have specialist protective clothing and members of the public can also be seen strolling nearby. One police officer who had quickly arrived on the scene remains in hospital. On Thursday Amber Rudd said the officer was out of intensive care but his condition was still serious. The pictures were taken at the Maltings shopping precinct in Salisbury, Wiltshire, on Sunday two minutes after Yulia was airlifted to hospital. At the time officers had no idea the pair had been attacked with a nerve agent and attended the scene in everyday uniforms, even removing parts of the cordon at one stage. At first police believed they were dealing with a routine drugs incident. In one picture two people can be seen strolling through the precinct, metres from where the Russians were taken ill. In another picture a person also appears to be watching events unfold within metres of the scene. Later a major incident was declared and experts in hazmat suits examined the scene and removed material. The area remains sealed off. Police, firefighters and paramedics were called to the Maltings at 4.15pm on Sunday after Skripal and his daughter were discovered slumped on a bench. The air and land ambulances left the scene with the two Russians at about 5.10pm. The photos were taken just minutes after the air ambulance left by Thom Belk, who had been at a nearby indoor football game when he heard sirens and the air ambulance. Belk, of Salisbury, said: “I went to see what was going on just as the air ambulance was taking off and the land ambulance was leaving. These pictures are the immediate aftermath of what had happened – I don’t think anyone there really had a clue what was going on. The police officer is very close to the area where [Skripal and his daughter] were taken ill. “The officers had actually lifted part of the cordon and at one point there were two members of the public walking very near to the bench and the bag as well. They started off with quite a big cordon, but did begin to take some of it down.” Georgia Pridham was walking to her friend’s car when she spotted the pair on the bench. She said: “[Yulia] was kind of slumped into his shoulder. It just looked like she was asleep or passed out. “[Sergei] was sat bolt upright and rocking back and forth.” Dan Holmes, who walked past them just after 4pm, said: “The man was holding the woman with his head up and eyes closed. He was talking to himself as if he was praying.” Anther eyewitness, Emma Pearson, said: “I walked past them just as they were laying the girl down. I was going to go and help them, but there were so many people there already. I was worried but they didn’t need more people getting in the way.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/mar/12/2017-deadliest-year-of-syrian-war-for-children-says-unicef-psychological-ruin","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-12T13:56:14Z","webTitle":"2017 was the deadliest year of Syrian war for children, says Unicef","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/12/2017-deadliest-year-of-syrian-war-for-children-says-unicef-psychological-ruin","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/mar/12/2017-deadliest-year-of-syrian-war-for-children-says-unicef-psychological-ruin","fields":{"headline":"2017 was the deadliest year of Syrian war for children, says Unicef","bodyText":"A generation of Syrian children face psychological ruin and ever increasing danger, with child deaths soaring by 50% last year and the number of young soldiers tripling since 2015. A report by Unicef found 2017 was the worst year of the war for young Syrians, with 910 killed in a conflict that has spared them no mercy and has taken a vastly disproportionate toll on the country’s most vulnerable people. The figures undermine claims that the war, which will soon enter its eighth year, is losing steam. Those most at risk face escalating threats of being permanently maimed by fighting, or emotionally scarred by a litany of abuses including forced labour, marriages, food scarcity and minimal access to health or education. “There are scars in children and there are scars on children that will never be erased,” said Geert Cappelaere, Unicef’s director for the Middle East and north Africa. “The protection of children in all circumstances that was once universally embraced – at no moment have any of the parties accepted.” More than 13 million people inside Syria need humanitarian assistance, more than half of whom are children, the UN says. Of the 6.1 million internally displaced, roughly half (2.8 million) are children. Figures for last year show an average of 6,550 people were displaced each day in Syria. During the first months of 2018 there has been a sharp escalation in violence in Idlib, eastern Ghouta on the outskirts of Damascus and in Afrin on the Turkish border. The Syrian regime and Russia have been besieging Idlib and eastern Ghouta, while Turkey and a proxy Arab force launched an offensive against the Kurdish enclave of Afrin in January. There also remains a lethal threat from mines and unexploded bombs left over from fighting in Raqqa and Deir ez-Zor. In eastern Ghouta a besieged population of almost 420,000 people, half of whom are children, are enduring a month of airstrikes from Russian and Syrian jets, which are attempting to oust opposition fighters and the communities that support them from Damascus’s doorstep. Estimated death tolls in Ghouta range from 1,000 to 1,300 people. Children are thought to account for at least several hundred casualties. Reaching children in need has been relentlessly difficult, the UN has said, with requests to deliver aid to opposition communities routinely denied and convoys allowed to enter often stripped of essential medicines. Humanitarian access was denied 105 times in 2017 alone – a year marked by sieges of east Aleppo and eastern Ghouta, which had both been strongholds of the anti-Assad opposition throughout the war. Healthcare facilities, including hospitals and ambulance bases, have been repeatedly targeted in eastern Ghouta, repeating a pattern set elsewhere in Syria. In opposition-held east Aleppo, the healthcare network was destroyed before the area was overrun by pro-regime forces in late 2016. Last year alone, there were 175 attacks on health and education centres, the Unicef report says. Médecins Sans Frontières says 15 of the 20 hospitals and clinics it supports in eastern Ghouta have been hit by airstrikes or shelling. Local authorities inside the enclave say the healthcare system is being systematically targeted and the capacity to care for high numbers of wounded has shrunk enormously as a result. “Their [Assad regime’s] strategy is brutally clear,” said Ghassan Chamsi, a resident in the Douma neighbourhood of eastern Ghouta. “They want to terrorise everyone into running for the borders. Either submit, or die. But don’t expect to be treated by our own.” On almost every economic indicator, children in Syria experienced worse conditions last year than in 2016. The scarcity of food has soared across the country, with the young again suffering most for the lack of adequate nutrition. Up to 12% of young Syrians are considered to be acutely malnourished, the report says. The psychological effect on young generations who have spent at least half their lives in conflict, deprived of adequate food, education and healthcare, is among the most difficult risk categories to gauge. “Their conditions require specialised treatment and services,’ said Cappelaere. “As children, their needs differ from those of adults: as their bodies and abilities change, so must their care. These children face a very real risk of being neglected and stigmatised as the unrelenting conflict continues.” With fighting raging in north and central Syria, the majority of the population displaced and regional powers now more deeply invested in the war than before, there appears to be little hope of the humanitarian situation easing anytime soon. Russia and Iran have both reinforced their support for Bashar al-Assad, who was losing on the battlefield until Vladimir Putin sent the Russian air force to prop up the Syrian leader in September 2015. Iranian-led ground troops have been central to clawing back lost ground, while opposition groups, splintered and divided, no longer pose a sustained threat to the regime. However, Idlib and eastern Idlib, despite sustained attacks, remain formidable obstacles to a leadership that has pledged to return all of Syria to central control. As yet, there is no plan for what to do with eastern Ghouta’s population if they are forced to flee. In Idlib, more than 2.5 million people, many of them displaced from elsewhere in the country, are crammed into a small province faced with ever increasing humanitarian needs."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"culture/2018/mar/19/rising-camp-how-an-arch-sensibility-got-political","type":"article","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-19T06:00:12Z","webTitle":"Rising camp: how an arch sensibility got political","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2018/mar/19/rising-camp-how-an-arch-sensibility-got-political","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/2018/mar/19/rising-camp-how-an-arch-sensibility-got-political","fields":{"headline":"Rising camp: how an arch sensibility got political","bodyText":"There are few more mercurial cultural concepts than camp – or more enduring ones. America’s current king of TV camp, Ryan Murphy, is winning new accolades with his arch, neon-lit true-crime drama The Assassination of Gianni Versace. The Winter Olympics’ breakout star, ice skater Adam Rippon, set gay Twitter aflame by arriving at the Oscars wearing a Jeremy Scott tux and leather harness. Jonathan van Ness, long-haired, plaid-skirted grooming expert of Queer Eye for the Straight Guy, has ensured that viewers of the Netflix show now “spray, delay and walk away” when applying cologne. So far, so fabulous. But also so familiar: camp is, after all, a perennial feature of style for white gay men. Yet camp can also be radical. At Paris fashion week this month, Japanese label Comme Des Garçons presented an alternative vision. On displaywere ruffles, clashing polka-dot and tartan patterns, voluminous panto-dame petticoats and endless puckering layers. Designer Rei Kawakubo declared that the collection had been inspired by the cultural critic Susan Sontag’s 1964 essay Notes on Camp, which helped define and explain this cultural phenomenon. Kawakubo echoed Sontag’s claim that camp is not simply clumsy over-exaggeration or bad taste. “On the contrary,” the designer said, “camp is really and truly something deep and new and represents a value we need.” Kawakubo had a point. When vulgarity has become not just a matter of bad taste in curtains but a political strategy that can put you in the White House, camp is an aesthetic tool that needs re-evaluating and refreshing. For Sontag, camp was ineffable. Notes on Camp was structured as a series of jottings rather than a formal essay because camp is a sensibility – a way of seeing – rather than a tightly definable idea. Still, she drew out a whole bouquet of its possible characteristics. Above all else, she said, camp is about artifice. Even when it takes nature as its source, it revels in stylising it – like the art nouveau lamps of the Paris Metro which are absurd renditions of orchids, or the ceiling of Antoni Gaudí’s Sagrada Familia cathedral in Barcelona, a vaulting arrangement of serrated stone leaves. Camp also blurs high and low culture. The same extravagant artifice of Gaudí’s campy forest canopy can be found in the reality TV show franchises The Real Housewives or Made in Chelsea, where authenticity is rejected in favour of fabricated drama, all big hair and outsized personalities. Sontag sees nuance of character and the development of emotional complexity as anathema to camp. “What camp taste responds to is ‘instant character,’” she wrote. “Character is understood as a state of continual incandescence – a person being one, very intense thing.” This is what makes camp so slippery. It requires a constant switching of aesthetic and emotional registers, of finding an ironic joy in ridiculous drama while still, somehow, sincerely loving and identifying with it. Strictly Come Dancing could not have survived 15 seasons on knowing irony alone: to read camp, one must recognise how artificial so much in our lives is, and then revel in its glittering falseness. It’s this puffed-up love of artifice that Kawakubo celebrates. For Sontag, however, the best camp has no idea that it is camp. Fifty years on from her essay, our own arch icon must surely be Vladimir Putin: the frequent photoshoots portraying the Russian premier riding horseback topless, or scuba-diving for Greek urns, are performances of masculinity so overblown they become comic. Putin isn’t playing camp, but we can’t help but read him that way. As Sontag stresses, “in naive, or pure, camp, the essential element is seriousness, a seriousness that fails.” Putin now finds his mirror in the White House. It’s not just his love of parades and big hair that renders Trump camp. His very language is full of camp affect and hyperbolic overstatement, as comedian Peter Serafinowicz reveals in Sassy Trump, his dubbed reworkings of Trump’s speeches. For years, gay people have played withthe concept of “butch”, making it silly, sexy and subversive, so it’s no wonder there is confusion between camp masculinity and homosexuality. Camp regards gender as something you can perform. As Sontag said: “To perceive camp in objects and persons is to understand Being-as-Playing-a-Role.” She highlights the “corny flamboyant female-ness” of such actresses as Gina Lollobrigida. These days we might see a ripped Channing Tatum, or an eyelash-fluttering Cardi B, as consciously playing up a camp shtick of gender norms. Sontag remarked that camp’s obsession with style at the expense of content rendered it “depoliticised … or at least apolitical” – an idea that history has since overturned. Camp’s obsession with playing up, and subverting, the performance of gender and sexuality has clearly had a significant effect on our society, and the queer audience has become a powerful force in the face of discrimination and oppression. A sensibility is a way of seeing, consuming and enjoying culture; sharing a sensibility in the social media age creates a community that can see and talk to itself. Put another way, how some queer people consume culture is an art form in itself. Take RuPaul’s Drag Race, the cult reality show where queens pitch themselves in fierce competition for the title of America’s Next Drag Superstar. The show is pasted thick with irony (it models itself as a take-off of America’s Next Top Model and Project Runway). Drag Race has become a cultural lodestone in gay communities with obsessive championing of favourite queens and endless rumination on tactics making ready-made topics of conversation among strangers. In other words, it’s football for gay people. Social media has amplified and made global this queer fan culture. This audience is far from apolitical, as RuPaul discovered. After telling the Guardian earlier this month that he would “probably not” let a trans woman compete on the show, large sections of its fanbase, as well as former queens, spoke out against him. Despite RuPaul being the titular figurehead, the fans know that what produces the show’s richness is the shared culture created by those who bond over it – and that culture increasingly recognises the role played both in the show, and in wider LGBT culture, by trans and non-binary people. This is what has changed since Sontag wrote her notes: the idea of culture being something produced in one sector and passively consumed in another is over. In the social media age, the audience makes the culture through the sensibility it displays. It makes new connections, remixing and recontextualising cultural objects as it goes. The role of self-defined “creative” in the modern aesthetic economy is not so much one of creating new trends, but spotting them as they arise from the general population, amplifying them and appropriating them. Artists themselves are largely at the mercy of their fans’ creativity, and when that creativity is camp, it brings into play powerful forces that allow the audience to produce new meanings, and celebrate unlikely and dangerous protagonists. Perhaps Kawakubo is right – camp is a value we need. When absolutism is becoming the order of the day, camp insists upon nuance. It knows that what makes something serious and heavy for one viewer makes it hilariously silly for another. And it knows that to fully appreciate culture, all these meanings must sit together in the object, to be wrestled and played with. It empowers the audience to undermine authority, to destabilise meaning, to change art. Camp regards nuance, enjoyment and brocade ruffles as virtues in their own right – although it would never be so vulgar or boring as to say so."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/mar/12/the-guardian-view-on-picasso-1932-the-art-of-the-possible","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-12T17:25:02Z","webTitle":"The Guardian view on Picasso 1932: the art of the possible | Editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/12/the-guardian-view-on-picasso-1932-the-art-of-the-possible","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/12/the-guardian-view-on-picasso-1932-the-art-of-the-possible","fields":{"headline":"The Guardian view on Picasso 1932: the art of the possible","bodyText":"Tate Modern’s new exhibition, Picasso 1932, is a breathtaking display of one artist’s relentless and restless creativity. Running until September, it is already destined to be one of Britain’s cultural events of the year. Yet it embodies an unresolved paradox about the way that modern societies think about art. Picasso 1932 is exactly what the title suggests it is – a chronological survey of Pablo Picasso’s work during a single year, when the artist was 50 years old. The exhibition at Tate Modern is laid out month by month, starting in January 1932 with several ebullient portraits of women and proceeding in stages to the darker work of November and December in the last room. In between, Picasso’s output ranges prodigiously wide, from primitive sculptures and line drawings, through a set of pictures inspired by the octopus to another triggered by Matthias Grünewald’s early 16th-century Crucifixion. Chronology is the essence of the show. It focuses close-up on Picasso’s evolution in those 12 months. Yet here’s the paradox. Picasso himself disdained chronology. He thought of himself as someone who made new art. He was certainly interested in other art, like Grünewald’s, for example. He was always experimenting with subjects, line, colour and composition. But he wasn’t particularly interested in his own evolution or in his objectification as a significant historical figure. This disjunction is highlighted in the exhibition. Back in 1932, Picasso curated in Paris one of the first retrospectives of his own work. Impatient with chronology, he deliberately mixed up his work from different periods – a device that is repeated in the June 1932 room of the Tate Modern show. To Picasso, his art needed no explanation. It existed as art, and not as part of a story. To the exhibition visitor, however, the chronology and the art are harder to separate. Picasso is not the only artist who fought against attempts to impose chronology and meaning upon his work. His contemporary Igor Stravinsky was exactly the same about his music. Many others, before and since, have wrestled with attempts to categorise, judge or impose hierarchies on their work. Yet this is a struggle that can have no end. The artist always prefers to do new things in their own terms. But the viewer is always making connections and drawing conclusions that the artist rejects. This is particularly important with Picasso. He expressed the visible in dazzlingly different ways. The late John Berger once called him “the master of the unfinished”. He didn’t mean that Picasso never finished his pictures. He meant that Picasso’s work is quintessentially the work of a particular moment, when the visible is always on the threshold of becoming the differently visible or the possibly visible. The brilliance of the Picasso 1932 exhibition is that it manages to be bring the two approaches together. It combines the actual – Picasso’s output of art – with the day-by-day possibility of paths not chosen. Picasso’s pictures and sculptures are objects now. But at Tate Modern they are objects of a creative moment. In this exhibition, creativity and chronology don’t repel; they reinforce."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"news/2018/mar/14/world-weatherwatch-noreaster-whips-against-us-as-cyclones-slam-south-pacific","type":"article","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-14T21:30:18Z","webTitle":"World weatherwatch: Nor'easter whips against US as cyclones slam South Pacific","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/mar/14/world-weatherwatch-noreaster-whips-against-us-as-cyclones-slam-south-pacific","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/2018/mar/14/world-weatherwatch-noreaster-whips-against-us-as-cyclones-slam-south-pacific","fields":{"headline":"World weatherwatch: Nor'easter whips against US as cyclones slam South Pacific","bodyText":"Cyclone Hola continued its path south-eastwards across the South Pacific this week, brushing along the northern-most fringes of New Zealand’s North Island. The cyclone, which intensified to category 4, brought with it heavy rain and strong winds in excess of 70mph to communities along the Bay of Plenty and Gisborne as well as to the country’s capital, Auckland. It was the third big storm to strike the country this year. Across the Atlantic, in the northern and eastern parts of the US, a second “nor’easter” as coined by American meteorologists, brought further strong winds and heavy snowfall along the east coast, affecting the states of New York, Pennsylvania and Maine last Thursday. A third winter storm is expected to strike during the coming days bringing strong winds and a mix of heavy rain and snowfall. The anomalous warmth in the Arctic, which in part was responsible for the swath of exceptional cold that swept through Europe over the past few weeks, has done little to maintain the extent of the sea ice in the region, which should now be approaching its typical maximum limit. As it stands, and within the satellite record, the sea ice extent recording seems to have put this winter within the top three for having the lowest ice extent. And there has been a reduction in the ice cover over the last three consecutive winters."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"education/2018/mar/12/sex-education-consent-advice-youtube-hannah-witton-laci-green","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-12T13:21:24Z","webTitle":"Masturbation hacks and consent advice: how YouTubers took over sex education\r\n","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2018/mar/12/sex-education-consent-advice-youtube-hannah-witton-laci-green","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/education/2018/mar/12/sex-education-consent-advice-youtube-hannah-witton-laci-green","fields":{"headline":"Masturbation hacks and consent advice: how YouTubers took over sex education\r\n","bodyText":"When Lily was at school, she remembers the boys and girls being separated for a sex education class. The boys were given one booklet; the girls another. “In the boys’ booklet, there was a section on masturbation and there wasn’t in the girls’ booklet,” she says. “A girl put her hand up and said: ‘Why don’t we have that?’ and one of the teachers said: ‘Girls don’t do that, that’s disgusting.’ It shouldn’t be a shameful thing to talk about. It can be a bit awkward and embarrassing, but we should be talking about it.” Afterwards, Lily, who is now 19 and identifies as bisexual, went online and discovered sex education videos on YouTube, particularly those made by a young woman, Hannah Witton. “Within my friendship group it has really opened up a conversation about things you don’t normally discuss,” she says. “In schools, LGBT sex ed is just not talked about. Sex was never discussed as a pleasurable thing, especially for women.” Magazines such as Cosmopolitan filled some of her knowledge gaps, she says, but most of her sex education has come from Witton. YouTube sex educators are increasingly popular, and for the young people I speak to, such videos are where almost all their information about sex now comes from. Witton, who is 26 and British, is incredibly popular, with 430,000 subscribers to her YouTube channel and videos racking up millions of views. Why Having Big Boobs Sucks! has received 3.5m views; 10 Masturbation Hacks has had 1.2m. In the US, Laci Green has 1.5 million subscribers and her videos on, among many topics, nudity, vaginas, foreskins and pubic hair reach millions. There are several other hugely successful sex-ed vloggers, such as Shan Boody and Dr Lindsey Doe. In Poland, where sex education was recently removed from schools, young people are turning to vloggers such as Natalia Trybus, while the model Anja Rubik and a women’s rights organisation, Dziewuchy Dziewuchom, have also launched a series of sex education videos on YouTube. Amy, 16, says these videos are where almost all of her sex education has come from. “I only really started being given proper sex education in year 10 or 11, when I was about to leave school.” It would have been helpful to have had it earlier, she says. She started watching Witton’s videos when she was about 12. “Everyone around me seemed to understand sex stuff and I was completely clueless,” she says. What did she find most helpful? “Quite a lot of it was her masturbation videos. She presents it in a very positive way – female masturbation is a controversial subject when it shouldn’t be. It helped me understand that side of things. If I had questions, I could probably go on her channel and scroll back and see if she’d posted on it. I’m not that sexually active but I feel like I’m more understanding of what [happens]. I feel a bit more confident because I’ve learned about it in a way that isn’t porn. It’s helped me become more sex positive. It helps me feel like I can talk about it with my friends, whereas before it was like: ‘I can’t talk about that even though everyone’s going through it.’” Has it made it easier to talk to her parents, too? “A little bit,” she says. It is not surprising that young people are turning to the internet for information, says Lisa Hallgarten, policy manager at Brook, the sexual health and education charity. “Partly because they get everything from the internet. But there is also the fact that in schools they’re just not getting what they need. Even in schools where they’re trying to do a good job, young people aren’t getting the information they need, when they need it. Young people are saying: don’t talk to us about contraception when we’re 17, because some of our friends are already pregnant.” At the moment, personal, social, health and economic education (PSHE) – in which sex education is often included – is not a statutory part of the curriculum in the UK, although schools are expected to provide it. Last year, the Department for Education announced that relationships and sex education (RSE) would be compulsory in all secondary schools, and an eight-week consultation on what should be included recently ended; the guidance has not been updated since 2000, during which time children have had to face then-unheard of things such as sexting, cyberbullying and access to online pornography. “What we would like is for RSE to be a mandatory part of PSHE and for PSHE to be a statutory subject and taught as a timetabled lesson,” says Hallgarten. Some aspects of sex education are compulsory and taught in science classes. However, parents have the right to remove their children from RSE. “Most parents want RSE for their children but we are worried that those who get withdrawn are possibly the most vulnerable and the least likely to be in households where they get that information from their parents,” says Hallgarten. “They may well resort to looking on the internet of their own accord, and in that case more power to the vloggers. I think there are good vloggers and mediocre vloggers. Some of what people see will be misinformation. I think vlogs should be a supplement, not a replacement to classroom teaching.” As it is, many teachers are not supported well enough to deliver great sex education lessons, she says. “I think there are a lot of teachers who feel awkward about talking about any aspect of RSE and that’s why we are lobbying hard to make it a real subject and provide real training. There are teachers who really love doing it and are really excellent, but lots of teachers don’t want to do it. If they feel awkward talking about it then it’s not really helpful for young people.” As Amy puts it: “Sex education isn’t seen as a positive thing. It’s seen as cringey. [Watching YouTubers] where it’s people who are only a little bit older than us and not like 40-year-old teachers, it might help people understand it better.” Hallgarten identified particular areas in which conventional RSE is lacking. “Things like talking about sexual pleasure is something that lots of teachers would really shy away from. They are told about unhealthy relationships but they often don’t have a good model for what a healthy sexual relationship would look like. The vast majority of people will have sex at some point in their life and we hope that it will be a nice experience, but we don’t talk about that. That’s one of the things young people go online to try to understand.” Some teachers have started even using YouTube sex-ed clips in a classroom setting. “We use a lot of the vloggers in our work,” says Eleanor Draeger, senior RSE trainer at the Sex Education Forum. “We go out and train teachers and show them a wide range of different resources they can use in their classrooms, and one of the resources is vlogs. The idea is that the teacher chooses the things they think will work with the students in their class.” Many of the topics might not be appropriate for secondary school age children; some of the most popular sex education videos are on topics such as encouraging stripping, and the use of sex toys and porn. “One of the ways we might recommend using a vlogger is we show the video on whichever subject you’re teaching and then the teacher can explain anything the students didn’t understand or expand on the topic. If you were only getting your sex education from [videos] you might not get a rounded sex education. Having said that, I think they’re fantastic as an adjunct and I wish that kind of thing had been around when I was younger.” Witton launched her first sex education video in January 2012 (she had been posting videos on YouTube for some time before that). It was a video on contraception, presented with a friend. “Sex education is pretty crap, at least in the UK,” she said in it, “so I wanted to make a mini series of sex education videos that hopefully you guys will enjoy and learn some stuff.” That “mini series”, as she endearingly described it, presented and filmed without her more recent polish, has turned into dozens of videos, millions of viewers, a book, and a full-time job as a YouTube star. Witton is smiley and chatty and presents her videos from her flat. She has covered sex toys, hormones, masturbation, porn, consent and open relationships (she doesn’t only talk about sex and relationships – in recent weeks she has been talking about undergoing surgery for ulcerative colitis and what it is like to live with a stoma). “I was very much inspired by Laci Green in the US,” she says, “and I decided I wanted to start making content about that because I noticed that most of my audience were young women. I felt like I wanted to do something. In terms of my personal experience, [sex education] was very much lacking in school. I had more of an open household so I could talk to my parents, in theory. I remember meeting people once I got to sixth form, who had maybe been to a different school from me or had a different upbringing, who didn’t know some stuff I thought was really basic. I met someone who thought it was totally fine to not use a condom and just pull out. I was like, ‘nooo’.” She is direct and funny. “I genuinely feel no awkwardness at all. It was one of the reasons I felt like it would be a good idea to start making videos like this, because I know some people don’t feel comfortable talking about these things. If I have a platform and I’m OK talking about them, I can use that platform for good.” The videos that have done particularly well, she says, include those on masturbation, “especially female masturbation, which for some reason is still taboo. A lot of people either don’t want to admit it’s happening or feel too ashamed to talk about it. There is a general shame and stigma around that topic, in terms of actually doing it but also talking about it.” Her main audience is women aged between 18 and 24, with 25- to 34-year-olds the next biggest group. People have to be 13 to have a YouTube account (or say they’re 13, and there will be many people who watch without an account) but the 13-17 age bracket makes up just 6% of her audience. Witton, who is an ambassador for Brook, is careful about accuracy. Are there sex education vloggers who are spreading misinformation? “I couldn’t [think of any] off the top of my head, but it’s the internet, so yeah.” Does she feel that for many young people, she’s their main provider of sex education? “That feels like a lot of pressure, but I’m always really clear that I’m not a doctor. I like to think of my videos as a conversation-starter and from there people’s curiosity can lead them to other bits of information if they want to look into it further. I don’t want to ever take a didactic approach of ‘I’m the teacher’. It’s more of a peer-to-peer education thing.” In the US, Green started making videos at university. Growing up as a Mormon, her only sex education at school was around abstinence. “A lot of the teenagers in my community just didn’t have the information and resources they needed, so I was a bit miffed about that. I didn’t really ever get sex ed in school. It was only in college, which for me was much later – I’d started having relationships, dating, having sexual experiences. I felt it was too late.” Her videos, she says, felt like “a good platform to have a conversation with other people who thought the same way I did and to share information. As I was trying to figure this stuff out, I was getting the information I needed and sharing it online.” Around 60% of Green’s subscribers are young women. “I think a lot of the problems we struggle with in society fall around misogynistic ideas around women’s bodies and about relationships, and this is what women are supposed to be and this is what men are supposed to be, which feeds into homophobia and transphobia as well.” She says around two-thirds of the people who contact her have had no sex education at school, or abstinence-based lessons. “Then the other third did have sex ed but didn’t have all their questions answered. I think a lot of people are awkward about sex. A lot of teachers in the US don’t know how to answer these questions, they’re very restricted in what they can say or do and that makes it really hard for them to have an honest relationship with their students.” Thea, 19, started watching sex education videos by Green and then found Witton’s. “I definitely got most of my sex ed from YouTube videos,” she says. “Which is sad, because some of this stuff should be taught in school to educate young teenagers properly about sex, but also about the gender and sexuality spectrums. My parents weren’t a lot of help either. It’s really awkward to talk to them about that stuff and they’re another generation so they don’t even know most of it.” She says YouTube videos have changed the way she thinks about sex, sexuality (she identifies as “queer”) and herself. “I feel a lot more confident about my body and I feel a lot more comfortable talking about sex. I probably wouldn’t have been able to actually come to terms with my sexuality if it wasn’t for YouTubers talking about theirs so openly. Online, people aren’t as reluctant to talk about sex, their sexuality and their gender any more, and that’s beginning to be the case in the real world as well, which is awesome.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2018/mar/12/pressure-mounts-john-bercow-mps-debate-bullying-caroline-lucas","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-12T17:35:38Z","webTitle":"Investigation into Commons bullying to follow Bercow claims","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/mar/12/pressure-mounts-john-bercow-mps-debate-bullying-caroline-lucas","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/mar/12/pressure-mounts-john-bercow-mps-debate-bullying-caroline-lucas","fields":{"headline":"Investigation into Commons bullying to follow Bercow claims","bodyText":"The leader of the House of Commons, Andrea Leadsom, has launched an investigation into allegations of bullying of Commons staff by MPs, a move that will put increased pressure on the Speaker, John Bercow. Leadsom announced the investigation after an urgent question from MPs prompted by a Newsnight investigation alleging that Bercow’s private secretary resigned and had post-traumatic stress disorder after working in his office. The allegations against Bercow surfaced shortly before Debbie Abrahams, the shadow work and pensions secretary, was suspended from her role while an allegation of bullying against her was investigated. Abrahams hit back at the claims on Monday night, counter-accusing members of Jeremy Corbyn’s office of bullying her. Corbyn’s office was said to be concerned about Abrahams’ alleged treatment of a number of both current and former staff members. She is believed to have been notified that there were formal allegations against her only in the past week, and was not given details of the specific accusations or who had made them. Some shadow cabinet ministers have suggested that the counter-claims of bullying centre on Corbyn’s chief of staff, Karie Murphy, which was strongly denied by the leader’s office. Abrahams will be subject to Labour’s internal code of conduct, which can result in individuals requiring employment training, a national executive committee reprimand or not being allowed to use Labour party staff. No formal complaint was submitted by Abrahams following her statement. Some MPs have given their backing to Abrahams, including the former shadow equalities and women’s minister, Kate Green, who tweeted: “Debbie is my friend. But were she not, it still can’t be right that she’s not apparently even been told details of complaint against her.” On Monday, Bercow chaired the urgent question on bullying, tabled by the Green party co-leader Caroline Lucas, who had requested that a deputy speaker take his place. “Reports of bullying of house staff are of huge concern to me and to honourable members right across the house,” Leadsom said. “I am committed to stamping out all kinds of bullying and harassment in parliament.” Leadsom said she had hoped to cover parliament staff under an independent grievance procedure set up by a cross-party working group at the end of last year, but had been advised that staff were already covered under the House of Commons’ respect policy. “Following the Newsnight allegations and others, it is clear the respect policy may not be sufficient to protect house staff,” Leadsom said. She said she would propose a short independent inquiry to the House of Commons commission, the body that runs the Commons administratively, when it meets on Monday. The commission is chaired by Bercow, but when Leadsom was queried about his presence on the commission by the Conservative MP Michael Fabricant, she said the investigation would be led independently. “It is right that everyone working for and with parliament, regardless of position or seniority, should have the same rights and protections and should be held to the same high standards,” she said. “Make no mistake, there is a need for change.” The Conservative MP James Duddridge said he was shocked that Bercow was allowed to chair the debate. “Is it appropriate for Mr Speaker to remain in his place while there are allegations against him which he is trying to suppress using taxpayer-funded money through sending out letters through speaker’s counsel?” he asked Leadsom, who reiterated the need to take complaints seriously without directly responding to the query. In the Commons, Lucas said it was clear staff members should be covered by the new independent procedure. “There are now considerable grounds to assert the respect policy does not have the confidence of the staff it is intended to protect,” she said. Several Labour MPs spoke out in Bercow’s defence during the debate, including the shadow House of Commons leader, Valerie Vaz, who questioned whether any formal complaints had been received. “It is noted you have granted the urgent question even though you are one of the people mentioned in media reports,” Vaz said. “No one, critics or otherwise, can deny your commitment to accountability and transparency and attempts to move the house forward.” The Labour MP Paul Farrelly, another of those accused of bullying Commons staff in the Newsnight report last week, urged fellow MPs not to “jump to judgment”. He called the BBC report “one-sided” and said the investigation should approach the cases in a “more balanced way”. Bercow has strongly denied the claims that he bullied his former private secretary Kate Emms, who worked for him between 2010 and 2011. Bridgen, who is pro-leave, admitted that his motivation to move against Bercow was partly down to his views on Brexit. “Given his apolitical position as Speaker of the House of Commons, he shouldn’t be able to trumpet them from the rooftops as he does.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"cities/2018/apr/12/sydney-car-crisis-dogs-trains-public-transport","type":"article","sectionId":"cities","sectionName":"Cities","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-12T06:00:24Z","webTitle":"Could allowing dogs on trains help ease Sydney's car crisis?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2018/apr/12/sydney-car-crisis-dogs-trains-public-transport","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/cities/2018/apr/12/sydney-car-crisis-dogs-trains-public-transport","fields":{"headline":"Could allowing dogs on trains help ease Sydney's car crisis?","bodyText":"Sydney loves to boast of its cafe culture, but only Leichhardt’s Cafe Bones makes it accessible to those on four legs. Situated in the middle of Hawthorne Canal Reserve, a large park in the city’s affluent inner west, its menu extends beyond flat whites and friands to lactose-free “puppaccinos” and “dogaccinos” – the low-fat alternative “for the health-conscious pup”. Now in its 18th year, Cafe Bones bills itself as the world’s first dog-friendly cafe. Its regulars – a large, freewheeling tornado of dogs and their close-knit community of owners – lend it a happily chaotic atmosphere that is all the more distinctive for its rarity. As an unabashedly dog-friendly environment, it is a haven in a city whose government is far more hostile to pet ownership than its residents are. Sitting at a table with Bessie, a 16-month-old Rhodesian ridgeback, at her feet, Jacqui laments the difficulties of owning a dog in a place that seems designed for it, with many central parks, beaches for swimming, and weather that lends itself to spending time outdoors. “To get anywhere in a car in Sydney is ridiculous, but because I can’t take her on public transport I just drive everywhere,” she says. A recent University of Sydney study suggests Jacqui is far from alone in her frustration. Surveying more than 1,250 Sydney dog owners, researchers Jennifer Kent and Corinne Mulley found 2.4m dog-related car trips were made in the city every week, exacerbating overcrowded traffic conditions and low rates of public transport use. Like many aspects of living in Sydney, they found, dog ownership was a “relatively car-dependent affair” – a reality that many owners accepted reluctantly. In total, 95% of those surveyed said they were in favour of allowing dogs on buses and trains, with one in five saying it would likely be enough for them to get rid of their cars altogether. Matt Roden and his partner bought a car shortly after bringing home their first dog, Pete. He says that while he would rather not own a car in the inner city, having one opened up new options as a pet owner. “I’m a big fan of public transport and like to use it when possible,” Roden says. “But as soon as we got a car, it was pretty clear how much easier it was with Pete. We could drive him to bigger, better parks in Sydney, to the beach, and to the emergency vet.“I’d love to be able to take Pete on the bus or train. I’d definitely use it over driving everywhere.” Letting dogs on trains won’t solve the Sydney car crisis – it’s far too gone for that. But Kent and Mulley argued the restriction was symbolic of the ways the city forces people into car ownership, even as it tries to reduce its dependency on private vehicles. Like Sydney’s “war on cyclists”,it speaks to a culture where the car is king. Comparing public transport policies on pets in 30 cities around the world, they found that dogs were welcome on trains and buses in all European cities, and using public transport was more the norm. In the US and Australia, dogs were confined to private cars, which are more dominant in both cultures. That made life more difficult, both for dog owners and people without access to a car. “People responding to the survey told us some really sad stories: times when their dog was having a seizure or needed medical attention and they had to carry it a kilometre up the road to the vet, when they could have caught the bus outside their house,” Kent says. “So much of what we do in our society is so car-dependent here in Sydney. If you don’t have a car, you really have no choice.” It is no wonder that the city is nearing breaking point over traffic. A 2016 report by Austroads found Sydney had seven of the 10 most congested roads in Australia and New Zealand, an average road network speed slower than New York’s and San Francisco’s, and a peak hour speed of just 29km per hour. In an effort to reduce congestion, the New South Wales state government has allowed private operators to reintroduce tolls – an approach that has had the opposite effect, pushing motorists to abandon toll roads and squeeze on to already congested suburban side streets instead. But given Sydney’s slow and unreliable patchwork of public transport, sitting in traffic is the only option many people have. In a city that regularly sweats through summer heatwaves, the city’s train network frequently breaks down in hot weather, and many older train carriages do not have air conditioning. In January, train drivers went on strike to protest against overworking, arguing that longer hours and fewer breaks were causing exhaustion and could increase accidents. Barely half of Sydney’s 307 train stations are accessible by wheelchair. One way of increasing uptake of public transport would be making the network more reflective of how people actually want to use it, rather than how government believes it should be used. As Kent and Mulley note, Australian city planners and policymakers have a tendency to regard public transport as supplementary to car travel, as though people only need to use trains, buses and trams for “predictable and ‘clean’ trips, such as the journey to work”. “In reality, our lives are made up of messy trips, and to reduce car dependence we need to plan for this mess.” There are moves being made in the right direction. An upswing in cycling commutes has prompted property developers and inner-city local governments to provide more infrastructure support for cyclists. A new light rail line is set to open in the central business district in 2019, and a proposed $8.3bn Sydney Metro line, billed by the state government as “Australia’s biggest public transport project”, is under way as well. But they pale in comparison to WestConnex, a gargantuan $16.8bn toll road development that the state government is persisting with in spite of budget and timetable blowouts and public opposition. Sydney is also due to construct as many as 10 new toll road networks in the coming years. It is a global outlier, as cities around the world dismantle freeway overpasses and pursue ambitious public transport projects, such as London’s upcoming Crossrail. A stone’s throw from Cafe Bones lies a stop on the inner west’s new light rail line. It is modern, clean and user-friendly ‒ except for anyone hoping to take their canine companion out for the day. Patting Bessie under the table, Jacqui is unimpressed. “I don’t get it,” she says. “I’ve seen humans do far more gross things on public transport than dogs would.” In collaboration with Guardian Australia, Guardian Cities is devoting a week to Australian cities.

Until now, however, one route through rural Victoria’s wheatbelt has been a road less travelled – not so much off the beaten track as off the tourist radar entirely. Careering north from Melbourne to Mildura and the mighty Murray river, travellers have often passed the one-horse towns, parched plains and pink lakes (it’s the algae) of the Wimmera Mallee, Victoria’s wild west, without a backward glance. A shame: they’ve missed treats such as Warracknabeal, the birthplace of Nick Cave, and Minyip, where the classic 80s TV series The Flying Doctors was filmed. Now, though, they’re slowing down in Yarriambiack Shire and following signs for the Silo Art Trail, a jaw-dropping tourist attraction. Where others see rural decay and rusty railway tracks lined with disused grain silos, street artists see huge concrete canvases. These agricultural giants date to the 1930s. Until 1916, transporting grain in hessian sacks from the wheatbelt to the coast and cities had been an arduous business. The development of massive grain-handling systems along the railways changed that. During harvest they were a hive of activity, with farmers delivering grain by horse-and-cart, then truck. Fast-forward to railway closures and abandoned silos, no longer “fit for purpose”. Australian company GrainCorp now stores mountains of wheat and barley under tarpaulins instead, while the silos littering the landscape were sentinels of an economic decline. Until Guido van Helten arrived. The first of the pioneer painters, van Helten is an artist who has created large-scale photorealist murals, from the US to the Ukraine. It had been his dream to paint one of these silos. Travelling from Brisbane (population 2.4 million) to Brim (population 171) at the end of 2015, he spent a month completing his epic art work: four figures, across six silos, rising 30m out of the sun-baked earth. Word got out. Other artists followed, and international street artist agency Juddy Roller got involved – along with the local council and national government. GrainCorp gave the go-ahead for more silos to be used and by the end of 2017 a sixth silo had been finished and a Silo Art Trail created. The series of giant portraits celebrates the spirit of the people here and each artist spent time in a local township, searching for their muse. It’s now touted as Australia’s largest outdoor gallery. The trail stretches around 200km, linking the country townships of Brim, Lascelles, Patchewollock, Rosebery, Rupanyup and Sheep Hills. It’s roughly a straight line – topped and tailed by Fintan Magee’s artwork at Patchewollock and Russian artist Julia Volchkova’s at Rupanyup. You could tick off all the silos in a crazy two- to three-hour trip but it’s better to do a loop, heading up on the Sunraysia Highway, then down on the Henty Highway. Slow down, take your time, spend the night en route. One gateway is Halls Gap in the mountainous Grampians national park, a three-hour drive from Melbourne. This was gold rush territory and the historic, low-slung buildings are woven with intricate wrought-iron verandas. Roads are long and straight and lined with gum trees and flat fields. This is cowboy country and the drover still plays an important part in the Australian psyche. It’s what Australian poet Dorothea Mackellar dubbed the country’s “wide brown land” in her patriotic ode My Country. Taking this route, the first silo is at Lascelles, a settlement named after the “Father of the Mallee”, Edward Harewood Lascelles and home to just 93 people. It has a pub, the Minapre Hotel, the area’s only drive-through bottle shop, and a mural on its silo by Melbourne artist Rone. Rone’s work focuses on “finding the fine line between beauty and decay” and his subjects are an old farming couple, Geoff and Merrilyn Horman. “They’re not local,” say the locals, “they’ve only been here 25 years.” The monochrome images blend into the concrete’s soft sepia, giving it a haunting quality, like a faded photograph. Drive on 50km to Patchewollock, a township that takes its name from two aboriginal words: putje, meaning plenty, and wallah, or porcupine grass. Before Brisbane artist Fintan Magee came to town, its claim to fame was the annual country music festival – with sheep racing. Magee’s lean and lanky subject is Nick “Noodle” Hulland, a local farmer who typifies the stoic spirit of the Wimmera Mallee, with his faded blue shirt and sun-bleached hair. From here, head to Hopetoun, a good stop-off for the night – and a relative metropolis with a population of around 500. At the Mallee Bush Retreat ($15pp excluding breakfast, 04 39 529 973, no website) you can even bed down in a silo. This architect-designed, community project on the shore of Lake Lascelles is real “cool camping”. Accommodation is available in two Silver Silos, a Cow Shed, Grain Store, Stables and Machinery Store. Or check into the recently spruced up Hopetoun Hotel ($90 a room, excluding breakfast, 03 50 833 070, no website). Like most things in the Mallee, the hotel is community-run. Alternatively, rustic-chic bolthole Leura Log Cabin sleeps two ($120 B&amp;B, outside Warracknabeal). While here, check out the Corrong Homestead, the oldest house in the Mallee, built by the first settler, Peter McGinnis, in 1846. After breakfast at the butchers, J&amp;C Wellingtons (there’s a funky cafe next to the meat counter, so you can order a latte while you wait for your chops; 76 Lascelles Street), drive south from Hopetoun to Rosebery. Lawyer-turned-street artist Kaff-eine’s mural was the last to be completed, at the end of 2017. She spent five months living in a remote farmhouse in the Mallee, getting under its skin. She fell for the place and the people. The young female farmer on the left silo sums up the spirit of the Mallee: she is the future; on the right silo, the man and his horse show the tender side of a tough existence. The project itself was a tough gig: Kaff-eine would hang high above the ground in a small cage, at the mercy of dust storms and temperatures ranging from freezer to furnace. Continue down the road to Brim, where Guido van Helten’s monochrome portrait of four figures has a ghostly, washed-out quality … they seem to be fading from view. His work focuses on identity: not of the individual but of these marginalised farming communities. He strove to capture the essence of this place – its struggle, its stoicism, the hardship. Sheep Hills is your next stop. Population: two. Artist Adnate also reveals the plight of marginalised communities through his works, and his is the only silo to portray the local Aboriginal community: Wergaia Elder, Uncle Ron Marks, Wotjobaluk Elder, Aunty Regina Hood and two children, Savannah Marks and Curtly McDonald – his theme the passing on of wisdom and culture to the next generation. The end of the trail is at Rupanyup, a squat steel grain silo painted by Russian artist Julia Volchkova. She chose a couple of young teenagers who play netball and Aussie Rules football, highlighting the importance of sport for the young in rural communities. The striking black and white portraits celebrate team spirit and hope for the future. Since the Silo Art Trail was completed, international visitor numbers have increased by 30%. The future is starting to look bright. This might be the end of the trail, for now, but it’s just the start of the story. Not just the silo show: other art to see The silos might be the main event but the sideshows are worth checking out too. Kaff-eine, with the help of 100 locals, created a 45m-long mural at Wagon Inn Cabins in Lascelles and painted a horse mural in Beulah, opposite the Victoria hotel. In Rupanyup, Melbourne artist Georgia Goodie painted two murals of local firefighters, while in Woomelang, on the side of the community shop, the snake mural by street artist Sirum highlights the plight of the endangered inland carpet python. Just outside town, a rusty shearing shed is being restored. The Tin Shed was built from crushed kerosene tins after the second world war, due to a shortage of building materials. The Stick Shed in Murtoa was built as an emergency grain store during the war. It now claims to be the ‘largest rustically-built structure in the world’, at 270m long, and can hold 92,500 tonnes of wheat. Inside, 560 mountain ash poles support a corrugated iron roof. It is now a heritage-listed building. The scale of this cathedral-like space, a Narnia-like forest of tree trunks, is awe-inspiring. St Arnaud’s Bible Museum is an Aladdin’s Cave of around 2,000 volumes in more than 300 languages, including 30 aboriginal languages, and is the work of mother and daughter Ellen and Jean Reid. You can flick (carefully) through a Geneva bible published in 1599 and made from rag paper. There are military bibles going back to the 1800s, some from the Boer war, and The Bible According to Spike Milligan. They also breed butterflies and release 1,800 each year to flutter around the town’s gardens, among them the red-spotted Jezebel."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/mar/12/childbirth-images-instagram-ban-censorship-katie-vigos-labour","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-12T16:38:01Z","webTitle":"‘Society shrouds birth in shame’: challenging Instagram’s ban on women in labour","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/mar/12/childbirth-images-instagram-ban-censorship-katie-vigos-labour","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/mar/12/childbirth-images-instagram-ban-censorship-katie-vigos-labour","fields":{"headline":"‘Society shrouds birth in shame’: challenging Instagram’s ban on women in labour","bodyText":"At the end of 2017, Katie Vigos, a Los Angeles-based nurse, launched a petition to allow uncensored photographs of childbirth on Instagram. Since she started her Empowered Birth Project page in 2014, her follower count has grown to almost 300,000, but the images of the process she seeks to celebrate, educate and inform women about – and help them heal from – are often removed by Instagram. Categorised as offensive material alongside pornography, threats of violence and hate speech, multiple images of childbirth have also been removed from smaller, similar accounts. “The female body in the midst of giving birth – blood, pubic hair, buttocks, the image of a baby exiting a woman’s vagina – seems to trigger people to report images,” says Vigos. “But there is no reason why we shouldn’t be able to show photos of physiological birth. It’s straight-up censorship.” Medical workers, for example, are allowed to post extremely graphic photos on Instagram, and womens’ bodies can be shown in explicitly sexual ways. But giving birth is deemed too unpleasant – even with Vigos’s proposal that the image is blurred, with an option to click through to see it, her concession to the idea that not everyone wants to see this type of content in their feed. The problem, she has been told, is a zero-tolerance policy towards genitals, regardless of context. Instagram’s community guidelines state: “We don’t allow nudity on Instagram. This includes photos, videos and some digitally created content that show sexual intercourse, genitals and close-ups of fully nude buttocks.” So, as Vigos sees it, “they’re saying because genitals are involved in childbirth [this type of image] belongs in pornography”. She says this comes from a social belief that the female body is only desirable and acceptable in a certain state, that vaginas are “only OK when they’re clean, tight and hairless”. Not only is this backward-thinking, she says, it is also harmful, and upholds the taboo and stigma surrounding birth. “It’s sending a message to women that your power to give birth is offensive and obscene, and should be hidden.” Vigos’s aim is to normalise childbirth and teach people what happens to their bodies, in the absence of routine education about the process and accurate portrayals in culture. Without adequate knowledge, she says, women aren’t capable of making informed decisions in the birth room, or trusting their bodies: “People can’t conceptualise a vagina opening for a baby to pass through, and that leads to fear and tension during labour, which inhibits the birth process.” The impetus for the campaign was a series of photographs of postpartum doula, Lauren Archer, giving birth to her son, Silas, which were taken by her father. First, Archer posted a photo on her own page, which was taken down by Instagram. “I had such an ashamed and saddened feeling,” she says. “As a woman, when someone censors you, there is this flicker of shame, this feeling of regret, like: ‘I must have done something inappropriate,’ even though I had nothing to be ashamed of.” Vigos saw the photos and published them on her account. It was the most liked post in her page’s history. Soon after, though, it was removed. Enough is enough, she thought, so she started the petition campaign on change.org. Within a week, it had 15,000 signatures. At the time of going to press, it has 21,000. Archer says images are an important tool. “As a mother or a mother to be, seeing photos of the raw strength and power of your body is utterly empowering. Birth is scary but only because our society has shrouded it in mystery and shame. Allowing uncensored photos pulls back that curtain.” Vigos compares the fight to uncensor birth with recent efforts to destigmatise menstruation and breastfeeding, and wonders if it would have been popular a few years ago, before those recent shifts in perspective. “Birth censorship needs to end right now,” she says. “People are hungry for it.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/mar/12/doctor-nhs-care-government-albert-thompson","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-12T13:39:58Z","webTitle":"As a doctor, I can see that denying NHS care to immigrants is inhumane | Kitty Worthing","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/12/doctor-nhs-care-government-albert-thompson","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/12/doctor-nhs-care-government-albert-thompson","fields":{"headline":"As a doctor, I can see that denying NHS care to immigrants is inhumane","bodyText":"Last week, the Guardian reported on the case of Albert Thompson, a man who came to London 44 years ago from Jamaica, at a time when many people from Commonwealth countries were migrating to the UK. This includes, of course, the thousands of nurses from Jamaica recruited in response to the NHS staffing crisis of the 1950s and 60s. Thompson’s mother was in fact one of these nurses. In November 2017, Thompson, suffering from prostate cancer, was told he could not continue to receive treatment unless he paid a staggering £54,000 upfront. Unable to pay, he was denied further care. This comes within the first month of the introduction of upfront payments, one facet of the government’s policy of charging for NHS services provided to people who aren’t “ordinarily resident” – in practice, charges for immigrants. The charging policy was first introduced under Gordon Brown in 2009, and extended in 2014 as part of a series of Conservative-led hostile environment measures. This is why Docs Not Cops – the campaign group I am part of – was set up: to campaign for free healthcare for everyone, whatever their immigration status. Government guidance makes it a statutory duty for the NHS to charge patients not deemed to be “ordinarily resident” in the UK. This means that patients with precarious immigration status are left with bills of thousands of pounds. Since October last year they can be denied care if they are unable to pay upfront, as Thompson was. If patients are unable to pay, the Department of Health effectively punishes them by handing their personal information to the Home Office, where their inability to pay for healthcare may mean their immigration applications are refused. While this case is particularly shocking given the length of time Thompson has lived in the country, it is sadly not uncommon. Commonwealth citizens who came to the UK decades ago, but whose right to remain does not show in Home Office records, are now being excluded from work, housing and welfare benefits, as well as healthcare, and even held in immigration prisons, as the government’s “hostile environment” for migrants deepens border control across all areas of life. As a doctor, I know that a decision to refuse care on the basis of a patient’s inability to pay is incredibly dangerous. If a patient’s cancer treatment is denied or delayed because it is not considered to be “urgent”, their condition risks rapidly deteriorating. This is the difference between cancer that can be cured, and cancer that will kill. Health is not a black-and-white issue – it is often not possible to make a clearcut distinction between “immediately necessary” and “non-urgent” care. These crucial decisions are being made in response to ill-thought out, politically motivated policy that has nothing to do with clinical judgment. The government’s brutal charging regime risks the lives of hundreds if not thousands of patients. And it isn’t just the charging regime that is putting lives at risk. The Home Office can now access confidential patient medical records via NHS Digital to obtain up-to-date addresses for people it wants to subject to immigration enforcement. In January, a health select committee inquiry into the data-sharing policy was shocked to hear that one domestic worker with precarious immigration status had died after she was too frightened to seek treatment for pneumonia. Data sharing and charging have a cumulative effect: they deter patients from seeking and receiving potentially life-saving treatment, and ultimately, people die. I know of patients who have had to crowdfund thousands of pounds for necessary and unavoidable care, something that is more common in countries like the United States. The government knows that if a patient isn’t able to raise those funds and is denied care, they will not receive any care at all. And for what justification? The charging system is framed as part of efforts to reduce NHS overspending. However, so-called “deliberate health tourism” accounts for only 0.3% of the NHS annual budget, compared to the massive debt of over £200bn to private finance initiatives for contracts such as those in the NHS. It is clear that these callous policies are ideologically motivated, and that healthcare is being used to extend the hostile environment and to scapegoat migrants for the underfunding and privatisation of our NHS. As an NHS doctor, I believe denying anyone access to healthcare on the basis of their ability to pay is fundamentally inhumane. Healthcare workers have a primary duty of care to our patients, which we cannot fulfil if we are policing the UK’s borders too. Access to healthcare is a human right, and no one should be denied or fear seeking treatment on the basis of financial ability and immigration status. But this isn’t just about immigration. Universality and privacy are the founding principles of our NHS. To lose them would be a high price to pay for the government’s obsession with immigration control. • Kitty Worthing is an NHS doctor and a member of Docs Not Cops"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/shortcuts/2018/mar/12/scientology-tv-network-television-directv-apple-roku-google-chromecast-streaming-content","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-12T13:22:53Z","webTitle":"Scientology launches its own TV network today – just like regular television, only more terrifying","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/shortcuts/2018/mar/12/scientology-tv-network-television-directv-apple-roku-google-chromecast-streaming-content","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/shortcuts/2018/mar/12/scientology-tv-network-television-directv-apple-roku-google-chromecast-streaming-content","fields":{"headline":"Scientology launches its own TV network today – just like regular television, only more terrifying","bodyText":"Name: The Scientology Network. Age: Due any minute now. Appearance: Just like regular television, only slightly more terrifying. Praise Xenu, a Scientology TV channel! Well, not really. Scientology will actually just be streaming content on DirecTV, Apple TV, Roku, Google Chromecast and an app. Scientology has no need for anachronisms such as television channels. You’re right. Scientology hates television channels, almost as much as it hates psychiatry, former Scientologists and people making any noise whatsoever during childbirth. Do you hate Scientology? Doesn’t everyone? Haven’t you seen the documentary Going Clear, the Louis Theroux Scientology film and the Leah Remini anti-Scientology series? None of them are particularly fond of Scientology, you know. So maybe Scientology has started this network to counter these accusations? Oh, I get it. It’s a PR move to try to make Scientology look less like a toxic dustbin full of deluded millionaires with aggressive superiority complexes. You’re very hostile. Would you like to take an Oxford Capacity Analysis to get to the bottom of this? No I wouldn’t, and I won’t be watching this channel either. It’ll probably just be endless repeats of John Travolta’s Battlefield Earth anyway. Actually, a programme list has been released; it includes Meet a Scientologist, Voices for Humanity and L Ron Hubbard: In His Own Voice. Great! Will the Hubbard series include his Affirmations, such as “Snakes are not dangerous to you. There are no snakes in the bottom of your bed” and “Masturbation does not injure or make insane. Your parents were in error. Everyone masturbates”? But everyone does masturbate. Be quiet: I’m making fun of a religion here. It’s my favourite thing to do. So you don’t hate Scientology specifically; you just enjoy mocking religious programming. Well, yes, especially if it’s likely to feature looped footage of Tom Cruise slagging off psychiatrists. And The Handmaid’s Tale. What’s that now? The Handmaid’s Tale. Elisabeth Moss made that, and she’s a Scientologist. Oh for God’s sake, really? That’s something else I’ll never be able to fully enjoy again. You do know that watching the Scientology Network isn’t compulsory, right? If you don’t like it, you can just ignore it. Where’s the fun in that? God, you’re such a Suppressive Person. No wonder you’re stuck at Operating Thetan Level Four.

Doddy, as everyone in the business called him, was the last link with a music-hall tradition that stretched back through time to include legends such as Max Miller, George Robey and Dan Leno. He adapted his act to the demands of TV and radio, but he was essentially a man of the theatre who could induce in a thousand or more spectators a sense of collective ecstasy. I claimed, when I interviewed Ken on his 90th birthday, that he and Laurence Olivier were the two performers in my theatre-going experience to be kissed with genius. But of what did that genius consist? For a start, a love of language that enabled him to usher us into a world of grotesque fantasy: a place of hairy Danes with bacon sandwiches strapped to their legs, of satyr-like seniors indulging in snuff orgies, of men with a third eye on the end of their finger. Even childhood was not immune. “I was born one day when me mother was out,” Ken used to quip. “We were so poor the lady next door had me.” That takes us back to Dan Leno who recollected a bizarre infancy in which he varnished the furniture, the cat and the interior of his dad’s boots with strawberry jam. Ken could fire off verbal gags, on every topic under the sun, faster than any comedian I’ve ever encountered. But he was also visually funny, making extravagant use of props, costumes and his own wayward teeth and unruly hair. Max Miller induced delight the moment he appeared in silky plus-fours looking like a raffish tipster. Ken would sometimes pelt on stage sporting a maroon maxi allegedly made out of 28 moggies, a mustard-yellow suit run up by a colour-blind tailor and a cone-shaped hat. If a test of a great comic is that they make you laugh before they’ve said a word, it is one Ken passed with ease. Props were also central to the act: not least the famous tickling stick, which could be seen as either a childish toy or a surrogate phallus. At the Palladium in 1965, the ticklingstick extended to the back of the stalls leading Ken to exclaim, in naive wonder: “The size of it!” Music was also pivotal. Ken started out as a burlesque baritone and developed this into a sendup of a fictive operetta entitled The Stupid Prince. He would offer a spirited rendering of Granada while wearing a hat decorated with ping-pong balls that he would bat into the auditorium with the back of a guitar. Best of all was the moment when he would strap a vast drum to his chest, beat it like a Salvation Army major and belt out rude ditties before crying to the audience: “Give in?” Comedians today mine their experience and expose their souls. Ken Dodd assumed a persona to give us an anthology of comedy that embraced the verbal and the visual, the whimsical and the surreal, the manic and the melodic. He was part of a great tradition and, with his passing, the music hall has lost the last of its luminaries."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2018/mar/12/slovakian-minister-resigns-after-protests-at-journalists","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-12T13:21:22Z","webTitle":"Slovakian minister resigns after protests at journalist's murder","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/12/slovakian-minister-resigns-after-protests-at-journalists","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/mar/12/slovakian-minister-resigns-after-protests-at-journalists","fields":{"headline":"Slovakian minister resigns after protests at journalist's murder","bodyText":"A key ally of the Slovakian prime minister, Robert Fico, has been forced to resign as interior minister after the murder of a journalist who had been investigating links between the government and the Italian mafia. Robert Kaliňák, who also quit his post as deputy prime minister, said the country’s need for stability required him to leave the administration. The Slovakian government has been in crisis since the discovery of the bodies of the investigative reporter Ján Kuciak, 27, and his fiancee, Martina Kušnírová, in their home last month. The couple were due to marry in May. Kuciak had specialised in investigating corruption and fraud. His stories had included individuals with whom Kaliňák had a business relationship. Fico’s partners in the coalition government, the Most–Híd party, had accused Kaliňák of having a conflict of interest in his role as head of the department to which the criminal investigators would ultimately answer. Kaliňák had been given until Monday to leave or face the fall of the administration. “I think to fulfil my mandate I have to do everything to preserve stability in Slovakia,” he said. “For this reason I have decided to resign as deputy prime minister and interior minister.” The murders of Kuciak and Kušnírová prompted tens of thousands of people to protest on the streets of Bratislava over the weekend, calling for the fall of Fico’s government. Police have said Kuciak’s death was “most likely” related to an unfinished investigation into the ties between senior Slovakian politicians and Italy’s ‘Ndrangheta organised crime group. Kaliňák is the second minister from the Smer party to resign over the murders. Marek Maďarič resigned as culture minister, saying he could not accept that a journalist had been shot dead during his tenure. An international team of journalists has been formed to complete Kuciak’s story. An estimated 40,000 people gathered in Bratislava to protest on Friday against Fico’s government. It was Slovakia’s biggest demonstration since the 1989 Velvet revolution that toppled communism in former Czechoslovakia. Thousands of others rallied in other cities across Slovakia, with parallel demonstrations also taking place in Prague and Berlin. Kaliňák said he would stay on to complete unspecified tasks before formally stepping down, without giving a date. Earlier this month, Slovakian police detained seven Italians named by Kuciak in his story, only for them to be released 48 hours later. The Most–Híd party is expected to meet later on Monday to decide whether Kaliňák’s resignation is enough to keep it in the coalition that also includes the rightwing Slovak National party (SNS). Fico’s alleged link to the mafia was his close aide Mária Trošková, a former model and Miss Universe contestant who was also close to the businessman Antonino Vadala, one of the detained Italians. Trošková and another Fico aide have both stepped down for the duration of the investigation. The Slovakian president, Andrej Kiska, has called for sweeping government changes or even snap elections after the Kuciak murder, and is in talks with all the coalition parties over the next steps. Fico initially criticised the president’s call as “an attempt to totally destabilise our country”, only to later accept the seriousness of his position. “We will offer solutions that will enable Most–Híd to continue in the government. I perceive the reality and I am ready for talks,” he said last week.

You could understand him having a couple of novelty comedy hits along the lines of Tommy Cooper’s Don’t Jump Off the Roof Dad or Charlie Drake’s My Boomerang Won’t Come Back, but Ken Dodd’s records weren’t funny, or at least the ones that sold weren’t. He knocked out a succession of comedy records, but there were far fewer takers for The Nikky Nokky Noo Song and The Diddly Doo Parade than for the love songs he sang, apparently in deadly earnest. He specialised in two things. The first were sentimental Italian ballads translated into English – he, or whoever picked songs for him, seemed particularly fond of the oeuvre of Liguria-born MOR singer Wilma Goich – and songs about crying: Tears, Tears of Happiness, I Can’t Hold Back the Tears, Tears Won’t Wash Away These Heartaches, Every Little Tear, Dancing With Tears in My Eyes, Let Me Cry on Your Shoulder. No matter that he made for a deeply improbable romantic balladeer, as evidenced by the sleeves of his albums – with his trademark hair slicked back and his goofy face fixed in a pensive, lovelorn expression, Ken Dodd looked, if anything, even more peculiar than usual. His romantic ballads sold, in occasionally mind-boggling quantities. 1965’s Tears was the biggest-selling single of the year, and the third biggest-selling of the decade: only the Beatles’ She Loves You and I Want to Hold Your Hand shifted more copies. He had 14 Top 30 hits in 15 years: as late as 1980, a Ken Dodd best-of compilation could make the Top 10. It might look like an inexplicable aberration, but Ken Dodd’s musical career was anything but: it was as much a sign of the times as Sgt Pepper or Highway 61 Revisited. He had his first hit in 1960, and was still knocking records out in 1983, but there’s something very telling about the fact that his biggest commercial success came between 1965 and 1967. These were the years in which, fuelled by a changing diet of drugs, pop music changed more dramatically and rapidly than it ever had before, or indeed has since. By their end, it was virtually unrecognisable: The Beatles in 1964, still the same besuited and bowing-in-unison quartet that had played at the Royal Variety Performance, seemed to have almost nothing in common with the Beatles who appeared on TV on Boxing Day 1967 singing I Am the Walrus. The success of Ken Dodd’s Tears – a song originally recorded in 1929 towering over a Top 40 that also contained I Can’t Get No Satisfaction, Barry McGuire’s protest anthem Eve of Destruction, Bob Dylan’s Like a Rolling Stone and James Brown’s Papa’s Got a Brand New Bag – was the first sign that a significant proportion of the record-buying public longed not for the white heat of drug-fuelled reinvention, but a simpler, cosier pop era. There’s a forgotten period between the arrival of the UK singles chart and the arrival of Elvis when the Top 10 almost entirely comprised songs that sounded like Tears, the raciest thing on offer was Frankie Laine or Johnnie Ray, and no one in Britain except a handful of die-hard aficionados had any idea about the raucous black American rhythm and blues records that already sounded like the future. The last generation that came of maturity in that period were still in their 20s when pop first started showing the effects of pot and LSD. They might have found something to love about the Beatles of Do You Want to Know a Secret? or Till There Was You, or the unthreatening sound of Herman’s Hermits singing Mrs Brown You’ve Got a Lovely Daughter. What were they supposed to make of Norwegian Wood or the Kinks’ droning See My Friends? It’s easy to scoff at the 60s squares, but ears trained to love Bing Crosby were clearly going to struggle with the sound of Bob Dylan sneering about not following leaders and watching the parking meters. Tears was eventually knocked off the No 1 spot by the Rolling Stones’ parent-scaring Get Off of My Cloud, which in turn was deposed by the mum-friendly sound of the Seekers’ The Carnival Is Over. This was a scenario that played out over and over again in the ensuing years. Jim Reeves’ Distant Drums was supplanted by the Four Tops’ groundbreaking Reach Out I’ll Be There, the Beach Boys’ Good Vibrations by Tom Jones’ The Green Green Grass of Home and, perhaps most famously, Englebert Humperdinck’s version of the 1949 song Release Me would relegate Penny Lane and Strawberry Fields Forever to No 2. At the risk of sounding pretentious, it was a kind of battle for the meaning of pop, played out at the top of the charts: was pop music supposed to be entertainment or, as critic Paul Williams put it, “a huge new playground to create and communicate and be perverse in”? Was it meant to be showbiz or the voice of a bohemian subculture? Comforting familiarity or the shock of the new? That Ken Dodd was an unwitting foot soldier in pop’s mid-60s generation gap war might be the weirdest aspect of his career."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"sport/2018/mar/12/bibian-mentel-spee-takes-paralympic-gold-two-months-after-cancer-surgery","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-12T12:20:43Z","webTitle":"Bibian Mentel-Spee takes Paralympic gold two months after cancer surgery","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/mar/12/bibian-mentel-spee-takes-paralympic-gold-two-months-after-cancer-surgery","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/mar/12/bibian-mentel-spee-takes-paralympic-gold-two-months-after-cancer-surgery","fields":{"headline":"Bibian Mentel-Spee takes Paralympic gold two months after cancer surgery","bodyText":"Bibian Mentel-Spee of the Netherlands retained her Olympic snowboard cross title at the Winter Paralympics in Pyeongchang – only months after finishing treatment for cancer, which prevented her from competing for much of the past year. Having been diagnosed in July 2017 with cancer in her neck, oesophagus and ribs, she had expected her treatment to be over by October. However, in December she was informed by doctors that the tumour in her neck required further urgent surgery – giving her barely any time to prepare for the Games. Before competing Mentel-Spee said: “I let go of my expectations for Pyeongchang. I’m really happy that I am able to go and that I can compete there. For me it is more important to compete there than to win. And just being there at the event with all my friends and showcasing the sport, that is the most important thing for me. I’m not really thinking about the results.” The 45-year-old, whose final operation was in January, was victorious in an all-Dutch final in Pyeongchang, edging out her team-mate Lisa Bunschoten for gold when she recovered faster after both women fell in the final race. Speaking to Paralympic.org, Mentel-Spee said of her treatment “It’s not easy to go through. Then again my doctor said it’s a no-brainer for me. You have to have this surgery to enjoy your life.” She described competing as a form of rehab for her. “I had all the more reason to stay on the couch with all that has been happening in the last couple of years,” she said. “But the best way I could treat my body and recover from all the surgeries and radiation and the cancer is to be as fit as possible and make sure that my immune system is as high as possible, which I do by playing sports.” Mentel-Spee became a Paralympian after having her right leg amputated below the knee after a bone cancer tumour was discovered while she was attempting to qualify for the 2002 Salt Lake City Winter Olympics. She won gold in the same event at Sochi in 2014, the first time the discipline was included in the Winter Olympics. Her Mentelity Foundation helps children with disabilities enjoy board sports, including snowboarding and skateboarding."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"music/2018/mar/12/c2c-festival-review-country-to-country-o2-london-emmylou-harris","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-12T11:17:58Z","webTitle":"C2C festival review – side-eye and satin suits in biggest country celebration yet","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/mar/12/c2c-festival-review-country-to-country-o2-london-emmylou-harris","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/mar/12/c2c-festival-review-country-to-country-o2-london-emmylou-harris","fields":{"headline":"C2C festival review – side-eye and satin suits in biggest country celebration yet","bodyText":"The stetsons start at the tube station, crowning the heads of perhaps half the punters making their way to the opening night of Country to Country 2018. Launched in 2013, the festival has evolved even as country music itself has sprung off down a dozen different byways; starting as a two-night, one-city shindig, C2C now sprawls across three nights and, with the addition of Glasgow and Dublin, three cities. The chrome-plated O2 isn’t a natural home for music rooted in what Sugarland singer Jennifer Nettles calls “brokenness and realness”, but needs must – there are so many stages that it wouldn’t fit anywhere else. Underlining country’s growing stature in the UK, Radio 2 sets aside three primetime hours on Saturday night for a live broadcast. The hats, and the anchoring commitment to realness, are the only constants of an event that heavily favours the new and the now, leaving traditionalism in the hands of a scant few acts, such as Friday headliners Tim McGraw and Faith Hill, and Sunday’s second on the bill, Emmylou Harris. (To be fair, the reception that greets both country’s glamorous first couple and the resplendent Harris hints that tradition is still very much alive.) The millennial artists who are reshaping the genre are here in their numbers, further blurring the lines between country and pop, rock and even rap. A dazzling Lukas Nelson, who has inherited his father Willie’s high-and-lonesome vocal style, pinpoints the way priorities have shifted when he comments: “We play rock’n’roll, but with a little twang.” And sometimes the twang is notably secondary, as with Alabaman Walker Hayes’s set; he thuds and booms with the help of a loop pedal, jabbing an accusing finger at life. Meanwhile, Grammy-winning Sunday headliners Little Big Town look like Abba and open with a none-less-country version of Elton John’s Rocket Man. They later revert to type with warm, rootsy harmonising, but the message is that “country” now means whatever you want it to mean. Even McGraw and Hill arrive holding hands to a Bat Out of Hellish rock overture, followed by the Aretha Franklin/George Michael pop grinder I Knew You Were Waiting for Me. Drawing the biggest crowd of the weekend, the duo play their individual hits but are more powerful when duetting: a soft argument in favour of marriage? While Nashville has never been short of female musicians who can pulverise errant men with one well-turned aphorism, many more have lately been emerging. C2C’s gender-equal billing spotlights so many purposeful, unencumbered women that it’s easy to believe the glass ceiling has taken some sledgehammer blows lately. One of Friday’s key acts, Kelsea Ballerini, honed her style by listening to Taylor Swift; like Swift, she effectively mixes bounciness and pithy side-eye (“I thought I’d miss you, but I miss me more/Miss my own sheets in the bed I made up”). On Sunday, Margo Price follows the sartorial traditions – cowgirl hat, white satin suit – but kicks her set into orbit by getting behind the drumkit and busting out a fabulous swampy groove. Kacey Musgraves, who closes Saturday, is a cheery but self-contained contrast to the weekend’s boisterous spirits. Announcing that she has recently married, she unfurls “trippy” material from her forthcoming album, Golden Hour. It’s a newlywed’s dreamy riposte to the ugliness of current politics, but the arch cynicism of older tracks like Stupid somehow feels more in keeping with the times."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/mar/12/liverpool-prison-symbol-broken-system-send-inmates-home","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-12T09:50:46Z","webTitle":"Liverpool prison is a symbol of our broken system.

Send the inmates home","bodyText":"Prisons are Britain’s dirty little secret. Hospitals may be overcrowded, roads congested, teachers exhausted and students offended. These woes pale against the disgrace that is Britain’s prisons. The news that two long-serving workers at Liverpool jail have been sacked for complaining about conditions caps a litany of dire inspections of this establishment. The workers, of 20 years’ service, were sacked by the private contractor, Amey, for “whistleblowing” to the governor, with “the potential of being incredibly damaging to the firm’s reputation”. So now we know. The repute of a private company matters more than the repute of the prison service. Liverpool’s jail has long been regarded as the most shocking and squalid in the country. In January it was declared “the worst inspectors had seen”, with rats, cockroaches, blocked toilets and pools of urine. Its suicide rate was the country’s highest, its psychiatric care severely deficient. Against a standard of one prison officer to 30 inmates, it had, at times, one to 100. Its budget had fallen by 17% over seven years. It is clearly unfit for purpose. I have visited prisons and make a practice of reading prison reports. They are a salutary corrective to other more vocal lobbies across the public sector. From drug addiction to violence, mental health and the collapse of rehabilitation, nowhere else in the welfare state so fails its customers – who are not just prisoners but the community into which they are released. The Dutch prison service too is close to collapse – from the opposite ailment, underuse. Since a switch to non-custodial sentences for non-violent prisoners, a dozen prisons have been closed and others rented out to Norway and Belgium. In the Netherlands, imprisonment’s bluff has been called. It is not essential to lock men and women in physical and psychological isolation to make society safer. It merely panders to an atavistic public yearning for a peculiarly devastating form of revenge. This pandering has driven Britain’s prison population to an all-time high of almost 100,000; it surged under Tony Blair and David Cameron to double what it was when Thatcher was in power. Meanwhile prison budgets have been slashed by 22% since 2008, severely worsening prison upkeep, staffing, cell overcrowding and rehabilitation. There is just one simple solution. Do not send so many people to jail merely “to pay their debt to society”. Experts reckon no more than one-fifth of prisoners need to be incarcerated for public protection. Other European countries have found punishments less destructive of the individual and less expensive to society – without experiencing social collapse. In other words, Liverpool jail should be closed and most of its prisoners sent home. • Simon Jenkins is a Guardian columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/mar/12/salisbury-mp-convinced-residents-are-safe-from-nerve-agent","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-12T19:00:44Z","webTitle":"Salisbury nerve agent attack: expert criticises lack of information","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/mar/12/salisbury-mp-convinced-residents-are-safe-from-nerve-agent","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/mar/12/salisbury-mp-convinced-residents-are-safe-from-nerve-agent","fields":{"headline":"Salisbury nerve agent attack: expert criticises lack of information","bodyText":"The former commander of the British regiment that specialised in detecting chemical weapons has claimed the authorities were blindsided by the Salisbury attack as he criticised the lack of information given to the public about it. Hamish de Bretton-Gordon, who was a commander of the now disbanded Joint Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear Regiment, claimed the UK was paying the price of the lack of action after chemical attacks in Syria and Iran. De Bretton-Gordon said people in Salisbury were fearful and that the government should have been more open about what the city faced earlier. He was backed by some members of the public who have contacted the Guardian to said they did not feel they had the right information early enough and that a hotline should be launched for anyone with health concerns. The focus of police and military attention has widened to a village just outside Salisbury and a car park that overlooks the spot where the former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter, Yulia, collapsed. Public Health England (PHE) has urged hundreds of people who visited the Zizzi restaurant and Mill pub in Salisbury – where the Skripals ate and drank before collapsing more than a week ago – to wash their clothes and possessions. De Bretton-Gordon, who advises a medical charity in Syria, said: “We’ve been dealing with this kind of thing in Syria for five years and we find the more information we give people, particularly civilians, the better.” His former regiment was disbanded in 2011 as part of a costcutting defence review. “I expect we need a new one as soon as possible,” he said. The UK was blindsided by the Salisbury attack, he said. “There are not many people around with current and deep experience of things like this. “I also think this is symptomatic of the fact that chemical weapons have become the norm. We haven’t done anything about the use of chemical weapons in Syria and Iran. Now we’re paying the price. “If [the Russian president Vladimir] Putin is responsible, he probably doesn’t think anything’s going to happen because we haven’t done anything about chemical weapon use in Syria and Iran. We must reimpose the taboo, the red line, on the issue of chemical weapons, otherwise every dictator, despot, rogue state and terrorist is going to use this stuff.” John Glen, the Conservative MP for Salisbury, said residents were bewildered, disconcerted and angry – but he was convinced they were safe. However, among those who contacted the Guardian was man who was close to the bench before after the Skripals collapsed but before it was cordoned off. He has underlying health issues and has developed other symptoms during the week including vomiting, terrible headaches and muscle seizures. He said he phoned PHE around 11am on Monday morning for advice and they called him back at 4pm and advised him to dial 111. He was concerned that not enough advice had been given to local people. “There hasn’t even been a press release regarding symptoms. I was with my young child in the area last week, after we had been told that there was ‘no risk’. Members of the public have been left wholly in the dark.” A local woman said she believed there was a discrepancy between the advice that the public were given and what she was witnessing. “To see people wearing tremendous protective clothing and then [PHE] saying to the rest of us: you’re fine, wash your clothes, use baby wipes is just extraordinary.” She added: “It doesn’t make sense when I’m looking at a newspaper photograph of five men in space suits and we’re just walking around in ordinary clothes. There should at least be a hotline for people to ring.” There was a flurry of activity in and around Salisbury on Monday afternoon. Police and military personnel arrived in Winterslow, a village about six miles north-east of the city. Some were spotted in hazmat protective suits. Attention focused on an Ashley Wood Recovery van. Last week police were seen at the company’s yard in Salisbury and a BMW believed to belong to Skripal was removed at that time. The first floor of a Sainsbury’s car park that overlooks the bench where the Skripals were taken ill was sealed off and all cars removed. Three uniformed police offices were guarding the area. A Wiltshire man was jailed on Monday for breaching a cordon around the bench where the Skripals were found. Jamie Knight, 30, who was drunk, shouted racist obscenities against Russians and bit an officer and a security guard as they tried to restrain him."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/mar/12/pierre-emerick-aubameyang-frustrated-arsenal-europa-league-absence","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-12T10:27:00Z","webTitle":"Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang frustrated by forced absence from Europa League","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/mar/12/pierre-emerick-aubameyang-frustrated-arsenal-europa-league-absence","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/mar/12/pierre-emerick-aubameyang-frustrated-arsenal-europa-league-absence","fields":{"headline":"Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang frustrated by forced absence from Europa League","bodyText":"Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang says his Uefa-enforced absence from the Europa League has hampered his attempts to find an early rhythm at Arsenal. The striker, who joined for a club record £56m from Borussia Dortmund on the final day of the January transfer window, is cup-tied in the Europa League – which is a huge frustration to him. Arsène Wenger, the Arsenal manager, has criticised the Uefa rule and he believes it will be scrapped, largely because of the huge sums of money involved in mid-season transfers. Aubameyang played for Dortmund in this season’s Champions League but they finished third in their group to drop into the knockout phase of the Europa League, where Arsenal are competing. The 28-year-old has sat out three Europa League ties so far – both legs of the last 32 against Östersunds and the first-leg of the last 16 at Milan, which Arsenal won 2-0. The return is at Emirates on Thursday. It is even more annoying for Aubameyang because the Europa League has come to represent Arsenal’s only hope of salvaging what has been a dismal season. “I can’t play every three days,” Aubameyang said. “When I was in Dortmund, I was playing every three days but now I play once a week or have a long time between games. It is not easy. I am really frustrated because the rules are a bit … I don’t know how to say it in English but I am disappointed because I can’t help my team. That’s life. I have to deal with it.” Aubameyang scored in Sunday’s 3-0 home win over Watford to give him three goals from six appearances for Arsenal. He has shown flashes of his quality inside the penalty area, although he has sometimes been peripheral in build-up play. Aubameyang played only once in January due to the Bundesliga winter break and problems that were linked to his transfer, and he admits he has had to play catch-up. “It was a bit difficult at the beginning [to settle] but I am feeling better,” he said. “I didn’t play a lot in January so it was difficult to find the rhythm. Now I am feeling better. I work hard, I work a lot in the last weeks and I am happy because I feel better.” Aubameyang has walked into the Wenger Out saga and he was asked whether the manager was taken for granted. “Of course,” he replied. “I am really happy because I am here because of him. He had the interest in me so I am happy to play for him.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2018/mar/08/jessica-jones-season-two-review-netflixs-difficult-second-outing-for-its-mould-breaking-superhero","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-08T11:49:17Z","webTitle":"Jessica Jones: season two review – Netflix’s difficult second outing for its mould-breaking superhero","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/mar/08/jessica-jones-season-two-review-netflixs-difficult-second-outing-for-its-mould-breaking-superhero","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2018/mar/08/jessica-jones-season-two-review-netflixs-difficult-second-outing-for-its-mould-breaking-superhero","fields":{"headline":"Jessica Jones: season two review – Netflix’s difficult second outing for its mould-breaking superhero","bodyText":"The first season of Jessica Jones (Netflix) marked something of a revolution for superheroes on TV. It was Batman-moody and had the cool, knowing wit of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, but it tapped into a psychological truth about trauma and pain, which took it to another level. The face-off between Krysten Ritter’s Jessica and David Tennant as her tormentor, Kilgrave, was as pitch-perfect as it was neatly resolved; the season finale offered a grim but cathartic conclusion that tied it all up in a bleak, gruesome bow. Given such precision, season two – available now in its entirety – is a blank slate. Jessica needs a new nemesis, and, with Kilgrave, the bar was set high. Where could the follow-up possibly go? Jessica may have finally freed herself from his mind control, but you can’t free yourself from yourself, and her demons are still in place. She is drinking more than ever, sleeping with sleazy strangers in the bathrooms of bars and wrestling once again with the notion that she may be a killer, after all. Netflix released only the first five episodes early for review, and based on these initial instalments, the show is struggling to find firm ground. For a genre that is all about beefed-up human beings, it’s strange that Marvel series can so often feel so flabby and slow, and it’s disappointing that Jessica Jones falls into that trap here. The first episode is particularly patchy, and at times even dull, alleviated only by a supposedly tense chase scene that turns into an inadvertent homage to Benny Hill. It feels as if it’s reaching for an enemy, uncertain of where those powerful fists will land. There are fragile male egos all over the place who are carrying on Kilgrave’s work. There’s the rival investigator who can’t handle the fact that Jessica is a better PI than he is. When she beats him up for pushing her buttons, his need to establish his superiority becomes unpleasant. “I never take no for an answer,” he tells her. “How very rapey of you,” she replies, drily. There’s a mysterious neighbour who doesn’t want the attention that a woman who can lift his fridge may bring. But both are relatively gentle and thinly drawn distractions from the main event. Thankfully, the show finds its energy in episode three, with the arrival of Janet McTeer as an unknown and potentially malevolent force. McTeer is already shaping up to be a classy addition, and she rescues the show from wisecracking its way around abandoned hospital corridors for too long. The series has a female showrunner, Melissa Rosenberg, and the entire season has been directed by women, so it seems fitting that it is the female characters – in addition to Jessica, of course – who command the most attention this time. (Though, #NotAllMen, Malcolm’s transition from addict neighbour to Veronica Mars wannabe is a welcome development.) Carrie-Anne Moss’s ruthless lawyer, Jeri, is getting bucket-loads of comeuppance from every side, although her predicament looks likely to manoeuvre her into a worryingly ambivalent position. Substitute sister and best friend, Trish, is a fascinating and complex portrait of female ambition. While Trish is dealing with some #TimesUp issues from her child-star past, the show has made the decision to build up her partnership with Jessica, which is turning out to be fun. It’s like two Nancy Drews, if one of them had a serious drinking problem and depressive streak. Trish unlocks some secrets about Jessica’s past that gives the show some much-needed focus, and this provides the solid villainy that seems to fire up its engines. In the aftermath of the childhood car crash that killed her family and left her with that whisky-glass-smashing superstrength, it turns out that there are 20 days missing from Jessica’s life. It’s not a surprise that she has control issues, given what happened in season one, but her mission this time is to find out who changed her life without her consent a long time before Kilgrave arrived. It’s a smart move, and one that turns him into a preface, rather than a postscript. While Tennant is missed, and Jessica Jones stumbles before she finally starts to run, the sludgy pacing may well turn out to be teething troubles yet."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2018/mar/10/putin-the-new-tsar-review-bbc2","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-10T06:30:05Z","webTitle":"Putin: The New Tsar review – a portrait of a lonely, lying narcissist","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/mar/10/putin-the-new-tsar-review-bbc2","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2018/mar/10/putin-the-new-tsar-review-bbc2","fields":{"headline":"Putin: The New Tsar review – a portrait of a lonely, lying narcissist","bodyText":"It was 2006, not long since Vladimir Putin had passed a new law allowing the KGB to kill traitors outside Russia, and soon after Alexander Litvinenko was poisoned after visiting a London sushi bar. Mikheil Saakashvili, the then president of Georgia, remembers being at a banquet with Putin and Aleksandr Lukashenko, the always president of Belarus. Saakashvili was on his way to London and Lukashenko was making jokes about it. Eat well here, he advised Saakashvili, and don’t eat anything in London, especially not sushi. Lukashenko didn’t leave it at that. He said the safest food was Putin’s and passed Putin’s plate to Saakashvili. At which point Putin got cross, dropped his fork and said he had nothing to do with Litvinenko’s murder. If Saakashvili was travelling to Britain today, Lukashenko might advise him not to visit any Italian restaurants in the Salisbury area. And this film, timed to coincide with the run-up to the forthcoming Russian elections, suddenly takes on even more poignancy. It’s an excellent portrait of the man who is certainly going to win at the ballot box, from a boy growing up poor in a St Petersburg flat, to a low-ranking KGB officer with no political ambitions, to accidental power and wealth that he then got a taste for. He accumulated power and wealth at an exponential rate, as well as the ego and narcissism that go with them. The film takes us through his battles with oligarchs and the military campaigns in Ukraine and Crimea, right up to Syria and the interference in foreign elections and referendums. It’s stuffed full of insight and anecdotes from a stellar cast of top-level pundits: foes, politicians, former ambassadors and allies. Chess grandmaster Garry Kasparov is amusing on trying to stand against Putin and having, not just doors slammed in his face but whole airports shut down, as he tried to put together a nationwide campaign. As amusing as the erosion of democracy and civil liberties can be, anyway. Putin’s dacha neighbour and former confidante Sergei Pugachev’s assessment of his erstwhile buddy is good value, too. “First of all he’s a weak man,” he begins. “Secondly, he’s an envious and greedy man, And thirdly he’s a man who always lies.” But the best lines are Putin’s own. Such as: “Sometimes it is necessary to be lonely in order to prove you are right.” And: “I am the wealthiest man, not just in Europe but in the whole world. I collect emotions.” That would be funny, if it weren’t so damn scary."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"film/2018/mar/08/michael-b-jordan-adopts-inclusion-rider-frances-mcdormand-oscar-speech","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-08T11:54:11Z","webTitle":"Black Panther's Michael B Jordan adopts 'inclusion rider' for future projects","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/mar/08/michael-b-jordan-adopts-inclusion-rider-frances-mcdormand-oscar-speech","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/mar/08/michael-b-jordan-adopts-inclusion-rider-frances-mcdormand-oscar-speech","fields":{"headline":"Black Panther's Michael B Jordan adopts 'inclusion rider' for future projects","bodyText":"Black Panther star Michael B Jordan has announced that his production company will be adopting the “inclusion rider” – a clause in contracts demanding projects have diverse casts and crews. His move comes in response to Frances McDormand’s powerful speech at Sunday’s Academy Awards, in which she encouraged the industry to back more stories and projects created by women. “In support of the women &amp; men who are leading this fight, I will be adopting the Inclusion Rider for all projects produced by my company Outlier Society,” Jordan announced on 7 March, posting an image of himself with Outlier Society’s head of production, Alana Mayo, and his agent, Phil Sun. “I’ve been privileged to work with powerful woman &amp; persons of color throughout my career &amp; it’s Outlier’s mission to continue to create for talented individuals going forward.” Outlier Society’s planned projects include a remake of The Thomas Crowne Affair and Netflix sci-fi series Raising Dion, though it is not known when its inclusion rider pledge will be implemented. Jordan is one of the first high-profile players to adopt the principle, since McDormand drew attention to it in her acceptance speech for best actress award at the Oscars. “I have two words to leave with you tonight, ladies and gentlemen: inclusion rider,” she told the audience. Others who have expressed support for the initiative so far include Oscar-winning actor Brie Larson and media company Endeavour Productions. The principle of inclusion riders was first proposed in 2014 by Stacy L Smith of the Annenberg Inclusion Initiative, a thinktank researching inclusion and diversity in the entertainment industry. According to its data, women and people of colour are routinely under-represented on- and off-screen in Hollywood. Its latest survey, in January, found that just 4% of 1,100 top Hollywood movies were directed by women in the past decade, while 5.2% were directed by African Americans and 3.2% by directors of Asian descent. “Imagine the possibilities if a few actors exercised their power contractually on behalf of women and girls,” Smith wrote in 2014. “It wouldn’t necessarily mean more lead roles for females, but it would create a diverse on-screen demography reflecting a population comprised of 50% women and girls. In other words, reality.” Inclusion riders could also stipulate more representation of people of colour, LGBTQ people and people with disabilities, she added."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/mar/08/uk-terror-related-arrests-rose-almost-60-to-record-high-in-2017","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-08T10:32:16Z","webTitle":"UK terror-related arrests rose almost 60% to record high in 2017","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/mar/08/uk-terror-related-arrests-rose-almost-60-to-record-high-in-2017","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/mar/08/uk-terror-related-arrests-rose-almost-60-to-record-high-in-2017","fields":{"headline":"UK terror-related arrests rose almost 60% to record high in 2017","bodyText":"The number of people arrested for terrorism-related offences in Britain rose by 58% to a record high of 412 in 2017 – one of the most intense periods of terrorist attacks in recent history. The Home Office quarterly statistics published on Thursday show there were 412 arrests in 2017 compared with 261 in 216. The record figures include 12 people arrested for the Westminster attacks in March, 23 people linked to the attack in Manchester in May, 21 arrests connected with the London Bridge attack in June and one arrest in connection with the Finsbury Park mosque attack later that month. A further seven arrests were made in connection with the attack on Parsons Green tube station in September. The figures reflect the growing threat from jihadists in Britain. The director general of MI5, Andrew Parker, spoke in October of “a dramatic upshift in the threat this year” to the “highest tempo I’ve seen in my 34-year career”. The detailed Home Office figures show that the 412 arrests in 2017 resulted in 135 people being charged – 110 of them for terrorism-related offences. More than half – 228 or 55% – were released without charge, 33 were released on bail pending further investigation and 13 faced alternative action. So far, 29 of the 110 people charged with a terrorist offence in 2017 have been prosecuted. All of them were convicted. A further 76 are awaiting prosecution. The remaining five cases have either not proceeded or are pending. The latest figures show there were 224 terrorist prisoners in jails in Britain at the end of 2017 – an increase of 24%, or 43, over the previous year – and continuing the upward trend seen in recent years. The overwhelming majority – 86% – held Islamic extremist views while 9% were rightwing extremists including from the recently banned National Action,. The remaining 5% were classified as “other ideologies”. The Home Office announced earlier this month that MI5 had reduced the threat level to Britain from Northern Ireland-related terrorism from substantial to moderate meaning a terrorist attack was possible but not likely. However, the threat to the UK from international terrorism remained at severe, meaning an attack was highly likely. The threat in Northern Ireland from Northern Irish terrorism also remains at severe. The quarterly statistics show that the Metropolitan police has stepped up its use of counter-terror stop and search powers. The number of searches carried out rose 59% in 2017 to 767 from 483 the year before. However, the number of people stopped and examined at ports and airports under counter-terror powers continued to fall in 2017. There were 16,349 examinations last year – a fall of 16% compared with the previous year, reflecting the recent downward trend. The number of people detained under these port powers, however, rose 10% in 2017 from 1,539 to 1,700."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2018/mar/08/from-the-house-of-the-dead-review-royal-opera-house-wigglesworth-warlikowski","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-08T14:27:59Z","webTitle":"From the House of the Dead review – formidable performances humanise Janáček's vision of hell","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/mar/08/from-the-house-of-the-dead-review-royal-opera-house-wigglesworth-warlikowski","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/mar/08/from-the-house-of-the-dead-review-royal-opera-house-wigglesworth-warlikowski","fields":{"headline":"From the House of the Dead review – formidable performances humanise Janáček's vision of hell","bodyText":"Krzysztof Warlikowski’s new Royal Opera staging of Janáček’s From the House of the Dead, the first in the company’s history, opens with silent but subtitled footage of the philosopher Michel Foucault heatedly discussing the prison system, which he analysed, attacked and attempted to reform throughout much of his life. A startling opening to a radical if flawed interpretation, it immediately exposes the tensions and problems to follow. The footage rolls over Janáček’s prelude, played with ferocious power by the ROH orchestra under Mark Wigglesworth. But reading Foucault pulls us away from the music, and our focus blurs. Posthumously premiered in 1930, From the House of the Dead derives from Dostoevsky’s autobiographical 1862 novel that drew on his experience as a political prisoner in Siberia. Janáček focuses on Dostoevsky’s idea of the “spark of God” in every human being that has the potential to redeem even the most hardened criminal. There’s little plot as such, and the opera interweaves an unsparing portrait of prison life with multiple narrations, as the inmates tell each other the stories of their lives. It’s a depiction of a living hell in which the idea of heaven is nonetheless present, as a profoundly touching discussion about the gospels – between the political prisoner Gorjancikov and the damaged yet saintly Aljeja – makes clear. Warlikowski dispenses with Siberia, and relocates the opera to an anonymous modern penitentiary where the Governor scrutinises the prisoners on CCTV and guards surreptitiously supply drugs to the men they brutalise. The atmosphere of incipient violence is powerfully realised, as emotional and sexual frustrations fester, and the prisoners turn on each other as well as their guards. But Warlikowski falters when it comes to the inmates’ narratives by over-elaborating the imagery of the opera’s central scene, in which the prisoners put on plays for each other. A revolving oblong box that contains the Governor’s office gradually morphs into a stage on which the narratives are obliquely re-enacted. As Skuratov (Ladislav Elgr) tells us how he murdered his lover’s husband, the players’ rehearsal behind him glosses the story. Šiškov (Johan Reuter) and Luka (Štefan Margita) gradually become aware that their destinies are horrifically linked as they play out their rivalry for a woman, which has destroyed both of their lives. The narratives themselves, however, are concentrated dissections of the human soul that have their greatest impact when unadorned. Once again, we’re aware of a crucial loss of focus. For all that, however, you need to see it, since the performance itself is formidable. Wigglesworth, using John Tyrrell’s new critical edition, prises open every facet of the score. Playing and choral singing are outstanding, and none of the cast, one of the finest Covent Garden has assembled in recent years, puts a foot wrong. Margita and Reuter make Luka’s and Šiškovs’s anguish palpable. The deepening relationship between Willard White’s Gorjančikov and Pascal Charbonneau’s Aljeja is beautifully done. However, perhaps the most striking performance comes from Nicky Spence as the violent Nikita: the closing scene, in which he finally helps and befriends a prisoner he has previously attacked and injured, heartbreakingly captures Janáček’s faith in humanity even at its darkest, and will linger long after the curtain has fallen. • From the House of the Dead is at the Royal Opera House, London, until 24 March.

The announcement is a significant win for the prospect of a truly national redress scheme for abuse survivors, which has been met with reluctance from other states, including South Australia. The announcement means at least 15,000 people abused in government institutions will be able to access compensation, counselling and other supports through the scheme. Another 21,000 would be covered if churches, charities and other institutions operating in NSW and Victoria opt-in, according to government figures. The chairwoman of the independent council advising government on redress, Cheryl Edwardes, said the decision of NSW and Victoria would be welcomed by abuse survivors. “Having New South Wales and Victoria, the two largest states in terms of people covered, on board will encourage the other states and non-government institutions to commit to the national scheme,” Edwardes said. “We need a national scheme that covers as many survivors of institutional abuse as possible while acknowledging that each individual’s impact was different.” The redress scheme was a key recommendation of the child abuse royal commission, designed as a simple, accessible way for survivors to access compensation. It is designed to further their process of healing, including by providing access to counselling, and requiring institutions to provide a direct response to survivors if they request it. But the federal government’s model, which is still before parliament, differs in several key respects from the royal commission’s detailed recommendations. The proposed legislation will cap payments at $150,000, rather than the $200,000 cap, $65,000 average and $10,000 minimum recommended by the royal commission. It could exclude survivors of offshore detention and would block those convicted of serious criminal offences, which could exclude a significant proportion of survivors. The Coalition has argued the restriction is required to protect the integrity of the scheme, although has indicated it may rethink it. The inclusion of NSW and Victoria prompted Malcolm Turnbull to urge other states to follow their lead. “We owe it to the survivors for their courage in telling stories they have been too afraid to speak of, often for decades,” Turnbull said. “Now that those stories have been told, now that they are on the record, we must do everything within our power to honour those stories and to act and to make sure that this national tragedy is never repeated.” The government says the announcement makes it possible for churches, charities and other institutions in the two states to join the scheme. The NSW premier, Gladys Berejiklian, said the announcement was “vital to acknowledging the suffering of survivors of abuse and supporting them on their journey to recovery”. “It’s unacceptable so many children were sexually abused in an environment where they were entitled to feel safe,” Berejiklian said. “Redress is an important part of recognising the lifelong impact of child abuse on survivors, many of whom carry the scars decades after the abuse occurred.” The Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, said redress would not erase the harm done to survivors. But it could finally give survivors the acknowledgement and dignity they “have long fought for and deserve”, he said. “Victoria wants to ensure that survivors are respected, that their pain and suffering is recognised, and that they get the support they need,” Andrews said. On Wednesday, Labor urged the government to quickly get the states and territories into the scheme. The shadow social services minister, Jenny Macklin, said the royal commission first recommended a redress scheme in 2015. It had taken until March 2018 and states and institutions were yet to sign on, she said. Labor also called for the compensation cap to be lifted to $200,000. “We don’t want to see survivors of child sexual abuse short-changed,” she said, in a joint statement with Mark Dreyfus, the shadow attorney-general. “For too long survivors of institutional child sexual abuse weren’t believed. For too long they’ve waited for justice. “They shouldn’t be made to wait any longer for redress.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/mar/08/myanmar-government-rogue-evil-bangladesh-minister-rohingya-refugees","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-08T07:54:17Z","webTitle":"Myanmar government is rogue and evil, says Bangladesh minister","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/08/myanmar-government-rogue-evil-bangladesh-minister-rohingya-refugees","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/mar/08/myanmar-government-rogue-evil-bangladesh-minister-rohingya-refugees","fields":{"headline":"Myanmar government is rogue and evil, says Bangladesh minister","bodyText":"A senior minister in Bangladesh has condemned the Myanmar government as “evil” and said he did not believe the hundreds of thousands of Rohingya refugees could be repatriated. More than 700,000 Rohingya live in camps on the Bangladesh border of Myanmar after fleeing a campaign of violence by the military across Rahkine state. Many of their homes and villages were burned to the ground, thousands of people were killed and hundreds of women raped. Bangladesh has insisted Rohingya will be sent back but speaking on Tuesday, the finance minister, Abul Maal Abdul Muhith, admitted this was looking increasingly unrealistic. “I do not believe the Rohingya can be sent back,” he said in comments reported by Hindu Business Online. “You can speculate that very few will return to Burma. “The first reason is that Burma will only take a few and secondly is that the refugees will never return if they fear persecution.” A repatriation agreement was signed by the two countries in November, supposedly to begin the process of returning willing Rohingya to Rahkine. It was reiterated in January, stipulating that the Rohingya should be returned within two years. Progress has since stalled, however, with both sides blaming the other for being underprepared. There are also concerns that Rahkine remains unsafe for the minority Muslim community, with most NGOs and organisations such as the UN still banned from operating there. Meanwhile, Rohingya continue to stream over the border to escape persecution. Muhith was outspoken in his condemnation of Myanmar and he described the government as evil. He also criticised its approach to repatriation, saying it would “take 15 [Rohingya refugees] a day when there is 1 million”. “They are evil, a rogue government,” he said. “We have no weakness in diplomacy, everyone is supporting us. But, Burmese are not trustworthy.” His comments come at a time when Bangladesh-Myanmar relations have been antagonised further by a build-up of Myanmar troops on the border, close to a strip of land housing about 6,000 Rohingya. The Myanmar government insisted it was to protect against terrorism. While the Bangladesh prime minister, Sheikh Hasina, has welcomed the persecuted Rohingya, there are signs that the country’s patience is being tested by the hundreds of thousands of refugees occupying land. Poverty is rife in Bangladesh and, with elections this year, the timeline for repatriation of the Rohingya is a controversial issue for the governing Awami League."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/mar/08/pyeongchang-takes-winter-paralympics-to-new-level","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-08T14:22:11Z","webTitle":"North Korea's Paralympic presence raises eyebrows as winter games open","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/mar/08/pyeongchang-takes-winter-paralympics-to-new-level","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/mar/08/pyeongchang-takes-winter-paralympics-to-new-level","fields":{"headline":"North Korea's Paralympic presence raises eyebrows as winter games open","bodyText":"The Paralympics opens on Friday in Pyeongchang in what will be the largest winter Games to date, with 240 medals up for grabs and North Korea making its debut, part of a wider cooling of tensions. The Games will run over 10 days and 670 athletes will compete, over 100 more than in Sochi four years ago, across six sports: para Alpine skiing, para biathlon, para cross-country skiing, sleigh hockey, para snowboarding and wheelchair curling. All eyes will likely be on the North Korean athletes who arrived on Wednesday as part of a 24-member delegation. It will be the first time North Korea has participated in the Winter Paralympics. It sent just one athlete to the summer edition in London and two to the Games in Rio de Janeiro. Six athletes have travelled to Pyeongchang, but only two will actually compete, both in Nordic skiing events. However, South and North Korea will not march together at the opening ceremony of the Winter Paralympics, as they did at the Olympics last month, because they cannot agree on a united flag that erases islands disputed with Japan, officials said. The athletes and officials from the North said little on arrival in South Korea – one senior official said only: “I am pleased” – before they were rushed on to buses bound for Pyeongchang. North Korea’s participation is part of a wider rapprochement on the Korean peninsula, and comes after it sent a delegation of more than 500 people to the Olympics, including cheerleaders and performers. Pyongyang has gone from issuing threats of war to saying it is willing to relinquish its nuclear weapons as part of negotiations with the US. But North Korea’s presence at the Paralympics has raised eyebrows due to a history of claims of official discrimination against disabled people. People are routinely sent to prison camps because of their disability, according to a UN report, and North Koreans who have fled the country have described harassment by the authorities. But adversity has led to some inspiring stories among the competitors. There are a wide range of disabilities, including amputated limbs, blindness, learning disabilities and spinal injuries. Athletes in the same sport compete in different categories based on their disability, to ensure an even playing field. Choi Kwang-hyouk fled North Korea shortly after his left foot was amputated – without anaesthesia – and will represent South Korea in para ice hockey. Brenna Huckaby became the first Paralympian photographed for the Sports Illustrated swimsuit edition and will compete in the two snowboard events. She lost her leg when she had cancer as a child and hopes the publicity will raise awareness of the Paralympics and encourage more people to participate. “We work just as hard as the Olympians,” she said in an interview with the Salt Lake Tribune. Two of the UK’s athletes lost limbs while serving with the military in Afghanistan, with Scott Meenagh’s appearance in Nordic skiing the first for a British athlete in two decades. Owen Pick will be one of Team GB’s first Paralympic snowboarders. The Paralympics organisers have said 275,000 tickets have been sold, about 89% of those made available so far. It’s a huge rise from a number that barely registered in October 2017. But many South Koreans are unaware of the Games, and just days before the opening ceremony a poll showed only about a third of people knew when the Paralympics would begin. Attracting an audience has been one of the main goals of the International Paralympic Committee (IPC), and internet streaming services mean more people can watch events than in previous years. “What is greatly encouraging is that not only do we have more broadcasters but many of them are also dedicating more airtime across all platforms than previous Games editions,” Alexis Schaefer, the IPC’s commercial and marketing director, said in a statement. “We have more broadcasters than ever before set to cover the Winter Paralympics which shows the growing global interest in para sport.” As in the Olympics, Russian athletes will not compete under the Russian flag, but instead as individuals and grouped under the term “neutral Paralympic athlete”. Russia’s Olympic and Paralympic committees were banned following revelations of a state-sponsored doping programme. The Paralympics have not been without controversy, and in recent years organisers have struggled with questions about how athletes are grouped according to their disability. Bethany Woodward, a British sprinter with cerebral palsy, quit competing and handed back a medal after saying more able-bodied athletes were allowed to race against her."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"business/live/2018/mar/08/chinese-exports-trade-wars-trump-tariffs-ecb-mario-draghi-business-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-08T23:50:37Z","webTitle":"Trump tariffs: president signs order on metal imports – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2018/mar/08/chinese-exports-trade-wars-trump-tariffs-ecb-mario-draghi-business-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/live/2018/mar/08/chinese-exports-trade-wars-trump-tariffs-ecb-mario-draghi-business-live","fields":{"headline":"Trump tariffs: president signs order on metal imports – as it happened","bodyText":"And finally, the Guardian points out that Donald Trump shouldn’t be solely blamed for the problems in global trade. In an ideal world, trade would be governed by the doctrines of Adam Smith and David Ricardo. International specialisation and comparative advantage would lead to more efficient production, stronger growth and higher living standards. Countries would unilaterally tear down the barriers to trade. But this is not the way the world actually works. Trade is managed rather than free. Politicians – Mr Trump excepted – talk the language of Smith and Ricardo but act like Alexander Hamilton, whose life has found fame in the hit musical today but is also the original 18th-century architect of US protectionism. Not everybody gains from trade, and some gain a lot more than others. So if there is a trade war Mr Trump will be not the only one to blame. Those who trumpeted the benefits of globalisation said the benefits would be fairly shared. They have not been. They said there would be help for those who lost well-paying jobs. It never arrived. More here: That’s all for today. Thanks for reading and commenting. GW Liam Fox, Britain’s secretary of state for trade, has also criticised Donald Trump’s steel tariffs. Speaking on the BBC’s Question Time current affairs programme, Fox says the US is approaching the problems in the steel industry in the wrong way, by claiming it is a national security issue. He explains that Britain sends 5% of its steel, by tonnage, to America - but it is equal to 15% by value. That’s because Britain produces very high value steel, some of which can’t be sourced in the US. UK steel is also used in US military projects. It is doubly absurd that we should be caught in an investigation in national security. Protectionism and tariffs never really work, he adds.d Here’s our US business editor Dominic Rushe on the tariffs news: Donald Trump pushed forward with plans to impose tariffs on steel and aluminium imports on Thursday, arguing the levies were necessary for national security and to stop the “assault on our country”. Flanked by steel and aluminium workers and key staff, Trump said he had to act to stop the “decimation of entire communities” and insisted there would be a very fair process as the administration used the next 15 days to negotiate exemptions with allies. Canada and Mexico will be exempted. “Steel is steel,” said Trump. “Without steel you don’t have a country.” More here: The first market reaction to the tariff announcement has come in Australia where the ASX200 benchmark is up 0.13%, or 8 points, to 5,946 in the first few minutes of trading. Australia is one of the countries hoping to be granted an exemption from the levies, although US steel imports from the land down under accounts for only 1% of the total and are worth around US$200m. There could be a stiffer test of investor resolve elsewhere in Asia Pacific. Japan supplies nearly 5% of US imports, for example, and South Korea nearly 10%. Both could claim to be equally sound allies of the US and may also hope to have the impact somehow watered down. Nikkei futures are pointing upwards. With this in mind, Michael McCarthy of CMC Markets in Sydney reckons that: Trading in the Asia Pacific region today will likely range from quiet to listless. Despite the announcement of new tariff protection for US industry the real intent of the sanctions, and their impact, is not clear. Markets will await further details and important data due tonight. European Aluminium, a trade body, fear that Europe will suffer from these tariffs, even if European exports into America are ultimately excluded. That’s because more excess capacity could be dumped on Europe’s r side of the Atlantic. Gerd Götz, Director General of European Aluminium, explains: “The US measures hit us where it hurts most. The European aluminium value chain is already under enormous pressure due to unsustainable Chinese overcapacities. The imposed tariff and influx of additional non-European aluminium could have severe economic consequences for SME’s in countries such as Germany, Italy, France, Spain, Sweden and Central and East European countries.” “Unilateral measures such as the US tariffs will not effectively address Chinese overcapacities. This global challenge can only be managed effectively through a global and long-term solution based on multilateral rules and common enforcement like a Global Aluminium Forum within G20,” I neglected to mention earlier, sorry, but Wall Street ended the day higher after Donald Trump’s announcement. The Dow closed 93 points higher, or up 0.38%, at 24,895. The S&amp;P 500 gained 0.45% while the Nasdaq rose by 0.5%. So a modest set of gains, as investors expressed relief that Canada and Mexico weren’t included in the new tariffs. These tariffs create a new test for Britain’s fabled Special Relationship. If Mexico and Canada can get a free pass, surely the UK deserves one too? The Unite union is pushing Theresa May to act fast to protect jobs. Their national officer for steel, Tony Brady, says: “While Mexico and Canada have secured exemptions it appears the UK has not. Steel workers and manufacturing communities who have battled to save the British steel industry over recent years will be looking to prime minister Theresa May to vigorously fight their corner and ensure job destroying tariffs are not slapped on UK steel in the coming weeks. Anything less would be a betrayal to steel workers and their families and deprive US manufacturers of specialist UK steel. France’s finance minister, Bruno Le Maire, says Europe will agree an ‘appropriate response’ to these tariffs. Yesterday, the EC singled out US peanut butter, orange juice and bourbon as likely candidates for retaliatory tariffs.... The proclamation on steel and aluminium tariffs makes the front page of Friday’s Financial Times. They focus on the last-minute softening of the move, to exempt Mexico and Canada. Donald Trump formally adopted new tariffs on steel and aluminium imports on Thursday while allowing US allies to apply for exemptions, a sign of growing concern in Washington that the president was alienating America’s closest international partners. US commerce secretary Wilbur Ross has told CNBC that America needs to impose broad tariffs, to prevent China circumventing them. Ross claimed: “China has been very clever at transshipping products through other countries and dislodging domestic demand in other countries, which causes their producers to dump on us.” “So the reason we have to go on a broader basis is to deal with the problems of transshipment and the problems of displacement.” Senator John McCain has also criticised the tariffs, saying they will cost jobs, hurt the economy and damage relations with America’s allies. McCain also disputes the ‘national security’ justification, saying it isn’t backed up by evidence. He says it could actually backfire: According to the Department of Defense, U.S. military requirements for steel and aluminum each represent only about three percent of U.S. production. The Department of Defense assesses that its programs are able to acquire all the steel and aluminum necessary to meet national defense requirements. In fact, by potentially triggering significant increases in the price of steel and aluminum, President Trump’s new tariffs could harm our national defense by raising the cost of production for critical military systems needed to sustain the United States’ comparative military advantage against our adversaries, from ships, to armored vehicles, to fighter aircraft. There is some relief that Donald Trump has softened his stance on tariffs, by giving Canada and Mexico a free pass. This could calm worries of a full-blown trade war breaking out. Economist Shane Oliver of AMP Capital says: Top Republican Paul Ryan, the speaker of the House of Representatives, has criticised the decision to impose tariffs on US imports of steel and aluminum. Ryan warns that it could have ‘unintended consequences’ (that’s code for cost jobs and hurt growth). He welcomes the decision to exempt Canada and Mexico, but says other American allies should be included. And on China, Ryan agrees that “bad trade practices” are occurring, but believes targeted measures would work better: Donald Trump has given his strongest hint yet that Australia will be exempt from the US tariffs on steel and aluminium imports, but did not outline any details. During the formal announcement of the tariffs, he made strong hints that Australia would be given special consideration. “We’re are going to be very fair, we’re going to be very flexible, but we’re going to protect the American worker,” he said, adding: “We’re negotiating with Mexico, we’re negotiating with Canada. We have a very close relationship with Australia. We have a trade surplus with Australia. Great country, long-term partner. We’ll be doing something with them. We’ll be doing something with some other countries.” The US is not a major market for Australian steel – it accounts for only about 0.8% of Australia’s steel exports and about 1.5% of aluminium exports – but the tariffs have triggered wider fears of a trade war which could affect Australia’s trade-exposed economy and that of its largest trading partners, including China. In the UK, union leaders are pushing the British government to ask for an exemptions to these tariffs. Gareth Stace, UK Steel Director, says: It is of course promising to note that flexibility may be provided by the US administration to grant national exemptions on national security grounds and it is vital that the EU and UK authorities now do all they can to deliver this. Stace also worries that excess steel could now be dumped in Europe, rather than sold into America. We must ensure our market is not now destabilised by millions of tonnes of steel diverted away from the US to the EU. We trust and hope that the UK Government will support such measures in due course.” Now for the backlash! Republican Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona has announced he will introduce a law to undo these tariffs. Reuters has the details: US Republican Senator Jeff Flake said on Thursday he would introduce a law to nullify President Donald Trump’s aluminum and steel tariffs, which Trump finalized in a proclamation earlier in the day. The Republican chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, Orrin Hatch, also criticized the tariffs but said he would work with the White House to “mitigate the damage.” President Trump has one last message for Beijing, as he leaves the room. He says America will hopefully have a great relationship with China, but something has to be done about the trade deficit. He seems to suggest this deficit is $500bn ( Trump then does the official signing... Oops! There’s a moment of levity, as the president of a local steel union, Scott Sarge, thanks president Trump for implementing these tariffs. Trump, showing his people skills, tells Sarge that his father Herman will be looking down proudly. Oh he’s still alive, Scott insists, as the room cracks up. He’s even more proud of you then, replies the president quickly. Nice save.... We’re now hearing from the US steel workers who are attending today’s proclamations. Dustin Stephens from Kentucky explains that his factory is only running at 40% capacity. He’s confident that they can move back to full capacity. Some of the countries who treat America the worst on trade and military relationships like to say they are our allies, Trump says - a remark that might worry Europrean politicians. President Trump cites this tweet from technology entrepreneur Elon Musk, showing how China currently has higher tariffs than America: We are pushing for more reciprocal tax programs in future, Trump says. Importantly, President Trump says he is open to modifying or removing the tariffs, as long as countries can prove that they don’t threaten America’s national security. He also confirms that the tariffs don’t begin for 15 days, while the US checks who treats it fairly and who is paying their bills (a reference to military spending). Trump also confirms that he’ll hold off on tariffs for Canada and Mexico. And on China, he pledges that the trade deficit (which jumped last year) will fall. Donald Trump says he is delivering on one of his most important campaign pledges. Previous politicians have let people down, he says, by not protecting the US steel and aluminum industry. Factories were “left to rot and to rust”, communities turned into ghost towns. That betrayal is now over, he adds. Trump says that his tariffs are already having an effect. He points out that US Steel yesterday announced it will reopen a steel furnace at its site at Granite City, Illinois. That’s happening all over the country, he continues. Trump says Century Aluminum will reopen a plant to create military-grade aluminum facility. It’s official. Donald Trump confirms that the US is taking action to correct the “travesty” of unfair steel and aluminum dumping on the American market. He is, as expected, imposing a 25% tariff on steel imports, and 10% on aluminum. If you want to avoid these tariffs, Trump continues, you should set up your steel plant in America - and also benefit from his tax cuts. Donald Trump has arrived. He pays tribute to the steel workers, saying they are the backbone of the US...and one of the reasons he’s here in the White House. Steel is steel, he continued. If you don’t have steel, you don’t have a country. A group is assembling in the White House, ready for the proclamation to be signed. Treasury secretary Stephen Mnuchin and Commerce secretary Wilbur Ross are there, along with a group of US steel workers. A government official has confirmed to Reuters that Donald Trump’s import tariffs on steel and aluminum will start in 15 days with initial exemptions for Canada and Mexico and the possibility of alternatives for other nations The Mexican stock market has jumped by almost 1% - on relief that Mexico will get an ‘indefinite exemption’ from the steel and aluminum tariffs (according to AP). Canada’s market is also rising, up 0.5%. UK MP Stephen Kinnock, whose constituency in South Wales includes Britain’s Port Talbot steel works, argues that Donald Trump’s tweets will hurt America’s economy (and the UK). The US stock market is also pushing higher. The Dow is up 73 points, or 0.3%, at 24,875, having fallen into the red earlier today. The Canadian dollar has jumped against the US dollar, shrugging off its earlier losses. Traders are welcoming AP’s report that Canada will be exempt from the tariffs. AP are also reporting that other countries can make their case to be spared these tariffs. Form an orderly queue.... Newsflash: Associated Press are reporting that Canada and Mexico have got an indefinite exemption on the new tariffs. For other countries, they’ll start in 15 days, apparently. At the today’s cabinet meeting, Donald Trump told reporters that his steel and aluminum tariffs would be flexible. The president explaines: “I’m sticking with 10 and 25 (percent) initially. I’ll have a right to go up or down, depending on the country, and I’ll have a right to drop out countries or add countries.” That should keep everyone on their toes. It’s also the sort of unilateral approach that ECB president Mario Draghi criticised today. The president has tweeted some photos from his cabinet meeting: Frankly, it’s too male for International Women’s Day. Fortunately the president has Melania on hand to redress the balance. She’ll be presenting the International Women of Courage Award to 120 women from more than 65 countries. It’s on! The White House has updated President Trump’s daily schedule, adding that he “will sign the Section 232 Proclamations on Steel and Aluminum Imports at 3:30PM ET”. That’s 8.30pm UK time. Anticipation is building as we wait to see exactly what Donald Trump does in two and a half-hours time. Despite the criticism, the president is expected to press on and announce new tariffs on steel and aluminum. metals imports. But he’s already hinted that ‘friends’ will get special treatment. My colleague Dominic Rushe has the latest: Donald Trump on Thursday looked set to push forward with plans to impose tariffs on steel and aluminium imports, a plan that threatens to undermine decades of detente in international trade. The president will meet metal industry executives and workers at the White House on Thursday afternoon to discuss the controversial levies. Officials from China and Europe have threatened retaliation if Trump goes ahead with his plan. “Looking forward to 3.30pm meeting today at the White House,” the president wrote on Twitter before the meeting. “We have to protect &amp; build our Steel and Aluminum Industries while at the same time showing great flexibility and cooperation toward those that are real friends and treat us fairly on both trade and the military.” Trump’s plan is to impose a 25% tariff on imports of steel, and a 10% tariff on aluminium. The initial plan was for a global levy, although it now appears that Australia, Canada and Mexico and other countries will be exempted. Other exceptions for some US companies may also be allowed. The London stock market has closed higher, as investors cling to hopes that a trade war can be averted. The FTSE 100 index of top shares ended 45 points higher at 7,203, up 0.6%. Mario Draghi’s trenchant criticism of unilateral trade actions has caused a stir. Paul Hannon of the Wall Street Journal says it was a remarkable blunt comment from a central banker: David Lamb, head of dealing at FEXCO Corporate Payments, says Draghi gave a clear warning of the dangers of trade wars: “How very European. Mario Draghi’s retort to Donald Trump’s swaggering trade war rhetoric was a rhetorical question – if you slap tariffs on your friends, who are your enemies? “The short answer, of course, is everyone. And the ECB chief was keen to stress that starting a trade war is a zero sum game. With no winners, only losers. “He also aimed an economist’s barb at the US President – reminding Mr Trump that previous trade wars have typically led to a strengthening of the Dollar. “With US exporters finally reaping the benefits of a softer Greenback, they need a resurgent Dollar like they need a hole in the head. Katie Martin of the FT says Draghi brought some much-needed maturity to the debate. Mario Draghi ducked the question on what makes a good ECB president. But he could have cited the ability to talk down your currency. The ECB president successfully downplayed the ECB’s decision to drop its pledge to boost its asset-purchase scheme if needed, calling it a ‘backward looking’ and ‘unanimous’ move. This has persuaded the markets that the ECB hasn’t suddenly turned hawkish - so traders have sent the euro down against the dollar (down 0.5% to $1.235). That’s good for eurozone exports, and inflationary pressures. And finally... Q: Should we throw away the old economics books and come up with a new way of measuring inflation? Draghi says this was a popular idea a year ago [when inflation had been wallowing below zero]. Some people thought the ECB should either cut its inflation target to zero (admitting defeat), or raise it to 4% (to force a change in inflation expectations). In what looks like another pop at Donald Trump, Mario Draghi has also warned that financial deregulation could be a threat to the world economy. Q: As it’s International Women’s Day, isn’t it a shame that the ECB is appointing a man, Spain’s Luis de Guindos, as its new vice-president? ECB chief Mario Draghi confirms that the governing council approved de Guindos’s appointment today, saying he’ll be a “very, very good colleague”. But he also admits that the gender balance at the ECB should be improved “at all levels”. Draghi says that the Bank is “working on improving our gender situation”, and reveal that progress has been slower than hoped. In 2013, the Bank set explicit targets on gender balance for the first time - and it is currently falling short. At the end of last year, 27% of management position were held by women, compared to an interim target of 29% For the most senior roles, 17% were held by women against an interim target of 24% Draghi says: So we’ve got to do some work here. The ECB is now asking headhunters to focus on gender in the recruitment process, and encouraging business managers to keep vacancies open until the objective is reached. Recruiting panels will now have “a considerable presence of women”, he explains: Often there are unconscious biases that play a role, and that’s why its necessary to ensure a much more significant presence of women on the recruitment panels. Asked about support for eurosceptic parties in Italy, Draghi says that the euro is irreversible. ECB president Draghi also criticises politicians around the world for not doing more to tackle inequality. He says: If there is one aspect where policies, all over the world, have been insufficient, it was to take care of distributional consequences of polices that were positive for growth but not necessarily for equity. Asked about last Sunday’s Italian elections, Draghi warns “protracted instability” could undermine confidence, and thus growth. Q: Should you make your guidance more explicit, to prevent a market panic similar to the one in the US recently? Draghi says last month’s market turmoil was triggered by unexpectedly strong wage data - which made traders rethink the likely pace of US interest rate rises. We don’t have such robust wage growth in the eurozone, so there’s not the same risk. Q: What has changed in the last seven weeks to lead the ECB to drop its easing bias today? Draghi points to the latest (small) growth upgrade, which confirmed the ECB’s existing confidence. Q: How could an ECB president with a different approach to QE take the central bank on a different path? Your questions suggest I’m going to leave tomorrow, Draghi replies, mock-hurtly. I’ll be around for a while yet, he insists (until 31st October 2019, I think). Q: After six years in the job, what do you think are the most important skills to be ECB president? Easy question, Draghi smiles. “I let others judge”. [Draghi’s term ends in late 2019, so speculation over his successor is building] Asked about the Italian economy, Draghi says that fiscal consolidations is particularly important in countries which have high debts (such as Italy) Mario Draghi says there are three questions when assessing the impact of Trump’s tariffs Will there be retaliations? How will the exchange rate react? In the past, the dollar has appreciated, but it could be different this time The effect on confidence - this can be very difficult to assess. If it’s negative, then that’s a negative impact on inflation and output. Asked about trade, Mario Draghi explains that Donald Trump’s tariff plans are a concern, for two reasons. Draghi says that the immediate spillover effects of the trade measures won’t be that big. But that’s not the problem. Whatever convictions one has about trade.... we are convinced that disputes should be discussed and resolved in a multilateral framework. Unilateral decisions are dangerous. Also, there is a certain worry about the state of international relations, he continues. If you put tariffs against your allies, one wonders who the enemies are. Victory cannot be declared yet on inflation, says Draghi, in response to another question. Q: Are the Latvian authorities infringing central bank independence, through their investigation into Latvia’s central bank chief Ilmars Rimsevics (who was detained under a bribery probe last month)? Draghi says the ECB is sending a letter to the European Court of Justice about the issue. We are asking for clarification on whether the security measures imposed on the Latvia central bank governor have had the effect of relieving him from office, and whether they comply with European law, he adds. On to questions. Q: Why has the ECB dropped its promise to expand its asset-purchase scheme if needed? Draghi says that promise had been added to the ECB’s monthly statement back in 2016, when the situation was very different. He also points out that the ECB has kept its other pledge -- to run its asset purchases until September 2018 ‘or beyond, if necessary’. The decision to change the language was unanimous, Draghi reveals. Draghi ends his statement by calling for the implementation of structural reforms in euro area countries to be substantially stepped up. He also calls for ‘specific and decisive’ action to complete Europe’s banking union. The ECB has revised down its forecast for inflation in 2019, from 1.5% to 1.4%. It still expects inflation to be just 1.4% in 2018, rising to 1.7% in 2020. Encouragingly, Mario Draghi says that eurozone growth will growth will expand by a somewhat faster pace than earlier expected. The ECB staff have revised up their growth forecasts for 2018, but they remain unchanged for 2019 and 2002. Here are the new forecasts: 2.4% in 2018 (up from 2.3% in December) 1.9% in 2019 (unchanged) 1.7% in 2020 (unchanged) But Draghi also warns that growth could be threatened by various downside risks, including protectionism. That’s a clear warning that a trade war would hurt the eurozone’s recovery. A timely warning, as Donald Trump is expected to sign off his steel and aluminium tariffs in a few hours time. European Central Bank president Mario Draghi has arrived for his press conference to explain today’s monetary policy decisions. He confirms that the ECB’s Governing Council left interest rates unchanged, and expects them to remain at their present levels for an extended period of time, and well past the horizon of the net asset purchases. On non-standard monetary policy measures (the QE bond-buying scheme), Draghi says they will run until the end of September 2018, or beyond, and until the Governing Council sees a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation towards its inflation target. But as already flagged up, Draghi does not mention the ECB’s previous pledge to expand QE if needed. It’s been dropped from the statement. The European Central Bank is moving towards ending its stimulus programme altogether, in around a year’s time, says Danielle Haralambous of the Economist Intelligence Unit: Ranko Berich of Monex Europe says Europe’s economic recovery means the ECB didn’t need to promise to do more QE if needed. ING’s Carsten Brzeski thinks the hawkish members of the governing council are gaining momentum (that includes Germany’s Jens Weidmann, a candidate to succeed Mario Draghi) Jon Ferro of Bloomberg points out that the ECB is still rather dovish, and will remain so until inflation gets back close to 2% (it’s just 1.2% today). This is the phrase which has vanished from the European Central Bank’s monetary policy statement: If the outlook becomes less favourable, or if financial conditions become inconsistent with further progress towards a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation, the Governing Council stands ready to increase the asset purchase programme (APP) in terms of size and/or duration. By removing it today, the ECB is signalling to the markets that it won’t boost its bond-buying scheme - which is buying €30bn of bonds each month until September (at least). Mike Bird of the Wall Street Journal has highlighted how the ECB has changed its position: The euro has jumped against the US dollar, clawing back its early losses: BREAKING: The European Central Bank has left interest rates across the eurozone unchanged, as expected. That means the headline cost of borrowing stays at zero, a record low. More importantly, it has dropped its pledge to enlarge its stimulus programme, if the eurozone economic outlook deteriorates. Previously, the ECB has given an explicit pledge to extend its quantitative easing bond-buying programme, if needed. That language has now vanished from today’s statement from the governing council. Instead, the ECB simply says: Regarding non-standard monetary policy measures, the Governing Council confirms that the net asset purchases, at the current monthly pace of €30 billion, are intended to run until the end of September 2018, or beyond, if necessary, and in any case until the Governing Council sees a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation consistent with its inflation aim. This is a sign that the ECB is moving, slowly, towards ending its massive stimulus programme.... More to follow. Breaking: It looks like Donald Trump will be signing the order to implement steel and aluminium tariffs later today: (That’s 8.30pm UK time). US media have reported that steel and aluminum workers are being flown to Washington for the event. But what does “great flexibility” mean? It’s probably a hint that Canada and Mexico will be exempt (assuming a deal is reached over NAFTA). Europe will be hoping that it also counts as a ‘real friend’ -- given the close ties between NATO members, for example. Over in Westminster, the UK government’s confidential Brexit impact assessment reports have been published (this is the report that leaked recently). It outlines various scenarios for the UK’s relationship with the EU and beyond after Brexit; worryingly, all scenarios shows an adverse effect on the UK economy, and damage to key industries. Andy Sparrow has full details in his Politics liveblog. Sky News’s Faisal Islam has been tweeting the key charts: If Jamie Dimon is right about Trump’s tariffs creating a ‘Pandora’s box of problems’, what might crawl out of it? Salman Ahmed, chief investment strategist at Lombard Odier Investment Managers reckons there are two possible scenarios - one in which other countries let the US get away with, and one where they retaliate. Here they are: Benign scenario – A one-off crowd-pleasing move by Trump: “So far, US economic policy under Trump has focused on growth-enhancing measures to decrease regulation and reduce taxes. This lurch towards populism is something we have seen before with promises of a border wall and Border Adjustment Tax - but which has never truly materialised despite the heavy rhetoric. The key is whether other countries take this as a one-off, crowd-pleasing move by Trump and do not participate to create a vicious cycle. Merkel’s fourth term confirmation is a welcome development in this context, and China’s stance will be equally important. If both of these key blocs do not over-react, there is a strong possibility that this ends with steel and aluminium. These are both insignificant when it comes to the state of the global economy, but still useful ammunition as an over-charged rhetoric.” Negative scenario – full blown trade war: “This scenario was last in play right after Trump’s election in November 2016, when fears of a China-US trade war came into focus. At that time, the Trump administration did not follow up on its strong pre-election rhetoric and markets started focusing on his policy views around lower taxes and reduced regulations. However, with tariffs on steel and aluminium, we now have a concrete measure and the two worrying elements of this policy move are the domino effects of a tit-for-tat vicious cycle, coupled with negative signalling when it comes to US-China trade relations. What puts some additional weight to the probability of this scenario is the direct involvement of two trade hawks, Wilbur Ross and Peter Navarro, as the driving force behind this policy shift, which now seems to be offsetting the positives coming from the departure of Steve Bannon from the Trump administration.” Another front cover for Donald Trump’s bathroom wall: Here’s our news story about the slump in profits at John Lewis: And here’s some reaction: Shares in Marks &amp; Spencer are down 1.8%, while Dixons Carphone have lost 3%. Bloomberg have helpfully created some video clips of Jamie Dimon discussing tariffs.... Breaking: Jamie Dimon, the head of banking giant JP Morgan has criticised Donald Trump’s plan to impose tariffs on steel and aluminium imports. Speaking on Bloomberg TV right now, Dimon says that “we don’t believe in these tariffs”. He agrees that global trade needs reforms, but fears that Trump’s plan could hurt the economy and trigger retaliations. Dimon, who has previously backed Trump policies such as tax reforms, says: There are serious issues around trade. WTO needs to get its act together and get a little more ambitious about fixing some of these problems, but I think tariffs is the wrong way to go about it. There may be more, there may be retaliations, it kinda opens up a whole Pandora’s Box of additional problems.... It could escalate and it could hurt growth”. Business leaders, Dimon continues, would rather see the US set out its strategy on trade properly, and negotiate with other countries in an organised fashion. Then, if you don’t get what you want, you take action. Dimon also says the resignation of Gary Cohn as Trump’s top economic advisor is “terrible”. He knows how an economy runs, he know how to make it run better for all Americans, and he’s not there, Dimon adds. Just in: Workers at UK retail chain John Lewis are getting their smallest bonus in decades, after profits slumped last year. John Lewis has reported its profits, before exceptional items, shrank by 21.9% in the last year. Pre-tax profits plunged 77%, to £103.9m. Its Waitrose supermarket chain was hit by falling profit margins, due to “the weaker exchange rate and commitment to competitive pricing”. John Lewis is owned by its staff, or partners, who receive a percentage of each year’s profits as a bonus. This year, the bonus has fallen to just 5%. Last year it was 6%, the lowest in 63 years. Sir Charlie Mayfield, Chairman of John Lewis Partnership, warns that 2018 will be tough too: We expect trading to be volatile in 2018/19, with continuing economic uncertainty and no let up in competitive intensity. We therefore anticipate further pressure on profits. It’s a bad morning for Turkish assets, after Moody’s slashed its credit rating last night. Moody’s cited the “loss of institutional strength” recently under President Erdogan, and the growing risk of an “external economic shock” due to Turkey’s debts and current account deficit. It downgraded Turkey to Ba2 from Ba1. The lira slid against the euro, and traders also piled out of Turkish government bonds, as Fercan Yalinkilic of Bloomberg shows: European stock markets are becalmed this morning, as traders wait for this afternoon’s ECB meeting - and any fresh developments over trade. In London the FTSE 100 is basically flat. Among smaller companies Countrywide, Britain’s biggest estate agent, has slumped by 13% after it posted a £208m loss and called 2017 “a disappointing year. Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets says Countrywide is suffering from its own mistakes, as well as the slowdown in the UK property markets The company is paying dearly for the acquisitive growth that helped its shares climb 80% to peak at 700p just 12-months after its March 2013 IPO. The problem is that the seemingly unbreakable UK housing market finds itself under increasing pressure with buyers deterred by economic uncertainty related to Brexit and the prospect of higher interest rates, letting investors hampered by both tax changes and rate hikes, clear slowing in house price growth and of course fierce competition from cheaper on-line selling alternatives. Shares rose on China’s stock market, and beyond, as its strong export data cheered traders. The CSI 300 index has closed 1% higher, while the Hong Kong Hang Seng index gained 1.5%. China has also waded into the row over steel tariffs, warning that it will take a necessary response if America begins a trade war. China’s foreign minister Wang Yi said Beijing hopes to work in partnership with the US, and that a trade war would be a mistake. However, he also cautioned that China wouldn’t stand by, if tariffs were imposed on steel and aluminium exports into America. Wang said: Especially given today’s globalisation, choosing a trade war is a mistaken prescription. The outcome will only be harmful. “China would have to make a justified and necessary response. More here: Betty Wang, senior china economist at ANZ in Hong Kong, says China is benefitting from the strong global economy. The broad-based recovery in China’s major export markets could explain part of the reason why exports were still quite strong. But Xia Le, chief Asia economist at Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria, warns that Donald Trump’s plans for new tariffs could derail Chinese growth. “Global demand remains robust and the economies of the U.S. and Europe are expanding, that’s the biggest boost for Chinese exports. “The risk of a trade war in which Trump increases tariffs for a broader scope of products seems to be rising.” China has spiced up the growing debate over trade wars by posting its biggest jump in exports in three years. Chinese exports jumped by a blistering 44.5% in February, smashing forecasts of a 13% gain, and up from 11.1% in January. It’s the biggest jump since early 2015. Imports, though, were more modest - rising by just 6.3%. This data can be distorted by currency fluctuations, and seasonal factors (factories shut down at various times for the Lunar New Year). But the broad pattern is pretty clear. Some experts would argue that strong Chinese exports show that the world economy is in good heath. But these figures could also used by protectionist voices to argue that China is getting an unfair deal, boosting its trade at the expense of others. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets says: This morning’s Chinese trade data are only likely to reinforce the US administration’s perception of unfair trade as Chinese exports were seen to show a rise 44.5% in February, the best performance in over two years. Rather than show that the global economy appears to be in fairly good health, they are likely to be used as further evidence by President Trump’s trade hawks that his current policy is appropriate. I’ll pull some reaction together now. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. All eyes are on the European Central Bank today, as Mario Draghi and colleagues meet to set monetary policy across the eurozone and release their latest economic forecasts on growth and inflation. As usual, Draghi’s press conference will be the main event. He’ll be asked whether the ECB is considering ending its huge bond-buying stimulus programme, and will probably get a few questions about Donald Trump’s tariffs and the Italian election deadlock too. Konstantinos Anthis of ADS Securities research says: Today the focus will be on the European Central Bank rate decision and Mario Draghi’s thoughts on the progress of the Euro area. Investors are eager to find out whether the head of the ECB is ready to start tweaking the bank’s forward guidance and prepare market participants for the gradual unwinding of their QE program. There’s a debate between analysts on whether Draghi will want to introduce changes to his rhetoric today or instead hold off until early summer. Investors are still worrying about the dangers of a global trade war. However, the markets are a little calmer today after press secretary Sarah Sanders suggested that some countries could be granted an exemption from looming tariffs on steel and aluminium. Sanders told reporters: “There are potential carve-outs for Canada and Mexico based on national security, and possibly other countries as well”. But with Europe threatening countermeasures, and various WTO members alarmed by Trump’s plans, the situation is still unclear.

The state government introduced the land-clearing laws last year, however they lapsed when the election was called. The state’s natural resources minister, Anthony Lynham, reintroduced the laws to parliament on Thursday, after the Labor government promised to do so if elected to a second term in power. Rates of clearing surged when the state’s former premier Campbell Newman promised to scrap restrictions, which his Liberal National party government did in December 2013. Rates then reached a plateau of about 300,000ha for several years. But Queensland again underwent a dramatic surge in tree clearing – with the heaviest losses in Great Barrier Reef catchments – as the Palaszczuk government attempted to restore the protections. This attempt was blocked at the 11th hour when its former MP turned crossbencher Billy Gordon sided with the LNP. Figures released in October showed a 33% rise in clearing to almost 400,000 hectares in 2015-16, giving Queensland two-thirds the annual rate of deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon. The resurgence of clearing suggested “panic clearing” by rural landholders – primarily graziers – in anticipation of Labor’s latest changes going through. Lynham told parliament that the new laws would put back in place a framework for the protection of native vegetation in Queensland. “These laws will protect our climate, our wildlife and our Great Barrier Reef, and the tens of thousands of jobs that depend on the Reef,” Lynham said. “Landholders will still be able to maintain their land and clear fodder trees to feed their stock, and the majority of landholders will continue to do the right thing, as they do now.” Labor says the policy will reduce land degradation, protect water quality, reduce greenhouse gas emissions and sustain biodiversity. The Queensland Conservation Council has welcomed the introduction of the new laws. The Queensland Conservation Council head, Dr Tim Seelig, said the new laws would draw a line “on a brief but shameful period in our recent history”. “Recent land-clearing figures show a disastrous increase in land-clearing rates in Queensland, including in Great Barrier Reef catchments, resulting in tens of millions of native animals being killed every year and countless habitats destroyed,” Seelig said. “Right now, we have a massive land-clearing crisis on our hands. We simply can’t keep bulldozing our native woodlands. That’s not a pathway to a healthy, sustainable future.” Seelig said strengthening land-clearing laws had not caused a downturn in agricultural productivity in the past. “Despite scare campaigns and misinformation from farming lobby groups, stronger laws, land restoration and carbon farming will be good for both the economy and environment.” WWF-Australia said the bill was a major step forward in the battle to end the state’s tree-clearing crisis. The WWF-Australia conservation director, Paul Toni, said that the “acid test” for the proposed legislation was if it could drive down excessive clearing rates, which had resulted in more than one million hectares of bushland being bulldozed in four years. More than 5,000 koalas were killed between mid-2012 and mid-2016 due to large scale land-clearing, the WWF-Australia says. “Scientists have repeatedly warned that koalas could become extinct in Queensland unless habitat destruction stops.” The Wilderness Society said the proposed laws were a good start but there were “a range of outstanding issues” that the state government needed to address to stop broadscale clearing. The Wilderness Society’s campaign manager, Gemma Plesman, said the legislation “will not stop all clearing of remnant vegetation”. “The challenge for the government now is to put in place the plans and policies to protect all remnant and high conservation value vegetation as outlined in its election policy.” Plesman also said the government needed to act to ensure that panic clearing did not occur. “Already more than 1 million hectares has been targeted for clearing this year so there should be no reason to clear without approval,” she said. The bill will now go through the committee process, with a report due back in parliament by 23 April."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/mar/09/child-protection-report-reveals-soaring-number-of-investigations","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-08T17:00:12Z","webTitle":"Child protection report reveals soaring number of investigations","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/mar/09/child-protection-report-reveals-soaring-number-of-investigations","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/mar/09/child-protection-report-reveals-soaring-number-of-investigations","fields":{"headline":"Child protection report reveals soaring number of investigations","bodyText":"One in 32 Australian children were subject to a protection investigation or response last financial year, a new report has found, with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children and children from lower socio-economic backgrounds and remote areas continuing to be over-represented. It also revealed the rate of Indigenous child removals dropped in the year to 30 June 2017, despite rates of substantiated cases of abuse rising. The Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) released its report on child protection data from 2016-17 on Friday, amid national outcry about child safety after the alleged rape of a two-year-old girl in Tennant Creek. It revealed increases of between 27% and 45% in substantiated notifications, care and protection orders, and out-of-home care, in the four years to 30 June 2017. Almost three-quarters of the 168,352 children receiving protection services were “repeat clients”, it said. Rates of substantiated abuse cases increased further with remoteness and low socioeconomics, particularly for Indigenous children. The report found almost half of Indigenous children who were the subject of substantiated notifications were from the lowest socioeconomic areas. Indigenous children were still seven times more likely to receive child protection services and the rate was increasing at a much faster rate than for non-Indigenous children. The rate of Indigenous children on care and protection orders was 10 times higher. Emotional and physical abuse were the dominant reasons for substantiated notifications in every state and territory except South Australia and the NT, where neglect was the highest proportion. Non-Indigenous children were more likely to be the subject of a notification about sexual abuse than Indigenous children, and girls were more likely than boys. The report said the reasons for higher rates of Indigenous children receiving protection services were “complex” and included the legacy of past policies such as forced removal, intergenerational trauma, a higher likelihood of living in lower socioeconomic areas and “perceptions arising from cultural differences in child-rearing practices”. “Drug and alcohol abuse and family violence might also be contributing factors,” it said. “Indigenous children are also over-represented in other areas related to child safety, including hospital admissions for injuries and assault, experiences of homelessness, and involvement in the youth justice system.” The AIHW data was collected in 2016-2017, predating the current Northern Territory crisis, but the figures reflected the concerns of many in the region, particularly in the Indigenous community. Residents of Tennant Creek have accused the NT government of ignoring its requests for help with high rates of alcohol and drug abuse, violence and child protection before the alleged assault on the two-year-old, whose family had been subject to multiple substantiated notifications. The general manager of the Anyinginyi Health Aboriginal Corporation in Tennant Creek, Barb Shaw, said vulnerable people in regional areas did not have wide access to or choice of services, and needed a greater level of help. According to the AIHW the NT had more than three times the national rate of children subject to substantiated notifications. The NT royal commission heard from multiple witnesses about a protection system that failed children and sometimes cut corners to deal with the backlog of cases. Of the more than 230 substantiated cases of child sexual abuse in the NT in 2015/16, just five victims were taken into care, its final report revealed, and in the 10 years to 2016 the number of known cases of some sexually transmitted diseases increased by 180% among Indigenous children. Despite rising rates of substantiated cases, Friday’s AIHW report revealed the rate of Indigenous kids being removed and taken into care fell in 2016-17. As children stayed in care for longer, the rate of those who were in care during 2017 increased to 58.7, from 48.2 per 1,000 in 2013. The national rate of Indigenous children placed with relatives, kin, or Indigenous carers was 68%, except in the NT and Tasmania where most were placed with non-Indigenous carers. Last week the Territory Families minister, Dale Wakefield, conceded the department was not considering the right people at the right time, despite legislated policies of kinship placement as first principle. “We know we need to do that earlier in the investigation process,” she said. “I have had several meetings with groups of Aboriginal women around how we can better do that and how the community can better support Territory Families to make better decisions.” Australia spent $4.3bn on child protection and out-of-home care services in 2016-17, an increase of 8% on the previous year."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2018/mar/09/landmark-case-challenges-land-clearing-based-on-climate-change-impact","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-08T17:00:12Z","webTitle":"Landmark case challenges land clearing based on climate change impact","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/mar/09/landmark-case-challenges-land-clearing-based-on-climate-change-impact","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/mar/09/landmark-case-challenges-land-clearing-based-on-climate-change-impact","fields":{"headline":"Landmark case challenges land clearing based on climate change impact","bodyText":"A landmark court case in the Northern Territory is set to consider a challenge to a massive land-clearing approval based on its impacts on climate change.

In November 2017, the Northern Territory government approved the clearing of 20,432 hectares of land on the Maryfield station property – an area more than three times the size of Manhattan. The clearing application was referred to the Northern Territory Environmental Protection Agency, which decides whether an action requires a full environmental assessment. The NTEPA briefly considered the greenhouse gas emissions from the action concluding that they “are likely to make a considerable contribution to the NT’s annual greenhouse gas emissions”. But the assessment went on to say the NTEPA did not consider that would be a “significant impact” on the environment. The reasoning they gave was that the NT government does not have a policy on the matter. Despite the proposed clearing being the largest ever approved in the NT, and previous smaller applications forced to undergo environmental assessment, the NTEPA decided a full environmental assessment was not needed for the Maryfield clearing. It went on to recommend to the pastoral lands board, which is the final decision maker, that the clearing be approved with a number of conditions related to biodiversity. The pastoral lands board then approved the clearing, but ignored some of those conditions. The ECNT, represented by the Environmental Defenders Office NT, is alleging that both the NTEPA and the pastoral lands board failed to properly consider the impacts of the clearing on greenhouse gas emissions. It is widely thought to be the first Australian case to challenge the approval of a land clearing action on the basis of its impact on climate change. Given the scale of the clearing, EDO NT principal lawyer Gillian Duggin said “it is of substantial public interest for the court to explore the errors we say exist in their decision making processes”. “The decisions challenged by this case have drawn attention to the significant weaknesses in the current legal and policy frameworks for land clearing and climate change in the Northern Territory – this is a major concern for our client,” Duggin said. Molloy said they decided to take up the case because they were shocked by the scale of the approval, and the fact it occurred without a full environmental assessment. “This huge clearing permit granted should never have been granted. It will wipe out intact forest and woodland, threatens native wildlife, and will increase the NT’s greenhouse gas emissions,” said Molloy. “It is the biggest clearing permit ever granted in the NT. For the NT EPA to find a full environmental assessment was not necessary is completely untenable.” Glenn Walker from The Wilderness Society said the clearing is likely to cause up to about 3 megatonnes of CO2-equivalent greenhouse gas emissions. That figure is based on detailed scientific studies of clearing on nearby properties, and is difficult to get a firm estimate of. “On a territory scale, the emissions from this one station, and the deforestation that could occur, is equal to 15 to 20% of the Northern Territory’s annual emissions,” said Walker. “That’s an enormous dent in their emissions reduction efforts.” Duggin said that while it is concerning that the NT government has failed to put in place an emissions or climate change policy, that does not mean the EPA can avoid considering greenhouse gas emissions when assessing clearing proposals. “In this case, however, it is the responsibility of the EPA to make its decisions according to the legislation that exists, notwithstanding the absence of a climate change policy. Our client will argue that hasn’t occurred in this instance”, said Duggin. Bruce Lindsay, a lawyer at Environment Justice Australia in Melbourne said the case would be keenly watched by environmental lawyers around the country, and there could be scope for similar challenges elsewhere. “I think under our amended Climate Change Act 2017 in Victoria there is scope for decision makers and policy makers to be required to take account of climate change, although in rather hedged language,” said Lindsay. “This has not yet been tested in a judicial proceeding.” Land clearing in Australia has been a significant contributor to the country’s greenhouse gas emissions. In 1990, before short-lived land-clearing controls came into law in Queensland, a quarter of Australia’s total greenhouse gas emissions were caused by deforestation. Emissions from land clearing dropped after 2010 but are rising sharply again. While in recent decades, the majority of the country’s clearing has occurred in Queensland, other states and territories look like they could be following in Queensland’s footsteps. In 2016 and 2017, the NT government approved about 45,500 hectares of land for clearing through the Pastoral Lands Board. That was an almost tenfold jump over the average of the previous 12 years of about 4,600 hectares, which was already an area two-thirds the size of Manhattan"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/mar/08/china-promises-necessary-response-to-us-tariffs-as-trade-war-fears-grow","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-08T05:25:36Z","webTitle":"China promises 'necessary response' to US tariffs as trade war fears grow","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/08/china-promises-necessary-response-to-us-tariffs-as-trade-war-fears-grow","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/mar/08/china-promises-necessary-response-to-us-tariffs-as-trade-war-fears-grow","fields":{"headline":"China promises 'necessary response' to US tariffs as trade war fears grow","bodyText":"The prospect of a trade war between China and the United States has increased after Beijing’s foreign minister said it would make a “necessary response” in the event of Donald Trump introducing punitive tariffs on steel and aluminium imports. The US president was expected to approve the 25% levy on steel and 10% on aluminium imports this week, possibly as early as Thursday. He says they are needed to counter overseas operators, especially from China, who are undercutting US companies and destroying American jobs. The surprise announcement of the tariff plan last week caused stock markets to fall sharply as investors feared a trade war. A possible 30-day exemption for Mexico and Canada and some other countries based on national security eased market fears during Asian trading on Thursday. The Nikkei in Japan, where steelmakers could be hard hit, was up 0.5% in afternoon trade. Stocks indexes in Australia, Hong Kong and Seoul were also in the black. However, the comments on Thursday by China’s foreign minister, Wang Yi, were a sign that Beijing would not take the introduction of tariffs lying down. Wang, speaking on the sidelines of an annual meeting of China’s parliament, said China and the United States did not have to be rivals, and history showed that trade wars were not the correct way to resolve problems. “Especially given today’s globalisation, choosing a trade war is a mistaken prescription. The outcome will only be harmful,” the foreign minister said. “China would have to make a justified and necessary response,” he said. Wang said China had a long way to go on its path of modernisation, and that it “will not and need not displace the United States”. Ric Spooner of CMC Markets in Sydney said: “Even if there is a relatively favourable outcome on the detail of steel tariffs, the wider issue of the potential for broader tariffs aimed at China be a background concern for markets and a source of potential volatility over coming months.” Trump still faces growing opposition to the tariffs from congressional Republicans and business worried about their potential impact on the economy. His top economic adviser, Gary Cohn, quit this week after opposing the tariff plan. But he appeared to brush opposition aside on Wednesday with a tweets demanding that China lay out plans for reducing its trade surplus with the US. China ran a record goods trade surplus with the United States last year of $375.2bn. Trade tensions between the world’s two largest economies have risen since Trump took office in 2017, and although China only accounts for a small fraction of U.S. steel imports, its industrial expansion has helped produce a global glut of steel that has driven down prices. Trump is also considering potential trade sanctions against China under a “section 301” investigation into its intellectual property practices and pressure on foreign companies for technology transfers. Diplomatic and U.S. business sources say the United States has all but frozen a formal mechanism for talks on commercial disputes with China because it is not satisfied it has met its promises to ease market restrictions."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/mar/08/thursday-briefing-nerve-agent-used-in-russian-spy-hit","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-08T06:18:01Z","webTitle":"Thursday briefing: Nerve agent used in Russian spy hit","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/08/thursday-briefing-nerve-agent-used-in-russian-spy-hit","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/mar/08/thursday-briefing-nerve-agent-used-in-russian-spy-hit","fields":{"headline":"Thursday briefing: Nerve agent used in Russian spy hit","bodyText":"Top story: ‘You don’t make this in your kitchen’ Hello, it’s Warren Murray with the pocket edition of the day’s news. The exiled Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia were poisoned by deliberate “exposure to a nerve agent”, say counter-terror police, who are treating the case as attempted murder. The Salisbury police officer first to the scene of their collapse has also fallen seriously ill, it has been revealed. The poison used has been identified, according to police, who declined to name it. The best known nerve agents are VX and sarin, both of which are difficult and dangerous to produce outside a well-equipped laboratory – raising suspicions of an assassination attempt involving the Russian state. “This needs expertise and a special place to make it or you will kill yourself,” said one expert. An unidentified man and a woman were captured on CCTV strolling in the alleyway close to the bench where Skripal was poisoned. The woman had blond hair and was holding a large scarlet bag. A little over a year ago, VX was used in Kuala Lumpur airport to murder Kim Jong-nam, the younger brother of North Korea’s dictator, Kim Jong-un. * * * Women on the march – It’s international women’s day and we are covering protests, celebrations and other events live. Women in Spain are staging a nationwide “feminist strike” seeking an end to sexual discrimination, domestic violence and the wage gap; while the Global Women’s Strike campaign is marking its success in mobilising several movements. The prime minister, Theresa May, has announced a consultation on new measures to combat domestic abuse including tagging suspects, banning them from alcohol and drugs, and outlawing emotional and economic abuse. The TUC says women are still working 67 days a year for free because of the pay gap. Zoe Williams argues the only way to fix the Conservative party’s feminist failings would be to “attach a scrappy, energetic woman who listened to reason to every blowhard man who didn’t”. Rebecca Solnit writes how #MeToo and #TimesUp have seized a moment that took decades to bring about. And here’s why you don’t have to be a Hollywood star to bring others along on the path to equality. Finally, we have set things up so you can tell us how are marking the day – we will publish a selection of the material submitted. * * * Fatal car crash – In news that broke overnight, two boys believed to be 17 were killed and two children were among the injured after a horror crash near Thirsk, East Yorkshire. Police said a black Ford Focus, a black Vauxhall Corsa and a green Volkswagen Bora were involved in the collision on the A61 between Busby Stoop and Carlton Minniott. Police have appealed for witnesses or anyone with dashcam footage to come forward. * * * Mysteries of Jupiter revealed – The Juno spacecraft orbiting Earth’s largest sibling has revealed how the storms and swirls on its surface spiral 3,000km down through an increasingly dense atmosphere where hydrogen becomes a metallic gas and helium turns to rain. Spectacular images of the phenomenal turbulence on Jupiter’s exterior have been returned by the probe. “The normal concept of gas, liquid and solid don’t really hold at these pressures,” says Yohai Kaspi, one of the scientists involved in publishing the findings. At its core, Jupiter probably has an extremely dense soup of gases, speckled with metallic elements, researchers think. Pressures are about 10 million times higher than at the Earth’s surface. * * * A few gifts too far? – The Westminster council deputy leader Robert Davis has stepped aside after he was revealed to have accepted hospitality or gifts 893 times over six years, frequently from property developers. Davis, who remains a councillor, argues the dinners, hotel stays, theatre tickets and trips abroad were all part of his job as planning committee chairman, and he had always rigorously declared them. Investigations by the council and an independent QC are under way. * * * Submarine case comes to court – The murder trial begins today of Peter Madsen, the Danish inventor accused of torturing and killing Swedish journalist Kim Wall during a trip on his homemade submarine. Madsen was once a celebrity for seeking to build a rocket and launch himself into suborbital space. Now he is accused by prosecutors of an “unusual and extremely brutal” murder in which he allegedly tied up, beat and stabbed her, sawed up her body, then sank the submarine to try to cover his tracks. Madsen’s trial is expected to run for 12 days. Lunchtime reading: Crimes of the police informer Gary Haggarty committed five murders, attempted another five, and engaged in 23 conspiracies to murder. As a UVF militiaman in Northern Ireland he also undertook arson attacks, beatings, hijackings and possessed small arsenals of firearms and explosives. The list of charges either admitted or “taken into consideration” goes on and on. “He got away with his crimes for so long because he was, in addition to these things, a servant of the British state,” writes Ian Cobain. “He was a police informer.” In return for his cooperation, Haggarty’s effective sentence was whittled down to a few years’ jail. Cobain examines whether the information gleaned by the security forces from Haggarty and other “touts” on both the loyalist and republican sides was worth the terrible cost of their largely unpunished crimes.

The papers The main story in town (unless you are the Express) is the Russian spy and the nerve agent attack in Salisbury that has also left a policeman seriously ill. The Mirror splashes with “Cop poisoned by nerve gas assassins”, calling it a “Russian spy outrage”. The Sun goes with “Nerve agent horror” while the Mail has the headline “Russia ‘could cripple UK’” and says the country’s cybersecurity chief has warned the Kremlin could shut down power supplies and hijack air traffic control. The Telegraph has the lead “Policeman poisoned by Russian spy nerve agent” and quotes Boris Johnson promising a “robust” response if a foreign power is found to be responsible. The Guardian says the suspicion in Downing Street will be that the Kremlin has carried out another brazen attack on British soil. The Times says one line of inquiry is that the Russian spy’s daughter may recently and unwittingly have brought a “present” for him from Moscow. And the i says the policeman is in a coma after coming into contact with a rare nerve agent that was used for the first time in the UK.

About 4.6% or 8,481 homes in the western Canadian city stood empty or underutilised for more than 180 days in 2017, according to declarations submitted to the municipality by 98.85% of homeowners. Properties deemed empty will be subjected to a tax of 1% of their assessed value. Vancouver has rolled out a raft of measures to cool prices and improve housing affordability in the country’s most expensive real estate market. Empty houses, also a big issue in the UK, are only one aspect of the problem. In 2017 the provincial government of British Columbia raised its foreign buyer tax from 15% to 20% to target offshore investors blamed for pushing up prices. Toronto, Canada’s biggest city, followed suit with a 15% tax in April. Before the foreign buyer tax, sales agents said investors in Hong Kong, China and other parts of Asia were acquiring up to 40% of Vancouver condominium projects marketed abroad, absorbing the more expensive units that domestic buyers could not afford. Nearly 61% of the homes declared empty in Vancouver were condos, and other multi-family properties made up almost 6%, according to the city government. More than a quarter of the empty properties were in downtown Vancouver. Property owners who did not submit a declaration and those who claimed exemptions, such as for renovations or if the owner was in hospital or long-term care, were included in the empty homes number. “This is not insignificant considering that the rental vacancy rate is less than 1% in Vancouver,” said Robert Hogue, senior economist at Royal Bank of Canada. “This kind of data is completely new so it is difficult to put into context.” Reuters contributed to this report."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/mar/08/crew-searching-for-mh370-optimistic-of-finding-missing-plane","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-08T04:46:05Z","webTitle":"Crew searching for MH370 'optimistic' of finding missing plane","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/08/crew-searching-for-mh370-optimistic-of-finding-missing-plane","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/mar/08/crew-searching-for-mh370-optimistic-of-finding-missing-plane","fields":{"headline":"Crew searching for MH370 'optimistic' of finding missing plane","bodyText":"The crew searching for Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 have said they “remain optimistic” of finding the missing plane in their first statement to media. Two Malaysian navy officers aboard the search ship, Azmi Rosedee and Adbul Halim Ahmad Nordin, told the New Straits Times they were “doing their utmost”, even as the search was slowed by bad weather and tricky underwater terrain in the Indian Ocean. The renewed search for MH370 began in January this year after the US-based company Ocean Infinity was hired by the Malaysian government. A previous three-year search coordinated by Australia was called off in 2017 after it failed to find the plane. After 43 days of searching Ocean Infinity’s ship, Seabed Constructor, is yet to find anything. “We have gone through a number of rough days,” Rosedee and Nordin said. “Operations continue even when the sea is rough … but it makes it difficult for us to deploy and recover the AUVs [search vehicles]. This slows us down. “Aside from that, the seabed of the search areas is hilly and uneven. This also disrupts the AUV’s capability to thoroughly sweep the areas”. In February the Australian Broadcasting Corporation revealed that the presence of Malaysian military on board Seabed Constructor had sparked a “power struggle”, with concerns the Malaysian government wanted stricter oversight and military control over the search. On Thursday the Malaysian navy chief, Admiral Tan Sri Ahmad Kamarulzaman Ahmad Badaruddin, defended the presence of the naval officers, Rosedee and Nordin. “Since the cost of this search will be borne by the government, it is necessary to have our representatives on board to observe the operation,” he said. He also told the New Straits Times the two officers would be “his eyes and ears” and would ensure that the search was carried out smoothly. Before the search began, Malaysian authorities identified a 25,000 sq km priority area in the Indian Ocean as the “most likely” resting place of the missing plane. This area was first suggested by the Australian Transport Safety Bureau, after the end of their three-year search, as the next place to look. As of Thursday, which marked the four-year anniversary of the plane’s disappearance, Seabed Constructor had searched 16,000 sq km of the 25,000 sq km priority area. Officials have estimated there is an 85% chance of finding the plane within the priority area. If the search is unsuccessful Ocean Infinity will expand the area to 48,000 sq km. Its contract with the Malaysian government allows for 90 days to locate the plane, on a “no find, no fee” basis. The search period also allows for time spent refuelling in the Australian port of Fremantle, meaning the search is expected to end by mid-June."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2018/mar/08/donald-trump-video-game-meeting-florida-shooting","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-08T12:00:04Z","webTitle":"Trump meeting with video game bosses revives tenuous link to gun violence","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/mar/08/donald-trump-video-game-meeting-florida-shooting","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/mar/08/donald-trump-video-game-meeting-florida-shooting","fields":{"headline":"Trump meeting with video game bosses revives tenuous link to gun violence","bodyText":"Donald Trump will host executives from the video game industry at the White House on Thursday, resurrecting a debate over the link between violent video games and gun-related deaths in the aftermath of the Parkland high school shooting. The meeting comes as the president and lawmakers in Washington face continued pressure to act in the wake of the 14 February massacre at Marjory Stoneman High School, which left 17 people dead. Although the White House has provided few details on the meeting, Trump’s focus on the role of violence in entertainment signaled the president may be embracing a more conservative response to the Parkland shooting, even as the push for stricter gun laws reaches a fever pitch. Each time there’s a school shooting in America, someone inevitably points the finger at video games. Trump similarly targeted video games and movies for influencing children and young adults when discussing the Parkland tragedy at the White House last month. “I’m hearing more and more people say the level of violence on video games is really shaping young people’s thoughts,” Trump said. The first major public debate over whether violent video games make people who play them violent took place after the Columbine massacre in 1999. The shooters, Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, were players of a graphic first-person shooter game called Doom, and amid desperate attempts to make sense of the killing, it became an easy scapegoat. The video game industry was blamed again after Sandy Hook, this time by the head of the NRA, Wayne LaPierre, who called it a “corrupting shadow industry that sells, and sows, violence against its own people” and mentioned titles such as Mortal Kombat and Grand Theft Auto. But despite the moral panic, the evidence doesn’t stack up. There have been many studies and meta-analyses examining the issue, and none has shown a causal link between violent video games and violent behavior. The few studies that find a weak correlation between aggressive behavior and video games lack context, failing to highlight how other competitive activities such as team sports have the same impact. “Video games are plainly not the issue: entertainment is distributed and consumed globally, but the US has an exponentially higher level of gun violence than any other nation,” said Dan Hewitt from the Entertainment Software Association, which represents companies including Ubisoft, Nintendo, EA and Activision. “The upcoming meeting at the White House, which ESA will attend, will provide the opportunity to have a fact-based conversation about video game ratings, our industry’s commitment to parents, and the tools we provide to make informed entertainment choices.” Trump has held a series of roundtable meetings since the Parkland shooting, often vacillating between disparate policy positions on guns. Last week, the president drew backlash from conservatives for embracing a series of gun control measures long opposed by Republicans and the NRA. In a meeting with senators from both parties, Trump threw his support behind universal background checks, raising the age limit for purchasing firearms and even entertained banning certain assault-style rifles. He has since made little use of the bully pulpit to call for such measures, even as the debate on Capitol Hill has appeared to stall amid a lack of consensus over what remains one of the most politically contentious issues in Washington. The White House failed to explicitly say on Wednesday why Trump felt it necessary to have Sarah Sanders, the White House press secretary, tell reporters the president believed violent video games was “certainly something that should be looked at”. “The president wants to continue the conversation on every different area that we can to help promote school safety,” she said. Although he made a more forceful push than Trump on gun control following Sandy Hook, Barack Obama also considered violence in video games part of the equation. Among other actions, Obama called on Congress in 2013 to fund research at the Centers for Disease Control “into the effects that violent video games have on young minds”. “We don’t benefit from ignorance,” Obama said at the time. “We don’t benefit from not knowing the science of this epidemic of violence.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/mar/08/bupa-waters-down-plan-to-restrict-gap-cover-to-its-approved-hospitals","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-08T03:11:58Z","webTitle":"Bupa waters down plan to restrict gap cover to its approved hospitals","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/mar/08/bupa-waters-down-plan-to-restrict-gap-cover-to-its-approved-hospitals","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/mar/08/bupa-waters-down-plan-to-restrict-gap-cover-to-its-approved-hospitals","fields":{"headline":"Bupa waters down plan to restrict gap cover to its approved hospitals","bodyText":"The private health insurer Bupa has watered down changes that would have seen patients only qualify for gap cover if treated in Bupa-approved facilities, following a backlash from doctors and consumers. Doctors including the Australian Medical Association president, Michael Gannon, accused Bupa of heading towards a US-style health system when the insurer announced that from 1 August “the higher scheme benefits will only apply when participating providers choose to use the scheme at hospital facilities that have an agreement with Bupa”. But Bupa has softened its stance, saying doctors and their patients opting to use the public hospital system would continue to qualify for the Bupa medical gap scheme, so long as the procedures were for elective surgery and they were pre-booked. “However, Bupa firmly believe having people forced to declare their private status without choice of doctor, or hospitals electing to give priority admission due to being privately insured, does not uphold the integrity of Medicare or our public system and as such ensuring any private payments go along with true pre-booked private admissions supports our public funding initiatives,” the insurer said in a statement. The Bupa medical gap scheme is designed to eliminate or significantly reduce medical costs associated with hospital treatment by paying doctors significantly higher benefits than those paid under Medicare. Insured patients can currently choose which hospital they receive their treatment at, including at any public hospital their surgeon may work at. Bupa’s managing director, Dr Dwayne Crombie, said he recognised that a patient should be able to make the choice to receive a private experience in a public hospital – and in fact a public hospital may be the best setting to do so. “As such, we support patients and doctors and believe ensuring any Bupa customer receives the private experience they are being billed for occurs is a good thing for all involved,” he said. “When a patient is admitted to a public hospital as an emergency or acute patient and treated as a public patient, they should use Medicare to fund that treatment as it is designed to do so.” Bupa also drew criticism for telling one-third of its Australian members that their policies would no longer cover hip and knee replacements, pregnancy and other major procedures. On Tuesday the federal health minister, Greg Hunt, ordered the ombudsman to investigate Bupa over the changes to polcies and gap cover. Bupa did not respond to questions from Guardian Australia about whether it had seen a rise in complaints following the policy changes. But on social media, the insurer has been responding to confusion from members and accused the media of “scare-mongering”. The chief executive officer of the Medical Technology Association of Australia, Ian Burgess, said he welcomed Hunt’s call for an ombudsman investigation into Bupa. “However, we urge the government to immediately bring forward a much needed productivity commission inquiry into private health insurance,” he said. “Despite a recent Senate inquiry calling for increased transparency, we need a circuit breaker and a Productivity Commission inquiry is the right vehicle.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/mar/08/european-clocks-lose-six-minutes-dispute-power-electricity-grid","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-08T01:46:48Z","webTitle":"European clocks lose six minutes after dispute saps power from electricity grid","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/08/european-clocks-lose-six-minutes-dispute-power-electricity-grid","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/mar/08/european-clocks-lose-six-minutes-dispute-power-electricity-grid","fields":{"headline":"European clocks lose six minutes after dispute saps power from electricity grid","bodyText":"Europeans who have been arriving late to work or school in recent weeks have more than just the bad weather to blame.

The continental network had lost 113GWh of energy since mid-January because Kosovo had been using more electricity than it generates. Serbia, which is responsible for balancing Kosovo’s grid, had failed to do so, ENTSO-E said. The Brussels-based organisation added that “this average frequency deviation, that has never happened in any similar way in the Continental European power system, must cease”. The deviation from Europe’s standard 50Hz frequency has been enough to cause electric clocks that keep time by the power system’s frequency, rather than built-in quartz crystals, to fall behind by about six minutes since mid-January. The problem mostly affects radio alarms, oven clocks or clocks used to program heating systems. ENTSO-E said it was working on a technical solution that could bring the system back to normal within “a few weeks”, but urged European authorities and national governments to address the political problem at the heart of the issue. “This is beyond the technical world. Now there needs to be an agreement between Serbia and Kosovo about this lack of energy in the Kosovo system. You need to solve it politically and then technically,” Camus said. The friction between Serbia and Kosovo is part of a broader dispute that goes back almost 20 years. Since the war in Kosovo ended in 1999, the Serb-dominated north of Kosovo that remains loyal to Belgrade has not paid the Kosovo government for the energy it consumes. A 2015 agreement was meant to resolve the dispute, but Serbia has blocked its implementation. Serbia’s power operator, EMS, blamed the problem on Kosovo, claiming that in January and February the country “was withdrawing, in an unauthorized manner, uncontracted electric energy from the continental Europe synchronous area”. Kadri Kadriu, deputy manager of Kosovo’s grid operator, acknowledged that electricity from elsewhere was diverted to the Serb minority in the north, but said consumers there had not paid for their electricity, causing considerable financial burden to the company."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2018/mar/07/uber-ceo-travis-kalanick-10100-investment-fund","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-08T01:32:11Z","webTitle":"Ex-Uber CEO Travis Kalanick reveals new project: a 'job creation' fund","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/mar/07/uber-ceo-travis-kalanick-10100-investment-fund","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/mar/07/uber-ceo-travis-kalanick-10100-investment-fund","fields":{"headline":"Ex-Uber CEO Travis Kalanick reveals new project: a 'job creation' fund","bodyText":"Nine months after he was forced to resign as CEO of Uber, Travis Kalanick has a new baby: an investment fund named 10100. On Wednesday, Kalanick announced the creation of 10100 – pronounced “ten-one-hundred” – on Twitter, saying that the “overarching theme” of the fund’s work would be “large-scale job creation”. Kalanick also said that the fund would undertake for-profit investments in real estate, e-commerce, and “emerging innovation” in China and India, as well as non-profit work focusing on education and “the future of cities”. A spokesman for Kalanick declined to provide further details, saying by email: “Stay tuned.” The erstwhile executive has largely stayed out of the news since Dara Khosrowshahi replaced him at the ride-hail company’s helm following a string of scandals and power struggle with Uber’s investors. He did appear in court in February to testify in the trade secrets dispute between Uber and the Google spin-off Waymo. But Kalanick’s sale of a portion of his Uber shares as part of SoftBank’s investment in the company in January transformed him from a paper billionaire to an actual money-in-the-bank billionaire, so the establishment of a family office was a logical step. Kalanick’s stated interest in job creation and the future of cities are noteworthy given his outsize impact on both as the chief executive of Uber. Hundreds of thousands of people drive for Uber, though the company does not directly employ them. Uber’s independent contractor model has been widely criticized for its low wages and lack of benefits, even as many other app-based companies have adopted the so-called “gig economy” model. Uber has also been criticized for its effect on the cities where it is most popular. An increasing number of studies have shown that ride-hail apps increase urban congestion by pulling passengers away from public transit. Kalanick also offered an apparently personal email account – travis@10100fund.com – to “anyone who wants to get to work”, though we imagine one of 10100’s first steps will be to hire a secretary."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/mar/09/like-juventus-boris-johnson-just-cant-be-knocked-out","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-09T12:51:30Z","webTitle":"Like Juventus, Boris Johnson just can't be knocked out | John Crace","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/mar/09/like-juventus-boris-johnson-just-cant-be-knocked-out","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/mar/09/like-juventus-boris-johnson-just-cant-be-knocked-out","fields":{"headline":"Like Juventus, Boris Johnson just can't be knocked out","bodyText":"Monday Boomerang kids – adult children who return to their parents’ home because they can’t afford a place of their own – are seldom out of the news these days. One recent report tried to work out a formula for how much parents should charge a child who turns up announced, while another concluded that parents’ quality of life nose-dived every time a kid boomeranged. I have rather mixed feelings about this. My daughter is currently sharing a flat with her boyfriend and has just announced they may move to Minneapolis for a few years, while my son, who is about to finish university, says he would rather live in the back of a van and travel round Europe for a year picking up odd jobs rather than come home for more than a few days at a time. Plans may change and hard financial realities may kick in at some time, of course, but part of me is thrilled both that my wife and I have brought up two children who have the confidence to leave home and that everything that was in the fridge when I left the house will still be in it when I get back. But I also miss them a great deal. Even when they are annoying. It’s sod’s law. When they were young I spent a long time wishing they were more independent and now that they are I wish they were a little less so. Tuesday According to one of my lobby friends who has forgotten more about politics than I will ever know, one of the great unexplained mysteries of Westminster is how Boris Johnson remains foreign secretary. Time and again he seems to get away with things that would have cost lesser mortals their job. Today he came to parliament to answer an urgent question on Britain’s relations with Russia following the suspected poisoning of the former spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter, Yulia. Boris had one job: to sound tough while remaining non-committal and refusing to speculate on the outcome of any investigation. Something that comes as second nature to most ministers who spend hours at the dispatch box saying nothing. For the first 20 minutes or so, Boris stuck to his brief but then he couldn’t help himself and unilaterally announced that we were at war with Russia. The usual protocol for starting a war is a cabinet discussion followed by a warning to the foreign power in question. Not content with that, he then went on to say that if, as he suspected, the Russians were behind the assassination attempt, then Britain wouldn’t be competing in the World Cup. Boris seemed unaware that Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland had already taken that decision by deliberately failing to qualify for the finals and that, if past performance was any guide, England would voluntarily make their own protest by refusing to play and getting knocked out in the group stages. Wednesday It ended as it so often does. In heartbreak. Having dominated much of the game at Wembley and taken a half-time lead, Spurs lost concentration for a four-minute spell after the break and were knocked out of the Champions League by Juventus. Though I was bitterly disappointed by the result, I did take some masochistic pleasure in the nature of the performance. Over the many years I’ve been supporting Spurs, one of their traits I’ve most come to value is that they so often let you down. Their disappointments mirror my own and somehow make me feel better about myself. They do my failing for me. I’m not sure I could quite cope with supporting a team who regularly lift trophies. Not only would I start taking success for granted, it would also make me feel inadequate. The loss to Juve was classic Spurs: first the hope, as Tottenham appeared capable of swatting aside the Italian champions, then the crushing sense of defeat. After several years of watching Spurs play some of the best football I have ever seen, it was as if normal service had been – albeit temporarily – resumed. And I’m sure Sunday’s long trek down to the south coast to watch them play Bournemouth in the Premier League will be all the sweeter for it. Thursday The world’s oldest message in a bottle has been found on a beach in Western Australia nearly 132 years after it was tossed overboard from a German ship in the Indian Ocean. Scientists believe the bottle had floated at sea for the best part of a year before getting washed up and buried in the sand. Even though the message was basically only a list of coordinates – the bottle was apparently one of many thrown overboard as part of an experiment to measure currents – its survival still appealed to the romantic in me. A voice from the past finally getting heard. When I was a child, my father encouraged me to put a message in a bottle and throw it over the side of the small boat we were sailing in off the Pembrokeshire coast. He handed me a Schweppes Bitter Lemon bottle and told me to ask whoever found it to return it to our home address and that we would refund the postage. I thought no more about it for several months until a letter arrived for me. The bottle had been found. Sadly it hadn’t, as I had hoped, travelled half way round the world. It had wound up on a beach several miles from where I had thrown it. Friday A new survey by a global education charity has found that British parents are among the worst for helping their children with their homework. Only the Japanese and the Finns came out worse. Although, thankfully, our days of having to supervise homework are long past, in my wife’s and my defence, our performance wasn’t always always down to sheer laziness. Both our children were always extremely reluctant to ask us for any assistance: not because they had the can-do ethic of wanting to sort their maths and English problems for themselves, but because they both assumed from an early age that we were congenital idiots who couldn’t possibly know anything. And they weren’t always wrong. When my daughter was writing her final essay for her English A-level on meanings of love in three works of literature, she finally agreed to let me read her final draft as I knew the three books in question well. I made what I thought were helpful revisions and helped her to rewrite certain sections in shorter sentences to make it more readable. To my surprise – she must have been desperate – she accepted all my suggestions. The draft came back as a fail, with the comment that many of my insights were just plain wrong and that the use of short sentences was a big mistake. She went back to the original text she had written before I got my mitts on it and duly got an A.

What will happen to the women we support?","bodyText":"The charity I work for, the Switch project, supports women who fall through the cracks of public services in the Tees Valley area. In the six years we’ve been running, we’ve helped hundreds of disadvantaged women facing their darkest hour. But now we’re weeks away from closing and I worry where these women will turn. Women like Tara*, who faced domestic abuse for more than five years. When we met Tara she was living in a women’s refuge. Her husband had thrown her out in the middle of the night; she’d been severely beaten but had managed to grab her car keys so she could sleep in the car. Her husband rang the police and Tara was arrested for drink driving – she had switched the car engine on to keep warm. Fleeing to a refuge meant resigning from her job, forfeiting her tenancy and leaving a place where she had spent most of her life. She had no idea what support was out there or who to ask for help until she was referred to us. Our team supported Tara during her court case, ensuring she had access to the right advice. It resulted in a restraining order against her husband. We helped her through the accommodation bidding process from the initial application to finding furniture for her new home. We made sure she knew what her rights were and how she could get what she needed. Now safe and happy in her own home, she says we saved her life. We’ve helped many disadvantaged and vulnerable women like Tara. Most have suffered domestic violence or sexual abuse. In a system that is fragmented and confusing – and shrinking fast – our support stops women becoming lost. We might step in to provide support to manage drug and alcohol dependency, accompany them to detox programmes and hospital appointments, help them find a job or assistance with developing life skills and self-esteem. We do whatever it takes to make sure these women are ok – that might be doing their food shopping, sorting out their hair or making sure they have clean clothes. Our interventions have stopped children going into the care system. We have also helped children to be placed back into the care of their mothers. Many women have been in such a dark place that they cannot do basic things for themselves, let alone their children. By lifting some of the burden from these women, and making sure all the support they need is in place, they have the space to get strong enough to cope and look after the children they love. Without a safety net like ours, women in need are often overwhelmed by a series of appointments, referrals and meetings with several different organisations. This at a time when many of them are so crippled by depression or substance misuse that they can barely face getting up in the morning. We received funding from the Big Lottery Fund in 2012 for three years. The positive impact of our project meant funding was extended for a further three years, to keep the project going. Local organisations and councils across the Tees Valley area are extremely supportive of our work, despite their own budget constraints and struggles, but the sad reality is that our funding runs out at the end of this month. Unless further funding sources are identified within the next few weeks, the project will close. We are trying to continue as normal, but we are also building contingency plans for the women we help. It breaks my heart to think that, in a matter of weeks, I will no longer be able to support these women. We have handover plans ready to ensure that women receive support from various agencies and organisations if we have to close, but I worry how they will navigate all this when some of them are still very fragile, and taking it day by day as they try to turn their lives around. *Tara’s name has been changed to protect her identity The Supporting Women in the Community and Home (Switch) project is run by social justice charity Nacro.

During her lifetime, the author exercised minute control over the reams of merchandise spun out of her work, which is why Sony Pictures’ new film adaptation would have been anathema to the Lake District author, according to her biographer. Potter, who died in 1943, oversaw an empire of products, from dolls to wallpaper, to circumvent attempts by others to create products based on her characters. “The idea of rooms covered with badly drawn rabbits is appalling,” she wrote. Matthew Dennison, whose biography Over the Hills and Far Away was published in 2016, said Potter would not have approved of Sony’s take on a story that has been part of millions of children’s lives. “Very early on in her career, she decided to design dolls based on her characters, so that no one else could get it wrong …,” he said. “She was not exactly possessive, but she had a very clear idea in her head of how the books should be. They came about through really close, careful work. There was nothing accidental or spontaneous about them. And she was a bit beady – she was tough with her publishers on things like how much white space or text there was. Every single detail she really thought about.” Dennison said the film, in which James Corden is the voice of a CGI, twerking Peter, changes the essential character of its eponymous hero. “Peter Rabbit emerges as a bully, and there really isn’t any evidence for that in the story.” He said Potter felt Kenneth Graham did not get his animals right in The Wind in the Willows. “Toad combing his hair, she felt that was ridiculous. [“A mistake to fly in the face of nature,” she wrote.] Her line was that her rabbit was wearing a jacket, but he was anatomically correct, and aside from wearing a jacket, he behaved like a rabbit.” Libby Joy, of the Beatrix Potter Society, agreed that the author would not have approved of something “so far removed from her original story”. Already accused of “allergy bullying” for a scene in which the rabbits attack Mr McGregor’s son with blackberries, knowing he will have an anaphylactic reaction, the Sony film is out in the US. Reviews have taken issue with what the New Yorker described as “violence and a puerile sense of humour”. The magazine called it “an object lesson in how not to adapt a beloved volume to the screen”, criticising Sony for “replacing the fable-like simplicity of her stories with a knowing veneer of contemporaneity”, and in so doing overlooking “the suggestive darkness at the core of Potter’s work”. Peter Rabbit had already been made into a CBeebies series, which Joy said had “taken all sorts of liberties” in order to make it exciting and keep children watching. Dennison said Potter would not have been keen on television or film, and suggested the only successful adaptation of her work was the ballet. “You take the books and translate them into abstract language, that is mostly visual … I think the ballet does work.” The problem with putting the creations on screen “is that they become cutesy, which is really quite un-Potter”, he said. “She’s not cutesy – bad behaviour gets punished, and she’s quite contemptuous of Jemima Puddleduck, who only wants a child. She’s not a cuddly person, and the problem is when her characters are translated to the screen, the danger is they become cuddly.” Paddington Bear, by contrast, which has been adapted into two films, “is cuddly and funny in the books, so it works for him. But in Potter there is irony and wit, which isn’t translating.” Potter left her rights to her publisher, Warne, when she died. Since then an industry has grown around her works, with everything from baby clothes to tea caddies available to buy. According to Warne, more than 2m Potter books are sold every year."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"healthcare-network/2018/mar/09/nhs-survey-staff-determined-best-tough-conditions","type":"article","sectionId":"healthcare-network","sectionName":"Healthcare Professionals Network","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-09T14:36:36Z","webTitle":"NHS survey reveals staff are determined to make the best of tough conditions","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/healthcare-network/2018/mar/09/nhs-survey-staff-determined-best-tough-conditions","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/healthcare-network/2018/mar/09/nhs-survey-staff-determined-best-tough-conditions","fields":{"headline":"NHS survey reveals staff are determined to make the best of tough conditions","bodyText":"The latest NHS staff survey – the world’s biggest workforce study – is both shocking and uplifting. It highlights appalling communication by senior managers, increasing anger about pay and signs that discrimination is on the increase. But it also reveals extraordinary resilience under pressure. Almost half a million staff responded to the questionnaire last autumn. The growing pressure for action on pay is clear, with just 31% saying they were satisfied with their pay. This is a fall of 6% since 2016, one of the biggest changes in the survey. The number of organisational “never events” remains stubbornly high. Around one in 50 staff experienced physical violence from other staff in the last year and around one in four reported harassment, bullying or abuse from staff. Around one in eight experienced discrimination – and more of it came from colleagues and managers than patients and service users. Just over 84% believe their organisation provides equal opportunities in careers, a figure that has declined steadily over the past five years. One of the most worrying revelations is that the poor performance of ambulance trusts evident in the 2016 survey continues. Compared with other types of trust, as well as clinical commissioning groups (CCGs), their training and development is strikingly poor, they are far worse than other NHS organisations for discrimination and equal opportunities, worst for illness due to work-related stress, worst for organisational and management interest in their health and wellbeing, worst at giving staff appraisals, worst for appraisal quality, worst for team working and worst for staff engagement. Ambulance trust staff are far behind everybody else in feeling their managers and organisations recognise their value. There are clearly fundamental problems with the resourcing and management of ambulance trusts. These weaknesses have long been evident in response-time data and Care Quality Commission inspections. NHS leaders need to get a grip on this, to understand the root causes of the problems and how local leaders can be supported in addressing them. The results for CCG staff are intriguing. They had by far the highest response rate to the survey, at 80%. They come top for staff recommending the organisation as a place to work and they feel the most valued. They are well ahead in being able to contribute to quality improvements. But they come bottom for satisfaction with the quality of work they are able to deliver and are well behind every type of trust in feeling they make a difference to patients. So commissioning organisations are well led and run, but there is doubt about the point of it all. Communication from senior managers across the sector is awful. Only a third of staff believe communication is good, although this represents a steady improvement from the 2013 survey, when fewer than 30% of staff said it was good. Even the best-performing trusts are struggling to get above 50%. With so many communication tools available to managers (including talking to people), this figure should be a lot higher. Two-thirds of staff say they are able to deliver the quality of care they aspire to, fewer than in 2016. Staff engagement has declined for the first time since 2014. But despite many areas of concern, the staff survey demonstrates extraordinary resilience. There have been small declines in satisfaction with resourcing and support, motivation and recommending their organisation as a place to work or be treated, but the fact these results are holding up pretty well under intense pressure across the system shows a determination to make the best of tough circumstances. Many trust board meetings now begin with a patient story, intended to illuminate systemic issues the leadership needs to address. Perhaps the occasional story from a staff member would help NHS leaders understand what it feels like to be part of their team.

More than a dozen vehicles were at the hospital as part of an operation to remove a police car from the site in the aftermath of last Sunday’s attack. Two military lorries arrived at A&amp;E with police escorts, incident response units and an ambulance. Earlier on Friday it was reported that about 180 military personnel had been called in to assist the investigation into the attempted murder of the Russian former spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter, Yulia. The additional personnel were deployed to remove potentially contaminated evidence. Meanwhile, police were seen at the cemetery where the grave of Skripal’s wife, Liudmila, and a memorial to his son, Alexander, who both died in the last few years, lie in adjacent plots that had been cordoned off earlier in the week. Police placed a blue forensic tent over the memorial to Alexander at Salisbury’s London Road cemetery. Fire officers in hazmat suits were seen pinning down the tent, while other officers in white suits and gas masks were seen packing items from the cemetery into a yellow barrel. It had previously been reported that Liudmila died of cancer in 2012 aged 59, while Alexander Skripal died in March last year in St Petersburg, aged 43, in unknown circumstances. The Metropolitan police said reports that a body had been exhumed on Friday were untrue. It is believed that Yulia Skripal may have visited her brother’s memorial stone on his birthday, 1 March – three days before she and her father were taken ill. As the investigation entered a new phase, the authorities were still seeking to establish exactly where and when a British police officer was poisoned. DS Nick Bailey is seriously ill in hospital having visited the home of Skripal after the defector and his daughter were found slumped on a bench in Salisbury, Wiltshire, on Sunday afternoon. Investigators want to know whether Bailey visited the scene where the two Russians were found and was poisoned there or by items there, or whether the officer was contaminated on his visit to Skripal’s home. Sources say that, while it is not certain, it is believed more likely that Bailey became contaminated on his visit to the home. Uncertainty about how and where Sergei and Yulia Skripal were poisoned led to police requesting military assistance on Friday to secure contaminated evidence. It is understood that personnel from the Royal Marines, the RAF and chemical teams were involved in the operation. The Met police said the units were called in because they had “the necessary capability and expertise” and urged the public not to be alarmed. Sergei, 66, and Yulia, 33, are comatose in hospital after being found unconscious on a bench in the Maltings shopping centre. The investigation widened on Thursday as police sealed off the memorials to Liudmila and Alexander, and said 21 people had been treated as a result of the incident. Bailey was described by Kier Pritchard, Wiltshire’s temporary chief constable, as “a massively dedicated officer”. Pritchard said the detective sergeant was “very anxious, very concerned” but sitting up in bed and talking. Amber Rudd, the home secretary, met Bailey during her visit to Salisbury district hospital on Friday. Gavin Williamson, the defence secretary, said of the request for military assistance: “Our armed forces have stepped up to support the police in their investigation in Salisbury, building on the vital expertise and information already provided by our world-renowned scientists from the defence science and technology laboratory at Porton Down. We have the right people with the right skills to assist with this crucial inquiry. This is a dreadful incident and my thoughts remain with the victims and their families.” The NHS confirmed that the Skripals were in a critical but stable condition, while Bailey was conscious in a serious but stable condition.Rudd said: “It is still very serious for the two people subject to this outrageous attack. For the police officer, it is still serious but we understand he is conversing and engaging.“I understand people’s curiosity about all those questions, wanting to have answers, and there will be a time to have those answers. But the best way to get to them is to make sure we give the police the space they need to really go through the area carefully, to do their investigation and to make sure that they have all the support that they need in order to get that.” She added: “At the moment our priority is going to be the incident, which is why I’m here in Salisbury today, making sure that everybody’s protected around the incident, making sure the emergency services have had the support that they need and will continue to get it. In terms of further options, that will have to wait until we’re absolutely clear what the consequences could be and what the actual source of this nerve agent has been.” Rudd did not reveal further details about the substance, how it was deployed or who used it. Ian Blair, who was Metropolitan police commissioner when the former spy Alexander Litvinenko was murdered in London, has suggested one line of inquiry is that Skripal may have been exposed to the nerve agent in his own home. “Clearly what they’re trying to find out at the moment is how was this delivered personally. There obviously are some indications. The officer – I’m very sorry he’s been injured – has actually been to the house, whereas there’s a doctor who looked after the patients in the open who hasn’t been affected at all. There may be some clues floating around in here,” Lord Blair said on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. Blair said that if the nerve agent was rare, as Rudd has said, then it should be possible to identify where it came from. “If this is rarer than sarin and VX it’s basically possible to identify the laboratory in which it was made. They would be able to establish where it came from – the level of authority is another matter,” he said. The use of a nerve toxin is seen as a key indicator of possible Kremlin involvement, with such substances usually held only in state military stockpiles. Moscow has repeatedly denied it had anything to do with the attack, the same line used when Litvinenko was poisoned with radioactive polonium-210 in his cup of tea.

Inside sat Rebecca, a teenage girl – the alternate persona of drag performer Harry Clayton-Wright, most familiar to Adelaide audiences from the “boylesque” performance company Briefs – in her perfectly ordinary bedroom in a perfectly extraordinary situation. Rebecca, with her flowing blonde hair, cute bralette, tattoo of Freddie Mercury and beautifully kept beard is, perhaps, spoilt with her expansive wardrobe of pyjamas and extensive collection of lipsticks and nail polishes. But mostly she is kind. Some guests arriving at the window come knowing they will love Rebecca; some arrive weary, or judgmental, or wanting to threaten, but she is there with a wave, a smile, a coy tilt of the head for them all. I watch these interactions from inside Rebecca’s bedroom on night two. The room is closed to the public – as night falls, security guards take their place outside the door – but she entertains a steady stream of friends, largely artists from across the fringe. And so I find myself in there, encouraged by a publicist to bring my own pyjamas, to lie on Rebecca’s bed, to paint her nails and to braid her hair. I’m nervous to spend time with an artist in character, never quite sure of how to act around someone putting on a performance, but the line between Rebecca and Clayton-Wright is hazy. To the world she is all Rebecca, yet in the room Harry creeps in. It’s an imperfect performance, and this is much of what makes the work so engaging. It is a challenge for Clayton-Wright to adopt this persona, however free flowing, for four days in such a small space. Even when the venue closes, Clayton-Wright stays, the only break space a small transportable bathroom behind the set. When I return in the final hours of the performance on night four, Clayton-Wright has begun to fray a bit at the edges. When an audience member peering in repeatedly remarks “They’re all on their phones!”, Rebecca snaps “Yes, and?!” back through the glass. Largely, though, it is incredible to witness the spirit of generosity with which Slumber Party is performed. There is other drag work on at the fringe, but there is something particularly thoughtful about this production – both the way it is designed to be stumbled upon, and the pedestrian quality of the room. Rebecca sometimes performs: she flips her hair, she preens, she flirts. She creates a space for other performers and all the weird and wonderful things they want to play with. But for the most part, this is a room of familiarity. A girl’s bedroom. A space we understand. It’s astonishing to witness, from the inside, all the ways people are drawn to and engage with Rebecca, especially when you consider the commitment to time. The endurance of a four-day performance forces its audience to think about how we construct and present ourselves, and to think about Rebecca and the space she is taking up even when we’ve left the park behind. Clayton-Wright has created a gentle incursion into the way the public sees drag. Over the evening I watch a toddler – maybe not old enough to talk but old enough, perhaps, to have started learning about gender – continually leave and return, each time more and more engaged, each time a bigger smile on his face. I watch older children run past making fun of this girl and her beard, but again coming back more and more interested, increasingly willing to stop. A girl about eight is nervous: her father brings her up to the window to say hello, to show her there is nothing to be frightened of. She keeps looking back the whole walk out of the park. Teenage girls are excited and drawn to Rebecca. They love this representation of themselves, this feminine taking up of space. They praise her outfits; they yell “Yas! Becky with the good hair!”; they take Instagrams and Snapchats. More than anyone, these girls understand the power in being told they can be different, more confident, than they’ve been led to believe. They see this performance is a celebration of teenage girlhood, and a space to say that your body, and yourself, can be complex and contradictory to the ways society has told us bodies and gender should operate. And over the hours, as I don more of Rebecca’s wardrobe – a fluffy coat, bunny slippers – this confidence slips into me. Although I am on display, I feel remarkably free. Older men, holding the hands of their female partners, blow kisses. As a heterosexual couple loudly talk about “him”, they’re stopped by a pair of women who ask Rebecca what pronouns she uses. “She!” she cheerily proclaims through the glass. The couple stop, and reset. Young, straight men try to flirt with Rebecca, try to make Clayton-Wright uncomfortable with their display of masculinity. But they cannot win. This is Rebecca’s space. She owns it, and she knows her power. I watch as she coolly turns her eyes towards a man reaching his hand inside his pants. He startles and runs off. His friend yells back at Rebecca, “Nah, you’re alright!”, laughing as he runs off, too. Well past midnight, as the park quiets down and I prepare to leave, Clayton-Wright and I talk about how we were never in the cool groups at school. We talk about teenage anxieties, and the nervousness that comes from going to parties during that time of feeling like you don’t belong. This Slumber Party, on display to the world for 107 hours, gives space to none of those fears. Instead it tells you, clearly and confidently: everything you are is enough."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/mar/09/trumps-steel-tariffs-political-theater","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-09T11:00:34Z","webTitle":"Trump's tariffs are mere political theater | James K Galbraith","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/09/trumps-steel-tariffs-political-theater","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/09/trumps-steel-tariffs-political-theater","fields":{"headline":"Trump's steel tariffs are mere political theater","bodyText":"On Thursday, Donald Trump announced a 25% tariff on steel and a 10% tariff on aluminum, likely excepting Canada and Mexico – and perhaps America’s strategic partner Australia in due course. It was, of course, a shocking thing. When was the last time a US president did such a shocking thing? Well, actually it was in the first week of March 2002, at exactly the same point in a presidential first term. The president was George W Bush, of the Republican party, and the steel tariff he imposed was 30%. And before that? Ronald Reagan, with his “voluntary export restraints”. As the man from Vaudeville ran out on stage to announce: don’t clap too loud, it’s an old theater. A difference is that both Reagan and Bush were ideological free-traders, globalists, union-busters, dedicated to the approved ideology in these matters. So when they imposed tariffs, they largely got a pass – except from a few principled free traders on their own staffs, who did complain, as Gary Cohn has done now. As a declared protectionist, on the other hand, when Trump makes a protectionist move, zero tolerance applies. But … since when is a 25% tariff higher than a 30% tariff? (Hint: it’s not). The practical effect of the tariffs will be small. The steel industry has about 150,000 employees in total; the aluminum industry claims about the same amount. No producer will commit the billions required to expand capacity, knowing that tariffs come and go; the Bush tariffs were taken off after only two years. If there is spare capacity that can be brought into service under the tariff barrier, that will show mainly as increased productivity rather than many new jobs. But there won’t be much increased production either, because there won’t be that much effect on imports or even on import costs. If Mexico and Canada (and eventually Australia) are exempted, does anything stop them from increasing their own exports to the US, while also increasing imports from the non-exempt countries – such as Brazil – to meet their domestic needs? Maybe, but then it’s not clear how they can be considered “exempt”. So the tariffs – as they are currently planned – could amount to little more than a game of metallurgical musical chairs. And even where they bite – as they will in some cases – will they slow things down in the face of the fiscal expansion already under way? Not by much. So why did Trump do it? The reasons are obvious. First reason: politics. It’s March of Trump’s midterm election year. He needs to be able to say he’s delivered on his promises to American workers. Now he can say that. Second reason: politics. There is a special election in western Pennsylvania on Tuesday, and it’s widely believed that the Republican candidate is weak, in a district Trump carried by 20 points. The tariff announcement can’t hurt with that one. Third reason: also politics. Right on cue, Trump’s enemies chimed in. The all-knowing economists. The Wall Street globalists. The financial press. It was a great instance of what the Brits call Project Fear. The tariffs will bring on a trade war! They will cripple the construction industry! They are “stupid”! Even the ever-popular president of the European Commission Mr Juncker stepped up, threatening retaliation against Harley-Davidson and Levi-Strauss – although not against Citigroup or Goldman Sachs. Take that, America! Of course in the White House, all this just makes the president laugh. He’s looking at his poll numbers; confident they’ll go up; the midterms are coming into focus and things are right on track.

It would be the first time a sitting US president has met the leader of North Korea. ‘Shocking that Trump agreed’ Jenny Town, assistant director, US-Korea Institute at Johns Hopkins SAIS: “It was a bit of a shock. It wasn’t shocking that Kim offered, it’s a bit of a shock that Trump agreed to it,” Town said. “Those of us who have been pushing for US-North Korea talks, this isn’t what we had in mind. “Trump needs to realise this will come with a lot of criticism, and Trump needs to be able to shoulder that. Clear, consistent messaging is going to be important and Trump has not been shown to be adept at that.” While Trump will not be diving into the minutiae of what North Korea needs to do with its nuclear programme, Town said he should push for “a continued moratorium on nuclear and missile testing, a moratorium on space launch vehicles, stopping fissile material production and allowing inspectors back into the country”. ‘An incredible coup for Kim’ Jeffrey Lewis, director of the east Asia nonproliferation program at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies: “This is literally the end of a North Korean movie – North Korea develops nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles, compelling the US president to come to Pyongyang,” said Lewis, referring to a series called The Country I Saw. “It’s an incredible coup for Kim. The message is that Saddam and Gaddafi disarmed. They are dead,” he said. “Kim finished the nuclear weapons program. He gets a summit with the president of the United States. “We should be talking to Pyongyang, but you don’t frontload the big concession.” ‘Guarded optimism’ Alexandra Bell, senior policy director at the Center for Arms Control &amp; Non-Proliferation and former state department official: “We don’t have a lot of reasons to trust Kim, but we also want to avoid a disastrous conflict. We should look at this offer with guarded optimism and have realistic short-term goals,” Bell said. “This offer was more than anyone was expecting and could have imagined and I will not deny that it seems a little too good to be true, but it is an offer worth pursuing in a careful and cautious manner. Maintaining a test freeze for as long as possible is in our interest. “The hard work of real nuclear negotiations takes months, if not years,” she added. “The White House has to be prepared to endure a lot of long, slow-moving negotiations that may stall along the way.” ‘Smile, nod, but don’t agree to anything’ Mintaro Oba, former US diplomat who worked on North Korea policy: “My advice to Donald Trump is this: nod, smile, and be open to any possibilities that help get us closer to denuclearisation and peace. And don’t agree to anything – or rule anything out – without taking the time to consult trusted advisers, especially career diplomats. “It would be a shame if President Trump didn’t come to the summit with a bold, creative proposal designed to put the ball in North Korea’s court and test Pyongyang’s willingness to make progress.” China, which was a major force in previous rounds of negotiations, seems to be left out this time, but Oba said: “China has always been comfortable with the division of the Korean peninsula, but it wants to make sure the situation is stable and that tensions aren’t rising in a way that could endanger China’s security. Beijing will be happy with the latest progress.” ‘Kim may offer more’ Frank Aum, senior North Korea expert at the US Institute of Peace: “Since Kim Jong-un has already made some concessions without getting anything in return, such as freezing nuclear and missile tests, and conceding that US-South Korea military exercises need to continue as scheduled, I wouldn’t be surprised if Kim Jong-un is prepared to offer many things during a summit meeting. “North Korea’s price for giving up its weapons may be too high for the US to bear, such as the withdrawal of US forces from South Korea or the end of the US-South Korea Alliance,” Aum said. “Or North Korea may not provide enough reassurances on the monitoring and verification aspects of denuclearisation. Or NK may agree to denuclearise over a longer period than the US would find acceptable.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/mar/09/trans-pacific-partnership-what-the-deal-is-and-what-it-means-for-australia","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-09T06:14:56Z","webTitle":"Trans-Pacific Partnership explainer: what the deal is and what it means for Australia","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/09/trans-pacific-partnership-what-the-deal-is-and-what-it-means-for-australia","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/mar/09/trans-pacific-partnership-what-the-deal-is-and-what-it-means-for-australia","fields":{"headline":"Trans-Pacific Partnership: what the deal is and what it means for Australia","bodyText":"Australia has joined 10 other nations to sign the long-awaited Trans-Pacific Partnership, which many thought was doomed when Donald Trump withdrew the United States from the Obama-era pact in January 2017. But after strong lobbying by Japan and Australia, the idea was revived and on Friday they struck the renamed Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership, or TPP-11. What is the deal? The central purpose of the TPP is to further open up the markets of its member countries: Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore and Vietnam. Trade tariffs will be slashed considerably. The deal will eliminate 98% of trade barriers, opening up access to a combined marketplace worth close to $13.7tn. Even without the US, it’s a hugely significant deal and could become a blueprint for future regional free trade agreements. Other nations have the chance to enter at a later time, if they so wish, and there have been suggestions Indonesia and even the United Kingdom may have some interest. The TPP also comes at a time when major powers, such as the US, are reverting to protectionist trade policies. The head of policy at the Export Council of Australia, Heath Baker, said its symbolism was significant. “[The TPP] shows that despite the protectionism coming out of the US, there is still momentum to increasing shared prosperity through freer trade,” he said. And what does it mean for Australia? There’s a lot we don’t know about the TPP deal. What we do know is that it’ll have major ramifications for Australia’s agricultural sector. As the trade minister, Steve Ciobo, put it: “The world will be drinking more Australian wine, eating more Australian beef and using more Australian services thanks to the TPP-11.” The deal will reduce or abolish tariffs on Australian beef, cheese, cotton, wool, seafood, horticulture and wine. There’ll be greater access to Japanese, Canadian and Mexican markets for Australian sugar and dairy exporters. A side agreement has also been signed with Canada to gradually remove tariffs on beef exports over five years. Ciobo also said there will be benefits for financial, professional and education services, as well as advanced manufacturing. What we don’t have is an officially endorsed estimate on how much the Australian economy will benefit from the deal. Ciobo said such modelling is typically misleading. An independent thinktank, the Peterson Institute for International Economics, has estimated a benefit of US$12bn (A$15.4bn) for Australia’s national income by 2030. The Greens say that figure is tiny and looks “more like a rounding error”. The TPP also helps to set new trade norms within the region, something the Export Council said is significant. “But the benefits of joining aren’t just economic,” Baker said. “The reason that Barack Obama pushed the TPP was to establish the next generation of trade rules. Even without the US, the TPP-11 still does this.” Are there things we don’t know about it? One of the persistent criticisms of the TPP has been the secrecy surrounding its true impact on Australia. The text of the agreement and an analysis of its impact on Australia’s national interest will not be tabled in parliament until the end of the month, well after it’s signed. The deal will then be scrutinised by the treaties committee. Labor, while generally supportive, wants “independent modelling” to demonstrate the benefit of the new TPP to Australia. The Greens are promising to closely scrutinise the contents of the bill when it comes before parliament. So what’s wrong with it? There are serious concerns about the impact of the deal on the costs of medicines in Australia. The Public Health Association of Australia says it risks increasing medicine costs. The association says the terms of the deal benefit the US pharmaceutical industry, while delaying access to cheaper generic drugs. Some of those rules were suspended when the US withdrew. But the PHAA says that could change if the US decides to re-enter. “These include the TPP’s rules for biologic medicines, which could delay access to cheaper versions of expensive cancer and immunotherapy treatments and raise the cost of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme,” said Deborah Gleeson, a spokeswoman for the association. “But while these provisions have been suspended, they haven’t been removed.” The PHAA also has concerns about rules for alcohol labelling, which it says could block a push for mandatory health warnings. The Greens, who are bitterly opposed to the deal, say it risks driving up the cost of vital medicines. Greens senator Sarah Hanson-Young said it would send the “costs of vital cancer medications through the roof”. And what about those investor-state dispute settlement clauses? These clauses have been very controversial. Many believe they cede too much power to corporations because they allow companies to sue member states if they do not act in line with the TPP’s investment obligations. Similar provisions in a Hong Kong-Australia trade deal were used by tobacco giant Philip Morris to sue the Gillard government for its 2012 plain-packaging laws. The TPP does have protection for states from being sued for regulatory measures and there are specific protections preventing tobacco companies from suing over Australia’s laws. But the PHAA and the Greens fear it will make Australia liable to court action for simply acting in the national interest."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/mar/09/north-korea-talks-where-will-donald-trump-meet-kim-jong-un","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-09T03:01:19Z","webTitle":"North Korea talks: Where will Donald Trump meet Kim Jong-un?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/09/north-korea-talks-where-will-donald-trump-meet-kim-jong-un","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/mar/09/north-korea-talks-where-will-donald-trump-meet-kim-jong-un","fields":{"headline":"North Korea talks: Where will Donald Trump meet Kim Jong-un?","bodyText":"It will be one of the most eagerly watched diplomatic encounters since Richard Nixon was hosted by Mao Zedong in China, or Ronald Reagan held talks with Mikhail Gorbachev in neutral Switzerland. But the stunning announcement on Thursday that Donald Trump will come face to face with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, whom he has previously branded “little rocket man”, prompts an immediate question: where? “Does this mean Chairman Kim is coming to Washington or does it mean the president of the United States is going to travel to North Korea?” pondered Jim Walsh, a senior research associate at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s security studies programme. “There are other options: it’s conceivable they might be able to meet in South Korea. No one has a plan here, presumably. There’s a lot of work to do between now and May.” More neutral potential venues for the first ever meeting between leaders of the two countries include China, Japan or South Korea. Other options might be the United Nations in Geneva or New York, or the Korean Demilitarised Zone (DMZ) that divides North and South. Or a long shot: Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida, where he has entertained world leaders including President Xi Jinping of China. The South Korean national security director, Chung Eui-yong, told reporters of the planned meeting outside the White House on Thursday, having briefed Trump and other senior officials about talks with Kim. White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said Trump “will accept the invitation to meet with Kim Jong-un at a place and time to be determined”. Analysts generally agreed Trump should not hand Kim the public relations coup of a photo opportunity in the North Korean capital, Pyongyang. Christopher Hill, a former US ambassador to North Korea, told America’s MSNBC network: “My advice would be the president should not journey to Pyongyang. Nor should he invite Kim Jong-un to Washington.” There have been creative solutions in the past, Hill continued, including “ship summits”: in 1989 George H W Bush and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev met on a Soviet cruise ship moored in a harbour in Malta, a summit hailed as helping to end the cold war. “One of the reasons we had the Balkan deliberations in Dayton, Ohio [an agreement that signalled the end to the civil war in Bosnia], was that no one wanted them to come to Washington and see the whole process blow up, so maybe we could do it in some out of the way place in the US or a third country.” Hill, who was head of the US delegation to the six-party talks on the North Korean nuclear issue, added: “I think no one has really given that a thought but I’m sure they can come up with something that will work for both parties. “And by the way, that wouldn’t be China because I think the North Koreans want to show they can deal with the US and not through China.” Other analysts agreed that China is an outside bet to host the meeting. Frank Aum, a senior expert on North Korea at the United States Institute of Peace in Washington, said: “Kim has never left the country, as far as I know, since he assumed power, so I couldn’t see it happening in a foreign country such as South Korea, China or the US. At the same time, it’s hard to see the US providing the prestige of having Donald Trump go to Pyongyang for a visit.” A more probable contender, Aum suggests, is Panmunjom in the DMZ. An inter-Korean summit is due to take place next month at Panmunjom Peace House on the South Korean side of the zone. Retired lieutenant-colonel Daniel Davis, a fellow at Defense Priorities, said: “There’s a lot of pros and cons. Some people say it should be in a neutral location. There are also positive points to say it should be on US turf because he would have home advantage. I don’t think Trump should go to Pyongyang or even Seoul. It should be somewhere like Tokyo.” Ultimately, however, the choice of venue will be less important than the content of the negotiations. Walsh, who has visited North Korea, admitted: “I’m both elated and horrified. I feel those emotions simultaneously. It could be the beginning of something important or it could crash and burn and we could all end up in a more dangerous place.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2018/mar/15/not-welcome-here-amazon-faces-growing-resistance-to-its-second-home","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-15T10:00:21Z","webTitle":"'Not welcome here': Amazon faces growing resistance to its second home","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/mar/15/not-welcome-here-amazon-faces-growing-resistance-to-its-second-home","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2018/mar/15/not-welcome-here-amazon-faces-growing-resistance-to-its-second-home","fields":{"headline":"'Not welcome here': Amazon faces growing resistance to its second home","bodyText":"What do you get for the man who has everything? When it comes to Jeff Bezos – the richest man in the world with around $130bn to his name – many US cities competing to host Amazon’s second headquarters have an answer: billions of dollars in tax incentives. That proposition has united an ideologically diverse group of dissenters to Amazon’s grand HQ2 competition, ranging from rightwing organizations linked to the Koch brothers to the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA). Groups and individuals that would normally agree only to mutual disdain and distrust have somehow come around to the same conclusion: that Amazon’s decision to pit 20 cities against each other in a fight to host a future hub is a bad deal for everyone except Amazon. In Atlanta, an anonymous group of activists with roots in the Occupy movement has set up AtlantaAgainstAmazon.org, a website that compares the HQ2 process to “something like a televised Hunger Games death-match”, and has designed anti-Amazon flyers that have been plastered around town. Generation Opportunity, a conservative advocacy group for millennials associated with the Koch brothers, has launched a targeted digital ad campaign with a slickly produced, ominously soundtracked video that compares the HQ2 competition to – wait for it – the Hunger Games. And a petition launched by the prominent urbanist Richard Florida and dozens of other academics calling for the finalist cities to unite in a “mutual non-aggression pact” on tax incentives has garnered more than 15,000 signatures. The idea behind the pact is that rather than engage in a tax-break arms race, everyone should agree not to offer incentives. That would force Amazon to simply choose its new home by the merits of the locations, which Florida told the Guardian he suspects they will do anyway, and free up local governments to invest their tax dollars in the kind of improvements that make a city attractive to a corporation in the first place. “I didn’t expect to ever write a protest letter,” said Florida, who was part of the group that organized Toronto’s bid for HQ2, where he advocated against tax incentives. “But one weekend I was so mad, I started emailing my friends across the ideological spectrum, and every one of them said they’d sign on in a minute.” Florida called the tax incentives proposed by states like New Jersey ($7bn) and Maryland ($3bn) “obscene”, an assessment shared by the Washington-based advocacy group Fair Budget Coalition. “Jeff Bezos personally has more money than the district’s budget,” said the group’s co-director, Monica Kamen. “Are we going to give the richest man in history a tax break before we make sure that homeless children have a place to sleep?” The Fair Budget Coalition has worked with the local DSA chapter to launch “Obviously Not DC”, a campaign that takes its name from the district’s pro-DC hashtag campaign, #ObviouslyDC. Asked how the group felt about ending up on the same side of an issue as the liberal bogeymen the Kochs, Kamen’s co-director Stephanie Sneed chimed in: “A broken clock is right twice a day.” Brad Landers, a member of New York City council who signed the Florida petition, said that he would be happy for Amazon to move to New York, as long as it paid its fair share. “You’re not opening a second headquarters as a charitable project,” he said. “You are opening it to make more money, and that is going to impose all these costs that our city has to bear, especially around transit, infrastructure, schools, and housing. You’re not expected to pay more, even though you have some outsize impacts, but to ask to pay less is just appallingly bad corporate behavior.” But some said they would oppose Amazon’s presence in their city, whether or not they were offered tax cuts. “Right now in Pittsburgh, we’re losing three black people every day from the city to the surrounding area,” said Carl Redwood, a community organizer and professor of social work at the University of Pittsburgh. “Amazon coming won’t change that trend. It will accelerate the trend.” “My view is that they should keep on walking,” he added. “Don’t come to Pittsburgh. Amazon is not welcome here.” Anti-HQ2 activists in Atlanta and Washington shared Redwood’s concern about the displacement of black communities from cities, and the tech industry’s execrable track record for hiring black and Latino employees does not give them confidence that selecting a majority black city will change that. Kamen said she expected Amazon would have “district residents work in the janitorial jobs and construction, and give all the high paying jobs to incoming white workers”. Despite the breadth of the opposition to Amazon among academics and community activists, however, just four elected officials from finalist cities have signed on to the non-aggression pact. Lander expressed disappointment that he had not been able to garner more support from a network of progressive elected officials around the country, but was also understanding of the intense political pressure that many feel to support their cities’ bids. “We have a lot of organizing to do or it will probably happen just like this the next time,” he said. But Florida, who called the city councilors who signed the pact “heroes”, said that he believes the backlash to HQ2 is just getting started, and that politicians who feel pressured to support the bids are mistaken about how residents will respond once a winner is chosen and the details of the deal become public. “If you win this thing, God help you,” he said. “The backlash in that community is going to be horrific, and the person who thinks they’re going to ride that to the governor’s house or the White House is going to ride it to being unelected.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2018/mar/09/comedy-or-cruelty-does-chris-lilley-have-a-place-in-2018","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-09T05:00:26Z","webTitle":"Comedy or cruelty: does Chris Lilley have a place in 2018?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/mar/09/comedy-or-cruelty-does-chris-lilley-have-a-place-in-2018","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2018/mar/09/comedy-or-cruelty-does-chris-lilley-have-a-place-in-2018","fields":{"headline":"Comedy or cruelty: does Chris Lilley have a place in 2018?","bodyText":"Netflix’s apparent quest to buy up all of TV has led it to secure the return of Chris Lilley to our screens. News emerged earlier this week that the Australian comedian behind Summer Heights High, We Can Be Heroes and Angry Boys will debut his next project on the streaming service. But the feeling that both Netflix and Lilley are jumping into unknown territory hangs heavy in the air. Can the divisive and provocative nature of Lilley’s humour exist in a TV landscape where representation and diversity are more important than ever? In 2014 Lilley’s most recent show, Jonah from Tonga, was criticised for its broad portrayal of Tongan culture. The show, a spin-off from his Summer Heights High, saw the then-39-year-old comic in brownface make-up, portraying a rebellious teenage character struggling to behave himself and get ahead at school. The show was criticised widely at the time and a range of major American civil rights organisations, including the NAACP, wrote to US broadcaster HBO expressing their “deep concern” with its content. Similarly, New Zealand’s minister for Pacific peoples at the time, Alfred Ngaro, said the series perpetuated many “negative stereotypes”. In 2017 the series was cut from Māori Television. Fans can argue that Lilley is a satirist whose skill lays in critiquing and lampooning cultural stereotypes, with no section of society safe. In 2013 he told Esquire his humour is designed to be “confronting” and “challenging”. This may be true, but in recent years Lilley’s gags haven’t been smart or strong enough to justify his on-screen provocations. Just last year he was forced to apologise when he posted an old clip of his most flagrantly offensive character, rapper parody S.mouse. In the video, which Lilley later deleted, S.mouse performed a track titled Squashed Nigga, which opens with a shot of a small Indigenous boy splayed out on a road. If there is ever a right time for a white guy in his 40s to post a clip like that remains to be seen, but less than a week earlier, the man who ran over and killed Indigenous teenager Elijah Doughty was cleared of manslaughter, in a ruling that shocked the country. Lilley was left to explain that the timing of his clip was in no way connected. Parody only works if the jokes are punching up and the audience is laughing at something wider than the subject. Aiming the same comic scythe at a minority group with little power can look like bullying. And, unfortunately for Lilley, the message of his most popular characters often seems to get lost in translation. In addition to Jonah and S.mouse, Lilley is known for dressing as schoolgirl Ja’mie and mocking some of the more shallow elements of teen life. (“I love your bins. They’re so random.”) He’s also not averse to playing Asian characters such as Jen Okazaki, a demanding Japanese mum who pushes her son so hard to become a champion skateboarder that he become depressed. In typical Lilley fashion, Angry Boys features scenes in which Okazaki decides to brand her son as gay in order to make him more marketable. Try not to laugh too hard as his “GayStyle Enterprises” begin flogging penis-shaped whistles. The success of Little Britain, itself a riotous assault on the senses in which working-class, gay, trans and disabled characters were routinely played for laughs, is a noteworthy parallel with Lilley and his work. Unlike Lilley though, the creators of that show have reckoned with their output. Speaking last year, Matt Lucas said he and co-creator David Walliams would not bring back the show because society has moved on. “If I could go back and do Little Britain again, I wouldn’t make those jokes about transvestites,” Lucas told the Big Issue. “I wouldn’t play black characters. Basically, I wouldn’t make that show now. It would upset people. We made a more cruel kind of comedy than I’d do now.” Comedian Hari Kondabolu has also tackled what he describes as the “soft racism” in comedy. In his 2017 documentary The Problem With Apu, Kondabolu looked at The Simpsons’ most famous Kwik-E-Mart employee, speaking with fellow south Asian comics, including Aziz Ansari and Aparna Nancherla. They talked movingly about how comedy can confound those left in the shadows of characters that poke fun at a community, regardless of whether it’s done with love. Ultimately, Kondabolu deduced that The Simpsons always won. The same can be said for Lilley. It is striking how rarely Lilley has looked inwards for his humour, instead capitalising on broad swipes and well-worn stereotypes of anyone but middle-aged straight white guys. Maybe his Netflix show will see Lilley reckon with his past and create something fresh and new. We don’t know yet. But you can’t help feeling that 2007 may be where Lilley’s brand of button-pushing humour belongs – if indeed it ever belonged in the first place."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/mar/09/laws-that-make-land-clearing-easier-ruled-invalid-by-nsw-court","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-09T00:33:39Z","webTitle":"Laws that make land clearing easier ruled invalid by NSW court","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/mar/09/laws-that-make-land-clearing-easier-ruled-invalid-by-nsw-court","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/mar/09/laws-that-make-land-clearing-easier-ruled-invalid-by-nsw-court","fields":{"headline":"Laws that make land clearing easier ruled invalid by NSW court","bodyText":"Laws that make land clearing in New South Wales easier have been ruled invalid by the NSW land and environment court after a challenge filed by the Nature Conservation Council. In November 2016, the NSW Coalition government scrapped the state’s Native Vegetation Act, the Threatened Species Conservation Act and the Nature Conservation Trust Act, and replaced them with its new Biodiversity Conservation Act. The government also introduced a suite of codes that exempted clearing in a range of circumstances from normal development assessment requirements. The council, represented by the environmental defenders office NSW, argued in court in Sydney on Friday that the codes were invalid because the environment minister had not approved them before they were implemented. The council’s case was backed by the court, and the NSW government now has the option to reintroduce the codes with the appropriate oversight. The council’s chief executive, Kate Smolski, urged the government not to do that. “It would be completely cynical for the government to immediately remake these laws without first correcting their many flaws and including environmental protections the community wants and the science says we need,” she said. Crucially, among the law changes, the government introduced a suite of self-assessible codes, which allowed farmers to decide whether or not a piece of land could be cleared of trees and shrubs. Some of those codes had no requirements for offsets, leading experts to fear that clearing rates could double in some parts of NSW. Such codes have been central to the surge in land clearing in Queensland, after the former LNP government introduced them in 2012. “By the government’s own assessment, they will lead to a spike in clearing of up to 45% and expose threatened wildlife habitat to destruction, including 99% of identified koala habitat on private land,” Smolski said. Since the codes that exempt clearing form normal development assessment procedures could have a significant impact on the environment, they required the environment minister, Gabrielle Upton, to approve them before they were implemented by primary industries minister, Niall Blair. That never happened. Since the codes do not require an act of parliament, they could be reintroduced almost immediately, as long as Upton approves them before they are implemented. David Morris, the chief executive of the environmental defenders’ office NSW, told Guardian Australia the ruling technically made any land clearing that has occurred under the codes unlawful. And any new clearing will require a full development assessment until new codes are introduced. “This is a legal and policy low point for NSW,” he said. “In conceding that they failed to follow due process, the government gives the strong impression of making laws on the run. “This is not simply a matter of incorrect paperwork. Ecologically sustainable development is not just another box to tick. The environment minister has a legal responsibility to protect biodiversity in this state. “Land clearing is a major threat to biodiversity, as habitat for many animals and birds is wiped out, along with thousands of hectares of native vegetation.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2018/mar/09/congress-republicans-democrats-gun-control","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-09T12:55:17Z","webTitle":"Paralysis in Congress as Republicans and Democrats dither over gun control","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/mar/09/congress-republicans-democrats-gun-control","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/mar/09/congress-republicans-democrats-gun-control","fields":{"headline":"Paralysis in Congress as Republicans and Democrats dither over gun control","bodyText":"Three weeks after 17 people were in killed in a massacre at a high school in Parkland, Congress is once again paralyzed over how to respond. Republicans are pushing for swift action on measures that would enhance school safety in an effort to calm public outrage fueled by the student survivors of the Stoneman Douglas shooting. Democrats, meanwhile, are working to amplify that anger, determined that the immense pressure on lawmakers will finally break the decades-long gridlock over guns in Washington and produce meaningful firearms reforms. Democrats are looking forward to a nationwide protest on 24 March, when hundreds of thousands of activists are expected to march against gun violence in Washington and dozens of other cities. The Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, announced this week that Democrats would wait to force action on gun legislation until after the rally, “when our Republican friends see they are just against the nation”. A majority of the public believe the Parkland students are effective advocates for gun control, according to a new Monmouth University poll released on Thursday. And 57% of the respondents said the students were having more of an impact on the gun debate than the victims of previous mass shootings. “This time, the gun rights crowd messed with the wrong community, the wrong kids and the wrong dad,” Fred Guttenberg, whose 14-year-old daughter, Jaime, was killed at Stoneman Douglas, said during a hearing in Washington this week. He added: “I have dedicated the rest of my life to fighting for the cause of gun safety.” Guns remains one of the most divisive issues in US politics despite the groundswell of activism, and polls showing stronger public support for controls since the shooting. The inaction from Congress so far reflects the dim political reality of passing meaningful reform. During a meeting last month at the White House, Donald Trump upended the debate by embracing gun control measures long opposed by Republicans and the NRA. He later met representatives of the NRA and appeared to dial back his support. This week, Trump met critics of violent video games and game-makers: Trump has suggested that violence in video games may play a role in school shootings. Researchers say there is little evidence to support the claim. With fresh urgency and growing numbers, advocates of stricter gun control have renewed calls for restrictions on gun purchases, including expanding background checks for firearm purchases online and at gun shows, banning assault-style weapons, restricting high-capacity magazine and raising the minimum age to buy an assault weapon from 18 to 21. They have also lobbied for measures that would allow authorities to remove guns from individuals deemed to pose a threat to themselves or others. Senate Democrats this week demanded legislation that would close “loopholes” in the background check system, requiring verification on firearms sales at gun shows and over the internet. They have also urged that Republican leaders allow Congress to debate whether to ban semi-automatic weapons like the ones used in the Florida shooting – a proposal that divides Democrats. As legislation stalled this week, Senate Democrats held an emotional hearing with survivors and family members of those killed in the February shooting, who implored “weak-kneed” politicians to act. Later, students staged a sit-in outside Mitch McConnell’s office in Washington. They chanted “Enough is enough” and “Not one more”. Republicans, meanwhile, rushed to bring forward a clutch of bills devoted to school safety in an effort to calm mounting public frustration. On Thursday, the Republican senator Lindsey Graham and his Democratic colleague Richard Blumenthal unveiled the Federal Extreme Risk Protection Act, which would allow courts to intervene to temporarily restrain potentially harmful individuals from possessing or purchasing a gun. The legislation is modeled after so-called “red-flag” laws that exist in a handful of states. Florida senators Marco Rubio and Bill Nelson introduced a related bill earlier this week, which would encourage states – using federal grants – to adopt such laws at the state and local level. Meanwhile, Senator Orrin Hatch, a Republican from Utah, introduced legislation that would provide funding to states to improve security and boost technology designed to stop violence in schools. The House is expected to vote on a version of this bill next week. But it remains to be seen if any of the legislation could clear the 60-vote threshold in the Senate. The one exception appears to the the bipartisan bill, sponsored by John Cornyn, the No 2 Senate Republican, that would incentivize public agencies to improve reporting to the FBI’s National Instant Criminal Background Checks System. The Senate bill, known as Fix Nics, a version of which has already passed the House, has 61 co-sponsors as of Friday. Democrats broadly support the measure but argue that alone it is woefully inadequate to address the demands of students and gun control advocates. Cornyn on Thursday blamed Democrats for stalling immediate action on the bill, though at least one Republican senator has objected to fast-tracking the legislation. “I can’t tell you how disappointed I am that the United States Senate has done nothing, nothing, to prevent them from happening in the future,” he said. But those measures are unlikely to satisfy Democrats and activists, who have accused Republicans of focusing on mental health to avoid addressing the real threat, which they say is the proliferation of “weapons of war” in daily American life. Schumer said this week that the day of action will have “huge effect” on Republican lawmakers, who he believes will be pressured to make at least some concessions on gun control. “Their time has come,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/mar/09/a-joke-sam-kerr-snub-from-world-xi-sparks-australian-outrage","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-09T00:35:15Z","webTitle":"'A joke': Sam Kerr snub from world XI sparks Australian outrage","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/mar/09/a-joke-sam-kerr-snub-from-world-xi-sparks-australian-outrage","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/mar/09/a-joke-sam-kerr-snub-from-world-xi-sparks-australian-outrage","fields":{"headline":"'A joke': Sam Kerr snub from world XI sparks Australian outrage","bodyText":"What more does Sam Kerr have to do to be recognised at the highest level? That is the question many are asking after the record-breaking Matildas striker was overlooked for a select world XI team, voted for by fellow players based on performances in 2017. Kerr, who scored eight times in nine internationals last year as the Matildas rose to fourth in Fifa’s rankings, came in a surprising ninth place in the strikers category for the Fifpro women’s world XI. With just the top three in that position making the elite team, Kerr was some way off selection. It is the second major recent disappointment for Kerr, who was also overlooked for the final list of three in last year’s world player of the year award, having initially made it onto the shortlist of 10. The latest snub comes despite a record-breaking 2017 for the player, who in addition to her exploits for the Matildas – who won the Tournament of Nations and in doing so registered a first win over world No1 USA – became the all-time leading goalscorer in America’s National Women’s Soccer League and won the Julie Dolan medal as the W-League’s best player for the 2016-17 season. The Perth Glory and Sky Blue FC player ended 2017 with a total of 36 goals in 43 games for clubs and country and was recognised by scooping the AFC women’s player of the year and the ABC Sports Personality of the Year awards. She was also named by the The International Federation of Football History in a world XI at the end of 2017. The voting for the Fifpro XI was based on a poll of more than 4,100 female first-division footballers in 45 countries. Matildas team-mate Lisa De Vanna labelled Kerr’s omission a “joke” while the list was branded elsewhere as “laughable” and “useless”. The final XI was largely made up of Europe-based players. European champions Lyon provided five, including on-loan American Alex Morgan, while five players currently ply their trade in the French league. Just Morgan and her Brazilian Orlando Pride team-mate, Marta, hail from outside Europe. Kerr has never played for a European club and, given the European Championships were held last year, she may have fallen victim to the world’s focus lying elsewhere in 2017. Since the start of the new year, and after saying she can still get better, Kerr has shown no signs of slowing down. Earlier this month, Kerr’s red-hot scoring streak continued when she netted in a seventh straight international game as the Matildas recorded their eight consecutive win with victory over Norway in the Algarve Cup. She added another to her tally five days later against China at the same invitational tournament in Portugal."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2018/mar/09/friday-briefing-meeting-being-planned-trump-to-face-kim-jong-un","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-09T06:28:57Z","webTitle":"Friday briefing: ‘Meeting being planned!’ Trump to face Kim Jong-un","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/09/friday-briefing-meeting-being-planned-trump-to-face-kim-jong-un","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/mar/09/friday-briefing-meeting-being-planned-trump-to-face-kim-jong-un","fields":{"headline":"Friday briefing: ‘Meeting being planned!’ Trump to face Kim Jong-un","bodyText":"Top story: Surprise deal struck for talks with North Korea Hello – I’m Warren Murray. News never sleeps, so let’s get you caught up. Donald Trump has agreed to attend a historic meeting with Kim Jong-un, the North Korean dictator. The pair are predicted to meet by May, with “permanent denuclearisation” on the table, according to South Korea. The initial surprise announcement was made by Chung Eui-yong, Seoul’s national security chief, who recently visited the North to meet Kim. Speaking at the White House, Chung said Kim Jong-un had “expressed his eagerness to meet President Trump as soon as possible”. The White House said Trump would meet Kim “at a time and place to be determined” and “in the meantime all sanctions and maximum pressure must remain”. Both statements can be read in full here. Trump tweeted about the “great progress” and added one of his trademark exclamatory sign-offs: “Meeting being planned!” The reaction of international observers? “This is literally the end of a North Korean movie: North Korea develops nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles, compelling the US president to come to Pyongyang,” said nonproliferation expert Jeffrey Lewis, referring (spoiler alert!) to the propaganda series The Country I Saw. Julian Borger writes that in this encounter of two enormous egos, the risks of failure are epic. So where will it happen? Mar-a-Lago and Pyongyang both seem a long shot – a more likely venue is a third country like South Korea or Japan, or the DMZ on the border of the two Koreas. * * * ‘Poisoned spy’ case widens – Police have searched Sergei Skripal’s house, cordoned off a garage in Salisbury and sealed off the graves of his wife, Liudmila, and son Alexander, both of whom died in recent years. It is a significant widening of the case surrounding former Russian intelligence officer Skripal and his daughter Yulia, who were poisoned by what the home secretary, Amber Rudd, has called a “very rare” nerve agent. A total of 21 people have received treatment as a result of the incident, including DS Nick Bailey, who has been described as a “massively dedicated” police officer. Bailey was sitting up in his hospital bed and talking but remained “very anxious, very concerned”, said Wiltshire police. Investigators will be trying to get a pure sample of the nerve agent used, in the hope of it carrying a “chemical signature” revealing where it was made. * * * ‘Latte levy’ falls flat – Ministers have rejected the idea of a 25p surcharge on disposable coffee cups. The Labour MP Mary Creagh is steaming over the decision. Creagh chairs the environmental audit committee, which made the recommendation aimed at reducing waste created by the cups – half a million are thrown away each day in the UK and just one in 400 is recycled. “Our report recommended practical solutions to the disposable packaging crisis,” Creagh said, accusing the government of “warm words but no real action”./ The government wants voluntary action by coffee shops instead. * * * Stormy relationship – What went on between the now-president and the porn star? One thing is clear – Donald Trump doesn’t want you to know about it. Tom McCarthy goes through the payoffs, the restraining orders, the Dirk Diggler-esque pseudonyms (“Peggy Petersen” and “David Dennison”) and the secret arbitration, culminating in Stephanie Clifford – AKA Stormy Daniels – suing the president to be allowed to tell her story. * * * Particular excitement – Nuclear fusion that can power the electricity grid might be just 15 years away, according to the backers of an MIT university project. We’ve heard it all before, but so far fusion reactors have always chewed up more energy than they produce. The MIT researchers plan to use ultra-powerful magnets made with new superconducting materials to smash together atoms of hydrogen – producing helium and releasing energy that could be harnessed. The Italian energy company Eni is putting $50m into the project. “If we succeed, the world’s energy systems will be transformed. We’re extremely excited about this,” says Prof Maria Zuber of MIT. Lunchtime read: Going, going, Tiangong Here at Briefing HQ we are self-confessed space junkies. Today our science editor, Ian Sample, takes a detailed look at what might happen when China’s out-of-control Tiangong-1 space station comes hurtling back to Earth – within roughly the next month. All we know is it will land somewhere along a belt of the planet between the latitudes of 43° north and 43° south. Tiangong-1 ranks as one of the larger manmade objects to re-enter the atmosphere without being deliberately steered towards the ocean. And it may be packing quite a punch – China hasn’t said much, but on board there could be rugged titanium fuel tanks, still loaded with unused hydrazine fuel which is toxic and volatile. The tanks are among parts that might survive re-entry, posing a risk if they land somewhere populated. “The only ones who know what’s onboard Tiangong-1, or even what it’s made of, are the Chinese space agency,” said Stijn Lemmens, space debris expert at the European Space Agency. We are keeping our best eyes on the skies … Sport Owen Farrell has been urged by Eddie Jones to bring his confrontational style to the England captaincy and get “in the face” of France, but was warned he must curb his aggression when talking to the referee. Arsène Wenger complimented his players for at last showing a reaction to the “nightmare” period they have endured with an authoritative 2-0 Europa League win at Milan. Chris Froome has criticised the head of cycling’s world governing body for speaking publicly about his 2017 failed drugs test. One of the many things England’s limited-overs side excel at is finding silver linings and even in the manner of their defeat in the fourth one-day international there were positives with hundreds for Joe Root and Jonny Bairstow. And Dejan Lovren has said an attempted break-in at his Liverpool home had a “horrific” impact on his family and affected his performances earlier in the season. The Winter Paralympics begin today and ski racer Kelly Gallagher, who won Great Britain’s first ever gold at Sochi, will be in Pyeongchang ready to fling herself down yet more mountains at 75mph in search of another medal. Business It’s been a very busy day for international trade. First Trump proclaimed his steel and aluminium tariffs and then 11 countries agreed a new Trans Pacific Partnership – the pact thought doomed when the US pulled out last year. Asian share markets stayed calm and carried on into positive territory, helped by the prospects of better relations on the Korean peninsula. The FTSE100 is set to rise a touch this morning while the pound has been down at $1.38 and €1.12. The papers News of the Trump-Kim meeting did not break until after the first editions so papers will have been updated. However for the first draft of history the Sun has the headline “Our lad’s beating Vlad” – which means that the policeman struck down by a nerve agent in Salisbury is recovering in hospital. The Guardian’s picture reflects the nerve agent story, with two people in chemical suits checking out a park bench. But the splash is the prospect of a 6.5% pay rise for NHS staff. The i says 21 people are being treated after the attack on the former spy. The Times says that Russian state TV is warning “traitors” not to settle in Britain or they risk being killed. While the Mail asks the question: “Should we boycott Putin’s world cup?”. It says ministers are under pressure to order the move. The Telegraph goes big on a health story with the headline: “Give blood pressure drugs to half of UK”. It says the NHS is considering new evidence that could see pills handed out more readily to the population. And lastly the Mirror splashes with “M25 rapist is dead”.

He’s also a former rapist. He confessed this to me in fits and starts, over dinners and phone calls and late-night drinks, after we’d known each other a couple of years. His story matches much of the research my work relies on, but it still forced me to re-evaluate some of my core assumptions about rapists and about the role of men in ending rape. Dave’s former MO is familiar to anyone who thinks about sexual violence for a living. He picked victims he knew. He got them alone, encouraged them to have conversations that made them feel vulnerable, and pressed a lot of alcohol on them. And then, when they were too drunk to consent, he “had sex” with them. (That’s how he thought about it at the time, though today he will tell you straight up it was rape.) The research is very clear: most rapists know they don’t have consent, and they rape an average of six times each. Before Dave told me his story, I thought that meant that most rapists were essentially sociopaths. I worried for a long time that Dave, too, must be a sociopath. But I’ve done a lot of thinking and searching on that idea, and I just don’t think he is. I think he’s a guy who grew up with some very toxic ideas about what it means to be a man. While Dave’s violence is inexcusable, his story also gives me some hope. It shows that men can change. Even men who’ve already done terrible things. Better models of masculinity are everywhere, if you know where to look. When I polled my friends about where they find examples of the kind of masculinities they want to see more of in the world, the crowdsourced list was dazzling in its diversity and included the musician Frank Ocean (for his “openness and vulnerability around sexuality”); the basketball star Steph Curry caring for his daughter at post-game press conferences; all of Barack Obama’s interactions with children; queer men of various stripes subverting the very definitions of manhood; and an array of fictional men of film and TV, including Bob from Bob’s Burgers and modern superheroes like the Flash and Midnighter. American men may be enjoying more emotional vulnerability in their superhero stories, but they also elected the living embodiment of toxic masculinity as president. Trump has spent his life defining his manliness in opposition to the women he dominates and degrades. He has been accused of sexual assault by over a dozen women, including his first wife, Ivana. The men he’s installed into power share his attitudes. And when these men talk about making America great again, one of the things they’re yearning for is the re-establishment of “traditional” gender values in which men are dominant, women are subservient, and anyone who questions whether that’s really the natural order of things is punished. My friend Dave grew up in a household steeped in those very values. It was only in learning that there are other, better ways to “be a man” that he became the friend I know him as today. That’s not to say that we should let guys who’ve already offended of the hook in order to tempt them into the light. If you hurt someone, whether or not you mean to, you should face consequences. In fact, consequences can sometimes help facilitate learning. “I think one of the reasons my behavior went unchecked for so long is that I didn’t suffer any consequences,” recalls Dave. It wasn’t until he lost a friendship he valued that he had to think about his behavior in a new light. Whatever he knows now, he still hurt those women, and if any of them decided to hold him accountable for that, I’d support them. So would Dave, for that matter. He has hardly become a full-time feminist crusader, but he does small things that make a big difference. He refuses to laugh at rape jokes or slut-shaming or anything that reduces women to commodities, and he goes out of his way to explain to other men why these things aren’t funny. He doesn’t vote for candidates who want to control women’s access to abortion or birth control. He’s raising his daughter to know that her body is her own. These are, of course, small victories, less “revolution” and more “baby steps toward basic human decency”. The difficulties in divorcing masculinity from misogyny aren’t confined to the tricky business of rape prevention. Hostile sexism – the kind that involves calling women degrading names, rape and rape threats – is the kind that’s most often linked to toxic masculinity. But it’s not the only kind of masculinity that relies on the dehumanization of women. After all, if men were just hostile to women all of the time, why would any of us enter into relationships with them? Instead, hostile sexism plays Mr Hyde to benevolent sexism’s Dr Jekyll, the two of them teaming up to keep women subservient to men’s needs. Benevolent sexism says that real men protect “good women”, who are morally superior angels living on uncomfortably narrow pedestals. It’s a kinder, gentler way to force three-dimensional women into two-dimensional boxes and strip us of our humanity. We have to get a lot more deliberate if we want to transform masculinity into a healthy identity that doesn’t rely on the subjugation of women. It would be a whole lot easier if we started at the beginning, teaching boys that being strong includes being able to embrace their own vulnerable emotions and that girls aren’t teacups or trophies or aliens from Venus but fellow human beings who are pretty dang interesting. Karen BK Chan, a sex and emotional literacy educator, speaks compellingly of the need to teach boys resiliency in the face of sexual rejection. “How might we empathize with a young guy who is balancing masculinity pressures and the desire to show and receive love?” she encourages us to ask. “How can we help him experience bearable rejection instead of unbearable failure?” Across the country, dozens of programs work with high school and college-age boys to help them rethink what it means to be a man. These programs need to start younger. We need to shift from an intervention mindset – trying to shift young men’s conceptions of masculinity after they’ve already been formed – to a prevention mindset in which we help boys develop healthier ideas about gender to start with. Research suggests middle school could be an ideal time to inoculate boys against toxic masculinity. Middle school boys’ ability to resist traditional masculine norms is relatively strong, but weakens when they get to high school. Maine Boys to Men (MBTM), a program that has long worked with high school boys, is developing a curriculum for middle school boys that teaches them to see and sidestep the rigid gender roles they’re already growing into. That’s only part of its shift from being strictly a training program for high school students to becoming a multifaceted program working to transform masculinity at the community level. In some ways, this shift is the result of the executive director Matthew Theodores’ very productive midlife crisis. Until 2012, he was general manager for marketing and strategy at a division of Microsoft. Unfulfilled, he started looking for not-for-profit organizations to connect with and stumbled into a board position at Boys to Men. Since he had three boys of his own, then ages six, eight, and eleven, it’s no surprise the work quickly got under his skin, or that he saw the potential impact of working with younger boys. MBTM adapted its high school curriculum for a middle school audience and tested it during the 2015-2016 academic year, reaching just over 500 boys in southern Maine. It tuned it up accordingly, adding more periods of physical activity and centering emotional literacy as the heart of the program, and wound up with a four-hour curriculum. The program is usually delivered one hour at a time over the course of four weeks at participating schools. The course begins with the “gender box” exercise that’s a hallmark of all MBTM programs. The idea is simple: the group leader draws a big box on the chalkboard, and the boys brainstorm stereotypes of masculinity. All of those go inside the box. Then they discuss what happens if a guy tries to behave in a way that’s not described in the box. Those punishments and threats hover around the outside of the box. The completed visual serves as a jumping off point to discuss how confining traditional masculinity can be and how harmful to both boys and girls, both men and women. Once they are primed to move beyond the gender box, the course gets the boys up and moving through a series of exercises in which they have to decide what they think about topics related to sexism and violence and debate their opinions with peers. Empathy is the glue that holds together all of the ideas in the course. As an adult woman, my presence would have inhibited the boys in the middle school program. But MBTM let me check out day two of a two-day program for high school students. The high school programs differ from their middle school work in more than age grouping – the high school group is mixed gender, with a hand-selected bunch of students the school has identified as being leaders or showing leadership potential across a range of social circles, teams, and interests. The idea is to use these teens as a schoolwide vaccine, each inoculating those in their particular spheres of influence. In one exercise, students were asked to respond physically to a series of scenarios by walking toward one side of the room or the other to indicate where on the spectrum of “healthy” to “abusive” the relationship being described sounded to them. The most contentious scenario involved a girl, Lindsay, and her prom date Ben. The two have left an after party when Ben turns off on to a strange side street and stops the car. Lindsay pretends to sleep. He kisses her neck, gropes her breast. She pushes his hand away; he gropes her some more. The three students who take a stand in Ben’s defense are all girls: “She didn’t say no.” One boy says: “It’s not on her to say something. She has indicated that she does not want this to continue.” A facilitator ends the stalemate, announcing that what Ben did is sexual assault, in no uncertain terms. The girls remain unconvinced. It’s a stark reminder that toxic masculinities aren’t just perpetuated by men. After completing the program, the students will be assigned an adviser and encouraged to help their fellow students step out of their gender boxes. It’s all part of a focus on making a community project of shifting gender norms that everyone can take part in. To that end, MBTM is also expanding its adult offerings, including a boot camp for new dads that offers practical parenting prep along with some exercises to help the dads think about how they want gender to play out in their relationship with their co-parent, their parenting style, and the values they pass on to their kids. Though the high school program has proved effective through years of evaluation, it’s too soon to say what impact the new offerings will have. But the signs are encouraging. Feedback from the middle school boys is almost universally positive, with most of them saying they’re going to change the way they talk to people or adjust their judgments about how others do gender. “Kids have come up after we’re done,” facilitator Sam Eley tells me, “and said, ‘Man, I’m really not going to try and be in a box!’” The staff at MBTM hopes that the project will transform the kind of measurement they can do on the effectiveness of their interventions, by following the students as they grow into high schoolers and beyond. That kind of longitudinal data on transforming masculinities is nearly nonexistent and could light a way forward for many other programs to follow. And not a moment too soon, because the boys are already being influenced by our fragile masculinist-in-chief.

With an oversized polar fleece jacket and a beanie pulled down on his cold head, he sat tight at the table as we scurried to fulfil a feast. I brought lillies, and laced them with wattle, one of his favourite flowers, September blooms, the elegant and the indigenous. The wattle drooped magnificently from around the thrusting lily necks. That day, though we three siblings barely spoke to each other, we worked to put the meal on the table. We worked under my father’s succinct and calm instruction, and under Mum’s eye. Mum told us, “be careful not to ruin the oven”, “don’t mark the bench top” and “don’t drop that fat and walk it all through the house.” We kept our heads down and worked to the brief. We would have the special roast, feed the family and come together for a meal, something we had not done for years due to distances both physical and emotional. We were doing it for Dad. My brother sweated over the gravy, stirring and swearing, thrusting his arm back and forth in the corner of the battered pan. It wasn’t working. I was willing him to succeed, silently barracking. The pressure was on. The gravy looked pale, and there’s nothing worse than pale gravy. We had to keep going: add more flour, more of the fat, some pepper, but no more water. No. More. Water. We knew what too much water did to gravy. There was the wing rib roast, there were peas, and tomato pie, and our famous family potatoes, done Dad’s way, not mine. Dad’s potatoes sat in fat and drank the meat’s juices: delicious. When all was served and eaten, the anticlimax was exhausting. Afterwards he told me he had not tasted the food at all. He had been disappointed with the meal, and had collapsed into bed straight after eating. No more evenings of flowing red wine and stories, heated debates and animated voices. The fluid restrictions had put a stop to all that for Dad. The next morning, they carted him back to hospital. Bloated to bursting point with an overdose of saline solution, drip-fed fluid to keep dialysis at bay. No. More. Water. The following year, for his birthday in March, I wanted to bring the production in-house; my house. I asked him for his recipe for the famous roast. My father told me over the phone: the particular weight, the oven temperature, the type and quantities of potatoes, the variations of heat at certain times. He told me, but I wanted it written down. I wanted something I could print out, file, refer to, mark with beef fat, make tatty, scribble on. I wanted the recipe for the meal he could no longer cook, and I wanted it “for the record.” I wanted the words to keep, and own. I requested the recipe “with intent”, you could say. There was a sense of time running out, of stories which might be lost, details unknown. This recipe was a sort of legacy, and I knew I wanted it before he died. The email came through for Arfur’s Wing Rib Roast. Proportions of weight to oven heat, potatoes, parsnips, temperature variations. There was his delivery of the recycled beef fat, to be kept in the fridge, in an old white serrated bowl. It all starts with the beef dripping, recycled each roast, to cook the meat and potatoes. How long can you continue to cook in the same substance? I wonder. At what point does the fat become rancid? What happens to our bodies when the clarified fats don’t work, when the liquids turn to sludge, when the toxins build up, when the colour goes pale, and the lumps won’t come out? No. More. Water. We cooked in my kitchen this time. Gravy in the pan, browning the flour, scraping the base, working in the corner, using the pea water. Scraped it, mixed it, could we add water? It was at the crucial point, and I was stirring the gravy, dragging the spoon over the rough metal tray. The frail man sat beside me in the kitchen on his walker. He was directing proceedings on his birthday, holding court, passing on the knowledge, sitting where he used to stand. We have a tiny video of him, attending his gravy students in my kitchen, and then we have a final video. We are singing “Happy Birthday to you” as we bring in the cake, candles burning. You can hear his beautiful voice as it resonates low. The video cuts out, just as he drags in a huge breath to blow out the candles. His last birthday, the candles still flickering. I haven’t been able to cook a roast since he died. But now I have his recipe, and he seems alive even when I think of it. My siblings and I are mates again, and I know in some ways that the hosting of the roast brought it home to us. Happy birthday, Arfur, the recipe lives on. • Anna Sublet is a freelance writer"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/2018/mar/08/donald-trump-north-korea-kim-jong-un-meeting-may-letter-invite-talks-nuclear-weapons","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-09T09:14:21Z","webTitle":"Kim Jong-un to meet Trump by May after North Korea invitation","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/08/donald-trump-north-korea-kim-jong-un-meeting-may-letter-invite-talks-nuclear-weapons","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/mar/08/donald-trump-north-korea-kim-jong-un-meeting-may-letter-invite-talks-nuclear-weapons","fields":{"headline":"Kim Jong-un to meet Trump by May after North Korea invitation","bodyText":"Donald Trump has accepted an invitation from the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, to hold an unprecedented summit meeting to discuss the future of the embattled regime’s nuclear and missile programme. In a stunning development following months of tension and mutual sabre-rattling, senior South Korean officials appeared outside the White House to announce the news, having verbally conveyed Kim’s invitation to Trump. The White House confirmed Trump was ready to meet Kim “by May”, at a time and location yet to be determined. If the meeting takes place it would be the first ever between leaders of the two countries. Pyongyang has long sought a summit with the US to reflect what the regime sees as its status as a regional military power. Bill Clinton came close to agreeing to a meeting with Kim’s father, Kim Jong-il, in 2000, but arrangements had not been made by the time he left office in January 2001. Administration officials portrayed the invitation as a victory for Trump’s policy of “maximum pressure” and stressed that the US would not relax its stringent sanctions regime before North Korea began disarming. A senior official said Trump “is not prepared to reward North Korea in exchange for talks”. The US Secretary of State, Rex Tillerson, said on Friday Trump had taken the decision to hold talks after the US was surprised at how “forward-leaning” Kim was in his conversations with a visiting South Korean delegation. “President Trump has said for some time that he was open to talks and he would willingly meet with Kim when conditions were right. And I think in the president’s judgment that time has arrived now,” he said. Pak Song-il, North Korea’s ambassador to the UN, praised Kim for his “broad-minded” and “courageous” decision in quotes reported by the Washington Post. He advised the US to contribute to peace by bringing a “sincere position and serious attitude”. Moon Jae-in, South Korea’s president, praised the possible meeting as a “historic milestone” on the way to peace on the peninsula. Trump himself confirmed the meeting in a tweet, adding that US sanctions would remain in place until a denuclearisation deal was achieved. The development was announced by South Korean national security director Chung Eui-yong, flanked by intelligence chief Suh Hoon and Cho Yoon-je, South Korea’s ambassador to US. The invitation, Chung said, was accompanied by an offer to suspend missile and nuclear tests, the condition US officials have laid down for the start of any substantive talks. Chung is expected to head to Moscow and Beijing, while Suh will travel to Tokyo. The Chinese foreign ministry spokesman said Beijing was pleased with the “positive signals” while the Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, said a Trump-Kim meeting would be “a step in the right direction”. “It should not just be a meeting, it should open up a way to resuming a fully fledged diplomatic process to find a solution to the North Korean nuclear issue on the basis of principles agreed during the six-party talks and the UN security council,” he told reporters. Japan’s prime minister Shinzo Abe said on Friday he “highly appreciated” the surprise announcement and planned to visit Trump “as early as April”. Japan has been cautious about the recent Olympics-driven rapprochement, with Abe warning on Thursday that “talks for the sake of talks are meaningless”. On Friday, he cautioned there would be no change in policy yet: “We will keep putting maximum pressure until North Korea takes concrete actions toward denuclearisation in a manner that is complete, verifiable and irreversible.” Japan’s foreign ministry said Abe and Trump spoke by phone shortly before the announcement. In a statement, the White House said: “President Trump greatly appreciates the nice words of the South Korean delegation and President Moon. He will accept the invitation to meet with Kim Jong-un at a place and time to be determined. We look forward to the denuclearisation of North Korea. In the meantime, all sanctions and maximum pressure must remain.” The South Korean delegation had met the North Korean leader in Pyongyang on Monday. Announcing the delivery of the invitation in a hastily arranged press statement outside the White House, Chung praised Trump’s “leadership”. “I told President Trump that in our meeting, the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, said he is committed to denuclearisation,” Chung said. “Kim Jong-un pledged that North Korea will refrain from any further nuclear or missile tests. He understands the routine joint military exercises between the Republic of Korea and the United States must continue.” He added that the Kim had “expressed his eagerness to meet President Trump as soon as possible”. “President Trump appreciated the briefing and said he would meet Kim Jong-un by May to achieve permanent denuclearisation.” White House officials said the US national security adviser, HR McMaster, would brief the UN security council on Monday. There have been no significant negotiations between the US and North Korea since 2012, when the two sides agreed a short-lived moratorium on long-range missiles and nuclear weapons activity in return for food aid. The agreement fell apart after Pyongyang launched a satellite with a powerful rocket that could be used in a missile. A deal struck in 1994 fell apart as a result of mutual distrust. It is far from clear that a new deal would be any more enduring. Mintaro Oba, a former state department official involved in North Korean policy under the Obama administration, urged caution. “This is a welcome step that will help us de-escalate dangerous tensions on the Korean Peninsula in the near term – and hopefully lead to progress toward denuclearisation. That said, we must manage our expectations given our knowledge of North Korea’s interests and past behaviour. There is a long and complicated road ahead.” Jon Wolfsthal, special assistant to Obama on arms control and non-proliferation, said: “The US must pursue this idea. Scepticism is healthy but the chance for progress is too good to pass up.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"games/2018/mar/09/super-smash-bros-nintendo-switch","type":"article","sectionId":"games","sectionName":"Games","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-09T08:52:00Z","webTitle":"Super Smash Bros leads lineup of Nintendo Switch 2018 releases","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2018/mar/09/super-smash-bros-nintendo-switch","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/games/2018/mar/09/super-smash-bros-nintendo-switch","fields":{"headline":"Super Smash Bros leads lineup of Nintendo Switch 2018 releases","bodyText":"Nintendo has announced several new games for its Switch and 3DS consoles, including the popular fighting game Super Smash Bros.

In a move that could again make education funding into an election issue, the opposition leader has promised to stand “shoulder to shoulder” with Catholic schools in their increasingly bitter campaign against the government’s changes to education funding. This week Shorten wrote to the Australian Catholic Bishops Conference chairman, Denis Hart, promising the sector would be $250m better off in the first two years of a Labor government and billions over the decade. “We are committed to funding all schools based on a proper assessment of their need, while also supporting parental choice,” he wrote. Shorten has previously said the government’s model had “unduly discriminated” against Catholic schools, but the letter confirms that a Labor government would revisit funding arrangements if elected. On Thursday the Labor deputy leader and education spokeswoman, Tanya Plibersek, backed Shorten’s comments, saying the government had “seriously disadvantaged low-fee Catholic schools”. “Many low-fee Catholic schools are looking at doubling or even tripling their fees. We’ve seen very large falls in some areas, large falls in enrolments because schools are faced with increasing fees to this extent,” she said. The Catholic sector is bitterly opposed to the new funding deal because it was designed to remove elements of the current formula that look at the average socio-economic status of all the schools in the sector rather than individual schools. The Catholic sector says the SES system that formulates how much parents are able to pay toward their child’s education disadvantages their schools compared with the richest private schools. When the new funding package was passed last June, the government agreed to roll over the system-weighted average for the Catholic and independent school systems for one year at a cost of $46m and commissioned a review of the socio-economic status formula. The education minister, Simon Birmingham, was forced to wrangle a reluctant cross-bench while staring down an internal revolt from conservative Coalition MPs concerned about cuts to Catholic schools. The review is due to report in the middle of this year. On Friday Birmingham accused Labor of abandoning the principle of needs-based funding and said Shorten was promising a “special deal” for one part of the school sector. “I think that Catholic parents, teachers and principals are bigger and better than what Bill Shorten is trying to appeal to,” he said. “That he is out there saying we can buy you off with a special deal, whereas I believe that people want to see a fair and transparent system and also one that is enduring. “Bill Shorten’s letter talks about what might happen over the next one or two years, but there is no certainty beyond that. Whereas the model the Turnbull government sought to put in place by building it around what David Gonski had recommended is an enduring model.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"law/2018/mar/09/australia-pledges-at-un-to-improve-its-human-rights-situation","type":"article","sectionId":"law","sectionName":"Law","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-09T00:31:45Z","webTitle":"Australia pledges at UN to improve its 'human rights situation'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2018/mar/09/australia-pledges-at-un-to-improve-its-human-rights-situation","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/law/2018/mar/09/australia-pledges-at-un-to-improve-its-human-rights-situation","fields":{"headline":"Australia pledges at UN to improve its 'human rights situation'","bodyText":"Australia has used its first session on the powerful UN human rights council to say it will promote and protect human rights across the globe, while conceding “no state has a perfect human rights record”. Australia campaigned for a seat on the 47-country body, pitching itself as a “pragmatic and principled” candidate and a voice for the Pacific. But it has been consistently criticised by UN human rights agencies over its asylum and refugee policies, in particular indefinite offshore detention, as well as persistent Indigenous disadvantage, juvenile justice and disability rights. Lachlan Strahan, charge d’affaires of Australia’s mission to the UN in Geneva, gave the “incoming members’ pledge”. Australia led 11 of the 13 new members of the council in the pledge, bringing together nations from across all five of the UN’s regional groupings: Afghanistan, Angola, Australia, Chile, Mexico, Nepal, Peru, Senegal, Slovakia, Spain, and the Ukraine. “As incoming members of the human rights council, we are committed to the success and effectiveness of the council, and are convinced that the council plays an invaluable role in promoting and protecting human rights worldwide,” he said. Australia pledged to “engage in the work of the council in a spirit of self-reflection, with a view to improving our own human rights situation, recognising that no state has a perfect human rights record”. It also vowed “to make progress in the promotion, protection and realisation of human rights at the national level, including through implementation of recommendations and resolutions of the council”. Many of the UN recommendations have not been adopted by Australia. The UN’s committee on the elimination of racial discrimination wrote in December that it was “alarmed” at the continuation of offshore processing “despite the high number of corroborated reports on the desperate and dangerous conditions prevailing in those centres, in which persons, including children, experience severe human rights violations”. The committee said it was “deeply concerned that Indigenous people continue to experience high levels of discrimination across all socio-economic indicators, including education, healthcare, employment and housing”. It said Australia needed to address Indigenous youth incarceration levels, schooling, housing and poverty. The UN’s human rights commissioner said offshore processing represented an “unfolding humanitarian emergency” last year, and called on Australia to move all of those it had sent offshore back to Australia. And the UN human rights committee told Australia it should lift the age of criminal responsibility from 10, and that the country should abolish the practice of forced sterilisation of women and girls with intellectual disabilities. Daniel Webb, from the human rights law centre, observing the human rights council session in Geneva, said Australia’s well-intentioned pledge must be backed up by action. “It’s important to hear our government promise to strengthen the UN system and to start respecting human rights findings,” he said. “The world will be a fairer and more humane place if we have a strong and effective international human rights system. “But just saying over and over again that you respect human rights doesn’t make it true, not for the innocent human beings warehoused on Manus and Nauru for the last five years, or the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander men, women and children being forced into prisons away from their families and communities at obscenely high rates. “All of the people suffering injustice right now in our community need action, not just words.” Webb said there were critical human rights abuses occurring now: the “ethnic cleansing” of the Rohingya minority in Myanmar; the chemical attacks targeting civilians in Syria’s eastern Ghouta; and attacks on political dissidents, journalists and human rights advocates across the world. The human rights council could be a powerful advocate for the protection of vulnerable people. “Victims of cruelty and injustice all over the world desperately need governments like ours to be part of the UN’s principled spine, not a corrosive influence gnawing away at the very foundations of human rights with their own hollow words and unprincipled actions,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2018/mar/14/tech-big-data-capitalism-give-wealth-back-to-people","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-14T10:00:04Z","webTitle":"Big data for the people: it's time to take it back from our tech overlords","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/mar/14/tech-big-data-capitalism-give-wealth-back-to-people","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2018/mar/14/tech-big-data-capitalism-give-wealth-back-to-people","fields":{"headline":"Big data for the people: it's time to take it back from our tech overlords","bodyText":"Google knows you’re pregnant. Spotify knows your favorite throwback jams. Is this convenient or creepy? It depends. One minute, you’re grateful for the personalized precision of Netflix’s recommendations. The next, you’re nauseated by the personalized precision of a Facebook ad. Big data has been around for awhile, but our discomfort with it is relatively recent. The election of Donald Trump punctured many powerful fictions, among them the belief in the beneficence of the tech industry. There is now greater public awareness of how a handful of large companies use technology to monitor and manipulate us. This awareness is a wonderful thing. But if we want to channel the bad feelings swirling around tech into something more enduring, we need to radicalize the conversation. It’s good that more people see a problem where they didn’t before. The next step is showing them that the problem is larger than they think. Big data is not confined to the cluster of companies that we know, somewhat imprecisely, as the tech industry. Rather, it describes a particular way of acquiring and organizing information that is increasingly indispensable to the economy as a whole. When you think about big data, you shouldn’t just think about Google and Facebook; you should think about manufacturing and retail and logistics and healthcare. Understanding big data, then, is crucial for understanding what capitalism currently is and what it is becoming – and how we might transform it. Rosa Luxemburg once observed that capitalism grows by consuming anything that isn’t capitalist. It eats the world, to adapt Silicon Valley investor Marc Andreessen’s famous phrase. Historically, this has often involved literal imperialism: a developed country uses force against an undeveloped one in order to extract raw materials, exploit cheap labor and create markets. With digitization, however, capitalism starts to eat reality itself. It becomes an imperialism of everyday life – it begins to consume moments. In the classic science-fiction film The Blob, a meteorite lands in a small town carrying an alien amoeba. The amoeba starts expanding, swallowing up people and structures, threatening to envelop the whole town, until the air force swoops in and airlifts it to the Arctic. Big data will eventually become so big that it devours everything. One way to respond is to try to kill it – to rip out the Blob and dump it in the Arctic. That seems to be what a certain school of technology critics want. Writers such as Franklin Foer denounce digitization as a threat to our essential humanity, while tech industry “refuseniks” warn us about the damaging psychological effects of the technologies they helped create. This is the path of retreat from the digital, towards the “authentically human” – an idea that’s generally associated with reading more books and having more face-to-face conversations. The other route is to build a better Blob. How to build a better Blob Data is the new oil, says everyone. The analogy has become something of a cliche, widely deployed in media coverage of the digital economy. But it’s a useful comparison – more useful, in fact, than people realize. Because thinking of data as a resource like oil helps illuminate not only how it functions, but how we might organize it differently. Big data is extractive. It involves extracting data from various “mines” – Facebook, say, or a connected piece of industrial equipment. This raw material must then be “refined” into potentially valuable knowledge by combining it with other data and analyzing it. Extractive industries need to be closely regulated because they generate all sorts of externalities – costs that aren’t borne by the company, but are instead passed on to society as a whole. There are certain kinds of resources that we shouldn’t be extracting at all, because those costs are far too high, like fossil fuels. There are others that we should only be extracting under very specific conditions, with adequate protections for workers, the environment, and the broader public. And democratic participation is crucial: you shouldn’t build a mine in a community that doesn’t want it. These principles offer a framework for governing big data. There are certain kinds of data we shouldn’t be extracting. There are certain places where we shouldn’t build data mines. And the incredibly complex and opaque process whereby raw data is refined into knowledge needs to be cracked wide open, so we can figure out what further rules are required. Like any extractive endeavor, big data produces externalities. The extractors reap profits, while the rest of us are left with the personal, social and environmental consequences. These range from the annihilation of privacy to algorithmic racism to a rapidly warming climate. The world’s data centers, for instance, put about as much carbon into the atmosphere as air travel. Society, not industry, should decide how and where resources are extracted. Big data is no different. The data is ours! Regulating big data is a good start, but it’s far from revolutionary. To democratize big data, we need to change who benefits from its use. Under the current model, data is owned largely by big companies and used for profit. Under a more democratic model, what would it look like instead? Again, the oil metaphor is useful. Developing countries have often embraced “resource nationalism”, the idea that a state should control the resources found within its borders, not foreign corporations. A famous example is Mexico: in 1938, the president, Lázaro Cárdenas, nationalized the country’s oil reserves and expropriated the equipment of foreign-owned oil companies. “The oil is ours!” Mexicans cheered. Data is no less a form of common property than oil or soil or copper. We make data together, and we make it meaningful together, but its value is currently captured by the companies that own it. We find ourselves in the position of a colonized country, our resources extracted to fill faraway pockets. Wealth that belongs to the many – wealth that could help feed, educate, house and heal people – is used to enrich the few. The solution is to take up the template of resource nationalism, and nationalize our data reserves. This isn’t as abstract as it sounds. It would begin with the recognition that all of the data extracted within a country is the common property of everyone who lives in that country. Such a move wouldn’t necessarily require seizing the extractive apparatus itself. You don’t have to nationalize the data centers to nationalize the data. Companies could continue to extract and refine data, but with the crucial distinction that they are doing so for our benefit. In the oil industry, companies often sign “production sharing agreements” (PSAs) with governments. The government hires the company as a contractor to explore, develop, and produce the oil, but retains ownership of the oil itself. The company bears the cost and risk of the venture, and in exchange receives a portion of the revenue. The rest goes to the government. The data dividend Bringing data revenues into public coffers is only the first step, however. We also need to distribute those revenues as widely as possible. In 1976, Alaska established a sovereign wealth fund with a share of the rents and royalties collected from oil companies drilling on state lands. Since 1982, the fund has paid out an annual dividend to every Alaskan citizen. The exact amount fluctuates with the fund’s performance, but in the last few years, it’s generally ranged from $1,000 to $2,000. We could do the same with data. In exchange for permission to extract and refine our data, companies would be required to pay a certain percentage of their data revenue into a sovereign wealth fund. The fund could use that capital to acquire other income-producing assets, as the Alaskan fund has, and pay out an annual dividend to all citizens. If it were generous enough, this dividend could even function as a universal basic income, along the lines of what the social commentator Matt Bruenig has proposed. A data fund that distributes a data dividend would help democratize big data. It would enable us to collectively benefit from a resource we collectively create. It would transform data from a private asset stockpiled by corporations to make a small number of people rich into a form of social property held in common by everyone who helps create it. Technology helps set the parameters of possibility. It frames our range of potential futures, but it doesn’t select one for us. The potential futures framed by big data have a particularly wide range: they run from the somewhat annoying to the very miserable, from the reasonably humane to the delightfully utopian. Where we land in this grid will come down to who owns the machines, and how they’re used – a matter for power, and politics, to decide.

Not many of the schoolkids know it, as the bus winds its way along the coast at Billinudgel, but their driver is a former world surfing champion. Pauline Menczer, the woman who had the world at her feet back in 1993, loves her job. Living in nearby Brunswick Heads with her fiancee Samantha, she has achieved a rare measure of peace for a retired athlete. This week on the Gold Coast, Menczer was honoured by the sport that for a long time had all but forgotten her. As 2017 WSL women’s world champion Tyler Wright and brother Owen took out the female and male Surfers of the Year, Menczer was inducted into Surfing Australia’s Hall of Fame in front of a room packed with her peers, taking her some way down the path towards proper recognition for a career that was built on perseverance, as much as talent. She smiled through it all, but Menczer did it hard from the very start. One of four children raised by a single mum at Bronte, she was bitten hard by the surfing bug at 13; collecting aluminium cans, baking cakes and selling toffees through her high school to raise the money to get to competitions. Possessed of a powerful, athletic style and no shortage of courage, she won her way to a berth in the world amateur championships in Puerto Rico in 1988 and came home world champion, at just 18. The win gave her the confidence to launch a pro career. She got herself a coach and set out in pursuit of her idols, South African Wendy Botha and Australia’s Jodie Cooper and Pam Burridge. But it was never easy: crippling rheumatoid arthritis left her frequently debilitated. There were tales of her being carried from cars, of recovering in wheelchairs after heats. She persevered, despite being routinely overlooked for sponsorships: the dollars went to other women who conformed to the ideal of beauty that the surf brands were after. “I didn’t care,” she tells Guardian Australia the morning after her induction. “I had so much fun. If I’d had major sponsors, I wouldn’t have been able to do whatever I wanted. If I felt like dressing up as a sumo wrestler, then that’s what I did.” And that’s the other secret weapon Menczer brought to the fight – a great sense of humour. “I’m a quiet person now,” she laughs. “I wasn’t then – last night was a little bit of what I used to be!” After her retirement from the pro tour, she continued to compete. But the sponsorship dollars, always hard to come by, now dried up. Opportunities were few, and recognition of her stellar career was almost non-existent. The surfing media, perhaps unwittingly, conspired in her disappearance from the public gaze. Menczer is cautious at the suggestion that she’s been overlooked. She seems to agree but doesn’t want to dwell on it. Other surfers were advanced to Hall of Fame status ahead of her, some while they were still competing. In her acceptance speech, Menczer said it was all OK with her – that she’d been through a lot and now was a good time for such a thing to happen. “I didn’t mind that it hadn’t happened until now,” she says. “They only take in one per year [into the Surfing Hall of Fame). But the reaction’s just been amazing.” It needs to be said that not everything has been set to rights. Controversy remains over her omission from the honour roll in Byron Bay’s Surf Alley. It’s not like Byron has produced so many world champions that they can casually leave one out. But Menczer’s humour kicks in in her own defence: in her acceptance speech, she said “Eat your heart out Byron Bay – this is heaps better!” Menczer agrees that the change that’s risen with the #metoo movement is yet to take effect in surfing. But she sees something else that’s lacking, and she’s not the first to say it. “They need to do something for their athletes who’ve hit hard times. The rugby has got the Men of League initiative. We should have something for those people.” Looking back is nothing but a pleasure to Menczer, despite the hardships. She thinks she might have had more fun than anyone else on tour. She won all over the world, and featured in some epic battles against Botha in 1991 and 1992 especially, before her barnstorming world title win in 1993. She won desperate heats in heavy surf. When asked if she has anything to say to aspiring female surfers from her newfound elevation in the Hall of Fame, she doesn’t hesitate. “Be yourself. You don’t have to sell sex to sell yourself as a woman. That’s why Tyler [Wright] is so good. I admire her for being her. Wearing your swimmers up your butt – is that really for you, or for others?” There’s a corresponding responsibility on the brands, she thinks, to stop selling their female athletes the wrong ways, to focus on their athleticism. It’s a lesson that’s been painfully learned by Billabong last year, and by Roxy back in 2013. A random question occurs to me at the end of our interview, a hunch about a particular kind of athlete. People like Menczer. Do you still have your world title trophy? She immediately starts laughing again. “I do,” she says. “It’s at home. But it’s in two pieces. When they gave it to me it was already busted. People always want to pick it up and I have to tell them not to because it’ll fall apart on them. But the trophy I got last night is beautiful. It’s made of some kind of metal and it’s heavy as hell.” There’s a metaphor in there somewhere. Surfing might finally be handing Pauline Menczer the respect she deserves. But meanwhile, it’s hit 2.45pm and Pauline needs to go. She’s got a bus to drive."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/mar/09/poetry-slam-hires-security-after-mark-latham-calls-it-islamic-political-ranting","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-08T17:00:13Z","webTitle":"Poetry slam hires security after Mark Latham calls it 'Islamic political ranting'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/mar/09/poetry-slam-hires-security-after-mark-latham-calls-it-islamic-political-ranting","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/mar/09/poetry-slam-hires-security-after-mark-latham-calls-it-islamic-political-ranting","fields":{"headline":"Poetry slam hires security after Mark Latham calls it 'Islamic political ranting'","bodyText":"Organisers of the nation’s biggest regular poetry slam have taken the unprecedented step of hiring security guards after Mark Latham described it as “Islamic political ranting”. The Bankstown youth development service director, Tim Carroll, said Latham’s comments on social media were a tangible example of how rhetoric from rightwing commentators and elements of the media had further marginalised ethnic groups in Sydney. Participants in the popular Bankstown Poetry Slam in western Sydney were subjected to a torrent of online abuse following Latham’s comments earlier this year. Latham had labelled the slam an “Islamic political group ranting hatred towards Australia and our institutions, especially the police, soldiers and even the Anzacs”. Carroll spoke to Guardian Australia about the incident after a roundtable on entrenched disadvantage in Bankstown on Wednesday. The event – attended by Jenny Macklin and Jason Clare, to help inform Labor policy – explored the complex range of issues affecting the Bankstown area. The slam takes place every month and is designed to promote social harmony through free speech and poetry. However, Latham’s comments forced organisers to hire security guards as a precaution, something they had never needed in the past. “He portrayed all of these young people turning up – having the balls and the skills to speak their mind in a really interesting manner – as Islamist hate speech,” Carroll said. “That kind of stuff is really, really scary. We had to pull all the videos down. [We had people saying] ‘you deserve to die’.” “For the first time ever we had a security guard at the last poetry slam and had requested some undercover cops, because we actually thought someone might jump up and do something violent or disruptive.” The roundtable heard racial discrimination was making it difficult for young people to be employed, so much so that individuals were anglicising their names on resumes just to get job interviews. Children were ending up on the streets because the number of youth refuges had fallen dramatically, from 495 across NSW in 2014, to 125. The lack of refuges were forcing at-risk young teenagers to be referred to motels to keep them off the streets. Vulnerable people in the community were blacklisted by real estate agents, the forum heard, and education standards were slipping, with truancy left unmonitored and no efforts at prevention. The support service at the roundtable also voiced concern that smaller local organisations were being pushed out of the area by larger charities, which had little local knowledge or connection, but regularly won government tenders. Macklin, the shadow social services minister, said the roundtables were designed to help inform a social policy that was adapted to the unique circumstances of local pockets of entrenched disadvantage. They will be held in areas of high unemployment, including the northern suburbs of Adelaide, Burnie, Bankstown, and the southern suburbs of Perth. “Thinking that you can address entrenched disadvantage by a national across-the-board policy just won’t be effective. You’ve really got to do things locally,” Macklin told Guardian Australia. “And also those places I’ve just mentioned – Burnie, Bankstown, Wide Bay ... are so completely different, different economies, different types of people.” Labor has consistently spoken of the need to increase Newstart, the unemployment payment, but would not say by how much. Carroll runs the hugely successful R.E.S.P.E.C.T. program, which teaches young boys and young men about the nature and causes the harms of family violence. It is a preventive measure he hopes could be effective across the country. The poetry slam is designed to promote social harmony but Carroll said the impact of inflammatory comments from figures such as Latham; the immigration minister, Peter Dutton; and radio station 2GB were profound. “In terms of the issues that affect this area really, really deeply are hundreds of thousands of Muslims who feel like they’re not part of the society,” Carroll told the roundtable. “And I think that that’s a profound thing, it’s almost become embedded here. People just go ‘what the hell, we’re literally not wanted’.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2018/mar/08/australian-scientists-move-closer-to-world-beating-quantum-computer-michelle-simmons","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-08T05:58:57Z","webTitle":"Australian scientists move closer to world-beating quantum computer","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/mar/08/australian-scientists-move-closer-to-world-beating-quantum-computer-michelle-simmons","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2018/mar/08/australian-scientists-move-closer-to-world-beating-quantum-computer-michelle-simmons","fields":{"headline":"Australian scientists move closer to world-beating quantum computer","bodyText":"Australian scientists, led by Australian of the year Michelle Simmons, have made a significant step in creating a world-beating, single-atom quantum computer. Simmons and her Australian team announced on Wednesday they had built quantum bits, known as qubits, from single phosphorus atoms in silicon, that could communicate and correlate with each other. Quantum computing is a field of science that aims to replace the building blocks of traditional computing, known as bits, with quantum particles. While classic bits can have a value of only 0 or 1, quantum bits can exist in multiple states at once. This means they can be thousands of times more efficient and potentially revolutionise computing. A working quantum computer could solve, in minutes, a problem that would take a classic computer thousands of years. Simmons said a process known as “entanglement” was crucial to this development. Entanglement allows one quantum particle to communicate with and affect the state of another, which allows them to transfer information at any even more efficient rate. Simmons’s research proved the qubits the team developed were correlating with each other, which was a promising sign of entanglement. While other qubits have previously been entangled, it has never successfully been demonstrated in silicon with single atoms, both of which provide a much higher accuracy and reliability. “In the silicon field, nobody has yet demonstrated that in those single atom systems,” Simmons told Guardian Australia. “The single atom systems are the ones showing the longest coherence times and very high accuracies. “Other qubits are physically bigger and you can scale them to be bigger, but they are limited by their coherence. You get coherence times becoming really long the smaller you can make them – and single atoms are the smallest you can go.” Silicon qubits, according to Simmons, are the best long term option for quantum computing. Qubits with low levels of coherence are prone to errors and are too unreliable for calculations. The current entanglement record is 10 qubits, set in November last year with qubits made of aluminium. On Monday, Google announced they had created a 72 qubit computer – a record for total qubits, but not entangled. Both developments come as physicists try and reach what is known as “quantum supremacy” – the point at which a current quantum computer can outperform a standard supercomputer. Google’s team announced they were “cautiously optimistic” that quantum supremacy could be achieved on their device, with more development. According to Simmons, the goal the industry is striving for is 70 entangled qubits. For their higher-quality silicon model, she is aiming to have one entangled quibit by the end of the year, and 10 entangled within the next five. She says the key to Wednesday’s discovery is that it broke expectations. The new data will improve their model, which will lead to better data – a recursive process that means the first entangled qubit is not far off. “Our original theory was predicting we need to get our atoms 20 nanometres apart before they talk to each other. It’s actually 16. In the quantum world, that’s massive. “There’s nothing to prohibit us getting them closer. The great thing is that the devices are small enough that we can make predictive models for the theory. Every time we get results we benchmark that with a theory and that helps us understand the system so much better. “We’re using what we’re building to help us build it. It’s kind of funny for me.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/mar/07/uci-president-david-lappartient-pressure-dave-brailsford","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-07T20:08:38Z","webTitle":"UCI president David Lappartient adds to pressure on Dave Brailsford","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/mar/07/uci-president-david-lappartient-pressure-dave-brailsford","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/mar/07/uci-president-david-lappartient-pressure-dave-brailsford","fields":{"headline":"UCI president David Lappartient adds to pressure on Dave Brailsford","bodyText":"Pressure was building on Sir Dave Brailsford to resign from his position as head of Team Sky following the news that they face another major anti-doping investigation. The head of cycling’s governing body claimed the findings of a parliamentary committee report may damage the sport’s credibility. The UCI president, David Lappartient, called for the organisation’s independent integrity division to investigate Team Sky. “We have the Cycling Anti-Doping Foundation, they have the power of investigation. I would like them to do this, to see if there is some violation of anti-doping rules,” he said. The Frenchman urged further investigation after a report by the digital, culture, media and sport select committee this week concluded that Bradley Wiggins, and possibly support riders at Team Sky, had abused the anti-doping rules in the buildup to the Briton’s 2012 Tour de France victory. MPs found Wiggins had taken the powerful corticosteroid triamcinolone not to treat a legitimate medical condition but to improve power‑to‑weight ratio. They claimed that performance-enhancing benefits would have been experienced even during the race. Before three Grand Tours Wiggins had obtained therapeutic use exemption forms, effectively a doctor’s note, to allow him to take triamcinolone, which would usually be banned. Lappartient said the rules around TUEs had been tightened but called for another inquiry to establish whether Team Sky, led by Brailsford, had committed anti-doping rule violations. “They had at the time the TUE agreement but now we have the evidence that it seems to be organised,” Lappartient told the BBC. “Just by a letter of support from the doctor, then it was not so difficult to get the TUE, which is something completely different now. So you have to put this in the context of the time; the grey zone was too big and it seemed that this grey zone has been used by Team Sky at the time so, is it doping? Is it just using the rules?” The former Team Sky coach Shane Sutton, who claimed Wiggins had crossed an ethical line with his use of triamcinolone, called on the five-times Olympic champion and the former Team Sky doctor Richard Freeman to come forward with more details. Lappartient said: “I think we need to know more about all these stories. There are still some grey zones, even in this report. I read the press release from Team Sky say ‘look we apologise, we recognise that we made some mistakes’. A mistake is something you’ve done without an intention to be wrong. The report is a little bit different. “It seems that it was a little bit organised, so it’s maybe not a mistake but a fault, which is different, because that could affect the credibility globally of our sport and that’s why I’m concerned about this.” Brailsford has remained tight-lipped since the report was published but calls are mounting for him to resign as team principal and even disband the team which he helped to form in 2010. Team Sky are also in the midst of challenging a failed drug test by Chris Froome. The four-times Tour de France winner gave a urine test at the Vuelta a España last year which showed double the permitted amount of the asthma medication salbutamol. Froome has continued to ride as his legal advisers have battled to clear his name with Wiggins strenuously denying any wrongdoing when he spoke to the BBC in the week. But Lappartient said it would be a disaster if he was at the Tour de France start line with the case still unresolved. “Of course we have to respect the rights of Chris Froome to defend what he thinks and what he believes with experts. So that’s why it’s taking some time,” Lappartient said. “I’m not sure we can have the decision before May’s Giro d’Italia – I hope we can have it at least before the Tour de France in July because, can you imagine if he’s riding the Giro and with spectators crying against him, or if at the end he’s disqualified from the Giro – that’s something difficult for our sport. “If he rode at the Tour it would be a disaster for the image of cycling, even if on a legal point of view he has a right to ride. For the image of our sport that could be a disaster and I don’t want to put our sport into trouble. So even for him to be more concentrated on defending his own case, from my point of view it would have been better for him not to ride.” In a statement, Team Sky said: “Team Sky is happy to co-operate with any investigation by the UCI and we would welcome further scrutiny of the Select Committee’s report. While we have acknowledged past failings, we strongly deny the very serious new allegations about the use of medication to enhance performance, as does Bradley Wiggins. “Furthermore, we are concerned that the Committee presented these unsubstantiated allegations without providing evidence to support them, which is fundamentally unfair to the Team and its riders. “We welcome any review by the UCI which can help establish the nature of the evidence relied on by the Committee in coming to its conclusions.” Meanwhile, Lizzie Deignan spoke of her hurt that drug-taking in professional cycling meant all riders suffer by association. “There’s lots of good, hardworking, honest people within the sport and lots of progression has been made so its damaging that has been overshadowed,” she said. “It’s definitely very frustrating and very upsetting.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/mar/08/firms-pay-gap-fines-labour-equal-pay-dawn-butler","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-08T08:51:32Z","webTitle":"Firms underpaying women should be fined.

Under Labour they will be","bodyText":"It is International Women’s Day, a day to celebrate the achievements of women around the world and how far we’ve come in the fight for equality, while also recognising how far we still have to go. Action is long overdue in tackling the scandal of unequal pay. So I’m announcing Labour’s policy to require employers to take action in closing their gender pay gaps and ending unequal pay. A Labour government will ensure employers’ plans are adequate, robust and, most importantly, adhered to. Under a Labour government, all public and private companies with more than 250 employees will be required to report what specific action they are going to take over a set period to close their gender pay gaps. If they don’t, they will face further auditing and fines. In 1970 Labour introduced the Equal Pay Act. But nearly 50 years later the scourge of unequal pay persists. According to the Fawcett Society, women in full-time employment are paid on average 14% less than men, and including part-time work the gap widens to nearly 20%. We cannot wait another 50 years for equal pay. The government recently introduced a requirement on large employers to report on gender pay. But we need action, not just audits. Under Labour’s policy, employers will not only have to report on their gender pay gaps – they will have to prove they are taking action to close them. This means the onus will no longer be on female employees to prove they are being underpaid in comparison with their male counterparts. Instead, the onus will be on employers to prove they are paying employees fairly and have good gender equality practices. The deadline for employers to report gender pay discrepancies, 4 April, is fast approaching, but only about 1,290 companies have submitted their figures so far, despite the fact that about 9,000 employers are estimated to fall under the legislation. Figures released by the Guardian on the data collected so far are devastating. Of the companies that have reported, an incredible 74% pay men more than women. Just 15% of large employers pay women employees more than the male ones. And the Equality and Human Rights Commission, the body responsible for overseeing this legislation, has seen its budget cut by 70% by the Conservatives. Time and time again this government’s actions demonstrate how hollow the Tories’ words are on women’s equality. We’re following in the footsteps of Iceland, which consistently ranks as the number one country for gender equality, and last year became the first country in the world to require firms to prove equal pay. Equal pay for women will bring benefits for business too. A PricewaterhouseCoopers report into the gender pay gap released on Monday estimated that closing this gap could bring benefits to the UK economy of £90bn. It is sound business sense that will help to improve the reputation of businesses and make the country’s workforce happier. The next Labour government will acknowledge and reward good business practice through equal pay employer certifications. And we will seek to award government contracts to businesses that obtain certification. While in opposition, we will put this proposal to a public consultation to obtain feedback from businesses, workers, women’s organisations, trade unions and relevant non-departmental public bodies to ensure we are ready to introduce the policy when we walk into Downing Street. But the deep-rooted social and economic inequality facing women runs deeper than the pay gap. Women have borne the brunt of 86% of the Conservatives’ cuts and more than 60% of those currently earning less than the living wage are women. Labour will end the Tories’ failed austerity agenda and introduce a real living wage of £10 per hour. We will also address the underlying structural issues that allow these disparities to exist, including insecurity around self-employment, exploitative zero-hours contracts, maternity discrimination, and the low value put on care, hospitality- and public-sector work. On this International Women’s Day let’s resolve to end the gender pay gap once and for all, and to prioritise tackling the structural barriers facing women across society, ensuring we take the next vital steps to achieving equality. • Dawn Butler is shadow minister for women and equalities and Labour MP for Brent Central"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2018/mar/09/friday-best-tv-nashville-requiem-tones-drones-arpegios","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-09T06:20:28Z","webTitle":"Friday’s best TV: Nashville; Requiem; Tones, Drones and Arpeggios","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/mar/09/friday-best-tv-nashville-requiem-tones-drones-arpegios","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2018/mar/09/friday-best-tv-nashville-requiem-tones-drones-arpegios","fields":{"headline":"Friday’s best TV: Nashville; Requiem; Tones, Drones and Arpeggios","bodyText":"Nashville 10pm, Sky Living The US channel CMT has brought this country music soap back from the dead once already, but this sixth series really is its last.

It was the fall of 1969 and black athletes across American sports were becoming more visible than ever in acts of overt political protest. A year earlier, Tommie Smith and John Carlos had raised fists at the Summer Olympic Games in Mexico City to protest racial oppression and the conditions of poverty and disinvestment in black communities. Two years earlier, Muhammad Ali had met with a delegation of mostly Cleveland-based black athletes to discuss his ongoing activism as a conscientious objector to the Vietnam war. And in the high plains of Wyoming, another athlete protest – a subtle gesture intended to shine a light on an injustice in their own backyard – was shut down before it could even get off the ground. Fourteen black members of the Wyoming Cowboys football team had the idea to wear black armbands to protest the racism they had encountered the last time they faced their upcoming opponent, the Cougars of Brigham Young University. “We wanted to wear armbands to say your ... beliefs have no place on the gridiron, that was it,” said Guillermo “Willie” Hysaw, one of the would-be demonstrators. So they showed up to the clubhouse with black armbands over their street clothes to let their coach Lloyd Eaton, who was white, know what they were thinking, hoping they’d have a conversation. They were mistaken. “It was a monologue, not a dialogue,” Hysaw said. “We never got to ask the question and we never got the state what we wanted.” The coach ‘fired’ all 14 players, triggering an uproar that consumed the rest of the football season and much of everything else in the tiny college town of Laramie, Wyoming. It’s that drama that filmmaker Darius Monroe has captured in a new documentary short: Black 14, which can be streamed now on the web platform Topic.com. Monroe, the award-winning director of Evolution of a Criminal, uses only archival footage to tell the story, mostly from local ABC and NBC affiliates in Wyoming, letting the principals – from the students, to the coach, to the school president and even the state’s governor – speak for themselves. “When I saw how great the material was, it made sense that all the people who were present at the time speak on their own behalf,” Monroe said. Cleansing the field of evil The first time Hysaw faced the Cougars in 1968, there were the usual cheap shots and taunts of “nigger” that were de rigueur for black collegiate athletes of the era. But what really got to him and his fellow black team-mates was what happened after the Wyoming victory. During the time when players traditionally shake hands and say “good game”, the all-white Cougars instead retired to the locker room prematurely. Then they cut on the sprinklers. And as Hysaw and his team-mates, which included more black players than most NCAA rosters at the time, jogged in though the soaking wet, there they saw a taunting caricature of an ape and a black man posted at the threshold of the visitors’ locker room. After the game a local paper in Salt Lake City ran with the headline “BYU cleanses field of evil” after the loss, Hysaw recalled. Brigham Young University was, and remains, an appendage of the Church of Latter-day Saints, and the school’s founder taught a virulently white supremacist theology. As the second president of the Mormon church, Young canonized the belief that blacks were a cursed and inferior race, banning them from the priesthood and judging death a fitting punishment for any of God’s favored whites who would be so debased as to “mix his blood” with blacks. The ban would not be lifted until church leaders received “revelation” from God in 1978. “They could believe what they wanted to, that when we die we don’t go to heaven,” Hysaw, now 69, said. “All we were saying was that, what they believed, relative to black people, didn’t have any place on the football field.” The Black 14 weren’t the first black athletes to bristle at competing against BYU. In 1968, black members of the San Jose State football and basketball teams refused to play in matches against the Mormon school. That same year, eight track and field athletes from the University of Texas El Paso did the same. But because of their high-profile immediate dismissal, none entered the public sphere quite like Wyoming’s Black 14. By January 1970, Sports Illustrated observed that “the protests [against BYU] have grown in intensity to the point where they have almost transcended all else.” An institution that wanted to shut them down The Black 14’s activism against the engrained white supremacy of the LDS church quickly instead brought them face to face with the engrained white supremacy of their team, school and the state of Wyoming – officially nicknamed, of all things, the equality state. Because it was a public university, the kerfuffle made it’s way to the state governor, who like virtually all white Wyomingites took the side of the coach over the players. The Black 14, all but one of whom had been recruited to Wyoming from out of state to play football, were outcast as ingrates by the lily-white campus community. In the documentary, ebullient whites can be seen brandishing sashes emblazoned with Eaton’s name, and the satisfaction over keeping the black students in their place is evident. “They didn’t know what tomorrow would bring,” Monroe said, “and yet they were willing to risk their careers, risking future economic possibilities to stand up and physically push back against an institution that wanted to shut them down, marginalized and oppress them.” With athlete activism resurgent once again in the post Black Lives Matter landscape, Hysaw reflected on how the modern anthem protest movement is different from the Black 14’s, as much of it is using sports as a platform to talk about broader societal issues. “For us, It was about football,” Hysaw said. But he added: “The same types of things that are being experienced by black folks today was also being experienced by black folks in the 60s, though. That’s the connection.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"news/2018/mar/08/gender-pay-gap-means-women-work-67-days-a-year-for-free-says-tuc","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-08T06:01:42Z","webTitle":"Gender pay gap means women work 67 days a year for free, says TUC","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/mar/08/gender-pay-gap-means-women-work-67-days-a-year-for-free-says-tuc","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/2018/mar/08/gender-pay-gap-means-women-work-67-days-a-year-for-free-says-tuc","fields":{"headline":"Gender pay gap means women work 67 days a year for free, says TUC","bodyText":"Women in the UK effectively work for free for more than two months a year because of the country’s gender pay gap, according to the TUC. In a report published to coincide with International Women’s Day, the trade union body called on the government to require employers to carry out pay audits and produce action plans to close the gap in their workplace. The gender pay gap is the difference between the average hourly earnings of men and women. Large companies have to report information about this by the 4 April. According to the Office for National Statistics, when all workers, full and part-time, are included, the pay gap is 18.4%. “This … means that women effectively work for free for the first 67 days of the year,” said the TUC. But it added that in education sector, the gap was 26.5%, so the average female worker in the sector has to wait until 7 April before searning the same as the average male worker. In the finance and insurance sector, the gap is 35.6%, which means the equivalent date is 10 May, said the organisation. Frances O’Grady, the TUC’s general secretary, said: “Nearly 50 years since the Ford machinists went on strike at Dagenham, the UK still has one of the worst gender pay gaps in Europe … Companies publishing information on their gender pay gaps is a small step in the right direction, but it’s nowhere near enough.” Meanwhile separate research suggests progress made in getting more women into top leadership roles is going into reverse. In 2016, 7.8% of chief executives were women, but this year it fell to 6.5%, according to Egon Zehnder, a global recruitment firm which surveyed the 92 largest companies in the UK. The survey also shows that while 13.7% of chief financial officers were women two years ago, today the proportion is 10.99%, and out of 19 chief executive appointments to these 92 companies since 2016, only three have gone to women. In 2014, Egon Zehnder made a public commitment to a target of a quarter of FTSE 100 chief executives being women by 2025. Another study has found that a third of working women earning below the voluntary living wage – about 1.12 million people – have no savings at all, including pensions. The Living Wage Foundation and the Fawcett Society said their findings revealed that three out of five low-earning working women only had enough savings to last a month at most if they lost their job. They also found that 94% worried about their financial situation, and 66% did not see their financial situation improving within a year. The voluntary living wage is £8.75 an hour apart from London where it is £10.20."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/mar/07/aung-san-suu-kyi-holocaust-museum-award","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-07T20:10:49Z","webTitle":"US Holocaust Museum withdraws Aung San Suu Kyi's human rights award","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/07/aung-san-suu-kyi-holocaust-museum-award","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/mar/07/aung-san-suu-kyi-holocaust-museum-award","fields":{"headline":"US Holocaust Museum withdraws Aung San Suu Kyi's human rights award","bodyText":"The United States Holocaust Museum has revoked a human rights award given to Aung San Suu Kyi, the civilian leader of Myanmar, over her failure to use her “moral authority” to halt a brutal military campaign. The museum announced on Wednesday that it had withdrawn the Elie Wiesel award, presented to Aung San Suu Kyi in 2012. Officials cited her refusal to condemn or stop the mass killings of Myanmar’s Muslim Rohingya minority. Aung San Suu Kyi had earned comparisons to South Africa’s Nelson Mandela after spending 15 years under house arrest for opposing the country’s military dictatorship. She became an international lodestar and won the Nobel peace prize in 1991. Her party won a landslide victory in 2015 and she became state counsellor. In response, Barack Obama relaxed sanctions, gave financial assistance and became the first sitting US president to visit Myanmar. But Aung San Suu Kyi’s international reputation has collapsed over the Rohingya massacres and she has been criticised as an apologist for the purges. She has not even spoken the word Rohingya in public. Sara Bloomfield, director of the Holocaust Museum, explained its reasoning in an open letter to the Myanmar embassy in Washington that was published on the museum’s website. “Based on inspiration that you created for millions around the world, with your long resistance to military dictatorship, and your advocacy for freedom and human rights for all the people of Myanmar, we were honored to present you with the first Elie Wiesel Award in 2012,” Bloomfield wrote. “It is with great regret that we are now rescinding that award. We did not take this decision lightly.” The museum has been “closely monitoring” the Myanmar military’s campaign against the Rohingya and Aung San Suu Kyi’s response to it, Bloomfield continued, making “numerous visits” to Myanmar and Bangladesh to obtain firsthand evidence. The museum has also published findings that include “mounting evidence of genocide”. The Burmese military, allied with armed Buddhist civilians, has killed thousands of Rohingya in the western state of Rakhine since last August. About 700,000 more have fled to Bangladesh. The US has described Myanmar’s denials of ethnic cleansing as “preposterous” and called on the UN security council to pressure Aung San Suu Kyi “to acknowledge these horrific acts that are taking place in her country”. The museum had hoped that Aung San Suu Kyi would speak out and try to end the brutal campaign, the letter added. “The National League for Democracy, under your leadership, has instead refused to cooperate with United Nations investigators, promulgated hateful rhetoric against the Rohingya community, and denied access to and cracked down on journalists trying to uncover the scope of the crimes in Rakhine State.” The Reuters journalists Wa Lone, 31, and Kyaw Soe Oo, 27, investigating the deaths of 10 Rohingya men and their burial in a mass grave, were arrested and face 14 years in prison. Authorities in Myanmar accuse them of possessing state secrets. Bloomfield acknowledged: “We understand the difficult situation you must face in confronting decades of military misrule and violence in your country and that institution’s still powerful constitutional role. However, the military’s orchestration of the crimes against Rohingya and the severity of the atrocities in recent months demand that you use your moral authority to address this situation.” The loss of the award – named after Elie Wiesel, a Holocaust survivor and one of the museum’s founders – comes as other admirers of Aung San Suu Kyi grow increasingly disillusioned. The South African archbishop Desmond Tutu, a fellow Nobel peace laureate, wrote in an open letter: “My dear sister: If the political price of your ascension to the highest office in Myanmar is your silence, the price is surely too steep.” The Holocaust Museum is unlikely to be the last institution or memorial challenged by her complicated legacy. A statue of Mahatma Gandhi outside the Indian embassy in Washington is accompanied by a slab of red granite inscribed with the names of prominent figures he influenced, and Aung San Suu Kyi is among them."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/mar/07/the-guardian-view-on-eu-attitudes-to-brexit-the-uk-is-running-a-goodwill-deficit","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-07T17:58:30Z","webTitle":"The Guardian view on EU attitudes to Brexit: the UK is running a goodwill deficit | Editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/07/the-guardian-view-on-eu-attitudes-to-brexit-the-uk-is-running-a-goodwill-deficit","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/07/the-guardian-view-on-eu-attitudes-to-brexit-the-uk-is-running-a-goodwill-deficit","fields":{"headline":"The Guardian view on EU attitudes to Brexit: the UK is running a goodwill deficit","bodyText":"Shared economic interest is a big motive for countries to form alliances, but not the only one. The chancellor of the exchequer, Philip Hammond, on Wednesday set out good commercial reasons why the EU should include financial services in a post-Brexit trade deal with the UK. The problem is that his target audience sees the value of European integration in terms that go well beyond commerce. Mr Hammond’s pitch for a uniquely fluid cross-border financial regime had been rejected hours before his speech. Draft guidelines for the next stage of Brexit talks, published by the European council, envisage a steep downgrade of access to EU markets for financial services. A clear implication from the document is that the prime minister’s Brexit red lines, taking Britain out of the single market and customs union, have so narrowed the available options that the best the City of London can hope for is trade in services on a template set by the EU’s deal with Canada. The chancellor rejects this model, arguing that the UK and the rest of Europe begin their negotiations from a point of maximum convergence; so for Brussels to invent barriers where none now exists is perverse. The EU riposte is that the perversity originates with the UK’s decision to leave the single market. Mr Hammond is right when he says that the lack of a precedent for a big services deal is no proof that such a deal cannot be done. Nothing about Brexit is precedented. If the government had begun fleshing out its ambitions earlier, the likelihood of a generous hearing would have been much higher. The purely technical obstacles would always have been formidable. The UK side has systematically failed to grasp how unbreakable the legal seal is on the single market: that inside/outside is a binary choice. Theresa May has also struggled to comprehend how central that legal integrity is to the cause of political solidarity in the EU. Even if there were some fast-track regulatory superhighway to be built from London into the EU, it would take a vast diplomatic effort to persuade other governments that building it wouldn’t undermine the rest of the structure. Such an effort would need to have begun well before now, and been conducted by people more skilled than Mrs May, David Davis and Boris Johnson. EU member states have divergent appetites for accommodating British exceptionalism. French resistance to favours for the City is not unrelated to hopes of luring banks to set up shop in Paris. But the UK also has friends in the EU whose capacity to influence the negotiations has been poorly harnessed. Needlessly confrontational Tory rhetoric has hardened the 27-against-one dynamic that now makes the prime minister’s job so hard. Mrs May and her chancellor rightly emphasise the common economic interests that should compel the EU towards generosity. But they wrongly imagine that economics trumps other considerations. British ministers argue that EU stubbornness is self-defeating. There is irony in Brexiters complaining about ideology obscuring economic rationality, when their project was conceived in that spirit. Other governments are capable of calculating their own interests. They do not need Mrs May to advise them on that score. The missing element in her strategy is investment in the diplomacy that would have persuaded them that Britain is sincere in seeing its interests and those of the EU as truly aligned. There is no shortage of financial reasons to do a deal that suits Britain. The deficit is in goodwill. That debt is harder to repay."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/mar/08/murray-darling-water-theft-allegations-nsw-to-prosecute-irrigators","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-08T03:07:41Z","webTitle":"Murray-Darling water theft allegations: NSW to prosecute irrigators","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/mar/08/murray-darling-water-theft-allegations-nsw-to-prosecute-irrigators","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/mar/08/murray-darling-water-theft-allegations-nsw-to-prosecute-irrigators","fields":{"headline":"Murray-Darling water theft allegations: NSW to prosecute irrigators","bodyText":"WaterNSW has moved to prosecute a number of landowners on the Murray-Darling river system for water theft, eight months after the ABC brought the matter into the national spotlight. Today’s announcement came on the day the state ombudsman, Michael Barnes, released a scathing report on the regulator, criticising it for giving him grossly inflated figures on the number of enforcement actions and prosecutions it had initiated to enforce water laws in the past 15 months. Those facing prosecution include Peter Harris and Jane Harris – the subject of the key allegations of water theft in a Four Corners program in July 2017 and who have been at the centre of further revelations in Guardian Australia since. WaterNSW also announced it was moving to prosecute Anthony Barlow, Frederick Barlow and Margaret Barlow. Both offences carry a maximum penalty of $247,000. Landholder Peter Harris said: “We look forward to an opportunity to vigorously defend these allegations in a legitimately constituted forum where the rule of law applies. We have always believed we acted in accordance with the conditions of our water access licences. While these allegations relate to events that happened more than 21 months ago, this is the first time Water NSW has raised this matter with us.” Anthony Barlow has previously told the ABC they believed they had secured permission to take water. WaterNSW said other matters were still being investigated and it expected to announce further enforcement action against other landowners shortly. The matters will be heard in the New South Wales land and environment court. WaterNSW said the announcement followed a lengthy investigation in the Barwon-Darling region but it comes amid growing criticisms of inaction by the regulator. The regulator was today blasted by the state ombudsman for giving him figures on the number of enforcement actions and prosecutions it had initiated over a 15-month period when it had not taken any enforcement actions at all. The stoush, revealed in the Guardian last month, has proved intensely embarrassing for the Berejiklian government and raises serious questions about the administration of the water portfolio in NSW. WaterNSW’s responsibilities include running the state’s water infrastructure such as dams, plus overseeing compliance with the Murray-Darling basin plan. Inaccurate data was also provided to the NSW minister for primary industries, Niall Blair, who used it in parliament to defend the performance of his agency and his administration of the portfolio. He has been forced to correct the record but Labor has been asking why it took 22 days after he became aware to do so. “The government has misled the ombudsman and the parliament. Blair claimed that after sacking the investigations unit he had fixed the problem of a lack of compliance and presided over hundreds of citations and 12 criminal prosecutions – the truth was they hadn’t done any,” said the opposition spokesman for water, Chris Minns, who called for his resignation. The issue came to the attention of the ombudsman after whistleblowers and people who had dealt with WaterNSW queried the data. A final report into the handling of complaints within the water portfolio is due in June and is expected to be strongly critical of Water NSW. But today’s report is particularly embarrassing because it points to serious cultural and systemic problems in the administration of water policy in the state. The NSW ombudsman said he was tabling the report to correct the record. “Prior to the tabling of the November report, WaterNSW provided updated enforcement figures and pressed for them to be included in the report in order to provide a fair and balanced picture of its performance” Barnes said. “Following some clarification of the numbers, the acting ombudsman agreed to this request.” Shortly after the tabling of the November report, the ombudsman received information stating that the figures were “significantly incorrect and that there had in fact been no referrals for prosecutions and no penalty infringement notices issued in the relevant period, which is contrary to the data provided to us by WaterNSW”, Barnes said. The information prompted a separate investigation into WaterNSW. After the ombudsman drew the incorrect numbers to the attention of WaterNSW, the regulator manually reviewed all actions taken, which confirmed that the actual number of enforcement actions was in line with the much lower numbers initially provided to the ombudsman in June 2017. The chief executive of WaterNSW admitted the error and apologised. Barnes said he was satisfied the provision of incorrect information was not intentional."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/mar/07/what-do-nerve-agents-do-and-how-hard-are-they-to-make-sergei-skripal","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-09T11:41:36Z","webTitle":"What do nerve agents do and how hard are they to make?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/mar/07/what-do-nerve-agents-do-and-how-hard-are-they-to-make-sergei-skripal","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/mar/07/what-do-nerve-agents-do-and-how-hard-are-they-to-make-sergei-skripal","fields":{"headline":"What do nerve agents do and how hard are they to make?","bodyText":"After days of analysis, police investigators announced on Wednesday that they believe a nerve agent was used to poison former Russian agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter on Sunday, raising questions of how it was created and how the attack was carried out. A range of highly potent nerve agents were developed by military scientists from the 1930s onwards and a number have since been used in assassinations and terror attacks. On Tuesday, the US state department confirmed that it held Kim Jong-un’s North Korean regime responsible for the murder of his estranged half-brother, Kim Jong-nam, in Kuala Lumpur international airport last year. The Malaysian authorities have charged two women with Kim’s murder after they allegedly sprayed the nerve agent VX on his face. The two maintain they were duped into the attack, claiming they thought were being filmed for a TV prank show. In the 1990s, the Aum Shinrikyo doomsday cult in Japan used VX to kill dissenters before releasing another nerve agent, Sarin, in the Tokyo subway, leaving more than 600 people in need of treatment. More recently, Sarin was used by the Syrian government in the civil war that has ravaged the country since 2011. Nerve agents are not hard to make in principle, but in practice it takes specialised facilities and training to mix the substances safely. The raw materials themselves are inexpensive and generally not hard to obtain, but the lethality of the agents means they tend to be manufactured in dedicated labs. The main five nerve agents are Tabun, which is also known as GA and is the easiest to make, Sarin, Soman, GF and VX. VX was invented in the UK in the 1950s, and is the most powerful nerve agent. It is mostly absorbed through the skin, and tends to take effect in the space of minutes. It can also be turned into a vapour by heating it, in which case the effects are almost immediate. Because it is particularly stable, it tends to remain on clothing, furniture and the ground for a long time, meaning it can be detected on samples collected from areas where it is used. But because of its potency and persistence, people attacked with VX are themselves a danger to first responders who can fall ill when they come into contact with minute traces of the agent. The victims must be decontaminated and affected areas cordoned off until they can be made safe. In pure form, all nerve agents are colourless organophosphorus liquids. They were found to be highly poisonous in the 1930s and became the dominant chemical weapons of the second world war. Once made, the substances are easy to disperse, either as liquids or aerosols, are highly toxic, and have rapid effects. Most are inhaled or, as is the case with VX, absorbed mostly through the skin, but in liquid form they can also be added to food and drink, which delays the onset of their effects. The agents take their toll on the body by disrupting electrical signals throughout the nervous system. The effects are fast and dramatic. People exposed to nerve agents find it increasingly hard to breathe. Their lungs produce more mucus which can make them cough and foam at the mouth. They sweat, their pupils constrict, and their eyes run. The effects on the digestive system trigger vomiting. Meanwhile the muscles convulse. Many of those affected will urinate themselves and lose control of their bowels. At high doses, failure of the nerves and muscles of the respiratory system can kill victims before other symptoms have time to develop. There are antidotes for nerve agents, such as oxime and atropine, both of which are used in military devices that deliver quick shots to victims. The antidotes are particularly effective against VX and sarin, but they must be given soon after exposure to work. Chris Morris, a medical toxicologist at Newcastle University, said: “If the symptoms can be controlled until the agent is removed then recovery is good. With the type of supportive care given in these cases, there may be minimal long term effects if treatment was rapid and effective.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/mar/08/its-been-a-long-couple-of-days-steve-smith","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-08T07:00:03Z","webTitle":"'It’s been a long couple of days': Steve Smith seeks reset button before second Test","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/mar/08/its-been-a-long-couple-of-days-steve-smith","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/mar/08/its-been-a-long-couple-of-days-steve-smith","fields":{"headline":"'It’s been a long couple of days': Steve Smith seeks reset button before second Test","bodyText":"In order to move on from the distraction of having his deputy in the dock following the conclusion of the first Test on Monday, Australian captain Steve Smith is determined to take control of the situation ahead of the second beginning on Friday. Speaking for the first time since leaving Durban, Smith detailed how he was handling the storm on both sides of the Indian Ocean. In South Africa, he brought his team together before their first training session in Port Elizabeth to help press the reset button. A meeting with South African skipper Faf du Plessis on Thursday is designed to do the same. At home, the events of Sunday afternoon earned his team a public lashing ferocious as any since the “monkeygate” mess of a decade ago. In response, Smith was keen to accept overall responsibility for what transpired while at the same time backing in David Warner’s version of events and dismissing Quinton de Kock’s as “fabricated” and a “load of garbage”. That’s a narrow messaging tightrope, but this is why the captaincy of the Australian cricket team is often credited as being the second toughest job in the country after the Prime Minister. Occasionally, the scrutiny is just as fierce. “It’s been a long couple of days for a few of the guys,” Smith confirmed. “It overshadowed what was a really good win for Australia.” When put to the captain in the immediate aftermath of the incident that the “ugly Aussies” tag of past generations might be reprised, Smith said it didn’t bother him. But his tune changed after two days of rage from fans and the commentariat alike, acknowledging the criticism had stung, and doubly so due to the disciplinary track record of the national side under his leadership. Until last weekend, that is. “It the last two years I think we’re the team with the least [code of conduct] indiscretions,” Smith argued. “We’ve played the game in a pretty good way. It’s the Australian way to try to play the game hard, aggressively, and stay within the boundaries. This week we probably went outside those boundaries on a couple of occasions and that’s not what we are about.” What Smith is learning is that the sins of forebears are inherited, making what comes next in this series all the more important. “I pulled the guys together and said let’s not let these incidents overshadow the way we played,” he said. “We want to stay within the spirit of the game and let cricket be the main thing on show. That’s what we are here to do.” Meeting with his opposite number on the eve of the Second Test they will be joined by the match officials. This is a powwow that always occurs, but according to Smith this time carries added weight “to ensure that things don’t get out of hand” in Port Elizabeth. “Something like this can certainly make some sparks for the rest of the series but that’s not the way I see it and I don’t want the series to pan out that way. I think we’ll be able to get our troops in order.” After that? At the toss an unchanged XI will be confirmed. While it is yet to be stated by the Australia camp, Usman Khawaja will be on notice if he fails to combat spin of Keshav Maharaj on a track Smith believes will be “quite slow” suiting both turn and reverse swing. A noticeably abrasive centre square area will help the latter considerably, which will be music to Mitchell Starc’s ears. When asked to discuss a quirk of his own otherwise impeccable statistical record against the left-arm tweak that dismissed him twice at Kingsmead, Smith was back into his groove. His efforts to take charge of the latest sideshow are admirable and sincere but it is dealing with 22 yards that matter most where Smith operates with complete control. How he will hope that it is the only place he will need to focus his attention in the week ahead."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"us-news/2018/mar/07/keith-ellison-to-lead-single-payer-healthcare-bill-house","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-07T23:06:23Z","webTitle":"Keith Ellison urges US to join developed world and embrace universal healthcare","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/mar/07/keith-ellison-to-lead-single-payer-healthcare-bill-house","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/mar/07/keith-ellison-to-lead-single-payer-healthcare-bill-house","fields":{"headline":"Keith Ellison urges US to join developed world and embrace universal healthcare","bodyText":"The US should join the rest of the industrialized world in providing universal health coverage, congressman Keith Ellison said on Wednesday, as he assumed leadership of the Democrats’ single-player plan in the House of Representatives. Ellison, a progressive from Minnesota and the deputy chairman of the Democratic National Committee, will replace congressman John Conyers as the leading sponsor of legislation to establish a healthcare system that covers all 323 million Americans. Conyers resigned from Congress last year amid multiple allegations of sexual harassment. In a floor speech, Ellison asked – and received – unanimous consent by members of the House of Representatives to take charge of the single-payer healthcare bill, titled the Expanded &amp; Improved Medicare For All Act, which has earned the support of nearly two-thirds of the Democratic caucus. “The United States is the outlier among large industrial countries,” Ellison said in a short interview on Wednesday. “Everybody else has decided that healthcare is a right and they’re working to make sure that it is. We as a nation need to move in that direction for the welfare of our people.” When Conyers stepped down, there was no immediate replacement to take charge of the bill, which the Michigan lawmaker had introduced in every Congress since 2003. Ellison said his colleagues agreed he should take up the bill as one of the most visible House Democratic supporters of universal healthcare. The Minnesota progressive said he does not expect to amend the bill this year, but is open to changes to the legislation in the future. Public polling shows a growing share of Americans support a universal, or single-payer, system of healthcare. Once a liberal pipe-dream, many prominent Democrats have since embraced the approach and liberal voters have rallied around the cause. Ellison thinks it is only a matter of time before a single-payer healthcare system is adopted by the Democratic party. He pointed to the number of candidates running in 2018 on a platform embracing universal healthcare. In Texas on Tuesday night, Beto O’Rourke, a supporter of a single-payer system, won the Democratic primary there to challenge Ted Cruz for his Senate seat in November. And two other Democratic candidates and supporters of universal healthcare advanced in a crowded primary to a May runoff election. “We’re going to have new people in Congress who are for this,” he said. “We’re going to have more people who are for it than before,” he added, predicting that rising healthcare costs will force the issue to center stage. “As the public continues to say, ‘Hey, look, I can’t pay $900 for an EpiPen, I can’t do it, and this is running me into bankruptcy, the urgency for this kind of legislation, for a Medicare for All, single-payer bill is going to become greater,” he said. With Republican control of both chambers of Congress, the legislation has no chance of becoming law. But Democrats, emboldened by early electoral successes and Trump’s record low approval ratings, are increasingly optimistic about their chances of taking back one or both chambers at the midterms in November. Nevertheless, the political reality of passing such sweeping legislation in Congress is daunting and would undoubtedly require Democrats to win the presidency as well as the support of more conservative Democrats on the issue. As an increasingly visible leader within the party, Ellison will continue to use his platform to build public support and organize around universal healthcare at rallies and events around the country. Next week, Ellison will host a town hall-style event in Minnesota to discuss healthcare and the congressional proposal. In the Senate, Bernie Sanders has introduced a similar bill, known as Medicare for All, which has been endorsed by a record 16 senators. The list includes six senators who are up for re-election in 2018 and a number of potential 2020 presidential candidates, including senators Kamala Harris of California, Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Kirsten Gillibrand of New York and Cory Booker of New Jersey. “I am excited to have Keith take the lead in the House on the fight to pass a Medicare-for-all health care system,” Sanders said in a statement, supporting Ellison. “With his leadership, I know that we will be able to take on the greed of the health insurance and pharmaceutical industries and finally join every other major country in guaranteeing health care as a right, not a privilege.” The news comes as Ellison is facing fresh questioning over his former support for the Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan, after the minister made a series of antisemitic remarks during a speech late last month. Ellison publicly renounced any association with the group in 2006 and repeatedly since then. He has repudiated Farrakhan for propagating “bigoted and antisemitic ideas and statements”. But that piece of his past has continued to dog him throughout his career, and resurfaced in his race for chairman of the DNC last year. On Tuesday, the Republican Jewish Coalition called on all “Farrakhan-connected” members of Congress to resign, including Ellison. In the interview, Ellison blamed political opponents for continuing to give life to this story, which has received considerable attention in conservative media since Farrakhan, in his speech, lashed out at Ellison for distancing himself. “This is the equivalent of ‘Obama’s a Kenyan’. This is the equivalent of ‘John Kerry’s not a courageous person’. This is a swift-boating,” Ellison said, adding: “No one asks me about this other than reporters.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/mar/07/seahawks-trade-michael-bennett-eagles-sherman","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-07T20:54:20Z","webTitle":"Seahawks trade Michael Bennett to Eagles as Sherman's future unclear","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/mar/07/seahawks-trade-michael-bennett-eagles-sherman","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/mar/07/seahawks-trade-michael-bennett-eagles-sherman","fields":{"headline":"Seahawks trade Michael Bennett to Eagles as Sherman's future unclear","bodyText":"The Seattle Seahawks have agreed to trade three-time Pro Bowl defensive end Michael Bennett to the Philadelphia Eagles in exchange for a fifth-round draft pick and backup wide receiver Marcus Johnson, ESPN’s Adam Schefter reported on Wednesday. Bennett, 32, is due to earn $7.4m next season, the first of three remaining years on his contract, making him a poor fit for a Seattle team looking to get younger and cheaper on defense. The veteran pass rusher appeared to confirm the swap on Wednesday afternoon when he tweeted a photoshopped image of himself in an Eagles jersey with the caption ‘free meek mill’, a nod to the Philadelphia rapper whose incarceration on minor probation infractions has become a focal point in the fight against racial injustice. The Eagles do not have an surplus of cap room but they will take on Bennett anyway in their bid to repeat as Super Bowl champions, a move that will likely require trading either Vinny Curry or Beau Allen. By trading Johnson, they part ways with a reserve wideout who’s played sparingly while making only five catches in 10 career games. The news came down amid reports that Seahawks cornerback Richard Sherman could also be facing the end of his Seattle days. The NFL Network reported earlier Wednesday that Sherman has been telling team-mates that he won’t be with the team next season, though the four-time Pro Bowler later told ESPN’s Josina Anderson that he hasn’t “been told anything” about his future with the team."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"music/2018/mar/09/yasiin-bey-robert-glasper-review-troxy-london-mos-def","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-09T12:31:07Z","webTitle":"Yasiin Bey and Robert Glasper review – mercurial hip-hop star finds magic in the moment","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/mar/09/yasiin-bey-robert-glasper-review-troxy-london-mos-def","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/mar/09/yasiin-bey-robert-glasper-review-troxy-london-mos-def","fields":{"headline":"Yasiin Bey and Robert Glasper review – mercurial hip-hop star finds magic in the moment","bodyText":"In the near-decade since his last album, The Ecstatic, the artist formerly known as Mos Def has proved a vaporous figure, scheduling albums that never arrive, relocating to (and then being expelled from) South Africa and, in 2016, announcing his imminent retirement from showbiz. His debut album, 1999’s Black on Both Sides, announced a saviour of hip-hop but, following label hassles and other maladies, Yasiin Bey chose a slow fade. Tonight’s show does little to clarify the questions that have surrounded the MC in recent years. Is he still retiring? He doesn’t say. That long-awaited second Black Star album he recently announced, to the bemusement of bandmate Talib Kweli? It goes unmentioned. Unconcerned with typical promotional duties – indeed, without anything to promote – Bey prefers instead to goof around with jazz maverick Robert Glasper’s trio, to live in the moment. “Just be here for this,” he tells the audience, requesting they switch off their phones, before performing a cover of Hotline Bling that locates a haunted loneliness beyond the Drake original. Spontaneity suits Bey. He revisits a handful of his old songs, riffs with the band on A Love Supreme, and indulges in some unexpected covers, including a deliciously murky reading of Madvillain’s Meat Grinder. Glasper gets Monk-ish on the keys as his rhythm section (bassist Derrick Hodge and drummer Chris Dave) send the beat skittering, playing jazz the way hip-hop has always heard it: a lucid stream of licks, loops, breaks and ambience which is never less than gripping. Even though the Troxy is bursting at its art deco seams, tonight feels like eavesdropping on an intimate, informal after-hours jam session, and the low-stakes vibe sees Bey thrive. Surprise guest Laura Mvula slips on stage for a moving, downtempo glide through Mos Def anthem Umi Says, Glasper and band finding glory within its melancholic funk. A climactic cover of De La Soul’s ever-resonant Stakes Is High, meanwhile, closes the night on a triumphant, heavy note, suggesting that if this really is Bey’s swansong, it will be a great loss indeed."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"music/2018/mar/09/mist-review-grime-mc-academy-leeds","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-09T11:44:11Z","webTitle":"Mist review – rehabilitated rapper turns pain into a party","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/mar/09/mist-review-grime-mc-academy-leeds","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/mar/09/mist-review-grime-mc-academy-leeds","fields":{"headline":"Mist review – rehabilitated rapper turns pain into a party","bodyText":"When Mist was in prison over Christmas in 2014, his resettlement officer asked him: “Who are you?” The Birmingham rapper couldn’t immediately answer, so in his cell he started writing personal, therapeutic lyrics about his parents’ deaths and the “pure pain” of knowing his daughter had “turned grown while I was in the pen”. He has barely looked back since, with 40m YouTube views and a Top 5 chart position for last month’s Diamond in the Dirt EP. With all the screaming and the sea of mobile phones, this show feels like a victory lap, but despite the euphoria, his bars retain the raw, melancholy edge that transformed his career: “It still hurts that my mum can’t see my success.” In grime’s competitive field, the 25-year old is different. With London Asian producer and fellow MC Steel Banglez on the eerie, catchy beats, the Caribbean-descended Mist’s music reflects multicultural Birmingham, with a sprinkling of reggae, garage, Brummie patois and Punjabi. And it’s oddly refreshing to hear a major grime star speak like Noddy Holder. The yellow tracksuited rapper works the crowd into a growing frenzy. Mosh Pit turns the venue into one. In Game Changer, he drily sings his life: “Hot like Nelly, Machiavelli, Glaston-berry, see me on the telly!” For all the torrent of F-words, N-words and harrowing lyrics about funerals, madness, street beefs and helicopter police chases, there is a lovely moment when the bravado momentarily drops and we get a glimpse of an emotional person who has lost his mum, and is briefly overawed by the turnaround in his life.

Why risk it with reform?","bodyText":"As the government ploughs ahead with plans to abolish local safeguarding children boards (LSCBs) in England, turning over the ground on which good child protection has flourished and helped to nurture fertile multi-professional and multi-agency working, it is urgent to reflect on what will be discarded. The boards’ genesis goes back to the mid-1970s and the response to the inquiry following the death of Maria Colwell. The inquiry identified concerns about how agencies and professionals worked together – for Maria it was about social services, health, school, education welfare, housing, police and the NSPCC. The inquiry highlighted the complexity of seeking to protect and assist children and families when different agencies each hold partial information; how difficult it is to build a full picture of what is happening; and how assumptions about what other workers and agencies might be doing can leave gaps in responding to concerns. The report also recognised the realities of trying to work with families and predicting what might happen in the future to a child. The Colwell inquiry gave rise to what eventually became LSCBs. There were also the first iterations of what was to become the national Working Together statutory child protection guidance for all who work with children. The original statutory guidance was brief and focused – and as a social worker and then team manager I was able to carry it around in my work bag (along with key social services and social security legislation). Over the past 40 years, further inquiries have led to the extension of statutory guidance and the growth of government directives. This has had its strengths in seeking to shape and promote good practice, but it has also created complexity that needs some simplification. One of the dangers of each inquiry and serious case review is that they generate more and more procedures, which create constipated organisations and undermine reflective practice. But overall in the UK we have created the safest child protection systems in the world. Although between 50 and 70 children are known to die in England each year as a consequence of neglect and abuse, this is a lower rate for the child population than anywhere else where there are comparative statistics. This has been the story of our successful child protection system since the 1980s. So although we cannot predict and prevent every child’s death, or always give the attention we would like to all children and families, we know how to protect children – and are generally good at doing so. This is why we should be concerned about the undermining and abandonment of developments to enable good inter-professional and inter-agency working. The government’s intended way forward, as recommended by Sir Alan Wood, will allow each local authority area to create its own multi-agency arrangements for child protection. The only given will be that they should include the local council, health service and police. What is particularly surprising is that this runs counter to another preference of the government: that children’s social services, including statutory social work services, should be opened up to a marketplace outside local authorities. As the government moves forward on creating more complexity, it is at the same time reducing the number of agencies and services that should be involved in developing and delivering collaborative working. At a time of cuts for all services as a consequence of austerity policies, resisting and restricting tendencies to silo working becomes increasingly important. But one of the major problems endemic today is that those advising government – and those in government taking decisions – often lack experience founded on direct practice. It would be sensible to reshape the work of LSCBs so they concentrate even more on awareness and attention to frontline practice and management across all agencies (including those working with adults). They should also be less distracted by managing expensive and time-consuming serious case reviews (Wood’s recommendations on reducing the requirements for these reviews are to be welcomed) – and LSCB leaders should be recruited on the basis that they have direct experience, expertise and wisdom about children’s services and frontline child protection practice. Better though to reshape LSCBs than to throw the whole system up into the air and wait to see how it lands. The consequence could be that as it lands, it will fall apart. • Ray Jones is a social worker and emeritus professor of social work at Kingston University.

We have the incidents that are reported publicly and sometimes go viral: the slave auction at Loughborough, the Confederate flag at Manchester, the banana incident at Warwick, and this week the horrific ordeal of Rufaro Chisango at her accommodation at Nottingham Trent. However, the stories that make headlines every few months are just the tip of the iceberg – many more never come to light. Is the level of racism captured in Chisango’s Twitter clip shocking? Undoubtedly. Does it come as a surprise that students are still subject to such racism? Unfortunately not. The issue should not be focused on individual incidents – we need to look at the way our universities are being run and how this creates the conditions for such racism to flourish. Our institutions steer clear and stay silent on the scandals on their doorsteps – their priorities tend to lie elsewhere, such as the next “diverse” photoshoot to grace their prospectuses. They have adopted the model and outlook of corporate PR machines, aiming to boost their “student experience” scores on league tables. For the sake of maintaining a facade of harmonious multiculturalism, universities will more often downplay or ignore complaints than risk confronting the real issue of racism and hate on their campuses. At times, this has seen universities censuring students of colour for organising against far-right activists on their campuses, as appeared to be the case at Birmingham University in 2015. University vice-chancellors and management scramble to assemble “taskforces” and “working groups” to ensure there is a “sense of belonging” on campus to market to “diverse” student groups. Yet they will condemn students exercising their right to protest. Meanwhile, the vastly bloated bureaucracy of our universities means that students affected by racist incidents are likely to find themselves bounced between faceless representatives and dragged into drawn-out, ultimately fruitless processes of redress that keep events out of the headlines. A result I have witnessed all too often. In the midst of all of this, students like Chisango and countless others find that their only arena for accountability is social media. Another student of colour at Nottingham Trent recounted their experience of living in halls the same building as Chisango’s last year, and told me that a fellow black student had been moved after complaining about racist behaviour towards them by other residents. They moved rooms while the students using racist language were apparently never challenged, nor made to apologise and never held to account. The cycle repeats itself. Incidents like this week’s cannot be taken as aberrations or individualised as “hate crimes” when I have to support students going through this on a daily basis. Incidents may break through into the headlines every few weeks, but students of colour have to continue to navigate microaggressions and institutional racism. Our institutions are failing – unwilling, it seems – to take effective action. From where I stand, this is the core problem. Until universities are forced into action through an organised student body, Twitter retweets are the best many students can hope for in bringing their stories to light. They deserve better, and we demand better.

The inquest, which opens on Monday, will seek to establish the roles of various services who were involved with Ellie before she died, including social services at Sutton council, of independent social workers from Services for Children, schools and medical professionals. Ellie’s father, Ben Butler, is serving a life sentence for murder after the six-year-old sustained “catastrophic” head injuries at the family home in Sutton, south London, in 2013, 11 months after she was returned to her parents following a custody battle. Her mother, Jennie Gray, was jailed for child cruelty for leaving Ellie with an untreated shoulder fracture in the weeks leading up to her death. The role of the family court in deciding to return Ellie to her parents will not be considered in the inquest. Ellie had been cared for most of her life by her grandparents Neal and Linda Gray, who did not want her to return to her parents because of concerns about the child’s welfare. Ellie was returned to her parents in November 2012 after a court quashed Butler’s conviction for violently shaking her when she was a baby. Butler beat Ellie to death in a violent rage while at home alone with her. Gray admitted her role in trying to make it appear that Ellie died two hours later than she had. The couple claimed her death was the result of an accident. The couple have twice appeared via video link at pre-inquest hearings into Ellie’s death, interrupting proceedings several times. “Ellie was a beautiful girl; always full of life. It was both a joy and a privilege to have known her, and I am enormously proud that she was my granddaughter,” Neal Gray told the Guardian. “Kind, clever and polite, Ellie had lots of friends, and was adored by her family; particularly by my late wife, Lin, with whom Ellie had a very special bond. “Ellie came to live with us late in our lives, but she was like a breath of fresh air. We both absolutely idolised her; she gave us a new lease of life, and we will be forever grateful to her for enriching our lives.” Gray questioned why Ellie had been removed from him and his late wife. “There is, in my mind, no plausible justification for the order to return Ellie to her mother. She was settled with us, and was happy and thriving. Her home was with us until she was almost six years old; it was unbearably cruel to have taken Ellie away from everything she knew, and to place her with virtual strangers. How that decision was reached is completely unfathomable to me. “No stone must be left unturned in establishing what happened after Ellie was placed with Jennie Gray. This inquest must identify who had ultimate responsibility for ensuring that the placement was safe for Ellie, who was overseeing the placement, and who was monitoring how it was going. “I want justice to prevail for my wonderful granddaughter, and I want to be reassured that this situation cannot happen again, so that no other child’s life will be so needlessly and horrifically lost.” Gray’s solicitor Aysen Soyer, of Wilsons solicitors, said: “A child’s best interests must always be the family courts’ primary consideration, and that child’s voice must always be heard: these are the pillars of family law. In this case, these pillars crumbled, with devastating consequences. Lessons must be learned, and changes must be made, to ensure that no child slips so tragically through the cracks in the system again. Most importantly, we seek justice for Ellie, and peace for Neal Gray.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"media/2018/mar/12/nme-vogue-death-print-magazines","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-12T15:15:01Z","webTitle":"Out of print: NME’s demise shows pressure on consumer magazines","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/mar/12/nme-vogue-death-print-magazines","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2018/mar/12/nme-vogue-death-print-magazines","fields":{"headline":"Out of print: NME’s demise shows pressure on consumer magazines","bodyText":"The closure of NME magazine after almost seven decades is the latest warning sign that the shift to digital media is threatening to kill the British love affair with print magazines. NME.com continues but stopping the presses on the print edition after 66 years was the first decision made by the magazine’s new owners, the private equity firm Epiris, after its £130m deal to buy NME’s parent company, Time Inc, at the end of last month. The closure of the weekly title is symbolic of the issues facing the wider consumer magazine market. NME is just the latest once mighty magazine brand to cease regular publication in print, or to have embarked on a digital-only path in recent years, joining titles including Loaded, Maxim, FHM, The Face, i-D, Sugar, Bliss, Nuts and Arena. While a number of these were shut when their print fans had already largely abandoned them, many were stunned at the news that that the magazine malaise had also spread to Glamour. The title, the 10th most popular paid-for magazine in the UK, halted its monthly print run last year. The outlook for the UK magazine market is not good with the decline in sales and advertising figures making for grim reading. Sales of the top 100 actively purchased print titles in the UK – those that readers buy or subscribe to – fell by 42% from 23.8m to 13.9m between 2010 and 2017. Since the start of the internet era in 2000, the decline is 55% from 30.8m, according to the Audit Bureau of Circulations. Similarly, advertising in consumer titles will have more than halved from £512m in 2010 to £250m by the end of this year, according to Group M, a media buying agency. “Are magazines dead? No,” says James Wildman, the UK chief executive of Cosmopolitan and Good Housekeeping owner Hearst. “We sell nearly 5m a month, that’s hardly dead, and we have 20 million unique UK users online a month, and more than double that on social media. “But it is true to say that some of the 1 million millennial women every week that look at Cosmopolitan on Snapchat don’t know we also have a magazine of the same name.” The reinvention of magazine brands online is all well and good, but the problem is that the £268m fall in print advertising is nowhere near being replaced by the growth of digital ad revenue, a key factor as magazine sales income also falls. By the end of the year, digital ad spend on consumer magazine brands is projected to be well under half that shortfall, at £111m. “The ad market is a fairly brutal place right now,” says Wildman. Google and Facebook account for 65% of the $6.5bn (£4.7bn) UK digital display ad market. They are also strangling attempts by magazine and newspaper publishers to build their digital ad revenues by taking about 90% of all new spend. This is without the added competition for readers traditional publishers face online from digital media startups such as BuzzFeed. “Magazines do still play an important part in client schedules – if circulation is holding up,” says Phil Hall, the chief commercial strategy officer at the media buying agency MediaCom. “But the issue at the moment is there is a glut of titles that are too similar, too generic. Reaching audience at scale is key to many advertisers and if readers are falling away then that’s a major issue.” Not all sectors of the magazine market are under such pressure. Luxury titles such as Vogue and Tatler, where the advertising is often a big reason readers buy them, are proving resilient. Specialist magazines, catering for more niche audiences with interests ranging from shooting to model railways and ponies, are likely to always have a print fanbase. Wildman says for magazines to survive they must build a brand beyond the core print publication. “It is overly simplistic to say it is just digital versus print,” he says. “Magazine businesses are much more diverse. We ran 100 events related to our magazines last year – [a] Harper’s Bazaar [event] sold out in hours at £600 a head. “Endorsement, accreditation and licensing are increasingly lucrative. DFS sell House Beautiful and Country Living [named after titles] range sofas. And the bestselling premium home gym at Argos is branded after our Men’s Health magazine.” Nevertheless, mounting pressure on the traditional print magazine business, which still drives most revenues, is forcing consolidation as publishers seek scale to survive. Time Inc in the US, which publishes People, Fortune and Sports Illustrated, has just been sold to rival Meredith for $1.8bn; the UK arm was picked up by Epiris. Last year, Immediate Media, which publishes 60 titles including Radio Times and Top Gear, was sold to the German publisher Hubert Burda, owner of Your Home and HomeStyle, for £270m.Despite the gloom, magazine publishers, like their newspaper counterparts, sense an opportunity as brand safety and measurement issues have prompted advertisers to closely scrutinise the once unquestionable value of investing in digital media such as YouTube and Facebook. “With issues such as fake news, we are seeing the pendulum swing back because of two things: trust and context,” says Wildman. “They are two things that went out of fashion in recent years as media agencies pivoted to buying audiences but weren’t worried about where ads were running. Now we are seeing readers and advertisers leaning back towards trusted brands.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/filmblog/2018/mar/14/jonny-greenwood-readers-questions-radiohead-phantom-thread-you-were-never-really-here","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-14T16:12:58Z","webTitle":"'The hardest member of Radiohead?

Ed's probably tasty' – Jonny Greenwood answers readers' questions","bodyText":"Jonny Greenwood’s place in the music firmament is well established after three decades as lead guitarist of Radiohead. But he has built a parallel career composing film scores that threatens to eclipse his day job. His recent soundtrack for Paul Thomas Anderson’s Phantom Thread, his fourth collaboration with the film-maker, earned him an Oscar nomination this year, and he provides a another distinctive and eclectic score for Lynne Ramsay’s latest, You Were Never Really Here. Taking time off from his dual career, Greenwood answers readers’ questions about cinema, music, guitars and fighting. Steve Rose Jessie Jones: Working for film obviously uses a different skill set, even ethos, when producing music as there’s always an image that you’re accompanying. I’m just wondering if that’s affected your work with Radiohead. The band, I think, has a very visual soundscape anyway, but I wonder how has working with film influenced that? Jonny Greenwood: The visual side of Radiohead comes from Thom and [artist] Stanley Donwood working together while we’re recording – often in the same room – on canvas, paper, computers. And it evolves while the recording evolves (and gets Thom occupied while the rest of us try out wayward ideas to dismay/delight him with). So no, I never think in visual terms when Radiohead are working. But on soundtrack work, I do get motivated by the interesting syntheses between music and picture. When that stuff falls well together, it’s really exciting. Apart from anything, it makes the music so much better (and sometimes the picture, too). chaspegg: Are there any films you wished you scored? JG: That’s tough to answer – not many good films have bad scores, and I wouldn’t hope to improve the good ones. There are some silent films I love, like Häxan, which would be fun to have a go at. Or maybe do The Piano without the piano. I don’t know. I’m pretty delighted to get the gigs with Lynne Ramsay and PTA [Paul Thomas Anderson]. TheJoyOfEssex: Who is the hardest member of Radiohead? JG: It’s not a very strong field. Having said that, Ed’s had boxing training – he was sparring with the head of our concert security on the last tour – so he’s probably quite tasty. But also the most placatory and pacific of all of us. I reckon Philip would be pretty handy if he had his wild up with someone. Unlikely, but still, don’t push him. The rest of us are … not a threat. ID9147645: Couple of questions: how did you first cross paths with PTA and begin this fruitful collaboration for his films, but also his Radiohead videos? JG: He saw the first film I scored, called Bodysong, which lead him to bootleg recordings of the first “classical” things I wrote: Smear for the London Sinfonietta and Popcorn Superhet Receiver for the BBC Concert Orchestra. He used bits of them in There Will Be Blood, and asked me to write more. He’s still asking, the rube. ID9147645: Also what guitar work are you most proud of in Radiohead (that guitar squiggle in the second verse of Subterranean Homesick Alien gets me every single darn time) JG: Sweet of you to say. Thanks. I’m more proud of what we’ve written than how I play. Ful Stop has good phasing arpeggios which are really satisfying. Also, talking of PTA, I like the version of Present Tense he filmed with me and Thom, performing in his back garden. That’s a nice guitar line, how it supports the song and dances around. Deschain: If Radiohead’s music and sound was to be represented by a single film, which film would it be? JG: Still on the PTA jag, his Punch-Drunk Love is very Radiohead. Gruingrass: When was the last time you were moved to tears by a song/music? JG: I played lots of Sibelius in the Thames Vale Youth Orchestra, and forgot about it for a few years. Now I’m getting back into it loads. The 2nd, 5th and 7th symphonies especially. It’s probably extra-emotional to me because of my teenage associations with it, and how long ago that was. CynthiaCortez: Hello Jonny, how different it is working with PTA and Lynne Ramsey (both great directors)? PS. Hope you kept the plectrum that I gave you in Miami 2017 show. Bless! JG: Thanks for the plectrum. I keep losing them too. PTA and Lynne are quite similar really – very dedicated, enthusiastic about music, with much nerdy film knowledge. I should get them together – I think that’d make for a fun (and long) night out. You’re right about Lynne being great, though. She is very underrated – I certainly don’t know a better UK director. An amazing photographer. MinusZero: It’s great that you’re doing film scores, writing orchestral pieces and being critically acclaimed, but do you still get days when you want to strap on your guitar, turn the amp up to 11 and just rock? JG: I know! Of course. Nothing’s more exciting than playing an electric guitar in a small room with a good drummer. And sometimes it’s worth recording what you play, and sharing that with other people – just not always. Karsten Walter: What key aspects and experience would you say you took from your time in Radiohead into your score creation and visa versa? JG: I got access to string players, and the chance to write little parts for them. I think the first one was the middle eight for My Iron Lung on The Bends. On later albums the parts got longer and more prominent. It was a really good way to learn. Karsten Walter: And could you make a solo album that’s just like Idioteque for nearly an hour? JG: Idioteque is actually made from a short chunk in an hour-long – “performance” isn’t the word – aimless arseing around with modular synthesisers and turntables. In any case, it’s not worth hearing. Thom slogged through it and found that little section that became the basis for that one song. He didn’t look very refreshed when he’d finished. I don’t think you’d enjoy all 60 minutes. •You Were Never Really Here is on release now."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"politics/2018/mar/13/lib-dems-education-policies-labour","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-13T06:50:34Z","webTitle":"The Lib Dems have come up with detailed education policies.

Why can’t Labour?","bodyText":"The row about who should chair Labour’s National Policy Forum, which overshadowed its recent meeting, is probably of limited interest to anyone not preoccupied by the party’s factional tussles, but it did have one important consequence: little discussion seems to have taken place about policy. It is debatable how much influence the party’s policy-making body has had in the last 20 years. For much of Labour’s time in power, change emerged from one or two powerful individuals at the heart of government rather than the party’s more democratic policy commissions. But given the emphasis on grassroots involvement and membership participation under the current leadership, and the importance most Labour activists place on the role of education in creating a fairer, more equitable society, the lack of any serious debate about the mounting challenges a Labour government might face is odd and frustrating. It is more than two and a half years since the idea of a National Education Service was floated in Jeremy Corbyn’s first leadership campaign. It has survived another leadership challenge and a general election, but we know little more about what its worthy principles – unified, free, cradle to grave, democratically accountable, inclusive education – might mean in practice. My hunch is that for all the talk about grassroots involvement, nothing much has changed since the Blair years and decision making is still tightly controlled by a few people at the centre, probably in the leader’s office. This leaves the engaging shadow education secretary, Angela Rayner, with little to do beyond vigorously opposing the few initiatives that emerge from a Brexit-bound cabinet, a task for which her hands are tied by the lack of detail about what Labour would do instead. I would be very happy if someone could prove me wrong as, for the National Education Service to work, some thorny questions need to be answered. How do you make schools locally accountable when more than 7,000 are now run through a commercial contract with the secretary of state? How do you prioritise inclusion with so many selective and semi-selective schools? What does a joined-up admissions framework look like? Civil servants have been agonising over a fair funding formula for more than five years, and still haven’t come up with anything that doesn’t leave as many losers as winners. How would Labour do this differently? The proposed Labour commission to look at curriculum and assessment and “teaching to the test” is a good idea but why not start now, at a time when there are growing concerns about the way the accountability system is driving negative, even unethical, behaviour in schools, something that should be laid at the government’s door. Coincidentally, just as I sat down to write this column, an email popped into my inbox from the Lib Dems, announcing a package of detailed education reforms, including changes to Ofsted and the league tables, proposals to address the question of the “middle tier” between government and schools, and changes to the curriculum as well as spending pledges. Labour got a long way at the last election by promising to spend more money. But what matters is how that money is spent and what sort of behaviour it incentivises. Simply pouring cash into a system that is plainly malfunctioning isn’t good enough. The Labour party shouldn’t assume it can take the “interested in education” section of the electorate for granted. It is a large and diverse group, including education professionals, governors and, of course, parents. Parents and teachers have a right to know what would happen in their schools and to their children if Labour were in power. The big vision matters but translating that into action can’t be put off for ever."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/live/2018/mar/10/nrl-wests-tigers-v-sydney-roosters-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-10T07:55:25Z","webTitle":"NRL:  Late try and conversion sees Wests Tigers beat Sydney Roosters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2018/mar/10/nrl-wests-tigers-v-sydney-roosters-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/live/2018/mar/10/nrl-wests-tigers-v-sydney-roosters-live","fields":{"headline":"NRL:  Late try and conversion sees Wests Tigers beat Sydney Roosters","bodyText":"The late breaking news before the game was new Tigers recruit Josh Reynolds was out due to a torn hamstring he suffered at training on Friday. This meant Benji Marshall’s NRL comeback started earlier than planned. And he did himself proud, having an influence throughout the game, and especially showing great leadership when Luke Brooks was sin-binned for 10 minutes, two minutes into the second half, for bringing down Blake Ferguson. Latrell Mitchell made it 2-2 with a goal from the resulting penalty, but the Roosters did not score again in the 10 minutes when they had a one-man advantage. Cooper Cronk and James Tedesco both had strong debut games for the Roosters, with the latter, a former Tigers player, being roundly booed every time he touched the ball. Tedesco did, however, commit one howler. He dropped a pass from Ferguson when he should have scored a try. That was in the 14th minute and would have made a big difference to the course of the game. With three minutes to go and the Roosters leading 8-4 after a try from Ferguson just before half-time, they were in the driving seat, or so it seemed. But Corey Thompson – with a try after sustained pressure – and Tuimoala Lolohea – with a perfect conversion from the sideline – had other ideas. With less than two minutes to go, the Tigers were now in the driving seat, leading 10-8, and they held on for the final siren. It was not a classic game by any means, but it certainly showed us the Tigers are better than most people seem to give them credit for, and that the Roosters have to ask some serious questions of themselves, number one being how could they manage to not take advantage of having an extra man for 10 minutes. Thanks for your company. Until next time, good evening. It’s all over and the Tigers have won with a late try and goal. 10-8, which is apparently the lowest ever score for a Tigers v Roosters game. 80 min: Roosters have the ball. It’s now or never. 79 min: Tuimoala Lolohea with a perfect kick from the sideline, under serious pressure. Tigers 10-8 Roosters. 78 min: Brilliant play by the Tigers. Well deserved try. 77 min: Penalty to Tigers after a late tackle. Time is running out. 76 min: Big kick from Cronk into touch, trying to wind the clock down and hold onto their lead. 75 min: Six minutes to go and it’s Tigers 4-8 Roosters. 73 min: Benji Marshall puts his left shoulder to good use to stop the Roosters close to the line, but the Tigers need to work quickly to get back into this game. 71 min: Good play from the Tigers but Tedesco intercepts a kick and saves the day. Making him even more of a villain to the Tigers fans. 68 min: Difficult kick for Mitchell, but he gets it. Beautiful kick. Tigers 4-8 Roosters. 66 min: Answer to my previous question is: score a try. 65 min: Knock-on given against Marshall. Now that the Roosters have the ball what are they going to do with it? 63 min: Lolohea scores and the Tigers are back in front, setting us up for a tight last 17 minutes or so. 61 min: Three-quarters of the game gone and it’s still 2-2. Tigers look more likely to score though. 58 min: Drop out to restart after Mitch Cornish got his hand to the ball before Marshall. 57 min: What is up with the Roosters? They failed to take advantage of having an extra man for 10 minutes and now don’t seem to know exactly what to do. 55 min: It’s not often you get his far into an NRL game and find the score is still 2-2. 53 min: Tuimoala Lolohea misses what should have been a relatively easy kick for the Tigers. Possibly the fact that he took so long to take it affected him. Never mind, the time wasting is over now that Luke Brooks is back on. 49 min: The Roosters in general, and Latrell Mitchell in particular, are letting frustration get the better of them as they are not taking advantage of their extra man. 46 min: Marshall kicks into touch, which is a smart move given the Tigers are playing with 12 men at the moment. 45 min: Tedesco runs straight into Marshall, with a predictable response from the Tigers fans. 44 min: Latrell Mitchell equalises with a goal. 42 mins: Ferguson drops the hip and it’s a great run. Brought down by Brooks who gets 10 minutes in the sin bin for his trouble. And trouble is what the Tigers are in, being down to 12 men now. 41 min: Just a reminder, the Tigers are leading 2-0 over the Roosters. Can the Tigers hold on? And an intriguing point about Mr Mitchell and his quiet first half. This person isn’t good with commas, but the sentiment is there. Cooper Cronk says “Gee it’s good to be back playing footy,” as he heads into the sheds. I’m heading for a cup of tea myself now. Back soon. 40 min: Tedesco tidies up, much to the chagrin of the Tigers fans. Tigers lead 2-0 over the Roosters after 40 minutes of grinding football. 38 min: Penalty to the Wests Tigers, just when the Roosters were building momentum. 36 min: Daniel Tupou forced into touch by strident defence from four Tigers. 34 min: Mighty kick from Cronk. 33: Naiqama saves the day for the Tigers, dragging Manu into touch. 31 min: More good work from Cronk, but again there’s no one there to collect his pass. 29 min: Roosters getting the upper hand now, but still have not scored. 28 min: Cronk kicked but there was no one there to pick it up. He’s got a nosebleed for his troubles too. 26 min: Tigers have 55% of the possession so far. 23 min: Interchange Ben Matulino is on. 21 min: Cooper Cronk’s pressure on Tigers captain Chris Lawrence makes him drop the ball just short of the line. 20 min: The bounce of the ball beat Esan Marsters when it looked like he was through for a try for the Tigers. 19 min: Kevin Naiqama has been busy and industrious for the Tigers. 18 min: Ferguson has been the key player for the Roosters so far. 17 min: Marshall puts the ball into touch and both sides get a momentary breather. 14 mins: Tedesco drops a pass from Ferguson. He should have scored a try there. The Tigers fans love it. 13 min: Tedesco being roundly booed every time he touches the ball. No way he can’t hear that. 12 min: Marshall in some space after an offload. What a start from him. 10 min: It has been an exciting and positive start from both sides, so far anyway. 8 min: Great play from the Roosters, leading to a penalty. 6 min: Goal for Tigers! 5 min: Good start from Marshall with a quick tap and some nice touches. No visible nerves from the veteran. 3 min: First touch for James Tedesco against his old club and the Tigers fans boo him loudly. 1 min: Good metres early on for the Roosters, but Tigers have the ball now. After a moment’s silence for Steve Folkes, the game has kicked off. The players are on the field. Roosters are going for an 11th straight win over the Tigers. And some are less positive. Then again, some are more positive than I am. Ten minutes to game time and it’s hard to see Wests Tigers winning without Josh Reynolds. 1. James Tedesco 2. Daniel Tupou 3. Latrell Mitchell 4.

This means Benji Marshall starts his NRL comeback today, in his first game for the Tigers since 2013, with Matt McIlwrick promoted to the interchange bench.

Some of those who have had their status resolution support service (SRSS) cut arrived in Australia as unaccompanied minors, have since graduated from high school here and won scholarships to university. With the withdrawal of financial support, some have since withdrawn from university because they can not survive while studying. Others who are studying English or training for a work qualification are being forced to choose between continuing their studies or finding immediate work to support themselves. Changes to the SRSS regime were imposed late last year, when individual asylum seekers – living legally in the Australian community on bridging visas – were told they were being cut off from their support. But details of the breadth of the policy have become clearer over recent weeks, with more and more asylum seekers affected. The government has outlined its rationale that asylum seekers judged to be “work-ready” will be required to be working: those who are seeking work, but are unable to find it, or who are studying for work qualifications or to improve their English, will not be eligible for assistance. Many have received letters informing them they have been cut off. Currently, the SRSS payment is 89% of the Newstart allowance – about $478 a fortnight – and 89% of rent assistance. About 12,000 people currently receive SRSS. Many were banned from working in Australia for years, but have recently had work rights attached to their visa. It is unclear how many people might be caught up in the changes, but agencies supporting asylum seekers estimate it could affect up to 10,000 people across the country, mainly in Sydney and Melbourne. SRSS providers, as part of their contracts, are gagged from speaking about the details of government policy on service provision. Dozens of asylum seekers have already received letters informing them their SRSS has been cut off. Some have been forced to choose between continuing to study for a qualification – in one instance for a forklift licence – and finding lower-skilled work straight away. Others have been forced to choose between learning English full-time and immediately entering the workforce. Refugee advocates have said those stripped of their SRSS are vulnerable to exploitation in the workforce, forced to take any job, under any conditions, in order to survive. A source familiar with the new policy described it as “deliberately punitive” and pushing asylum seekers towards destitution. “How does homelessness help with integration?” A Department of Home Affairs spokesperson said: “Individuals on a bridging visa with work rights, and who have the capacity to work, are expected to support themselves while their immigration status is being resolved.” The spokesperson said studying basic English on a part-time basis would not “automatically” preclude a person’s access to support services. Melbourne’s Asylum Seeker Resource Centre said the changes to the payments meant individuals and families waiting for their protection claims to be assessed could not pay rent, buy food or access mental healthcare. The centre said the changes had not been clearly to explained to asylum seekers, and said it was a “cruel twist of irony” to demand higher language requirements of would-be citizens while removing support from those studying English. “If you don’t support people to meet basic needs, how can they learn to speak English and pass the government’s own proposed language test?” the ASRC’s Jana Favero said. In Sydney, the principal solicitor with the Refugee Advice and Casework Service, Sarah Dale, said some of the asylum seekers stripped of SRSS had studied and worked ever since arriving in Australia as children, by themselves. “It’s just further perpetuating this second class of refugees in this country and limiting their opportunity to settle here successfully and to have a bright future,” she said. “It’s not just a choice of ‘do I continue my studies?’, this is a choice about their future, we are limiting their ability to build a new life for themselves, and to integrate in Australia.” The Greens’ immigration spokesman, Nick McKim, said cutting support payments to asylum seekers was “unconscionably cruel and punitive”. “This is a deeply unfair decision which could force people into poverty, homelessness and exploitative jobs,” McKim said. “Many people affected by these cuts are studying, and all of them are trying to rebuild their lives.” Labor’s immigration spokesman, Shayne Neumann, said any abuses in the system should be stamped out, but urged the government to “stop playing politics” with vulnerable people.

A new generation got their hands on cinema, and they took it to places it had never been before: out of the studios and into the streets; into inner consciousness and psychedelic realms; out into the cosmos and the future. They made what went before look square, Daddio. It started with the French. Even in the mid-50s, François Truffaut was labelling the stuffy, classical studio fare that had gone before “le cinema de papa”. By the end of the decade, he and Jean-Luc Godard, among others, were ready to show the world the alternative. Their debuts, Truffaut’s The 400 Blows and Godard’s Breathless, were both made in 1959 (neither arrived in British cinemas until 1960) but they set the tone for the decade: hand-held cameras! Real locations! Politics! Jump cuts! Irony! Vitality! Modern life! Death to papa! The ripples spread from the French New Wave and suddenly other countries had their own new waves, in name or in spirit: Czechoslovakia, India, Brazil, Italy. In 1960 alone, Italy gave us Fellini’s La Dolce Vita and Antonioni’s L’Avventura. British cinema had its own variation of the new wave, starting with the Free Cinema documentary movement and the “angry young man” and kitchen-sink realism currents that launched the careers of Lindsay Anderson (This Sporting Life, If), Tony Richardson and John Schlesinger. But then in 1963 came another revolution in the form of the Beatles and Richard Lester’s A Hard Day’s Night, a piece of avant-garde pop playfulness whose surprise commercial success forced studio execs to acknowledge that they no longer knew anything. Some of those late-60s British movies are still my all-time favourites, in particular Antonioni’s Blow-Up and Donald Cammell and Nicolas Roeg’s Performance – both ostensibly by-products of that swinging London moment, but mining far darker and deeper themes. On both sides of the Atlantic, pop culture and the counterculture steadily took over, to the extent that by the end of the decade Hollywood itself was made “new”. The cumbersome old studio productions lumbered on, but a new breed of stylish, edgy new movies began to take hold: Bonnie and Clyde, The Graduate, Midnight Cowboy, Point Blank. There was still an awful lot of squareness around in the 60s. The highest-grossing movie of the decade, for example, was The Sound of Music – a movie that does absolutely nothing to represent the era. But even in mainstream Hollywood, certain films still had a clip to them. Disney has never produced a better movie than 1967’s The Jungle Book. Hitchcock gave us Psycho and The Birds. And Kubrick gave us the ultimate sci-fi head trip, 2001: A Space Odyssey. If you drew a graph of “fiscal responsibility” versus “wayward experimentalism”, the 60s is the point where they crossed. It was a golden age for studio-budgeted oddness, and so many of my favourite films from the era have that “how did they get away with it?” quality to them. European cinema was a trove of surreal and psychedelic curios such as Vera Chytilova’s Daisies, Wojciech Haas’s The Saragossa Manuscript, Sergei Paradjanov’s The Colour of Pomegranates and Luis Buñuel’s Belle de Jour. There were intense dramas such as Andrei Tarkovsky’s Andrei Rublev, Ingmar Bergman’s Persona and Roman Polanski’s Repulsion; exuberant pop nonsense such as Barbarella, Modesty Blaise and Smashing Time, or cult movies that were simply way cool, like Russ Meyer’s Faster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill! and Seijun Suzuki’s deranged spy thriller Branded to Kill. The 1960s were over before I was born, but in my own (mildly) rebellious youth, it was a revelation to discover movies so rebellious and youthful. And back in the pre-internet 80s and 90s you really did have to discover them, which only enhanced the experience. If you didn’t live near a decent repertory cinema (which I didn’t), you’d be lucky to find them playing on late-night television, or at your local video rental store. So now those films are viewed through a double layer of nostalgia, not to mention a 21st-century political filter that exposes many of them as archaically white- and male-centric, but that sense of vitality and possibility is still palpable. Despite the youthfulness, so many of those works have stood the test of time."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"fashion/2018/mar/09/designer-football-scarves-versace-henry-holland-fashion","type":"article","sectionId":"fashion","sectionName":"Fashion","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-09T11:25:47Z","webTitle":"Here we go: how fashion co-opted the football scarf","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2018/mar/09/designer-football-scarves-versace-henry-holland-fashion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/fashion/2018/mar/09/designer-football-scarves-versace-henry-holland-fashion","fields":{"headline":"Here we go: how fashion co-opted the football scarf","bodyText":"Football scarves are making the move from Saturday afternoon fan favourite to this year’s must-have fashion accessory. At the recent autumn/winter 2018 collections, they were featured by some of the most influential brands in fashion. In Milan, Donatella Versace showed three styles in bold primary hues depicting the family brand, while fellow Italian fashion house MSGM presented five bearing the name of drinks brands and Vodka bars located in the fashion capital. In London, Henry Holland’s scarves were the talking point. The designer – famous for his statement T-shirts with slogans including ‘I’ll Show You Who’s Boss Kate Moss’ – sent out personalised scarves to influential guests in advance, inserting a cheeky expletive in place of a middle name. “There is a real feeling in the air of having to belong to something, support a cause or be part of a movement and I think the football scarf trend is a representation of this,” says Holland. In Paris, Karl Lagerfeld – the doyen of French fashion – was spotted wearing one backstage after his Chanel show. The fashion search platform Lyst.com says it has seen global searches for the terms “football scarf” and “soccer scarf” increase by 13% in the last month, while womenswear-specific searches have risen 57% on the previous month. And it’s not just catwalks that are jumping in on the trend – the most popular Lyst searches include a collaboration between the sportswear brand Reebok and Vetements, and a scarf designed by the TV presenter Alexa Chung for her eponymous label. The latter was made in a limited run of 50, and sold out. The scarf’s newfound status is riding on the back of the trend for statement logos and genderless items, says Ida Peterson, buying director at Browns. The retailer was one of the first to test the water with an early style from the streetwear brand Y/Project which, she says, performed well. “I don’t think it’s a coincidence that the trend has emerged the same year we have a World Cup,” says Peterson, who also noted the recent rise in popularity of football shirts."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"society/2018/mar/09/antihistamines-linked-to-fertility-problems-in-men","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-09T00:01:20Z","webTitle":"Antihistamines linked to fertility problems in men","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/mar/09/antihistamines-linked-to-fertility-problems-in-men","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/mar/09/antihistamines-linked-to-fertility-problems-in-men","fields":{"headline":"Antihistamines linked to fertility problems in men","bodyText":"Common allergy drugs have been linked to fertility problems in men. Antihistamines are often used to relieve symptoms of allergies such as hay fever, hives, conjunctivitis and reactions to insect bites or stings and are available either over-the-counter or on prescription. Now an Argentinian review of studies involving the commonly taken drugs has found that they could have negative long-term side effects for male fertility. The study, which is published in the journal Reproduction, found a number of papers reported adverse effects of antihistamine on normal testicular function. They discovered antihistamines were likely to affect the production of male sexual hormones in the testicles, which could lead to altered morphology and decreased motility of sperm, as well as a lower sperm count. The researchers, who analysed a number of animal studies, said further research was needed as human studies were still very limited, but they cautioned against antihistamine overuse. The rise in allergies in the industrialised world has led to an increased use of drugs such as antihistamines. Histamine is a molecule produced by the body in response to an allergy that makes the sufferer react to it, such as by sneezing or itching, and previous research has shown that histamines are also involved in other bodily processes unrelated to allergic reactions, including sleep-wake regulation, sexual behaviour and fertility. Researchers at the Instituto de Biologia y Medicina Experimental in Buenos Aires said this suggested that blocking histamine activity to treat allergy symptoms may lead to undesirable side effects. Study author Dr Carolina Mondillo said: “More large-scale trials are needed to evaluate the possible negative effects of antihistamine on reproductive and sexual health. “This can then lead to developing novel treatments to relieve allergy symptoms without compromising fertility. “The data compiled in this review indicates the crucial involvement of histamine in orchestrating testicular functions, but even so there is still much to learn about the implicated mechanisms.” Commenting on the research, Dr Channa Jayasena, senior clinical lecturer at Imperial College London, said: “The average sperm quality in the population has been reducing over the last few decades, so it is always important to consider that common (and increasingly used) medications may be partly responsible. “The authors aim to summarise previous scientific studies in the field. As they rightly acknowledge, it is far too soon to raise alarm bells about taking these medications. “Many agents have been linked to male infertility. The trick is working out how much overall impact they have on men’s reproductive health, which is still not known.” Prof Darren Griffin, professor of genetics at the University of Kent, said: “Any medicine that has the potential to do good also has the potential to do harm and side effects of over-the-counter drugs constantly warrant further investigation, and the use of antihistamines is on the rise. “In any event, however, persistent sneezing is not a particularly good reproductive strategy either, so perhaps taking the antihistamines when necessary is the lesser of two evils.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/mar/08/houston-rockets-golden-state-warriors-nba","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-08T13:35:28Z","webTitle":"In the Houston Rockets, the NBA finally has a team for the Warriors to fear","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/mar/08/houston-rockets-golden-state-warriors-nba","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/mar/08/houston-rockets-golden-state-warriors-nba","fields":{"headline":"In the Houston Rockets, the NBA finally has a team for the Warriors to fear","bodyText":"When Kevin Durant joined the Warriors in the summer of 2016, many NBA fans resigned themselves to a new basketball reality for the foreseeable future: every season would end with the inevitable and anticlimactic Warriors v whatever-Eastern-team-LeBron-is-on Finals. That was the new and future NBA. The Warriors, then LeBron, then everyone else a very distant third. Enter the Houston Rockets. With Wednesday night’s 110-99 road win over Milwaukee, Houston have now won 17 games in a row and sit a full game ahead of the Warriors in the West with just 16 regular season games to play. There’s a real chance the Western Conference Finals will go through Houston and some have begun to wonder if the NBA Finals may do too. “I expect to beat them,” Rockets center Clint Capela said back in December of the Warriors, a quote that raised a lot of eyebrows and a few chuckles. But Capela has every reason to be confident. The offseason additions of Chris Paul, Luc Mbah a Moute and PJ Tucker have turned Houston’s defense from a weakness to a strength – with Capela on the back end serving as rim protector with 1.78 blocks per game, sixth-best in the NBA. And while Capela’s quote no longer elicits laughter, the story is the same for the defense played by Rockets star James Harden. Once laissez-faire, his defensive play is now can be graded as, well ... fair. A recent deep-dive into defensive analytics by ESPN graded Harden as an above-average defender at his position this season. You can argue that if you’d like with the eye test, but the volume of video clips of Harden getting blown like his controller is disconnected has waned a bit on social media in 2018. Take that for data. But it’s Harden’s offense that has elevated him to the top of the MVP race this season. Paul’s ability to make plays and find the open shooter has made Harden even more dangerous and he’s letting the ball fly with confidence. Harden ranks first in the league in scoring, second in field goal attempts and first in three-point attempts with a career-high 10.5 per game. Harden isn’t the only Rockets player firing from long range, however. Houston have taken Golden State’s embrace of the three and literally expanded it to the farthest reaches of the court. The Rockets average an eye-popping 42.4 three-point attempts per game, nearly 13 more per game than the Warriors and seven more per game than the next closest team, the Brooklyn Nets. More than half of the field goals the Rockets take are from three, making them the sole member of that exclusive club. Such reliance on the three ball presents more opportunities to score points, but also significant risk. If the Rockets go cold in a match-up with the Warriors, they could be dispatched with relative ease. In fact, if they go cold in a match-up with anyone, that could be their fate. But the quantity of quality long range shooters the Rockets have – Harden, Paul, Tucker, Mbah a Moute, Trevor Ariza, Ryan Anderson, Gerald Green and Eric Gordon all shoot 35% or above from three – makes it unlikely everyone will start missing at once. The Rockets shooting threes has both more reward and less risk than any other team. That, and their improved defense, is a terrifying reality to any team they face, including Golden State. Asked after Wednesday night’s win if the Rockets are now the NBA’s team to beat, Harden succinctly responded: “Nah.” He then added: “I feel like we’re just out there swaggin’ and hoopin’. We’re not worried about wins and losses right now. We’re worried about playing the right way on both ends of the floor and that’s going to carry over into the postseason. More times than not, 90% of the time, if you play the right way on both ends of the floor great things will happen. The result? Get wins.” That “swaggin’ and hoopin’” approach could even give the Rockets an extra edge in a potential playoff match-up with Golden State. The Warriors have the pressure of being the NBA’s team to beat and anything short of a championship every season from now through the early 2020s will be considered a colossal failure – and Golden State has seemed weighed down by that reality at times this season. Steve Kerr said his team was “mentally fried” heading into last month’s All-Star break. Meanwhile the Rockets are playing with the lightness of a team with zero expectations, creating a real chance to win the franchise’s first title since Michael Jordan was an newly-retired baseball player. No one is planning parade celebration routes in Houston quite yet. The prevailing sentiment throughout the league is still that the Warriors will simply “turn it on” in the postseason (bookies still have Golden State as heavy favorites to win the title this year with Houston and then Cleveland well behind). Let us not forget that even a mentally tired Warriors team is still just a game back of a team on a 17-game tear. But all that aside, we don’t know with complete certainty anymore that the Warriors will win the NBA Finals this year. Or even make it to the final round. The inevitability and anticlimax is gone. The conference playoffs matter again. That’s something all NBA fans can celebrate."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"us-news/2018/mar/10/republican-candidates-north-korea-experience-may-not-be-all-he-claims","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-10T11:30:11Z","webTitle":"Republican candidate's North Korea experience may not be all he claims","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/mar/10/republican-candidates-north-korea-experience-may-not-be-all-he-claims","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/mar/10/republican-candidates-north-korea-experience-may-not-be-all-he-claims","fields":{"headline":"Republican candidate's North Korea experience may not be all he claims","bodyText":"North Korea rarely plays a prominent role in US congressional elections, but Rick Saccone – the Republican candidate for Congress in Tuesday’s crucial special election in Pennsylvania – has made much of his experience in the reclusive country. A television advertisement features moody shots of a missile launch and goose-stepping North Korean soldiers – and Saccone’s claim that his career as “a diplomat in North Korea” makes him uniquely placed to deal with the looming crisis over Pyongyang’s nuclear programme. Saccone’s campaign website says that he “spent one year on a diplomatic mission in North Korea” and describes him as “the only United States citizen living in North Korea that negotiated with the North Korean regime on a daily basis”. But the four-term state legislator may be overstating his role. According to former colleagues, although Saccone is one of the few Americans to have dealt with North Korean officials, he was not a diplomat, and was not engaged in traditional diplomacy. “From what I have heard, he has tended to embellish his role,” said David Lambertson, a former US diplomat who held the same position as Saccone in North Korea. Both were US representatives for the Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organization, (KEDO), a nuclear power plant project in North Korea that was designed to give Pyongyang civilian nuclear power without the ability to make weapons. KEDO was the result of Bill Clinton-era negotiations that began in 1994 and slowly fell apart before formally ending in 2006. The agreement required at least one American to be on site, as well as representatives from Japan and South Korea. The building site where Saccone spent his time was in Kumho, about 270 kilometres (165 miles) from Pyongyang. The close race between Saccone and Democrat Conor Lamb in a district that Donald Trump won overwhelmingly in 2016 has become a major test of Republican strength ahead of the 2018 midterms. And after this week’s shock announcement that Trump had accepted an invitation to meet the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, Saccone’s experience in Kumho has taken on fresh relevance. Questions about the precise nature of that experience were first raised by blogger Warren Throckmorton. According to Lambertson, substantial negotiations over KEDO would take place in Pyongyang, with US staff flown in from New York. Lambertson attended these meetings but described his presence at negotiations as “more of an observer”. “Saccone’s experience would have been exactly the same: he was not negotiating highly sensitive matters with the North Koreans by any means,” he added. Kim Joong-keun, the South Korean representative on the project who worked with Saccone, agreed that the candidate’s account was “inaccurate”. “Frankly speaking, he didn’t meet any important North Koreans,” Kim said. “There was a lot more contact between North Koreans and South Koreans. “Of all the Americans I worked with, I would rank Saccone at the bottom.” Kim said that meetings typically took place twice a month – a far cry from the claims in Saccone’s campaign literature. “Once the framework was signed, there was no political negotiations going on with KEDO, it was a $5 billion construction project,” said Joel Wit, a former state department official who was instrumental in establishing KEDO and oversaw the agreement with North Korea. “If you want to talk to people who knew about the project, he wouldn’t be one of them”. Bob Branstetter, a spokesman for Saccone said: “Rick was the American representative for the Korea Peninsula Energy Development Organization inside North Korea from December 2000 to December 2001.” He added that Saccone “interacted daily with the North Koreans regarding the implementation of the agreed framework” and “served in a diplomatic capacity for KEDO”. Branstetter also sent a picture of Saccone shaking hands with another man over a conference table lined with full glasses of beer. He added: “What is portrayed in the photo is the definition of diplomacy. In the photo, Rick was shaking hands with North Korean officials immediately after signing an agreement negotiated by Rick and the North Koreans to give access to the beach area for the KEDO workers.” Branstatter also provided an image of a commemorative plate given to Saccone after he left KEDO. It bore the names of six KEDO co-workers. The first name listed was that was of Kim. Branstattter said Saccone “interacted with North Koreans virtually every single day during his year in the country”. Although Saccone has said that he lived in North Korea for one year, Lambertson and Kim said his position was shared among two or three people, with each rotating in for a maximum period of about six weeks. Despite his experience in North Korea, Saccone has hesitated to share explicit views on how Washington should engage with Pyongyang. In an interview earlier in March, he declined to comment on the wisdom of a pre-emptive airstrike against North Korea. “I’m not privy to exactly what the adminstration’s strategy is,” said Saccone. “I don’t want to second-guess a strategy that may be going on behind the scenes until I get there and then I can advise how to make this work.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/booksblog/2018/mar/09/five-great-short-novels-you-were-never-really-here","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-09T14:48:58Z","webTitle":"Brief encounters: what are the best short novels?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2018/mar/09/five-great-short-novels-you-were-never-really-here","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/booksblog/2018/mar/09/five-great-short-novels-you-were-never-really-here","fields":{"headline":"Brief encounters: what are the best short novels?","bodyText":"As Nabokov said, “a good reader is a re-reader”. But how many times have you read In Search of Lost Time? Exactly. Sure, those big novels have a certain literary allure. Making it to that final page is like an Odyssey in itself, never mind the plot. But wouldn’t it be nice if they could just get to the point? Or, maybe, be enjoyable enough that you’d like to dip back into them sometime? Here, we celebrate those novels that can squeeze eternity into an hour (or four). Those wonderful books that do a lot with a little and, graciously, never outstay their welcome. Eugene Onegin by Alexander Pushkin “Pushkin is our everything” is an actual Russian saying, and his greatest work clocks in at just 120 pages (or at least it does in the translation I have). Onegin, bored of St Petersburg, moves to the countryside. He’s a man trying to live as a Byronesque antihero. It doesn’t go well. But while the plot – full of feigned romance, social satire and culminating in a famous duel – is engaging, it’s Pushkin’s tone and insight that lingers. He has that lightness of touch that only the knowing possess. This “novel in verse” (it’s not just a long poem, I swear) has repeatedly been thwarted in English. Mostly because of Pushkin’s unique and complex stanza structure. Clarke sidesteps this entirely, rendering it in freewheeling, lyrical prose (which, for the sake this article, makes it a novel). Pedro Páramo by Juan Rulfo The magical realist’s choice: it cured Gabriel García Márquez of writer’s block and inspired One Hundred Years of Solitude, and Jorge Luis Borges called it one of the greatest works of any literature. Susan Sontag thought it a masterpiece. And it’s just over 150 pages. Set in a literal ghost town, the story begins with a promise: our protagonist assures his dying mother that he’ll travel to the village of Comala to find his father, the titular Pedro Páramo. The book then loses all sense of certainty. It’s fragmentary. You’re never sure who’s talking, if they’re living or dead, or when they’re doing it. But Rulfo exploits this for dramatic purposes. Despite being non-linear, there is a plot. And it’s devastating, as is Rulfo’s beautifully sparse prose. By Grand Central Station I Sat Down and Wept by Elizabeth Smart Angela Carter said this novel of prose poetry (again, not a long poem!) was “like Madame Bovary blasted by lightning”. Even Flaubert’s average-sized classic seems bloated in comparison. This is a tale of a love affair. But it’s also a story of life lived as poetry. Some complain it is overwrought, but if you give yourself up to Smart’s language, it is as intoxicating as it is terrifying. As Life of Pi author Yann Martel put it: “She takes what is yours and mine, what is everyday and everywhere … and makes it mythical.” Its brevity even echoes the lifespan of such intense love. You Were Never Really Here by Jonathan Ames Ames is a skilled literary impressionist: he can do a good Bukowski and a surprisingly poignant PG Wodehouse. You Were Never Really Here is Ames’s take on a whole genre: noir. But as with any impression, what is done with it is as important as its accuracy. What Ames does is refresh beloved tropes, without taking them apart. Joe, the book’s protagonist, is a damaged ex-FBI agent who now lives rescuing girls from the sex trade – until he stumbles into a much larger conspiracy. Yes, it’s cliched. But Ames finds a way to let even the most critical of readers enjoy those cliches anew. In earnest. And whereas some books in this list are short but dense, Ames’s prose flies at breakneck speed – and, true to noir, that speed doesn’t preclude some delightfully deadpan description. Achilles by Elizabeth Cook A compressed epic. Scholar and poet (noticing a theme here?) Cook draws liberally from The Iliad, The Odyssey and other classical sources, to produce writing that is both muscular and delicately worded. Despite retelling a story we’ve heard 100 times over, Cook manages to provide a true twist ending that will both please and infuriate. As an aside, it also contains one of the best – and most fantastical – sex scenes written in the English language. “Is that it!? What about The Old Man and the Sea? Breakfast at Tiffany’s? Is The Metamorphosis not here because it’s too short? Was Things Fall Apart omitted because it’s too long? What exactly is a novella anyway!?” Questions, questions, questions. We could deliberate for a long time. But like so many of the novels listed here, I want to keep this brief – but please share your favourite short books in the comments below."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"media/2018/mar/12/michele-hanson-obituary-letters","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-12T17:37:08Z","webTitle":"Letters: Michele Hanson’s bond with her readers","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/mar/12/michele-hanson-obituary-letters","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2018/mar/12/michele-hanson-obituary-letters","fields":{"headline":"Letters: Michele Hanson’s bond with her readers","bodyText":"Sarah Carter writes: The many columns by Michele Hanson sustained me for several years.

The answer depends on your perspective. To the whales, seals and penguins of the Antarctic: it’s dinner. To you and me: it’s a small creature called krill, which forms the bedrock of the Antarctic food web. But unfortunately, and as a new report by Greenpeace lays bare, for an expanding multimillion dollar fishing industry: it’s an investment opportunity. One of the quirks of life on our planet is that the biggest creatures to have ever lived, blue whales, depend on something no bigger than your little finger: krill. Gathering in their billions, these tiny crustaceans form vast clouds of pink in Antarctic waters which can stretch for miles and show up in satellite imagery. Blue, humpback, fin and minke whales all consume krill – some up to two tonnes in a single day. Penguin colonies across the Antarctic are strewn with pink-stained snow because of the volume of krill they eat. Fur seals, crabeater seals, and many more animals rely on them. Even the things that don’t eat krill usually eat something that does: albatross, leopard seals and killer whales are all indirectly dependent on krill. Companies fishing in the Antarctic for krill usually market themselves as sustainable and trustworthy – as the good guys providing health supplements such as Omega-3 pills for clean-living individuals, along with fishmeal for farmed fish and pet food. But sustainability in the Antarctic ecosystem is a risky claim, when there is such patchy data, when the industry’s fishing overlaps with feeding grounds, and when the impact of climate change is already causing a decline in krill populations. History tells us that even species with huge populations can be driven to the point of collapse. In the 19th century no one would have believed that the most abundant bird on Earth, the passenger pigeon, could be hunted to extinction through the shooting of more than 5 billion birds. Meanwhile the practice of transhipment means that catch is often transferred at sea to filthy cargo boats, or “reefers”. Many of these vessels are deployed in the Antarctic to allow the trawlers to remain at sea for months at a time, and their use has been linked to environmental and labour abuses. But this isn’t only about protecting the Antarctic wilderness. With their bulbous black eyes and translucent pink bodies which reveal the green algae in their stomachs, krill not only underpin life in the Antarctic, but they also have a crucial role to play by helping to limit climate change. That’s because when krill gather, the ones at the top eat their fill at the water’s surface and then sink down to the bottom of the pack, before doing their carbon-rich business in faecal pellets which can drop to the bottom of the ocean. This is a vital process for cycling and storing carbon: as much as 23 million tonnes of carbon a year according to some studies. An EU proposal to create the biggest ocean sanctuary on Earth – 1.8m sq km, or 200 times the size of Yellowstone national park – will be considered by the Antarctic Ocean Commission when it meets in October. This Antarctic Ocean Sanctuary would cover much of the Weddell Sea and parts of the Antarctic peninsula. It is an area that the krill industry mostly does not yet fish, but is looking to expand into. Rather than letting something that belongs to us all be offered as an investment opportunity, more than a million people have already called for the protection of this unique region. When a huge iceberg broke off the Larsen C ice shelf last year, it revealed an ecosystem that had been hidden for 120,000 years, providing an opportunity for groundbreaking scientific research. This year has also seen humans visiting parts of the Antarctic seafloor we have never been to before. What greater gift could we give to future generations than to preserve a bigger chunk of the natural world than we have ever done before? Krill might be tiny, but to protect the biggest beasts roaming the ocean we need to start small and think big. • Chris Packham is a naturalist, nature photographer and author, and one of the presenters of BBC2’s Springwatch"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"fashion/2018/mar/12/hubert-de-givenchy-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"fashion","sectionName":"Fashion","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-12T17:44:36Z","webTitle":"Hubert de Givenchy obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2018/mar/12/hubert-de-givenchy-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/fashion/2018/mar/12/hubert-de-givenchy-obituary","fields":{"headline":"Hubert de Givenchy obituary","bodyText":"Audrey Hepburn glides through the credits of the 1961 film Breakfast at Tiffany’s in a black dress that is in no way little. It’s a long, narrow sheath, though she can still amble down Fifth Avenue unimpeded. The dress is sleeveless – yet gloves cover her arms far above her elbows – and collarless, with a striking back strap revealing her shoulder blades. Several generations have worshipped images of Hepburn in that dress as defining sophistication. This was the work of Hubert de Givenchy, who has died aged 91. His clothes for Hepburn made her feel secure. “I put them on and I feel protected,” she said. He helped her to downplay the trampiness of Holly Golightly, who trips into Sing Sing prison in Givenchy’s lampshade hat, and shops at Tiffany’s in his tailored coat. No wonder Jacqueline Kennedy commanded Givenchy to outfit her state visit to Paris that year. Givenchy had been brought up to enjoy textiles, to regard them as treats. He was the younger son of the Marquis of Givenchy, who died when the boy was three, and Béatrice Badin; and the pet of his maternal grandmother, Margaret Badin, widow of the director of the Beauvais tapestry workshops. That was his happy memory of childhood, his grandmother rewarding him for good behaviour by opening cupboards filled with fabric treasures, or allowing him to rummage in trunks and bundles. “My mother and my cousins played customers, gathered about the sewing machine.” His mother backed his decision to be a fashion designer, provided he did it to the highest standards. She introduced him to couture houses and sent him to study in the Ecole des Beaux-Arts in Paris. As a postwar teen he worked briefly for Jacques Fath, Robert Piguet and Lucien Lelong before joining Elsa Schiaparelli in 1947. She had confidence in him, despite his youth, and told him to use up 900 metres of prewar, surrealist-print silks cluttering her stockroom. He did what he always did thereafter: hung up the cloth until he understood its properties, and then cut separates from it, amusing enough to sell well despite the stuffs being so out of date. “Never work against the fabric, it has a life of its own,” he said. Givenchy was 24 when he opened his own house with financial backing from his brother-in-law, Louis Fontaine, who owned the Prisunic chain stores. There was only money enough to pay his few workhands (many of whom then stayed with him for life). He showed his clothes on plastic mannequins to save model hire and, not being able to afford the silks of his competitors, made a collection with the cotton toile (shirting) traditionally used for couture prototypes. This, plus the simplicity of his lines, and his philosophy that a dress should defer to a woman’s shape, not she to it, positioned him closer to American sportswear than to Paris couture. His heroes were the unique dressmaker Madame Grès, who left him her personal collection of 300 gowns, and Cristóbal Balenciaga, who redirected clients to Givenchy when he closed his own house – despite the fact that Balenciaga was baroque in spirit, while Givenchy was a neoclassicist. Givenchy’s freshness and vivacity were just right for the new world of the Vespa scooter and the beach bag. And they attracted the ultimate customer in 1953. When he was told Mademoiselle Hepburn had made an appointment, he assumed that meant Katharine the great movie star. In walked Audrey, who had just made Roman Holiday, the definitive Vespa movie, aged 24 but looking a teen in T-shirt, ballet flats and no make-up. She thought he could supply the believable sophistication she needed for Sabrina (1954), the Billy Wilder film in which a below-stairs girl returns from Paris transformed. There wasn’t time to create to order, so she chose from what was available and stood through three-hour fittings in service of exactitude. Her boat-necked Cinderella gown won a deserved Oscar, but not for Givenchy: his work was credited to the studio designer Edith Head. Hepburn was mortified by that, but the episode established the Givenchy-Hepburn relationship, which lasted to her death in 1993. He made her costumes for the musical Funny Face (1957) and the thriller Charade (1963). By How to Steal a Million (1966), the partnership had become an in-joke — when Hepburn’s character asks why she must be disguised as an aproned charlady during a robbery, she is told: “It’ll give Givenchy a night off.” Yet the next year, the studio dressed Hepburn in ready-to-wear clothes, and not from Paris, for the comedy Two for the Road. The mood had changed, and the big money had gone. She demanded Givenchy should design her period costumes for Tennessee Williams’s Summer and Smoke, then withdrew from the project, and their only movie together after that was the made-for-television Love Among Thieves (1987). Among Givenchy’s clients were also Lauren Bacall, Ingrid Bergman, Leslie Caron, Maria Callas, Grace Kelly and the Duchess of Windsor – he stayed up all night to sew the black coat she wore to the Duke’s funeral. Although he never lacked wealthy customers, he was uncomfortable with the extravagant showmanship of couture from the mid-1970s: the “impossible, crazy clothes” that did not “think about the life of a woman”, and were careless, almost contemptuous, of textiles. He remained commercially astute, selling his perfumes to the Veuve Cliquot champagne brand in 1981, and the couture house in 1988 to the LVMH luxury conglomerate, which later acquired the perfumes, too. Givenchy kept his patience, just, with LVMH’s head, Bernard Arnault, until his formal retirement in 1995, and thereafter spoke of Arnault’s designer appointments (including John Galliano and Alexander McQueen) with distant politeness. “C’est la vie,” he told commiserators. “Happily, for many years we had a wonderful time, beautiful fabric, beautiful people.” He had long since set up an alternative life as an “amateur d’art”, buying from artists he had met, Miró, Picasso and the sculptor Diego Giacometti. His real passion, though, was for the very best French furniture of the late 17th and early 18th centuries, and over the decades his Paris apartment became a miniature Versailles. But he sold his collection in 1993 – too museum-like – and lived mostly in Le Jonchet, his manor house near Tours, with its gardens edged by 36,000 box bushes and its white roses in memory of Hepburn.

I may have involuntarily joined in a couple of times: an unabashedly contrived story of a sweet, “straight-acting” high-schooler (lovable dreamboat Nick Robinson) drawn out of the closet when he strikes up an anonymous email friendship with another secretly gay schoolmate, Love, Simon is entirely adorable. “Adorable” is not a word we often use when discussing LGBT cinema, even at its most swooningly romantic. Films like Carol, Moonlight and Call Me by Your Name may make our eyes well up and our hearts beat a bit faster as their onscreen lovers come together, but there’s an undertow of tragedy – latent or narrowly averted – to their stories of love across (or against) social boundaries that staves off the “awwwwws”, that cuts deeper than cuteness, that leaves you thinking as much of loss and loneliness as romantic gratification when you leave the cinema. Love, Simon is a different proposition in pretty much every respect. A gay teenage romcom from mass-market TV titan Greg Berlanti, it’s affecting and heartsore in all the right places, but comforting above all: you leave it with the same light wine-spritzer buzz you get from Bridget Jones’s Diary or 13 Going on 30, though its adolescent target audience shouldn’t even be that inebriated. Like Call Me by Your Name, it tells the story of a winsome 17-year-old boy awakening to his alternative sexuality, but where Luca Guadagnino’s louchely sensual film was made for festivals and arthouses, Berlanti’s clean-cut, decidedly un-queer one was made for malls and multiplexes: it’s largely sexless, edgeless and no peaches were harmed in the course of its production. So why does Love, Simon feel, in its own uncool, milk-and-Oreos way, momentous – more so, if anything, than Guadagnino’s Oscar-winner? Partly, of course, it’s a matter of simple precedent, or lack thereof: the Fox release is the first major-studio film ever to centre on young gay romance, not an insubstantial milestone at a time when Hollywood, made dizzy by talk of black panthers and inclusion riders, is being forced to reassess its standards of representation. But there are a number of ways Love, Simon could have been made and styled, and Berlanti opts for the safest, bringing to it the slick, brightly lit, hugs-and-tears sensibility of his TV empire – with less darkness even than his current hit Riverdale. It’s full of soapy conflict and teaching moments; as Simon’s parents, Jennifer Garner and Josh Duhamel both get to deliver dewy-eyed monologues on the preciousness of love and acceptance and family that resemble Michael Stuhlbarg’s climactic Call Me By Your Name speech as filtered through Chicken Soup For the Soul, and leave you dewy-eyed in turn. Even its soundtrack is produced by Jack Antonoff, current hitmaker for the likes of Taylor Swift: its hoody-wearing hero might fancy himself an offbeat rebel for listening to The Kinks, but the film is pure pop down its Converse-clad toes. And yet there’s something strangely defiant – subversive, even – in that safeness: an assertion of mainstream identity that says LGBT storytelling has earned the right to be as naff and as conventional and as unconflicted as its fluffiest straight counterpart. Love, Simon is not entirely blinkered to the daily challenges and hostilities faced by the LGBT community even in a more enlightened age – bullying tenses up its narrative at cruelly direct and micro-aggressive levels – but – but it’s a film more preoccupied with happiness, togetherness and the rush of a first kiss, just as countless teen date movies have been for eons now. Most interestingly of all, it feels produced and packaged for an audience that won’t necessarily credit it as a milestone, for which its love story should feel as normal and unremarkable as its popcorn-movie presentation. Berlanti has attempted to normalise the gay romantic comedy before, albeit with a more mature target market: 2000’s middle-of-the-road The Broken Hearts Club, centred on a circle of amiable gay friends in West Hollywood, was unusual at the time both for the casual familiarity it presumed of its audience, and for the relatively wholesome portrait it painted of a culture still largely depicted in Hollywood as sexually deviant and Aids-shadowed. But it remained a niche item, confined to the arthouse circuit despite being scarcely edgier than an episode of Ally McBeal and grossing just £1.5 million worldwide. Love, Simon, meanwhile, will be getting a wider release than Berlanti’s first film could ever have dreamed of, and it remains to be seen if children of the 21st century will even rally around it: it might be that the film seems more essential or remarkable to a generation of gay men that, like Berlanti, didn’t have any Love, Simons to mirror their own adolescent crises growing up. Writing for Time, Daniel D’Addario wondered if the film has missed its cultural moment: “Kids like Simon, in 2018, already have a good shot of fitting in. They don’t need this movie.” That might be over-idealising a world in which youthful homosexuality still meets with ugly opposition in many cultures, and underselling the personal difficulty of coming out even in the most favourable circumstances, which Love, Simon depicts with some clarity and compassion. As Simon tells his digital penpal in voiceover, he ultimately knows his friends and family will embrace him either way, but that still doesn’t make it a cinch. I’d like to think some nervously closeted high-schoolers will go to see Love, Simon and feel seen in turn, and maybe a little emboldened by its pat happy ending – one that follows a run of recent films, including Carol and God’s Own Country, in reversing the tragic arc that was once standard in LGBT cinema, but with fewer compromises and qualifiers in its hero’s sparkly future. Others might well greet it with a shrug, but that may itself be a kind of victory, or at least a turning point. If, years from now, cornball feelgood crowdpleasers about LGBT characters are commonplace in our multiplexes, and Love, Simon is remembered – if at all – only for having preceded the lot of them, then Berlanti’s gratifyingly, unchallengingly adorable film will have done its job. Love, Simon is out in US cinemas on 16 March and in the UK on 6 April"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/mar/12/football-jamie-carragher-spat","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-12T17:57:21Z","webTitle":"Football as the beautiful game is dead.

Jamie Carragher spat on its grave","bodyText":"Spitting is now the scourge of football, the sport’s most offensive act. Worse even than elbowing, foul language, butting, brawling, kung-fu kicking and using your hand to deny England’s brave boys their World Cup destiny. It is the beautiful game’s deadliest of sins. Did I say beautiful game? Rarely a week goes by when football’s big-money age fails to parade its ugliness to a horrified world. Depositing a trail of saliva on an opponent is hardly a new development – the image of the German player Rudi Völler’s mullet harbouring phlegm from Dutchman Frank Rijkaard during a 1990 World Cup clash lives in the memory. But this week’s uncouth act by Jamie Carragher – who spat through the window of a car carrying a teenager on Sunday after Manchester United’s win against Liverpool – symbolises football’s deterioration into a soulless enterprise. Spitting is bad enough when directed at a rival player. Directed at football fans, it is far worse. The former Liverpool defender might be a well-paid pundit – although not for much longer if Sky’s suspension turns into a sacking, despite his frantic apologies – but his spitting shame must be seen as the latest symptom of the contempt displayed by the superstars of the modern game for the men, women and children who pay preposterous amounts of money to watch them kick a ball around for an hour and a half each week. Further evidence of the disappearance of football’s original, Corinthian values was provided by the ugly scenes at West Ham’s new London Stadium on Saturday, when fans stormed the pitch and menaced their directors after losing to Burnley. It was fitting, in its way, that these antics diverted attention from a tribute to the great West Ham captain Bobby Moore, as he more than anyone else epitomised those values and would not recognise today’s game. In more innocent times, punk rock fans gobbed at their heroes on stage. I remember a spoof “Gob of the month” competition on the 1980s satirical TV show Not the Nine O’Clock News. But much has changed since then, and spitting today gets under so many people’s skin not only because it might transmit infection, but also because it carries a degree of psychological insult and is seen as the ultimate gesture of contempt. While Carragher’s man-of-the-people persona was carefully cultivated, his disgrace is just another reminder of the chasm between Premier League clubs and their fans. Since there is a mandatory suspension for any player found to have spat at someone during a match, Carragher should, at the very least, be banned from TV for the rest of the season. His actions tell us more than his punditry has to date. It’s a sorry reminder that the game of Moore, Bobby Charlton and Bobby Robson has been hijacked by an arrogant elite. • Anthony Clavane is a sportswriter and the author of Moving the Goalposts: A Yorkshire Tragedy"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"science/2018/mar/12/rosalind-franklin-plaque-can-inspire-women-scientists","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-12T17:46:42Z","webTitle":"Rosalind Franklin plaque can inspire women scientists | Brief letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/mar/12/rosalind-franklin-plaque-can-inspire-women-scientists","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2018/mar/12/rosalind-franklin-plaque-can-inspire-women-scientists","fields":{"headline":"Rosalind Franklin plaque can inspire women scientists","bodyText":"I enjoyed Brian Cox’s lively tour of sites of scientific discoveries (Travel, 10 March), but there was a glaring omission.

Awesome house!” He lists the other investors who are turning this remote Utah community into a crucible of “generational ideology, innovation and entrepreneurship”. Richard Branson will have a house here, and so will the world’s most powerful marketing executive, Martin Sorrell. The Hollywood producer Stacey Sher and the actor Sophia Bush will be their neighbours, as will Miguel McKelvey, a co-founder of WeWork, and the renowned technology investor and author of The 4-Hour Work Week, Tim Ferriss. The audacious real estate project – branded Powder Mountain – is becoming a mecca for altruistically minded members of the global elite. “The goal will always remain the same,” says Elliott Bisnow, Rosenthal’s business partner: “To be a beacon of inspiration and a light in the world.” Bisnow, Rosenthal and three friends, all entrepreneurs in their 30s, dreamed up the scheme after spending years running Summit, an exclusive gathering described by insiders as a “Davos for millennials”. Applicants to Summit are screened and interviewed to ensure they display the correct “psychographic” (or mindset) for the events. It is pitched as an entertaining ideas festival, comparable to TED and Burning Man, featuring speakers such as Quentin Tarantino, Jane Fonda, Peter Thiel and Jeff Bezos. Guests pay $3,000-$8,000 (£2,200-£5,800) for access to three-day flagship events, hosted everywhere from beaches in Tulum, Mexico, to cruise ships in the Caribbean. Having finessed the art of persuading rich people to pay to join these getaways, the founders convinced their friends to help them buy an entire mountain in Utah, complete with 10,000 acres of some of the best ski terrain in the US. They bristle at the idea that they’re trying to build a high-altitude utopia for plutocrats, but then casually refer to a segment of their clientele as “the billionaire set” – and don’t hesitate to mention that their mountain happens to be located between towns named Eden and Paradise. The beautiful surroundings and unique blend of people, Rosenthal believes, will create the “exponential opportunities of the future”. “I have this whole rap with Gertrude Stein, Katharine Graham, De’ Medici, Bauhaus. There’s this rich history of groups coming together, where the whole is more than the sum of the parts, right?” he says. “I think that’s what’s happening here.” Such hype might seem detached from reality, but it is much in vogue among the technology sector’s new generation of millionaires and billionaires, who seem keen to distance themselves from the selfish excess of their predecessors from 1980s Wall Street. They show less interest in super-yachts or sports cars; instead they speak about spiritual enrichment, connections to nature and purpose. It is against this backdrop that countless Summit-like festivals, retreats and communities have emerged in and around California, promising to help wealthy clients find a better version of themselves. Further Future, a gathering in the Nevada desert attended by the ex-Google CEO Eric Schmidt, which has been described as “Burning Man for the 1%”, promises a culture of “mindful optimism, wonder and exploration”. Scott Kriens, the chairman of the technology multinational Juniper Networks, recently opened a retreat for self-improvement and introspection in a redwood forest near Santa Cruz, California, recognising that, despite its great advances, the internet “did not help people connect to themselves”. And Esalen, an institute perched on a cliff in Big Sur that has been a magnet for a bohemian set searching for spiritual enlightenment for half a century, is now directly courting guilt-laden tech executives. “The CEOs, inside they’re hurting,” the director, Ben Tauber (a former Google product manager), recently said of his clients. “They wonder if they’re doing the right thing for humanity. These are questions we can only answer behind closed doors.” Summit prides itself on its progressive “content”, with talks about global warming, inequality, racial divisions and the war in Syria, but there is a celebrity draw, with talks such as “Jessica Alba on defying expectations” and “Andre Agassi on scaling change”. During the February weekend I attend (a smaller retreat on the mountain, which costs around $2,000), there are only three talks, each lasting an hour; the remaining three days are spent skiing, snowshoeing, eating and drinking, relaxing in yoga or spa sessions, or partying in crowded hot tubs. For all its intellectual bravado, a big appeal of Summit has always been recreational. Food is provided by Michelin-starred chefs, and top musicians are flown in for dance parties; the Summit crowd contains a dedicated contingent of Burning Man aficionados, known as “Burners”, who are adept at adding fuel to the festivities. (Rick Glassman, a comedian flown from LA for a 10-minute set, prompts howls of laughter when he says Summit had taught him that “everyone does mushrooms”.) The gatherings are also notoriously fruitful networking opportunities; Rosenthal had told me I would be immersed in a community of “polymaths” and “savants”, but they would be a humble bunch. “If people are really like ‘oooh’, showing off, showing you pictures of their supercars or some shit at the dinner table? Probably not a cultural fit at Summit,” he says. “What superstars do you know, who you interact with, who are self-aggrandising these days? I don’t know anybody that walks around pumping their own chest when they’ve accomplished something – at least in our generation. It’s just, like, unnecessary.” Like others, I had been quietly schooled in the unwritten social rules. Asking someone what they do is considered a faux pas (the socially acceptable alternative is “What is your passion?”). Business cards, I was warned, should not be exchanged in a brazen way. After dinner one night, I meet an investment banker, two venture capitalists, a famous TV host, a sex coach, a cannabis entrepreneur, a man who claimed to have developed a new method for brewing coffee, and Facebook’s head of counter-terrorism. Most of them are talkative, extrovert types, but none of them seems out of the ordinary. The highlight of the weekend is a presentation about the search for extraterrestrial life, led by Kiko Dontchev, an engineer from SpaceX, who explains why his boss Elon Musk wants to “make life interplanetary”. “Earth is the only place that we have right now, so if we want to guarantee the existence of the human race beyond the next 100 or 200 years, it is really important for us to become a multiplanetary species,” Dontchev says, as his audience, packed into a yurt-like lodge on the summit of the mountain, nods approvingly. The presentation opens and closes with a video Dontchev shot four days earlier to capture his ecstatic reaction as Falcon Heavy’s rocket boosters successfully returned to their landing docks in Florida. The audience bursts into frenzied applause. “Yeah baby!” one man shouts. Another quietly shows off a text message he’s received from the Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, who has a rival spaceflight company. I ask an astronomer, who appears on stage with Dontchev, who exactly might colonise Mars in the event that Earth becomes uninhabitable. “Unfortunately, I think, the same way it always happens,” she says. “The people with power and money.” Later, I ask Bisnow if he has any interest in living on another planet. “Not in the slightest bit,” he says. “I’m really, really interested in Earth. I mean, Mars is horrible, it is really a bad scene out there. Like, I’m gonna go live in a bubble on Mars?” The story of how Bisnow and his friends – Rosenthal, Ryan Begelman, Jeremy Schwartz and Brett Leve – came to occupy their bubble on a mountaintop in Utah has become something of a legend. It began in 2008, when Bisnow, with the boundless confidence of a 23-year-old businessman, cold-called entrepreneurs he admired and invited them on an all-expenses-paid trip to Utah. Bisnow shouldered the cost of the 19-strong gathering on his credit card, then repeated the trick with another get-together in Mexico, racking up $75,000 in debt. Bisnow and the others quickly coalesced a sort of “mutual aid society” for young, well-connected businessmen, which in the early days included the co-founders of Twitter and Facebook and the real-estate heiress Ivanka Trump. Soon, Bisnow and his friends were running dozens of closed-door events dedicated to creating “positive impact” – and hosting their flagship conferences on cruise voyages that sailed from Miami to the Bahamas. Those events acquired a reputation as booze cruises for white, male tech bros, so a few years ago Summit decided it was time for a rebrand. They introduced cheaper tickets for women to improve the gender ratio, and abandoned the Caribbean for a more down-to-earth location: Los Angeles. “Not Santa Barbara. Not Beverly Hills,” Rosenthal says. “But downtown LA – where you’re literally in the throes of gentrification and homelessness.” For years the team worked remotely in Amsterdam, Tel Aviv, New York, Miami and Barcelona. They would combine work with snowboarding in Montana and surfing in Nicaragua. But by late 2011, the friends were approaching 30 and starting to travel less. They were living and working out of a mansion in Malibu and, Rosenthal recalls, hosting “amazing dinners that became pretty culturally significant in LA at that time”. It was around this time they heard from a Utah-based venture capitalist that Powder Mountain was for sale and hatched a plan to transform their considerable social capital into real estate. The plan was enacted months later, after a gathering they hosted in Lake Tahoe. They chartered a Boeing 737 and flew about 75 of their wealthier patrons from northern California to a tiny airport in Utah’s Ogden Valley. From there, it was just a short drive to the top of Powder Mountain. They arrived in time for sunset, lit a bonfire in the snow and laid out their vision. Each investor who helped them buy the mountain would receive a plot of land – and, assuming the plan worked, their money back at a future date. They bought the mountain for $40m in 2013, but it is only in recent months that the wooden shells of the first 26 properties have mushroomed out of the mountainside, along with roads, bridges and ski lifts. Much to the frustration of some locals, machines have been drilling wells deep into the mountain in search of water. One day there will be 500 homes on the mountain, and a village with coffee shops, juice bars, restaurants, a sound studio and a five-star hotel. Rosenthal takes me on a driving tour of the mountain, to explain how they plan to create a community that is different from exclusive resorts such as Aspen, Colorado. Restrictions prevent anyone from building a home larger than 4,500 sq ft, and residents must use vetted architects to ensure that their home is “subservient to the land” and in a style that has been called “heritage modernism”. “None of the architecture should express taste or wealth,” Rosenthal says, nodding to the spot that will become a central promenade. “That is a very walkable main street – we will have soft Italian kerbs.” I steer the conversation to the subject of how utterly detached from the real world elites seem to have become. “Elitism, the way I would define it, is obtainable,” he replies. “All that stands between you and being elite is your own investment in yourself.” I tell Rosenthal that I’ve met many people in America who work as hard as him and his friends – harder, in fact – but struggle to make ends meet. He acknowledges that he’s benefited from considerable advantage, but insists we now live in an era in which “the internet is the great equaliser”. “What are you doing to create the utility for yourself? Are you introducing people so they can collaborate?” he says. Struggling Americans, he adds, might want to “host a dinner. Invite 10 strangers. See what happens.” Rosenthal presses on with his thesis, telling me there are just not enough people in the world who will “excessively commit their lives to something. Journalism, cheese, automobiles, whatever. Rocket ships – perfect example. Everyone wants to work at SpaceX, no one wants to go to engineering school.” We drive to the top of the mountain. Rosenthal reflects on its future. “Is a great album going to be recorded here?” he asks. “Is the film-maker of our time going to think of the movie they’ll make? Will a company get formed that becomes the next Google?” He adds: “It’s just sort of an endless pool of opportunity for the world at large.” Altruism is a powerful marketing brand, and Rosenthal and his friends have become experts at using the idea to promote their business. But when I ask exactly what they’ve been doing for the public good outside of their conferences, little appears to be happening. Summit is quick to say that it raised $500,000 to help the Nature Conservancy to protect marine life, but that was partly an effort to compensate for the damage caused by their Caribbean cruises. Now that their flagship conferences are being held in LA, Rosenthal tells me the company provides “50,000 meals to the unfed” in the city. (When I look into this claim, I discover the donation actually involved 30,000 meals for families displaced by California wildfires – and they were paid for by the LA Chargers football team, not Summit.) Four years ago, Summit created a much-touted not-for-profit company, to be “more intentional” about its social and philanthropic action. The Summit Institute helps fund scholarships for people who could otherwise not attend events, and hosts workshop events for NGOs and charities. The institute’s co-director, Kathy Roth-Douquet, declines to tell me her budget, but estimates it is “maybe around the couple of hundred thousand-dollar level – if that”. The Summit Action Fund, by comparison, which is a “boutique venture capital fund” for the friends to invest in startups such as Uber and the sunglasses company Warby Parker, was valued at $25m. Still, several Summit aficionados tell me that the community’s professed commitment to improving the world is the very thing that sucked them in. Rameet Chawla, the chief executive of an app-designing company, told me there’s “definitely a Kool-Aid” around the notion of impact at Summit. “I would say I’m happy to drink it.” Chawla is a minor celebrity on Instagram. Several years ago, he created a stir with the launch of an app called Lovematically that automatically “liked” every post on a user’s feed. He’s also an accomplished technologist who has designed software for companies such as Coca-Cola, American Express and Porsche. When I hitch a ride in Chawla’s SUV, he tells me how he came to invest in Powder Mountain. He had just been on a disappointing trip to Verbier, a resort in the Swiss Alps where the food was “not that progressive”. Utah, he says, made for a refreshing change. “I bumped into 30 of my friends. I didn’t have to do anything. The food was amazing,” he says. “There was a moment when they served coconut water.” Coconut water was the very thing he’d been craving in Switzerland. At that moment, he thought to himself, “These guys just get me.” He adds: “I thought, you know what, I’d love to support this project.” But it was an experience on a Summit cruise ship that Chawla says made the biggest impression. He was on the deck, casually talking to the founder of a not-for-profit company whose career had been devoted “to building schools in Africa or something like that”. “I felt so embarrassed to say, ‘Oh, I run a technology company, I build apps.’ It was just so purposeless. It felt so selfish, what I was doing.” Chawla says the first thing he did when he got off the boat was set up his own (now defunct) not-for-profit company: Charity Swear Box. It was a website connected to Twitter that would monitor how often a user swears in their tweets, and recommend they make a donation to charity. “I would have never spent the time and effort to do that had I not come to Summit,” he says. I tell Chawla I’ve heard he’s opening a secret hotel in the Hudson Valley, New York state. “How did you know that?” he asks, a little startled. “It’s not so secret if everyone starts talking about it!” He tells me about the 250 acres filled with “cute cottages and homes and greenhouses and plants and vegetables” where guests can stay for about $525 (£380) a night. He wants them to learn about food, farming and nutrition, and plans to be “diverse enough” to appeal to a wide array of clients. “I’m going for the corporates, and then I’m going for the yogis,” he says. The secrecy, he explains, is intended to “play with the idea of frustration … There’s no published photos of the hotel. The public can’t book it. So you have to email and mention who you know that’s connected to the property. Then you can come.” Bisnow invites me to his cabin. It is the only finished property, a chic, minimalist space with a stove suspended from the ceiling and a ladder that Bisnow asks me to climb so we can talk in his favourite spot: a cubbyhole tucked into the ceiling. The five Summit co-founders describe themselves as equal partners, and all have equity in the company that bought the mountain, but Bisnow is the linchpin – only he sits on the board. “It feels very womb-like when you look out of the window here,” he says, watching wind turn the snow into dust. He points to a wooden structure cloaked in tarpaulin beyond the trees. “That’s Martin Sorrell’s house right there.” Bisnow wonders aloud what will happen when his neighbour moves in. Perhaps Sorrell and his wife will just treat the place like a second home, he says. But Bisnow envisages “another path” in which Sorrell, one of the highest-paid chief executives in the UK, “really gets the mission” and rents out his home for a few months a year – or maybe even allows low-income artists to stay in it for nothing. “Suddenly this becomes a really incredible place that’s accessible, open, affordable,” Bisnow says. “It could go in either direction.” His other close neighbour will be Richard Branson, who he calls his “hero”. Much like Branson, Bisnow benefited from supportive and well-connected parents. His mother, Margot Machol Bisnow, is the author of a parenting guide entitled Raising an Entrepreneur. His father, Mark Bisnow, gave a real-world example of how a parent might go about doing just that when he made Elliott, who dropped out of college, a co-founder in his business. (The family business, Bisnow, which produces real estate trade publications and events, was sold to a private equity firm in 2016 for a reported $50m.) I ask Elliott Bisnow if he has any regrets. He replies: “Just so much of my life being part of the problem. For so many years, just going through the world in a kind of ignorant, not thoughtful, not present way. Not listening. Not learning. Not caring about my surroundings. Just caring about me. And my success. And being like the prototypical capitalist. It’s, like, so lame.” He tells me he’s “still evolving”. He’s been meditating, reading, learning about ecology and sustainable farming. If Bisnow is committed to altruism, why is the Summit Institute, the not-for-profit wing of his empire, so minuscule, with an annual budget that is a fraction of what it cost to build his house? “We’ve just been so busy with so many things, we thought there’s no rush,” he replies. “Why not just slowly ramp it up?” I tell Bisnow that his alpine town for wealthy elites could be perceived as dangerously detached and exclusive. He says he’s “really not into exclusive communities”, before taking a few moments to mull the meaning of the word exclusive. “It is one of those words like ‘luxury’ or ‘utopia’,” he says. “It is one of those words that is very charged. Maybe there’s a yoga retreat for people who are really great at yoga, and I can’t get into it. Does that mean that it’s exclusive?” He tells me he’s open to the suggestion that his community is elitist – “these criticisms, there’s a truth to them” – and insists that he strives to make authentic connections with people from all walks of life. For example, he says, earlier in the day he met a worker at the ski resort who was taking guests on a tour. “I literally could have said, ‘All right, have an awesome tour,’ and instead I was like, ‘So, you’re here all year?’ And he goes, ‘No, I’m actually from New Orleans.’ And I’m like, ‘Really?’” Bisnow says he behaves the same way with servers in restaurants. “[When] you start to engage with these people you realise the humanity in everyone and how unbelievable they are.” Then he explains how he always sits in the front seat of Uber taxis, talking to dozens of drivers a week, hearing “the most remarkable stories”. He ends up hanging out “with a significant number” of his drivers. I ask how many Uber drivers he’s invited to Summit. He doesn’t say, but instead tells me an anecdote about a chef he invited to Summit after meeting him “at this dilapidated castle in England”. The conversation reminds me of so many I have had in and around San Francisco, in which millennials made rich through technology relay snippets of revelatory conversations they’ve had with Uber drivers, some of whom live and sleep in their cars. It is as though the taxi-sharing app is one of the last remaining cords keeping the new elites connected to everyone else’s world. When Uber rolls out its self-driving cars, even that fragile connection will be broken. There is shocking stratification in places such as San Francisco, I say; cities that seem increasingly detached from the real world. “It is a big problem,” he agrees. “That’s why a lot of successful people like living in New York, because in New York you’re just always in it. You just go down to Manhattan and you’re right there, back in society.” I get the sense that Bisnow doesn’t quite understand my point. But he insists he knows where I’m coming from. “It’s not good when the world forms bubbles and loses connections. But I feel like that’s unfortunately been a big part of the history of the world. As you become more successful, you get your house and your gate, and you move into your bubble and your friends, and you just totally lose connection. And I think that’s clearly what we’re seeing in front of us.” Contact the author: paul.lewis@theguardian.com • Commenting on this piece?

As part of the 4,000-home Mountfield Park development near Canterbury, Kent, there are plans to build a village that will have its own homes, shops and cafes. All of the residents will be people with dementia. It is being modelled on Hogeweyk, a dementia village near Amsterdam, whose inhabitants live in shared houses, have a supermarket, park cafe, cinema, village squares and gardens, as well as round-the-clock care if they need it. “What struck us was how unrecognisable the lives of those with dementia were at Hogeweyk compared with those I’ve met in England,” Simon Wright, the chief executive of developers Corinthian Land, told the Times. “A lot of nursing homes are based on a medical approach,” says Frank van Dillen, co-founder of Dementia Village Advisors and one of the architects who designed Hogeweyk. “We try to de-institutionalise that approach because people want to live as normally as possible.” So there is care and medication, but also everyday activities: “You want to go to a restaurant, do your own grocery shopping, sit in a bar, walk outside and meet people.” This could be beneficial to some, but not everybody, says Stacy Cannon of the Alzheimer’s Society. “Our work is about making any community anywhere dementia-friendly [so that people] can stay where they’ve lived all their lives. A lot of the principles they’re talking about are ones that can be applied to any community by people behaving in a different way, adapting their surroundings, looking at the policies of their organisations.” These could include increased awareness of simple things such as being patient if someone is struggling with their coins at the supermarket checkout, or improving signage around buildings. The Hogeweyk concept, Van Dillen points out, is coming up to 25 years old (it opened in 2009, but had been planned for years) and it isn’t necessarily right to replicate it across Europe. It’s expensive, at about €6,000 (more than £5,300) for each resident a month. “I often say the whole world is a dementia village,” he says, “and we have to make a lot of effort to include people with special needs in our normal society.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/mar/18/brompton-m6l-barbour-folding-bike-review-masterclass-in-precision","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-18T06:00:08Z","webTitle":"Brompton M6L Barbour review: ‘A masterclass in precision’ | Martin Love","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/mar/18/brompton-m6l-barbour-folding-bike-review-masterclass-in-precision","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/mar/18/brompton-m6l-barbour-folding-bike-review-masterclass-in-precision","fields":{"headline":"Brompton M6L Barbour review: ‘A masterclass in precision’","bodyText":"Brompton M6L Barbour edition Price: £1,350, cyclesurgery.com Frame and fork: steel Gears: 6 speed Saddle: Brooks Here’s a random fact about folding, courtesy of the well-thumbed copy of QI’s 1,227 Facts to Blow Your Socks Off which sits in our loo: “If you could fold a piece of paper 51 times, its thickness would exceed the distance from here to the sun.” Good one, eh? We love to fold, don’t we, and everything from picnic tables to high-velocity rifles has been fitted with hinges, so they could be collapsed into smaller, packable versions of themselves. Perhaps one of the strangest I’ve come across is the “foldable” canoe one of my friends created so that he could keep it in his cramped flat. Foldable is a bit of a misnomer as he simply sawed the craft in half and then fitted a series of worrying looking bolts to the join. The two halves now hang in his hall. Of course, in bike land, however, when it comes to creased cycles, one brand reigns supreme: the Brompton. It’s all small wheels and big business. Considering it is just a folding bike, it’s hard to believe quite how far the brand has integrated itself into the way we live. Today, a city street or a commuter train just wouldn’t look right without a couple of these dinky-wheelers curled up in the corner. Unlike almost any other bike you can think of, except perhaps a unicycle, the bike itself has its own distinct personality. It’s synonymous with a certain kind of smug metropolitanism. To ride one it’s best if you are called Will or Jonty, and probably best also if you didn’t do so well at uni because of, you know, rugger and beer and bants. They’re expensive and slightly ridiculous – like ski goggle tans or quilted coats for dogs. Playing up to type, Brompton has now created a special Barbour edition – who else? It’s finished in what’s called “Gloss Barbour Green” and is complemented with a waxed Tarras bag which clips on above the front wheel. This model features a new M-type handlebar which is more ergonomic over distance and comes with six gears so you can tackle hillier routes. It’s the country cousin to the city model, but it can still be folded up into a compact package, perfect for public transport – though somehow I get the feeling this bike will more often be slung into the back of a Range Rover than on to a crowded train. But don’t hold that against it. This Brompton, like all Bromptons, is a masterclass in precision engineering. It’s brilliantly designed with a specific function in mind – and it does that beautifully. It folds easily in less than a minute (the world record held by Thomas Ernst, a Brompton dealer from Zurich, is actually 5.19 seconds). It’s also great fun to ride. The commanding seating position and precise wheels make you feel like a trick cyclist. And it’s even quite comfortable over distance. A few years ago I rode from London to Brighton on a bright orange one without any issues at all. It’s hard to believe Brompton is now more than 40 years old. The first one was built in 1975 in the South Kensington bedroom of designer Andrew Ritchie. The London-based company has expanded worldwide, and now has stores in cities including London, Amsterdam, Beijing, Tokyo and Barcelona. Every Brompton is handmade in their London factory by skilled craftsman, who have undergone an intensive 18-month training programme and each have a unique signature which they stamp on the parts of the bike they work on. If you fancy a go, head to your nearest Cycle Surgery store. There, you can now test a Brompton for 72 hours for a fee of £30. If you buy the bike, they’ll knock that off the price. The shop will also give you a tutorial before taking the bike out – which I would definitely recommend. I’d also recommend you only take the test ride if you are serious about buying one. Because after a day or two you’ll find it very hard to return it – and before you know it you’ll be joining the folding classes. On your bike On Bike Building is a series of talks, demos, and displays between 1 April and the 27 May at the Barbican that showcase some of the UK’s leading frame-builders, including displays by Hartley Cycles, Isen Workshop and Saffron Frameworks; a live frame-building demonstration by the Bicycle Academy on 1 April; and a special panel discussion on 3 May featuring all of the frame builders involved in the series. The series is part of Make! – the Barbican Shop’s first ever season of events. Curated by the Barbican’s retail team in partnership with Crafts magazine, the season seeks to challenge people’s perceptions of craft by showcasing contemporary makers who are helping to redefine its meaning today. Many of the events are free. For further details and tickets, go to barbican.org.uk Baggage, no trouble Among the road riding community there are certain rules that can never be broken: number one among these is that a rack and pannier should not be fitted to a road bike. It wrecks the aesthetics, spoils the line of the bike and shows that you aren’t prepared to cycle with bulging pockets. Well that could all be about thanks to Tailfin’s revolutionary product. They have created a carbon pannier rack that will fit any bike, without tools, in a matter of seconds. It even clips on to frames without traditional pannier mounts and can safely by used on carbon frames. As far as I know there really is nothing else quite like this on the market. Applying high-end design principles to something as mundane as a bike rack elevates it from a workmanlike accessory to a biking essential. It’s strong, sleek and beautifully made. And you’ll never have a sweaty rucksack back again!

In it, I recorded everything that happened each day. Not in the outside world but to me, inside my own body. It was the only thing that seemed important enough to set down. “Lots of muscle spasms today,” I wrote on 20 February, pen pressed hard to the page. “Aches and twinges on my right side, getting more acute in the evening. Left leg still weak.” At the back of the diary were lists: girls’ names, US states, English counties – all written out alphabetically. While my days were spent obsessively monitoring my physical symptoms, the lists were getting me through the silent winter nights. Putting my brain to work on “Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas…” was a diversion tactic to stave off the worst of the panic. It was two miscarriages and their medical investigations that turned my mind inward until I could do nothing but mentally scan my body, looking for trouble. I was told I had endometriosis and an underactive thyroid, and this completely wrong-footed me. If my body had kept this from me, what else was it harbouring in its darkest corners? OK, I’d been watching a lot of Game of Thrones, but I felt like an unpopular queen in a court of traitors. My body had become a thing apart from me, capable of keeping secrets. Adding to my paranoia was the fact that I’d written about miscarriage and madness in a novel before I got pregnant. Had I brought this on myself, or were the gods punishing me? (“You wanted some good material, love? Try this.”) I’d been afraid before – mainly in airports, waiting to board – but that was a price I was occasionally willing to pay for some sun. This fear, though, didn’t slink away on landing; it was with me all the time. Nothing felt benign any more, not even a sunny morning at home with my dogs. I couldn’t read, I couldn’t write, I couldn’t sit still, I couldn’t be on my own. One evening, the room around me shifted like a glitch in the matrix and I wondered if any of it was real. “I just want to get back to myself,” I wailed to my husband, who wasn’t much less frightened than me. “But what if I can’t?” Danger stalked me everywhere. Every time I turned on the TV, I was besieged by hospital documentaries. Characters in books were struck down with horrible diseases. I couldn’t even go for a nice walk – once a reliable cure-all – because I was so frightened I had multiple sclerosis that I dreaded every step. There was a really bad day when I put on some music and danced on the spot, to prove to myself that my brain was still talking to my limbs. I sobbed with fear as I did it, the dogs looking on with concerned bemusement, and told myself that this would be funny one day. And it is funny. And it isn’t, because I can still remember how much nerve it took to do it, even as I offer it up as a cheap anecdote. Health anxiety is an epidemic estimated to cost the NHS £420m every year. While hypochondria is an age-old affliction (Charles Darwin and Marcel Proust had it), we are now mercilessly assisted by the internet. I had hoped “Dr Google” would throw up some irrefutable proof that I didn’t have whichever disease I was petrified of that day. Instead, I discovered a raft of new symptoms that my body cunningly reproduced within 24 hours. The single best thing I did in the quest to feel normal again was to keep a promise to my mum to “stop looking at those bloody websites”. My real flesh-and-blood GP, when I went to see her, was great – sensible and kind. I hate to think of anxious people going to those Hollywood-style doctors who dish out medication like sweets, because I wanted all the drugs I could get my hands on then – to soothe my fractious body and feel as little as possible. And there was a lot to numb: bone aches, pins and needles, shooting pains, dizziness, palpitations, muscle spasms, body jolts… My shoulder muscles were so rock-hard with tension that I couldn’t lie on either side. My GP agreed to prescribe a week’s worth of sleeping pills because not sleeping when I was used to nine hours was making me feel even more mad: wired, disordered and utterly wrung-out from all the adrenaline that was burning around my system like battery acid. That night, I took a single pill and dropped fathoms-deep into a dark, blissful slumber that went some way to calming my hair-trigger nervous system. The deal with the sleeping pills and antidepressants I’d argued for and got, was that I also signed up for some cognitive behavioural therapy. Face-to-face sessions on the NHS came with a waiting list of four to six months, but if I was willing to try phone CBT, then I only had to wait a few weeks. It was my counsellor, Sam, who gently suggested I give up the diary. “I think it might be making you obsess more,” she said. Another piece of “homework” was to try to stop asking for reassurance. It turned out to be just like any other craving: if I held off for a few minutes, the urge ebbed away. When I managed a whole day without asking my husband if I was walking oddly, I felt as though a fragment of my old, equable self had been restored to me. Mindfulness, though I’d previously filed it in the same drawer as chakras and homeopathy, was helpful, too. My epiphany was understanding that anxiety wasn’t me, it was something happening to me. Instead of being consumed by it, I managed to hollow out a crucial inch of space between it and me. I’d been out in the storm and now I was watching it through the window. Instead of fighting the fear tooth and nail, I practised a rueful roll of the eyes: “Oh, here’s that old devil anxiety again, up to his usual tricks.” And slowly, slowly, that’s what it became: a series of threadbare illusions I could see right through. A year ago, I couldn’t wait for 2018. If I got there in one piece, it meant I’d been wrong about being ill. But I see now that a bigger fear lurked beneath the hypochondria. What if my old sleep-loving, fast-walking self had abandoned me for ever? What if I could no longer be a writer because my imagination had become a dangerous place to be? And yet here I am, writing about it in the past tense. I still occasionally feel the anxiety sidle up, clammy fingers fumbling for a way in, but I’m wise to it now. Or wiser, anyway. I know it’s time to go out in the fresh air, arrange to see people, turn off my laptop. I am here, chastened but well. How to cope with anxiety Remember that anxiety itself can create a myriad of frightening physical symptoms. They’re horrible but they won’t hurt you. If your GP tells you to pull yourself together, go to a different one. Try not to feel guilty for being a nuisance or because other people really do have the illnesses you’re worried about. You can’t help it and you’re doing your best to put yourself back together. Turn sabotaging thoughts into hard evidence by writing down everything that supports your self-diagnosis and everything that doesn’t. The second column forces you to apply some objective logic. Avoid alcohol and caffeine. The jittery effects of too much coffee should make it an obvious no-no, but alcohol is tempting for its ability to loosen tense muscles. The hungover paranoia the next day is just not worth it, though. Get out in the world. If you work from home, go to a co-working space at least once a week, just to be among other people. Talk to the people you trust. It’s nothing to be ashamed of and they will want to be there for you. My family and friends were brilliant even when they didn’t know what to say. Stay off the internet.

As more details emerged regarding the Sunday incident, Richard Vance told investigators a bag may have struck the emergency fuel shutoff button on the Eurocopter AS350, a law enforcement official told CNN. Separately, a passenger on a similar helicopter flight questioned the rigour of safety procedures under operator Liberty Helicopters. The aircraft landed in the water at about 7pm. Vance was the sole survivor. In a radio transmission released after the crash, the pilot can be heard saying “Mayday, mayday, mayday” and “East river engine failure”. Video taken by a bystander showed the red helicopter descending slowly into the water, before listing on to its right-hand side. Vance was able to free himself and was rescued by a tugboat. The passengers were identified on Monday as Daniel Thompson, 34, and Tristan Hill, 29, from New York; Trevor Cadigan and Brian McDaniel, both 26, from Dallas; and Carla Vallejos Blanco, 29, from Argentina. The helicopter had been privately chartered for a photoshoot, officials said. Eric Adams, a travel journalist based in Pennsylvania, said on Sunday night he had been on a similar flight which took off soon after the helicopter that crashed. The helicopter was a “doors-off” flight, Adams said, meaning the sides of the craft were open to the elements. Passengers on such flights, able to take pictures in the open air, are strapped into their seats tightly. Adams said he had the same safety briefing as the passengers on the crashed helicopter. It had lacked fundamental details, he said. “It was a doors-off flight, with harnesses,” Adams wrote on Twitter. “They would have been difficult to remove in an emergency, since you’re attached from the rear. “They provide knives to slice harnesses but didn’t physically point out where they were once we had them on. We had floatation [sic] devices too.” Liberty Helicopters did not respond to a request for comment. On Sunday night Adams posted photographs to Twitter of what he said was the helicopter minutes before it crashed. Cadigan posted a video to his Instagram story on Sunday which showed him in the helicopter, apparently during take off. ABC News reported that the helicopter entered the water around East 86th Street, near Manhattan’s Upper East Side. It then floated “a mile or two south”, officials told ABC, before emergency crews could bring it to a halt. Fire department of New York commissioner Daniel Nigro told reporters the helicopter turned upside down in the water, complicating recovery efforts. “One of the most difficult parts of the rescue were that five people were tightly harnessed,” Nigro said. “People had to be cut out.” The National Transport Safety Board was leading the investigation into the crash. On Monday, the agency said it was sending “14 NTSB personnel” to the site. The crash drew crowds to the waterfront. “It’s cold water,” witness Mary Lee told the New York Post. “It was sinking really fast. By the time we got out here, we couldn’t see it. It was underwater.” Another bystander, Susan Larkin, told the Associated Press she saw rescue boats in the river and a police helicopter hovering low over the water. Others reported seeing someone in the water, clinging to a flotation device. It is the third crash involving Liberty Helicopters in the past 11 years. In 2009, nine people were killed when a helicopter collided with a plane over the East river. Five Italian tourists and the pilot were onboard the helicopter and three people, one of them a child, were travelling in the plane. Two years earlier, one of Liberty’s helicopters fell 150m during another sightseeing trip. The pilot was able to land the aircraft safely in the Hudson river and help evacuate the seven passengers."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2018/mar/20/dead-mens-trousers-irvine-welsh-review-","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-20T06:59:33Z","webTitle":"Dead Men’s Trousers by Irvine Welsh – a last hurrah for Renton and company","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/mar/20/dead-mens-trousers-irvine-welsh-review-","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/mar/20/dead-mens-trousers-irvine-welsh-review-","fields":{"headline":"Dead Men’s Trousers by Irvine Welsh – a last hurrah for Renton and company","bodyText":"Irvine Welsh’s style is so pulpy nowadays that it’s hard to imagine Booker prize judges losing time arguing over his sexual politics, as they are said to have done before ruling out his 1993 debut, Trainspotting, for the misogyny of its heroin-addicted protagonist, Renton, and his fellow Edinburgh low-lifes, Begbie, Sick Boy and Spud. Welsh has since tended to play safer, softening the cynicism of that novel for preachier, more farcical capers that take care to turn the tables on their unreconstructed male leads (while still relying on them for tang). Somewhere along the way, though, the prose has grown uneven: much of Dead Men’s Trousers – a fifth and apparently last hurrah for Renton and company, now in middle age – unfolds in the kind of airport-thriller gush (champagne is a “bubbling elixir”; people don’t wear clothes but “sport” them) that’s now nearly as much a Welsh hallmark as his X-rated Scots (“Ah fuckin hate the way some American cunts call lassies cunts. Fuckin offensive, that shite”). Set in the run-in to the Brexit vote, the plot turns on the guilt of Renton, now reformed as a jet-setting DJ promoter, over cash he once stole from Begbie – who for his part has put thug life behind him to become a celebrated sculptor, albeit one prone to deadly rage if his doting wife and daughters aren’t around to witness it (as shown in 2016’s The Blade Artist). Sick Boy, meanwhile, has a new app-accessible escort agency to front his exploitation of underage girls; and Spud, dirt-poor, is ready to accept a job offer that involves smuggling a kidney to Germany via Istanbul. The scene where he winds up in a disused warehouse being operated on by Sick Boy, with only a YouTube tutorial for instruction – running on a laptop that’s low on power, with no charger – is one of several impressively hairy set pieces (others variously involve a samurai sword, an assault rifle and a sex tape unveiled over Christmas lunch). Yet, overall, jeopardy fizzles out as Welsh – a little in love with his own voice – swamps the action with rants about “neoliberal planet-rapists” and “monarchy-worshipping paedophile bastards”; more entertaining, at least, than gripes about long-haul flight – Welsh now lives in Miami – and online banking (“It disnae work so smoothly when you’re between countries”). Still, the grumpy-old-raver vibe does produce probably the book’s most blackly funny exchange, when Sick Boy – a pimp, remember – is aghast that Renton, whose star client wants to be the next David Guetta, should be “coining it in fae they fucking shit EDM DJs”. Like a superhero franchise, the Trainspotting universe gets a new origin story with every reboot. Skagboys showed how Renton’s initation into heroin came after police beat him up at Orgreave; The Blade Artist put Begbie’s bloodlust down to a teacher’s mismanagement of his boyhood dyslexia. The tweak in Dead Men’s Trousers is more meta: Trainspotting, it’s implied, was only published after Renton stole the manuscript from Spud and passed it off as his own. This nicely muddies Renton’s claim to be a reformed character – but only at the time-warping expense of having us believe that the original book was published in 2017 (and not 1993). It’s ultimately a mark of Welsh’s magic in having created such memorable characters in the first place that they survive this cartoonish revision. And to judge from hints that Begbie’s ever so slightly scary eldest daughter has one or two anger management issues of her own (Trainspotting: The Next Generation, anyone?), I wouldn’t bet on him leaving them for good any time soon. • Dead Men’s Trousers by Irvine Welsh is published by Jonathan Cape (£16.99).

The three-day week, the winter of discontent, Austin Allegros, punch-ups with the National Front, mutterings of rightwing coups, the Sex Pistols swearing on family TV. They included, to be sure, such now unavailable non-trivia as free higher education, affordable housing and a functioning health service. But it was a decade that, having flared into being in the psychedelic glow of its predecessor, embrowned itself into the tones of hessian and muesli and the guttering shadows of power cuts. It was the time when architectural modernism, imploding under the weight of self-doubt and external criticism, gave way to a meek “neo-vernacular” of bricks and pitched roofs. And then, in Norwich (to misquote the opening credits of the epoch’s epic game show, Sale of the Century), appeared an assured and beautiful statement of faith in the new: a shining shed on, if not quite a hill, this being Norfolk, at least an upward incline. The Sainsbury Centre for Visual Arts at the University of East Anglia, designed by the fortysomething architect Norman Foster, was, as he now says, based on “an optimistic view of the future”. The era’s mood of malaise and decay could only bounce off its aluminium hide. Next week, the building will celebrate its 40th birthday by housing Superstructures: the New Architecture 1960-1990, an exhibition on what came to be called “hi-tech”. Like most stylistic labels, hi-tech is one resisted and resented by the architects to whom it was applied. But, oversimplifying and sometimes misleading though it is, it serves a purpose in identifying what, then and now, was a distinct set of ideas pursued by a distinct set of architects. Foster was and is its most successful practitioner. His Norwich building can be expected to be the star of the show it will host. Hi-tech has yet to experience the nostalgic renaissance of interest enjoyed by brutalism, which came just before, or its approximate contemporary, postmodernism. This could be because, becoming widespread and prodigiously successful, it never went away. Its early clients tended to be companies that aspired to be progressive – IBM, for example – more than the institutions of the welfare state that kept an earlier generation in work. From here grew a business-friendly, socially concerned, cleaned-up image of modernity that especially suited the Clinton and Blair years. It became an officially favoured style for parliaments, national museums, bridges, skyscrapers and corporate headquarters, right down to the most expensive and majestic office complex ever built, Foster’s just-finished Apple Park in Silicon Valley. Most new airports derive from hi-tech precedents such as Stansted in Britain and Kansai in Osaka. The style’s main protagonists – Foster, Richard Rogers, Renzo Piano, Michael and Patty Hopkins, Nicholas Grimshaw – set up large, successful practices that, with continued input from their founders, are still going strong. Hi-tech was, or is, a broad set of social objectives – democratic workplaces, accessible art museums, transparent government, sustainable design – combined with a faith that modern building techniques could help achieve them, combined with an aesthetic fascination with the joints, surfaces and details that came with those techniques. Hi-tech architects favoured flexibility and changeability, promoting the notion of a building as a “kit of parts” that could be swapped around as needs must. Rather than last forever, as some architects wish for their work, buildings should adapt or die. Hi-tech architects’ preferred materials, especially in the early days, were steel, glass and aluminium, sometimes advanced plastics, that could be made in factories and delivered pristine to sites. They favoured big roofs – wide, column-free spans made possible by ambitious engineering, which would enclose fluid, multifarious and open-ended human activity. They enjoyed hanging things on wires. They liked to show their workings: through exposing pipes and services in the case of Piano and Rogers’ Pompidou Centre, complex structures at Grimshaw’s Eurostar terminal at Waterloo. Inspirations included the Crystal Palace of 1851 and Buckminster Fuller’s geodesic domes – Victorian and space age manifestations of the same kit-of-parts, big-roof idea. (And Foster now says that, if he could dine with one antecedent, it would be the former’s designer, Joseph Paxton.) Other influences were the British architectural thinker Cedric Price and the architectural group Archigram, who in their different ways challenged the notion that buildings should be fixed and monumental. Hi-tech, an overwhelmingly British phenomenon, was a manifestation, believes the exhibition’s curator, Jane Pavitt, of a pragmatic rather than a theoretical culture. Hi-tech combined pride in the past national glory of Paxton and Brunel with emulation of the new American energy of such things as California’s Case Study houses, which aimed to turn the power of industry to making better homes for all. What binds the Crystal Palace with California, says Foster (who, at 82, is training for his 25th Engadin cross-country ski marathon in Switzerland), is their “can-do attitude, the absolute utter determination to do it and not talk about it”. Performance, doing something difficult well, is a big part of hi-tech. There are contradictions in hi-tech architecture that have made it an easy target for criticism over the years. By presenting itself as pragmatic and analytical, for example, it looks foolish when it is not these things. It has difficulty admitting that it is concerned, as other architecture is, with look, image, style, theatre and symbol. These buildings don’t just want to fix problems with modern methods; they show you that they are doing this. They assume something unproven: that for a building to act in a certain way, it has to look that way too. “Festishisation of technology” is the accusation often levelled. “Nostalgia for the future” was another. In its desire to slip loose the surly bonds of Earth, to soar like a plane or float like a yacht, hi-tech can suffer pratfalls when it meets human reality. The reported hospitalisation of Apple Park staff who collided with its immaculate glass walls is the latest example. By scraping out the old idea that architecture should be about composing space, hi-tech can create voids that get invaded by kitsch and exploitation, such as the retail fungus that has engulfed Stansted airport. As some fine drawings in the exhibition will show, hi-tech buildings tend to be highly crafted – not the practical outcomes of industrial processes, but more updates on the British Arts and Crafts movement’s preoccupation with detail. Some, like the famous tower that Foster built for HSBC in Hong Kong, are as a result legendarily expensive. Others, the Sainsbury Centre included, have had technical problems that are more easily excused if a building is considered a work of art rather than a machine. They have a way of ending up as monuments after all, highly composed artefacts, as hard or easy to change as any other kind of building. The notion of swappable kits of parts is rarely achieved in practice: it is what Alfred Hitchcock called a MacGuffin, the ostensibly important plot device that allows the really interesting stuff to happen around it. Foster has heard such arguments before, which is probably why he wants to stress the social and environmental qualities of his early work ahead of its appearance. He likes to talk of the long-gone amenity building he created for the staff of the Fred Olsen shipping line, a miraculously fragile mirror-glass box in the clanging environment of London’s old docks, where dockers and management were treated equally to the same high-quality environment. Foster stresses that the Sainsbury Centre is a “celebratory social space” directed towards the landscape around it. “It doesn’t make a big song and dance about its services,” he says. He’s right that these objectives matter more than style. Yet if you take away the look of hi-tech, you remove much of what makes it distinctive. You also extract what many of its clients, who value look as well as function, want. It is the taut, pristine quality of the Sainsbury Centre – machine-made and highly tuned – that makes it stand out. Something similar could be said of the many of the best works of hi-tech – bold, crystalline, singular and rigorous even when perverse. MacGuffins they may be but, to misquote Cézanne on Monet, what MacGuffins. • Superstructures: the New Architecture 1960-1990 is at the Sainsbury Centre for Visual Arts, UEA, Norwich, from 24 March to 2 September"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2018/mar/12/john-oliver-last-week-tonight-cryptocurrency","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-12T16:00:50Z","webTitle":"John Oliver on cryptocurrency: 'You’re not investing, you’re gambling'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/mar/12/john-oliver-last-week-tonight-cryptocurrency","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2018/mar/12/john-oliver-last-week-tonight-cryptocurrency","fields":{"headline":"John Oliver on cryptocurrency: 'You’re not investing, you’re gambling'","bodyText":"John Oliver gave audiences a detailed introduction to the world of cryptocurrencies in this week’s episode of Last Week Tonight with a cautionary reminder of the pitfalls. On his HBO show, the British comic started by talking about bitcoin. “Everything you don’t understand about money combined with everything you don’t understand about computers,” he said as a description. Oliver covered the much-publicized rise of bitcoin in comparison to how it was viewed not long before. “Just a few years ago you’d only hear about bitcoin from that one guy in your office who wouldn’t shut up about it,” he said. But it’s not been without hiccups. “A bitcoin conference stopped taking bitcoin, which is a red flag since that’s the one place you’d think it would be accepted,” he said. “It’s like when I tried to pay for access to the Republican National Convention using Ronald Reagan’s dusty skeleton bones.” He expanded his discussion to cryptocurrency in general and spoke about how tokens are required to start one and how one company made $35m in 30 seconds after obtaining some. “Normally when someone makes that much money that fast they did it by walking up to Bill O’Reilly, sitting in silence for 26 seconds and saying ‘I recorded our phone calls’,” he joked. Oliver continued: “Many people are buying coins for no reason other than other people are buying them.” There have been a multitude of companies getting into the game yet some have already faltered. “I am not saying that every cryptocoin is a scam, just as I’m not saying that every blockchain company is bullshit,” he said. “What I am saying is: in a speculative mania, it can be very hard to tell which companies are for real.” He used an example of a company raising massive amounts of money via cryptocurrency without actually having an idea of what their business is yet. “The point is: if you choose to invest in the cryptocurrency space, just know that you’re not investing, you’re gambling. Which is fine, but you should know that is what you’re doing and prices do go down,” he said. He ended by warning: “The important thing to remember here is: this is a brand new, very complicated space and literally nobody knows how it’s going to develop so you need to be careful and I know that sounds boring.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/mar/14/sharp-rise-in-number-of-eu-nationals-applying-for-uk-citizenship","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-14T12:20:15Z","webTitle":"Sharp rise in number of EU nationals applying for UK citizenship","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/mar/14/sharp-rise-in-number-of-eu-nationals-applying-for-uk-citizenship","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/mar/14/sharp-rise-in-number-of-eu-nationals-applying-for-uk-citizenship","fields":{"headline":"Sharp rise in number of EU nationals applying for UK citizenship","bodyText":"The number of German, Italian and French nationals applying for British citizenship has more than trebled in three years as the impact of the Brexit referendum is felt, government data has revealed. Almost 30,000 EU nationals applied to become British citizens between June 2016 and June 2017, double the previous year. By volume, Poles topped the list of those seeking British citizenship in the past three years with just under 6,200 applying in the year to June 2017, up 44% on the previous year. The sharpest rise in applications was among Germans, whose applications jumped from 797 in the year to June 2016 to 2,338 in the year to June 2017. The number of Italians opting for citizenship rose from 1,109 to 2,950 for the same period, while the number of Spanish almost tripled from about 500 to approximately 1,400. The biggest jump in percentage terms was among Finnish people, although the volume of applicants was small at 220 – a jump of 255% on the previous year. Half of the 28,502 applications made in the year after the Brexit vote were made on residency grounds according to the figures provided by the Home Office under the Freedom of Information Act. A further 6,839 applications were made in the same period on behalf of minors, up 77% on the previous year and more than double the 2014-15 figure. The looming divorce between the EU the UK appears to have consolidated many continental relationships, with a sharp rise in EU nationals applying for citizenship through marriage. Numbers were more than double those recorded in each of the two years before the referendum, standing at 4,342. The uncertainty over Brexit has led to record numbers of EU27 nationals living in Britain trying to secure their status. Recent Home Office figures show that 168,913 permanent residence documents were issued in 2017, the highest ever number and twice the 65,068 issued the previous year. More recent headline figures from the Home Office show the number of citizenship applications for British citizenship from EU27 nationals has not dimmed: in the full year 2017 there were 38,528 applications, two-and-a-half times the 2016 figure (15,460). Compared with overall numbers of EU citizens living in the UK, those opting for British citizenship remains very small. Latest ONS data shows there are 907,000 Polish-born citizens in the UK, 299,000 Germans, 220,000 Italians, 164,000 French and 157,000 Spanish. Just over 15,000 of the citizenship applications made in the year after the Brexit referendum were made on the basis of residence in the UK, a 61% rise on the year before the EU referendum. To become naturalised, EU citizens need to have been resident in the UK for five years if the application is being made on residence grounds. Naturalisation costs £1,282."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2018/mar/12/goldman-sachs-harvey-schwartz-ceo-david-solomon","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-12T20:10:35Z","webTitle":"Goldman Sachs' Harvey Schwartz exits, clearing way for new CEO","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/mar/12/goldman-sachs-harvey-schwartz-ceo-david-solomon","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/mar/12/goldman-sachs-harvey-schwartz-ceo-david-solomon","fields":{"headline":"Goldman Sachs' Harvey Schwartz exits, clearing way for new CEO","bodyText":"The race to succeed Lloyd Blankfein as the chief executive of Goldman Sachs has narrowed to one candidate after the surprise departure of one of the US investment bank’s top executives. Harvey Schwartz, the 54-year-old president and co-chief operating officer, has decided to step down on 20 April, leaving David Solomon, 56, as sole president and chief operating officer, the bank announced. Both had been seen as likely successors to Blankfein, the bank’s longstanding chairman and chief executive, so Schwartz’s departure paves the way for Solomon to eventually become the Wall Street firm’s next boss. The Wall Street Journal reported on Friday that Blankfein was expected to leave the firm at the end of this year and mentioned Schwartz and Solomon as the two top contenders to replace him. Both became co-chief operating officers and presidents of Goldman in January 2017 after Gary Cohn left to work for the Trump administration. Cohn announced his resignation from the White House last week. Promoting Solomon to chief executive would be a departure for Goldman, which has been led by traders in recent years. Trading was the main profit engine in 2006 when Blankfein took the helm, replacing Henry Paulson, who became US Treasury secretary. Since then the bank has moved into new areas such as consumer banking. Solomon joined Goldman as a partner in 1999 and ran its investment banking arm from 2006 until 2016. A Reuters profile in 2011 named him as a future CEO candidate. Solomon previously worked at Bear Stearns and Drexel Burnham Lambert – the investment bank that pioneered the use of junk bonds for corporate takeovers under Michael Milken, who was jailed for securities fraud. Outside work, Solomon is known as DJ D-Sol, spinning dance music at nightclubs, according to the New York Times. He also does yoga with his adult daughter, dines out more frequently than some food critics and is a wine connoisseur. WSJ reported that Solomon gave zero bonuses to 5% of his bankers, hinting that they should look for another job, but has also led efforts to lighten the workload for junior bankers and to recruit and promote more women. Schwartz spent 20 years at Goldman, working in a number of operations including running its trading arm, and a four-year stint as chief financial officer. Blankfein said of him: “Harvey’s work ethic, command of complexity, and client focus have defined his career at the firm. Harvey has been a mentor to many, and his influence has made an indelible impact on generations of professionals at Goldman Sachs.” He added: “I look forward to continuing to work closely with David in building our franchise around the world, serving our expanding client base and delivering strong returns for our shareholders.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/mar/12/angela-merkel-pledges-grand-coalition-for-the-little-people","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-12T16:32:47Z","webTitle":"Germany promised ‘grand coalition for the little people’ in Merkel's fourth term","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/12/angela-merkel-pledges-grand-coalition-for-the-little-people","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/mar/12/angela-merkel-pledges-grand-coalition-for-the-little-people","fields":{"headline":"Germany promised ‘grand coalition for the little people’ in Merkel's fourth term","bodyText":"Germany’s new government has vowed to become a “grand coalition for the little people”, as Angela Merkel’s conservatives and her two coalition partners embark on a precarious project of reforming Europe while nodding to the language and concerns of the far-right. Merkel, who is due to be sworn in for her fourth term as chancellor on Wednesday, almost six months after national elections last September, said on Monday that her new government would focus on “the integration of refugees, but also on the state’s ability to act when people have not been granted right of residence”. “We have all enjoyed the benefits of the Schengen area, allowing us to move freely,” Merkel said at a joint press conference with her new vice-chancellor and finance minister, the Social Democrat (SPD) Olaf Scholz, and her interior minister, Horst Seehofer of the Bavarian-based Christian Social Union (CSU). “But when we introduced free movement, we did not sufficiently think about securing our outer borders. That has to happen now, as well as a development policy that tackles the causes of migration,” she added. On Sunday, Seehofer laid down his government’s law-and-order credentials by pushing for more video surveillance in public areas and faster deportations of rejected asylum seekers. Wednesday’s swearing-in of the new government will put an official end to the longest period of coalition-building in Germany’s postwar history. An aborted attempt to forge an unorthodox “Jamaica” coalition between Merkel’s CDU, the pro-business FDP and the Green party last November resulted in a revival of the “grand coalition” between centre-right and centre-left that has governed the country for the last four years, eventually approved by a vote of the SPD’s membership at the start of this month. On Monday, Merkel nonetheless insisted that plans to present joint European initiatives with the French president, Emmanuel Macron, in March remained on schedule, in spite of her ponderous path to power. “I never said anything about a delay,” said Merkel, announcing that she would visit Paris shortly after her inauguration. “We certainly won’t have settled every last question, but we’ll be able to say more than in December. It surely would be too much to expect us to spell out every facet of the eurozone for the next 20 years.” Merkel said the Franco-German tandem had been galvanised into action by the US president Donald Trump’s plans to introduce 25% tariffs on steel imports. Referring to the threat of a pending trade war, Scholz said: “In an ever more complex world, it is absolutely necessary that Europeans stick together and develop solutions and methods to take control of shaping their future.” Scholz, the SPD caretaker leader and a former mayor of Hamburg, signalled that his party would foster more combative relations with its coalition partner, remarking that “the fourth grand coalition in German history did not start out as a love match”. Merkel said she was looking forward to a “good debating culture” within her cabinet. Both parties go into government on the back of historically poor election results last September, and the SPD’s polling figures have nosedived after its leadership made a U-turn on an announcement to seek renewal in opposition. Yet Scholz can embark on his new ministerial portfolio with his party on a high after successive polls over the weekend appeared to reward the SPD for going into government. A survey on Sunday by the polling institute Insa saw the far-right Alternative für Deutschland drop into fourth place behind Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union, the SPD and the Green party. The new government will start with the same constellation of political parties but a reshuffled lineup of personnel. The CDU has ceded control of the finance ministry to the SPD and of the interior ministry to the CSU. Merkel and the defence minister, Ursula von der Leyen, will be the only politicians to retain the roles they held over the last four years."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"stage/2018/mar/13/ken-dodd-paul-o-grady-alan-davies-frank-cottrell-boyce","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-13T06:00:33Z","webTitle":"'Non-stop gagster and comedy scientist': Paul O’Grady, Alan Davies and Frank Cottrell Boyce on Ken Dodd","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/mar/13/ken-dodd-paul-o-grady-alan-davies-frank-cottrell-boyce","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2018/mar/13/ken-dodd-paul-o-grady-alan-davies-frank-cottrell-boyce","fields":{"headline":"'Non-stop gagster and comedy scientist': Paul O’Grady, Alan Davies and Frank Cottrell Boyce on Ken Dodd","bodyText":"Paul O’Grady: ‘I was in awe of him’ If Doddy was doing a show in Liverpool, it was always packed out. He had a fabulous imagination that gripped children and adults. As a kid I got the Diddymen annual and would see him at the theatre and just be completely entranced. At Christmas we’d watch him on TV at my auntie’s. She’d scream with laughter. My auntie and my mum used to go and stand outside the courts to show support during the trial over his taxes. When he came out, they’d shout: “We’re behind you, Ken! Good luck, lad!” He was very much loved in Liverpool. I was in awe of him whenever I met him. The last time was in his dressing room at the Blackpool Grand. He was very serious off stage – especially about comedy. He told me he had studied it way back to the ancient Greeks. He knew all about new comics, too. I asked him if certain types of comedy only appealed to a working-class or middle-class audience and he said it should appeal to everybody regardless. In Blackpool, he went on at half-seven and was still there at midnight. It became a running gag. The theatre manager would come on and throw over the keys and say, “Lock up when you leave”. There was nobody else quite like him. I mean: a tickling stick? Where did that come from? It was a bizarre act but a wonderful one. Doddy used to do a ventriloquist routine with a Diddyman puppet. It was really charming, spellbinding even as an adult. And so well engineered after years and years of polishing it. When he did his act he had someone backstage timing the laughs. Any gag that didn’t get a suitable amount of laughter would be taken out or improved. He was never complacent but always working to improve the act. It was a science to him. I don’t believe anything was ever ad-libbed: it was all stored in that brain of his. There was a joke for every occasion. I remember in Blackpool I said to him: “Would you consider retiring?” And he gave me the dirtiest look. Alan Davies: ‘He was a machine of comedy’ I met Ken Dodd just the once, back in 1999 when I was making a documentary about comedians for the BBC. I went up to Liverpool’s Adelphi hotel. Ken arrived a little late, very jovial, in a suit and tie and then disappeared again for 40 minutes to get changed, only to reappear in an almost identical beige suit. He proceeded to talk almost non-stop for two hours. It was fantastic – like having my own private audience. He made me laugh non-stop, too. I barely needed to ask any questions. Ken had this kind of life force. He set out every day to make people laugh for as long as he could. Comedians who do long sets will have lots of waffle in there – my last live tour was a bit too long at over two hours. But Ken would be on stage for four or five hours of non-stop jokes. How did he remember them? He was a machine of comedy. If you look at footage of audiences at his shows there’s a quality to the laughter that’s really joyful. He went about life with such good humour and positive energy, and always appreciated the fact that his audience had chosen to come see him and he was grateful and always enjoyed being on stage. He simply was a very, very funny gagster. Frank Cottrell Boyce: ‘Doddy wanted us to feel happy’ Ken Dodd was a campaigning Tory adored in a city where even considering voting Tory is social death. A vocal supporter of Margaret Thatcher held in the deepest affection in a city where supporters of Thatcher are viewed with the deepest opprobrium. He was cavalier about paying his taxes but we were pleased when he was acquitted. Even when he presented Maggie with a tickling stick we forgave him after a while. There’s a Maya Angelou quote that you see a lot on staffroom walls: “People won’t remember what you say, or what you do, but they will remember what you made them feel.” Doddy wanted us to feel happy. It’s an extraordinarily difficult thing to make people laugh without asking them to laugh at somebody else. But once he learned how to do it, Doddy wouldn’t stop. Through a series of misunderstandings, I ended up having dinner with him once. Because I asked him lots of questions he somehow got it into his head that I was updating his obituary for the Liverpool Echo. It came out that we had seven children. He turned to my wife and said, “Seven kids! Stand up and take a bow. No, don’t. Sit down and take a rest.” During that dinner we talked about silent movies. He could see that Chaplin was a genius but preferred Stan and Ollie. Bullies and authority were the butt of Chaplin’s comedy – and that was important and beautiful. But Stan and Olly were the butt of Stan and Ollie’s comedy and “innocent laughter,” he said, is “the sound the angels make”. People will compare him to the great Shakespearean fools like Kempe and Tarleton. But when he was invited to perform in Twelfth Night at the Liverpool Playhouse, he took the part of Malvolio not Feste – the twit and not the twitted. Of course, he was a terrific wordsmith. There’s a wild poetry to his best gags and he had a poet’s eye for the evocative detail – he said of his first trip to the variety theatre: “it smelled of orange peel and cigar smoke”. It’s not the wit of the jokes that makes you laugh. It’s the daftness. No one will ever be able to explain why words like knickerbocker, sausage-knotter or jam butty make us laugh. There would come a point in his shows when – partly from sheer exhaustion – you were laughing without knowing why. You weren’t even listening any more. You were carried beyond yourself. You became part of the happiness – one huge heaving hive-laugh that had stopped caring that the last train had long departed. Afterwards you felt that you’d been part of some kind of experiment to identify and stimulate an actual chuckle muscle. Last year my friend Roy Boulter tried to persuade him to be in a short film I was making with Carl Hunter. He turned us down because it was “a bit downbeat. I’m only interested in happiness.” I don’t want to sentimentalise him. He went on to explain that the other reason he didn’t want to do it was that it was part of a Beatles celebration and “surely they’d made enough money already”. He went on to ask about the fee. But then made it clear that if he did say yes the fee would go to Alder Hey children’s hospital. I think he probably meant that literally about angels. He always asked “the big man upstairs” for help before going on stage. I think he believed that the part of us that could laugh innocently – the chuckle muscle – was transcendent and eternal. Satire is important of course and the darker forms of comedy can help us face our fears. But during a time of division and hatred, to sit in a room full of hundreds of people laughing together and not at anyone else, was to feel your common humanity rocking your body. That was special. And important. For the good, as Yeats said, are always merry."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"football/2018/mar/12/jamie-carragher-dropped-by-danish-broadcaster-after-spitting-incident","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-12T14:06:31Z","webTitle":"Jamie Carragher suspended as Sky Sports pundit over spitting incident","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/mar/12/jamie-carragher-dropped-by-danish-broadcaster-after-spitting-incident","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/mar/12/jamie-carragher-dropped-by-danish-broadcaster-after-spitting-incident","fields":{"headline":"Jamie Carragher suspended as Sky Sports pundit over spitting incident","bodyText":"Jamie Carragher has been suspended by Sky Sports after he spat in the direction of a 14-year-old girl following a brief verbal exchange with the teenager’s father over the result of a football match. Carragher has proven popular with audiences since he joined Sky Sports as a pundit in 2013 after retiring from playing. But his broadcasting career is hanging in the balance while the station reviews his position as a result of the incident. The former Liverpool defender had been due to appear on coverage of the Premier League fixture between Stoke and Manchester City on Monday evening but was stood down amid growing calls for his resignation. Carragher expressed his regret after a video was published showing him committing what he called the “worst mistake” of a 25-year career in the public eye. The footage shows a car pulling up alongside Carragher on a main road following Manchester United’s Premier League match against Liverpool and the former footballer, who wound down his window. The man teased him over Liverpool’s 2-1 defeat against United and at that point Carragher spits into the car. The 14-year-old can be heard complaining that Carragher’s spit had hit her. A Sky Sports spokesman said: “Sky takes this matter extremely seriously and strongly condemns Jamie’s actions, we have made that clear to him in person today and suspended him from his duties. It falls well below the standards we expect of our people.” It is understood the 40-year-old Carragher will not appear on Sky Sports coverage for at least the next week as it is determined whether his job, for which he is paid more than £1m a year, will continue. Carragher is also a columnist for the Telegraph. They did not give any comment on whether he would still be working for them. Carragher, who played for England 38 times, arrived at London Euston train station on Monday morning before taking a chauffeur motorcycle to the Sky headquarters on the outskirts of the capital. He told reporters he had not realised the 14-year-old girl was in the car. “I’ll speak to the family again. I’m sorry. I’ll apologise again today properly,” he said. When asked if he had seen the girl in the car, Carragher replied: “I didn’t to be honest, she was leant back. I wish she wasn’t involved. I hate that she was involved more than anything.” He later appeared on the Sky Sports sister channel Sky News where he watched mobile phone footage of the incident live. “It was a moment of madness, it’s difficult to explain, it was almost an out-of-body thing but you can’t ever behave like that, it’s unacceptable,” he said. Carragher, whose daughter Mia is around the same age as the girl caught up in the incident, said: “I would find it hard to know what I would say or how I would react if it happened to my daughter. I’ve made mistakes in my 25-year career, but this is the worst one.” He would not be drawn on whether he thought he deserved to lose his Sky Sports job. In the past, Carragher has used his platform as an analyst to condemn spitting in football. In a column in the Daily Mail in 2015, Carragher wrote: “I was spat at once in my career. It came during a Uefa Cup game against Celta Vigo in 1998 and the player in question was a Russian midfielder called Aleksander Mostovoi. I was shocked more than angry when he did it because I couldn’t believe what had happened.” The Danish broadcaster TV3 has also dropped Carragher from its coverage of the Champions League match between Manchester United and Sevilla on Tuesday. Peter Nørrelund, head of sport at TV3 Sport, said a decision had not yet been made about Carragher’s long-term future. “Jamie should have been at Old Trafford for us tomorrow and we have taken him off that,” said Nørrelund. “It would have been like sending him into a lion’s den.

Seven years after Jack’s death as a result of negligence while in the care of specialists at Leicester Royal Infirmary, the case remains controversial. It’s truly a sad event, catastrophic on all sides: for the parents, the continued media attention ensures that their grief continues; for the trainee who had always aspired to be a doctor, her dream is in tatters.In the eyes of many doctors, it is catastrophic, too, for regulator the General Medical Council (GMC), which has taken a trainee to court to remove her right to practise as a doctor. The facts behind Jack’s death are complex and were catalogued in the judgment. Bawa-Garba was working in an understaffed paediatric unit. The wider system in which she worked was profoundly unsafe – the trust’s own as yet unpublished internal inquiry is said to include 23 recommendations and 79 actions to minimise risks to patients. If nothing else, we owe it to Jack Adcock to ensure that this does not happen again, and that lessons are learned. A huge amount of taxpayers’ money is invested in training doctors. Bawa-Garba was an accomplished trainee. Although she was two years from becoming a consultant, there were occasions when she was responsible for looking after very sick children, and saved many lives. Here was a registrar just back after 14 months maternity leave. An induction she should have been given hadn’t taken place; three medical colleagues were absent for much of her shift; she’d had no break; there was an IT system failure at a crucial time; and she had to deal with other seriously ill children. At some point during that 13-hour shift, she will not have been aware that she had mental fatigue. It seems that Jack was the casualty of this systemic failure, in which Bawa-Garba was one component. Subsequently, Bawa-Garba and two nurses, sister Theresa Taylor and agency nurse Isabel Amaro, were charged with gross negligence manslaughter in December 2014. Taylor was acquitted; Bawa-Garba and Amaro were convicted the following November and given two-year suspended sentences. The GMC’s own tribunal found Bawa-Garba to be at fault, recommended a 12-month suspended sentence, but did not suggest terminating her licence to practise as a doctor. However, in an unprecedented move, the GMC took her to the high court, where it was ruled this January that the appropriate sentence was erasure from the medical register, rather than suspension. A matter that has become critical to the medical community is the extent to which her reflections were used against her. This judgment has set medical training back decades. A trainee has been pursued without appreciation of the complexity doctors and nurses contend with in a cash-strapped NHS, where there are serious problems with managing rotas, filling jobs, and coping with rising demand. It has pitched doctors against their regulator. Bawa-Garba’s own consultant neonatologist, Dr Jonathan Cusack, who gave evidence in her defence at the criminal trial and the Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service hearing, stated “the criminalisation of medical error when events are considered singularly rather than as a part of a highly complex system is going to seriously impede learning”. And this is the crux of the problem. The GMC is fast losing respect in the profession it seeks to regulate. It is seen as out of touch about the challenges of working on the frontline and worse still, its actions are viewed as diluting patient safety – one of the principal reasons it exists. Loss of confidence in the GMC would diminish its authority as a regulator, the respect in which it is held, and ultimately its ability to protect patients and support doctors. Many doctors we have spoken to say they don’t want their subscription used to scapegoat trainees, and there have been calls to scrap the GMC. Post Bawa-Garba, all health professionals, not just doctors, will fear working in stressful acute units; they will be aware that their own written reflections might be used against them; and apprehension and blame could drive underground the culture of openness and transparency. Death, even where expected, may raise the prospect of a charge of manslaughter, driving recruitment away from “at risk” specialties such as emergency medicine and paediatrics. The GMC’s actions were purely punitive against a trainee doctor who trusted the investigation process. The regulator has been found wanting. There are no winners in a system that blames tragic outcomes on a hardworking health professional trying to do their job. We accept that there were a catalogue of errors in this case, but patient safety will never be improved unless everyone promotes an open learning culture. Much has happened that may change how NHS doctors work, how we’re regulated, and how we raise concerns. The GMC and the health secretary, Jeremy Hunt, have both announced reviews of how gross negligence manslaughter is applied to medical practice. It’s time Bawa-Garba is given a chance to clear her name – and time for the profession to move forward constructively. Otherwise the NHS faces the grim prospect of poor recruitment, defensive practices and a culture of shame and blame, rather than learning from honest mistakes.

Once, I tried to rectify this with hanging pot holders – but it was a sad attempt. Most of the path runs down the side return, so it is north-west facing, but it’s also sliced between two buildings so it’s light. It’s very much a shaft, but it’s a warm, sheltered one. Last year, I had an inspired moment with a wrecking bar and chisel, and liberated pockets of the patio below to find rich, dark earth. If you want to hide your sins, the quickest solution would be a virginia creeper, Parthenocissus quinquefolia. The variety ‘Guy’s Garnet’ from Crûg Farm Plants in Wales turns a statement postbox red in autumn, even in deep shade. I could go for the self-clinging Hydrangea anomala ssp anomala or the slightly slimmer-leaved ssp. petirolaris, both with lacy white flowers in summer that are loved by bees and are tough as old boots, so good for an exposed position. However, it is such a good plant that I already have one, and two might be too much frill. Again, Crûg Farm Plants is the place to visit as it has all sorts of interesting varieties collected from Japan and Korea. A number of roses would climb or ramble given a little tying in, and although they might not bloom with the profusion of a sunnier spot, they’d hold their own. ‘Albéric Barbier’ (creamy lemon), ‘Albertine’ (salmon pink) or ‘New Dawn’ (pearl pink double) all froth in a delicious old-fashioned manner. If I were more patient, I’d fan train a morello cherry, one of the few edible choices that thrives on a north-facing position. But I am impatient and demanding; I want something fast and evergreen. One option could be honeysuckle, such as Lonicera japonica ‘Halliana’, with its trumpets of deliciously scented cream and yellow flowers that appear in July and keep going right into September. It can ramble up to eight metres and will do so fairly fast, but it’s easy enough to keep in bounds, just prune it back after flowering. However, I have a soft spot for something that seems perhaps a little unexpected. You’d imagine that star jasmine, Trachelospermum jasminoides, would want full sun, but it will cope in part shade as long as it’s sheltered. Cold, drying winds kill it off. It’s evergreen, the foliage often tinting a lovely bronze in autumn, and fast growing, but not rampant. The flowers are some of the headiest scented I know. It is used in perfume and incense, so something to open the window for when washing up."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"us-news/2018/mar/13/alabama-bus-crash-driver-killed-and-students-injured-on-school-trip","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-13T16:56:26Z","webTitle":"Alabama bus crash: driver killed as school trip ends in plunge down ravine","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/mar/13/alabama-bus-crash-driver-killed-and-students-injured-on-school-trip","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/mar/13/alabama-bus-crash-driver-killed-and-students-injured-on-school-trip","fields":{"headline":"Alabama bus crash: driver killed as school trip ends in plunge down ravine","bodyText":"A charter bus taking high school students home from a trip to Disney World plunged off a bridge and into a ravine in Alabama early on Tuesday, killing the driver and injuring several others. The bus was carrying about 50 people when it came off Interstate 10 in Baldwin county, near Mobile. The passengers were members of the band from Channelview high school in the Houston area. The local sheriff, Hoss Mack, told reporters that one person was in critical condition and five more were seriously injured, while other passengers suffered minor injuries. Some were transported by helicopter to hospitals. Sacred Heart hospital in Pensacola said it took in 18 patients. Video footage showed a bus with the logo of a Houston-based tour company lying on its side on grassy land next to a creek and embankment with severe damage visible to the front axle and side panels, as first responders with flashlights combed the area. The road was closed in both directions. Mack said that the accident happened at about 5.30am, when the bus entered the median, then fell about 50ft, forcing rescuers to rappel using ropes to reach the victims. The cause of the incident was not immediately clear. “This has been an extensive rescue operation,” he said. John Malone, a state trooper, told a news conference that the driver’s identity had not yet been released pending notification of next of kin. There was “not a whole lot indication that there was braking” before the bus plunged, he said. “I heard a lot of panicking and screaming, some students were stuck under seats, some were on top of other students, and there was a lot of panic to get people out,” one student told ABC13 local news from a hospital, adding that he felt “one huge bump” and the lights in the bus went out. On Monday the band had posted a photograph of students at the theme park in Orlando on its Facebook page."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/mar/14/golden-goal-marc-overmars-for-arsenal-v-manchester-united-1998","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-14T13:00:07Z","webTitle":"Golden Goal: Marc Overmars for Arsenal v Manchester United (1998)","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/mar/14/golden-goal-marc-overmars-for-arsenal-v-manchester-united-1998","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/mar/14/golden-goal-marc-overmars-for-arsenal-v-manchester-united-1998","fields":{"headline":"Golden Goal: Marc Overmars for Arsenal v Manchester United (1998)","bodyText":"The Sky Sports advert for the 1997-98 season is a masterpiece of absurd pomposity. The actor Sean Bean, the concept of keeping it real in human form, strides relentlessly towards the camera while giving a breathy speech about the meaning of football. “It’s ecstasy, anguish, joy and despair,” he says. “It’s theatre, art, war and love … It’s our religion: we do not apologise for it, we do not deny it … They’re our team, our family, our life.” The pay-off is plea of authenticity. “Football. We know how you feel about it. Because we feel the same.” With the exception of the original Alive and Kicking advert, it’s probably the most memorable Sky football promo. It did its job superbly – yet it was trumped towards the end of the season by an unscripted, unofficial advert for football. There was no speech, no pulsing music, no Sean Bean – just an Arsenal fan going feral with happiness. He wasn’t celebrating any old victory. Twenty years ago on Wednesday, Arsenal won 1-0 away to Manchester United through a late goal from Marc Overmars. It was the first time they had even scored at Old Trafford in the Premier League era, never mind won there, and it gave them tentative control of the title race. Arsenal moved six points behind United with three games in hand. More than that, the slick authority of their performance against a nervous, injury-hit United made everyone connected with the club think something magical was happening. At the final whistle, as Arsenal celebrated around Overmars, the camera cut to a thin man with curly black hair, stubble and a black leather jacket. He was wild-eyed, clenching both fists and growling “YES!”. Barry Ferst is a laid-back, softly spoken man, but sport is one of the few areas of life in which happiness is demonstrated through aggression. It brings out the Danny Dyer in most of us. Ferst was in a car on the way back to London when a friend called and told him he’d been on TV. “I’ve got naturally curly hair and I’m quite distinctive, so I just thought I was easy to spot in the crowd,” he says. “I had two or three more phonecalls but didn’t think much of it.” By the time Match of the Day came on that night, he was at home with his girlfriend, sharing a bottle of wine and reliving Arsenal’s win. “When they showed the Overmars goal and there was nothing,” he says, “part of me was a bit disappointed.” He didn’t know the clip was at the end of the match rather than after the goal. His 15 seconds of fame were soon repeated. “My girlfriend said: ‘Oh my god!’ Even I was a bit like: ‘Jesus Christ!’ But I wasn’t really surprised by how intense I looked. The things I’m passionate about, I’m very passionate about. I was caught in the moment.” Life was different in 1998. Although some people had mobile phones, communication was slower and more relaxed, with no culture of text messaging. The internet was a curiosity rather than a societal addiction. It took a while before Ferst realised his life had changed. “I thought a few people would say something and that would be it,” he says. “It’s not like I’d scored a goal or been dropkicked by Eric Cantona. It started to dawn on me the next day, when I was getting recognised in local shops, that things weren’t normal. I used to work at Barclays Bank in Hammersmith and I went in as usual on the Monday. There were a few cracks about it at work. On the way back to the station that night, a three-minute walk took me about 20 minutes.” Arsenal’s next home match was against Sheffield Wednesday two weeks later. Ferst bought a copy of the Gooner fanzine as usual – except this time he was on the back, with a picture of his celebration accompanied by the words ‘This Is What It Meant’. The usual three hours of pre-match drinking at the Gunners pub went by in a blur as people started asking for a handshake – often, not entirely hygienically, in the toilet – a photo or an autograph. “The autographs were especially surreal,” he says, “because they don’t know your name, so you’ve got to introduce yourself. ‘Should I put my name underneath…’” When he left the pub he was chairlifted to the turnstiles. “I wasn’t exactly doing a royal wave but it was a bit surreal. I was really self-conscious. When they were still showing the clip on TV a few days later, I thought: ‘I hope we do win the league now or I’ll look a right prick!’” They did. The win at Old Trafford was the second of an unprecedented 10 in a row, during which Arsenal played some extraordinary football. It culminated in the euphoric afternoon at Highbury when they clinched the league by walloping Everton 4-0. A fortnight later they beat Newcastle 2-0 in the FA Cup final to do the Double in Arsène Wenger’s first full season. Ferst went on his honeymoon to the US that summer and was even recognised in a Las Vegas casino. In May 2002, when Arsenal won the title at Old Trafford, he was interviewed on Sky before the game. They picked him out during it, too; this time he knew what was coming and his celebration was far more restrained. The chances of Overmars ever walking into the Gunners pub on the day of the match are minimal. Ferst, who is part Dutch himself, is the next best thing: he became an instant cult hero, the enduring, angry face of one of Arsenal’s happiest seasons. He still gets recognised 20 years later, even though he has long since shaved off his beard. In 2013, the Bleacher Report website put him second on a list of iconic facial expressions in football history, sandwiched between Paul Gascoigne at Italia 90 and Roberto Baggio at USA 94. “There hasn’t really been any downside to it,” he says. “Sometimes people ask you to do the face. If I’ve had 10 pints I might try, but it’s a bit weird when you’re sober.” Ferst’s celebration showed what it was like to see your team win the biggest game of the season. You wonder whether, in 2018, a TV director would pick him out. There is a greater focus on banners and banter; contrived passion and outrage. Ferst had no idea anyone was looking at him, never mind a million people on Sky TV. His naked passion was totally authentic. You didn’t need to be an Arsenal fan to understand. We all knew how he felt. Because we’d felt the same."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/mar/14/tracy-beaker-jacqueline-wilson-new-book-care","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-14T06:00:04Z","webTitle":"My character Tracy Beaker changed the world.

I hope she will again","bodyText":"I get asked all the time what I think Tracy Beaker is up to now and never really have an answer. I grew up with Tracy, playing her in the BBC TV series The Story of Tracy Beaker from the age of 12 to 16, and then again from when I was 19 in Tracy Beaker Returns – when she comes back as a care worker. We explored the first kiss situation together, and so much else. Like so many of her age, she had a wild imagination, and lots of crazy scenarios in her head. But in many ways I’m just like everyone else who invested all those years in the TV programme – we were all left wondering what on earth she would get up to. That’s why it’s so exciting that Jacqueline Wilson, who wrote the books, is working on a sequel called My Mum Tracy Beaker. I always wondered if Tracy would end up as just another statistic, and now we are going to find out. I thought she was so determined that she wouldn’t let her difficult start in life hold her back. When I got the part of Tracy I had hardly even met any looked-after children. At the start she is struggling to find a family she can fit in with, yo-yoing in and out of foster placements and back to “the Dumping Ground”, which is what she calls the care home (and which now has a spin-off TV series of its own). She is a feisty character. Her emotions are all over the place and she kicks off quite a lot – one minute she is nice as pie, the next she is having a fight. I have had many a parent say they didn’t approve of Tracy Beaker, and some of those who were children at the time tell me they were banned from watching it, but she wasn’t just naughty – there were always reasons for her behaviour. She knew when something was wrong, and in her mind she was going to fight for what she thought was right. I thought that was awesome. Growing up in the 1990s I mainly watched cartoons, and the only programmes that touched on stuff we didn’t already know about were Grange Hill and Byker Grove. So Tracy Beaker broke new ground. At its heart was a message about how different families work, and how not everyone is lucky enough to have a mum and a dad and a house. I’d like to think that, thanks to Tracy, looked-after kids are less embarrassed now about telling their friends where they come from; that other children have some understanding of what growing up in foster care means. I think that’s why the series was such a success on so many levels – last year Wilson received a Bafta special award for her contribution to British children’s television. Her creation was actually about something and did something special. It gave looked-after kids a voice. Even if viewers sometimes blur the lines and struggle to tell us apart, I’m very different from Tracy. She was a hothead, whereas I’m pretty calm. But like her, I’m a mum now too. You’re always going to get a mixed reaction to a sequel like this, because people have made up their own minds what became of Tracy. But I can’t wait to find out. • Dani Harmer is an actor who played Tracy Beaker in the Bafta-winning BBC series based on Jacqueline Wilson’s books"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"healthcare-network/2018/mar/20/nhs-it-health-service-staff-guardian-survey","type":"article","sectionId":"healthcare-network","sectionName":"Healthcare Professionals Network","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-20T10:11:13Z","webTitle":"NHS IT can't keep up with health service demands, survey of staff finds","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/healthcare-network/2018/mar/20/nhs-it-health-service-staff-guardian-survey","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/healthcare-network/2018/mar/20/nhs-it-health-service-staff-guardian-survey","fields":{"headline":"NHS IT can't keep up with health service demands, survey of staff finds","bodyText":"Six out of 10 healthcare professionals believe that NHS IT systems are not fit for purpose, according to survey findings that also show better systems would improve patient care. A Guardian Healthcare Network survey found that less than a quarter of workers thought health service IT was appropriate for the demands the NHS faces. Only 3% of the 1,016 healthcare professionals who responded strongly agreed that computer systems were adequate. “The IT systems compromise patient safety without a doubt ... ” said one junior doctor. “[NHS IT] is the most frustrating aspect of my job by far. It is not fit for purpose and a facet of the job my colleagues and I grapple with on a daily basis.” A hospital manager wrote: “I work in NHS IT. A lack of investment leaves us walking a tightrope above a pit of major systems failure.” Another respondent, who works in health informatics, admitted that inefficient IT lets the health service down. They said: “Our systems are disjointed and do not talk to one another. System reliability is another issue. IT could be good and a huge advantage, but why do we just never get it right?” Many respondents to the self-selecting survey, which was open to NHS workers earlier this year, felt that IT held them back in their jobs. Half of NHS workers said better systems would help them to be able to provide better patient care. A number of professionals who took the survey outlined some of the practical challenges staff face every day. One nurse who works in community services said: “I work remotely with a laptop that consistently loses mobile signal, I regularly waste significant periods of the day on the telephone to the IT department in order to resolve issues that I come across.” Clinicians described how it can take up to 10 minutes to log on to a computer, a task that has to be done several times a day. Simple actions such as looking something up on the internet, printing labels or ordering scans take up a “ridiculous” amount of time which could be spent looking after patients. A junior doctor wrote: “It’s an absolute nightmare. I often waste valuable time just trying to get computers and printers to work, or the right blood form to print out – and it has delayed me in providing care to patients.” Another hospital worker added that there wasn’t time to get training on how to use available technology properly because the ward is so short-staffed – and all their time is taken up looking after patients. Harpreet Sood, associate chief clinical information officer at NHS England, said in response to the findings: “Digital and IT offer great potential to improve patient care, which is why the NHS is investing £4.2bn across a number of projects, from cyber security to online services for patients; from training more NHS digital leaders to helping a group of acute, mental health and ambulance trusts became world leaders in the use of technology.” Join the Healthcare Professionals Network to read more pieces like this.

That’s certainly the message given by some newspaper headlines, prompted by the release of a survey by the pressure group Action on Salt. The group assessed data on salt levels in takeaway dishes from six randomly selected restaurants in London’s Chinatown and 269 supermarket ready meals, side dishes and dipping sauces, and found that the salt contained in many of them was wildly in excess of healthy limits. One main course-plus-noodles bought in Chinatown contained nearly double the UK recommended maximum daily intake for an adult; many of the supermarket ready meals contained around half the recommended daily intake. Experts agree that eating too much salt raises blood pressure, and makes strokes and heart attacks more likely. Certainly, the meals surveyed are very salty. But are they really Chinese? A quick look at the takeaway dishes selected shows that they were all the kinds of dishes adored more by westerners than Chinese people, such as beef in black bean sauce, sweet and sour chicken, prawn crackers and egg-fried rice. The same applies to the ready meals: a giddy parade of deep-fried and sweet-and-sour foods with fried rice and noodles. All the ready meals are produced in Britain for the British market, by British companies, including Sainsbury’s, Iceland and Marks &amp; Spencer; even Blue Dragon, with its Chinese-sounding name, is actually the British offshoot of a global company. It’s hard to imagine any Chinese person eating Iceland’s Slimming World Chinese Style Banquet Rice, one of the saltiest offenders, according to the survey. If westerners want to eat the unhealthiest Chinese dishes, why should the Chinese be blamed? Moreover, it’s not just a question of what the Chinese eat, but how they eat it. Action on Salt’s chairman, Professor Graham MacGregor, appeared on Radio 5 Live this morning suggesting that customers would typically eat several of these salty dishes at one sitting, and might even add extra soy sauce at the table. But this is not the Chinese way of eating. Chicken in black bean sauce, egg-fried rice and prawn crackers with extra soy sauce is not a Chinese meal: it’s a western idea of a Chinese meal. In a Chinese context, highly seasoned dishes are almost invariably served with plain steamed rice (or, in the north, bread or noodles), and accompanied by other, lightly seasoned dishes, such as simple green vegetables and plain broths. One dish of, say, deep-fried chicken in sweet-and-sour sauce (a marginal dish anyway in China) would normally be shared by at least two people and probably more, with steamed rice and other dishes. Fried rice and noodles are exceptions, rather than the rule. Even in the Chinatown restaurants surveyed, sensible ordering and sharing would have given a healthier meal. The survey also announced that soy sauce was “over five times saltier than seawater”, which is hardly surprising, as soy sauce is a salty seasoning and condiment like – er – salt. You add it to dishes in the kitchen for a salty-umami flavour, and you might put it on the table, like salt, as a dip for foods that need extra seasoning, such as boiled dumplings. Chinese people do not sprinkle soy sauce over dishes like sweet-and-sour chicken or beef in black bean sauce. No one would include in a press release the shocking news that salt is salty, so why do it with soy sauce? And why are prawn crackers more headline-worthy than crisps? What’s most striking about the way Chinese people really eat, from a British point of view, is how healthy it is. Most meals consist of plain rice (or bread or noodles – see above) with some meat or fish, plenty of vegetables and a refreshing soup. Even in Sichuan, famous for its spicy food, the dramatically flavoured delicacies are always balanced with the plain. Street stalls serving construction workers and motorway truck-stops in China often offer healthier food than that on which many middle-class British people feed their children, with a dazzling variety of vegetables. Although as the Chinese follow the west down the road of fast and junky food, they are increasingly experiencing the same diet-related health problems, the traditional Chinese diet could be a model of healthy eating. Few cultures understand the intimate connection between diet and health better than the Chinese. Yes, some Chinese food is junky and unhealthy, but most of it isn’t. Why imply that the salty, sugary, deep-fried stuff beloved by Brits is representative of one of the world’s great cuisines? Ever since Chinese people started settling in the west, there they have encountered unpleasant stereotypes about the way they eat. In a notorious article published as recently as 2002, the Daily Mail denounced Chinese food as “the dodgiest in the world, created by a nation that eats bats, snake, monkeys, bears’ paws, birds’ nests, sharks’ fins, ducks’ tongues and chickens’ feet”.

On Wednesday Donald Trump was preparing to announce that CNBC host and conservative commentator Larry Kudlow would replace Gary Cohn as director of the White House’s National Economic Council. Kudlow, 70, best known as a CNBC commentator and outspoken proponent of free trade and low taxes, is in many ways a contradictory fit with Trump’s “America First” agenda. But Kudlow, according to White House advisers, was chosen from a shortlist of just one candidate for one of the most powerful economic posts in the administration. The official announcement could come as early as tomorrow, according to CNBC, his employer. The 70-year-old certainly brings some Trump-supporting chops. He helped to shape Trump’s economic policy platform during the 2016 campaign and later worked with the treasury secretary, Steve Mnuchin, on an overhaul of tax codes. He has reportedly also helped shape economic policy over the past year. A veteran of the Reagan administration, Kudlow worked in the White House budget office. Despite never completing the master’s program in economics and policy at Princeton University, he later moved to Wall Street and served as chief economist at Bear Stearns. A committed proponent of tax cuts as an engine of broad economic growth, Kudlow defended Trump’s own tax cuts when they ran into resistance, from Republicans and Democrats, over the higher budget deficits they will probably bring. But the financial news TV star has not been above criticizing the president’s economic positions, including the recent threat to impose import tariffs on aluminium and steel. “Trump should also examine the historical record on tariffs, because they have almost never worked as intended and almost always deliver an unhappy ending,” Kudlow wrote in a National Review column “Tariffs Are Taxes” penned with co-authors Stephen Moore and Arthur Laffer on 3 March. The authors continued: “We aren’t persuaded by the Trump administration’s claim that we need to impose these tariffs for national-security reasons. Despite stiff competition from imports, many specialty steel producers are doing just fine, and are actually exporting steel to Mexico and Canada.” But Kudlow later said his worries had been assuaged, telling New York’s AM 970 “the tariffs [were] basically gone with the exception of maybe China and a few countries”. “I guarantee you, all of Europe is going to wind up being exempt. And I bet you our allies in Asia will wind up being exempt. China may be the only one,” Kudlow continued. He reasoned that the tariff proposals are “a Trumpian way of negotiating. You knock them in the teeth and get their attention, and then you kind of work out a deal,” Kudlow said. “That’s what he’s done. My hat’s off to him. He had me really worried, now I’m not.” Kudlow, who is from New Jersey, also shares personal aspects of Trump’s life experience. Trump lost his brother to alcoholism; in the mid-1990s, Kudlow entered a 12-step program to combat an addiction to cocaine and alcohol. Kudlow told Crisis magazine that in 1995 “the roof fell down on my life”. “I had another bad relapse. I lost my jobs and my life in the spring of 1995. My wife sent me away to the Hazelden Treatment Center in Minnesota. I was there for five months.” He was helped by the economist and Opus Dei evangelist Father John McCloskey, who also guided Newt Gingrich and Sam Brownback in their conversions to Catholicism. McCloskey recalled that Kudlow had faced a dilemma. “Success comes easy and in a big way for some people in our affluent, celebrity-conscious culture. And what do you do then, when the bottom falls out in a way from which nothing up to that time has prepared you?” McCloskey wrote in Good News, Bad News his 2011 account of the conversions he has overseen. By late 1997 Kudlow was ready to be baptized, surrounded by friends from the conservative magazine National Review. He returned to work and to his marriage and came to see his recovery from alcoholism and cocaine as part of Christ’s redemption. “I knew somehow that first of all, Christ wanted me to recover, and secondly, Christ would stand with me.” “All of this is God’s handiwork,” Kudlow said. “I have learned to live a life of faith … I pray and meditate every single day, every morning. You know I pray in cabs. I pray in airplanes. I don’t really pray for anything – I just pray that Jesus will give me the strength to follow him.” He will need all that strength as he enters the White House. Tenures for Trump appointees have become increasingly brief as Trump tolerance for dissension has shortened."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/mar/20/rachel-roddys-recipe-for-hazelnut-biscotti","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-20T12:00:39Z","webTitle":"Rachel Roddy’s recipe for hazelnut biscotti","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/mar/20/rachel-roddys-recipe-for-hazelnut-biscotti","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/mar/20/rachel-roddys-recipe-for-hazelnut-biscotti","fields":{"headline":"Rachel Roddy’s recipe for hazelnut biscotti","bodyText":"“Bis!” is what Italians shout insistently at the end of a concert in the hope of another song. “Bis”? is also what you might be asked by the person with the serving spoons if you have finished your lasagne and are seen eyeing up the dish hopefully. Bis means encore, again, more; and when put before cotto (cooked), bis means again, or twice, so biscotto means twice-cooked. The word comes from the Latin panis biscotus – bread cooked twice – which is the same root as the word biscuit. Would I like a biscuit? Yes please: a rich tea from a just-opened packet to have with my tea; the last two slightly bent and squidgy ginger nuts to have with my hot chocolate, or a three-inch hazelnut biscotti to have with my red wine. These days, both biscotto and biscuit are all-embracing terms and not necessarily twice-cooked. The tradition, though, of baking twice, traditionally for conservation reasons, is still common in Italy. Different regions have different ways and names: the cantuccini and tozzetti, the baicoli veneziani, biscotti di Prato and countless others. What they all have in common is that they are hard, sometimes fiendishly so – I once lost a filling and a bit of tooth to tozzetti made with honey from a town called Velletri – and they follow more or less the same formula: a dough of sugar or honey and flour – possibly enriched with eggs, fat or alcohol – is flavoured with nuts, dried or candied fruit or fennel seeds, baked in loaves, cut, then baked again. It not uncommon for biscotti recipes in classic books to have few or no quantities; instead you will find the inimitable qb (quanto basta), or as much as is necessary, which assumes you know your ingredients and how you like your biscuits. One such recipe is in my book of Roman food and feels like a slightly ambiguous sketch, suggesting 1kg of nuts, another of honey, flour qb, plus any other flavours you fancy. You then cook them, twice, until they are done. I suppose it makes sense: unfussy biscotti of this sort easily become an exercise in qb, by eye rather than scale. But a template is helpful to start. Here is mine, based on a recipe by Ada Boni; treat it lightly and vary as you wish. Line a flat baking tray with baking parchment and heat the oven to 180C/350F/gas 4. Whisk four large eggs with 350g caster sugar until thick and creamy, then add two tablespoons olive oil, 400g sifted flour, 150g toasted hazelnuts, 60g sultanas, the zest of a large unwaxed orange, a pinch of salt and half a teaspoon of baking power. Use a spoon to mix everything into a consistent dough, which should be slightly sticky. You could add more flour to work a very manageable dough – better, though, is to use floured hands and a floured board to shape a slightly sticky dough – into two fat logs about 20cm long. Lift the logs into the baking tray, then flatten them so they are about 10cm wide, ensuring a good gap between them. Bake for 25 minutes, until pale gold and cooked through, but still a little soft to the touch. Take out of the oven and put on a rack to cool a little, but not completely. Turn down the oven to 160C/325F/gas 3. Now, use a serrated knife to slice the logs widthways into 1cm-thick biscotti. Lay the biscotti back on the baking tray like soldiers and return to the oven for seven minutes on one side, then seven on the other, by which time they should be golden and firm. Kept in an airtight tin, these orange scented, hazelnut-studded biscotti will stay crisp for days, and good for weeks. They are somewhere between delicious and slightly hard work, best dunked in something: coffee, tea, warm milk, sweet wine, or red wine – depending on how you feel."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"society/2018/mar/13/tower-residents-croydon-replace-grenfell-style-cladding-tribunal","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-13T17:26:33Z","webTitle":"Tower residents told to pay £500,000 to replace Grenfell-style cladding","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/mar/13/tower-residents-croydon-replace-grenfell-style-cladding-tribunal","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/mar/13/tower-residents-croydon-replace-grenfell-style-cladding-tribunal","fields":{"headline":"Tower residents told to pay £500,000 to replace Grenfell-style cladding","bodyText":"Leaseholders in an apartment block covered in Grenfell-style cladding have been ordered to pay £500,000 to make their building safe after a tribunal ruled that they, rather than the management company, were obliged to cover the costs. The ruling, which could be challenged, means leaseholders of the 95-apartment Citiscape complex in Croydon, south London, may face a £2m bill, which some have said would force them into financial ruin. The building is owned by the family trust of the multimillionaire property mogul Vincent Tchenguiz, but the case was brought by FirstPort Property Services property management company, seeking clarification on who should pay. Soon after the Grenfell Tower fire it was estimated that the cost of replacing the combustible cladding was about £500,000, but it later received estimates that the cost could be up to £2.4m. Leaseholders had insisted that replacing the cladding should not be added to their service charge as it was not a matter of disrepair “because the cladding remains as designed and constructed”, and it did not fall under “periodical expenditure”. One resident, Richard Low-Foon, told the tribunal he needed “a miracle” to fund the works as his father was ill and could not sell his flat because of the risk the building carried for any future investor. “He is in hospital because of all this. It got too much for him,” he said. However, the chairman of the London residential property first tier tribunal, Angus Andrew, ruled against the leaseholders, insisting they should pay because “if the manager is obliged to do work … the tenants are obliged to contribute to the cost although they remain entitled to dispute the reasonableness of the cost”. The ruling will be closely watched by thousands of other leaseholders in at least 130 private apartment complexes in England that failed cladding tests after the fatal fire in June. Other disputes are simmering between leaseholders and freeholders over who should pay. At the New Capital Quay development in Greenwich, by Galliard Homes, the recladding cost is estimated at £40m for just over 1,000 homes. Alex Blanc, 37, a charity fundraiser who owns a two-bedroom flat in the Citiscape complex, said the ruling was unfair. “It’s a let-down,” she said. “This is something we are not responsible for and now we are having to pay for it.” The tribunal chairman suggested residents may have claims against other parties involved, including the government. Andrew listed the cladding manufacturer, “if warranties were given as to its suitability”, and Barratt Homes, which built the blocks in 2001, “if they were negligent as to the selection and installation of the cladding”. He said leaseholders could mount legal challenges against the London borough of Croydon “if there were errors in certification process”. That was a reference to the fact that many of the buildings, including Grenfell, were signed off by council building inspectors as compliant with building regulations. Andrew also said leaseholders could challenge central government “if the building regulations were not fit for purpose”. But he added that no claims could reasonably commence until Sir Martin Moore-Bick’s public inquiry into the causes of the Grenfell fire had reported, which was unlikely to be until 2019. He warned that tenants could “find themselves mired in litigation for many years, during which time their flats would be effectively unsaleable”. A spokesperson for First Port said: “We brought this case before the tribunal not in conflict with residents, but to receive an independent judgment on the most appropriate way to ensure their safety in the long term. “As the property manager, we will continue to support everyone at Citiscape and work to minimise the costs of recladding, while putting residents’ safety first at all times. “We will continue to work with all parties to provide further assistance to residents, but we must begin these essential safety works.” Steve Reed, MP for Croydon North, said: “The tribunal’s decision is the first time a judicial body has opened the door to a legal challenge to the government over the flawed fire safety rules that allowed flammable cladding to go up on Grenfell and hundreds of other blocks across the country. “The government has consistently claimed the flammable cladding on Grenfell did not comply with the rules, but last week we saw a certificate authorising a similar material that was signed by the government’s chief advisor on the fire safety of buildings. “It is crystal clear the government was responsible for allowing this cladding to go up so the government must accept responsibility for taking it down.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"culture/2018/mar/13/late-night-hosts-on-trump-does-he-think-acting-like-a-buffoon-is-mandatory","type":"article","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-13T15:03:07Z","webTitle":"Late-night hosts on Trump: 'Does he think acting like a buffoon is mandatory?'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2018/mar/13/late-night-hosts-on-trump-does-he-think-acting-like-a-buffoon-is-mandatory","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/2018/mar/13/late-night-hosts-on-trump-does-he-think-acting-like-a-buffoon-is-mandatory","fields":{"headline":"Late-night hosts on Trump: 'Does he think acting like a buffoon is mandatory?'","bodyText":"Late-night hosts took aim at Donald Trump’s “unhinged” rally in Pennsylvania over the weekend and shared concerns over his planned meeting with Kim Jong-un. Stephen Colbert On The Late Show, Stephen Colbert discussed the president’s announcement of a new slogan, unveiled at the rally to endorse local candidate Rick Saccone. Make America Great Again will now be Keep America Great! for the 2020 election. “He’s replacing Maga with Kag,” he said. “Keep America Great? Where have I heard that before? Well, it turns out it’s the tagline for the movie The Purge: Election Year.” Trump also decided to criticize Meet the Press moderator Chuck Todd. Colbert quipped: “Chuck Todd is not a sleeping son of a bitch. He’s a goatee host organism.” Then followed a strange impression of Trump acting in the way he thinks people expect a president to act. “Is Trump really making fun of what he thinks normal presidents are like?” he said. “That’s like an alcoholic going: ‘Ooh look at me, I can hold down a job without drinking wine in the bathroom.’” He claimed it’s harder to act in the way that he does but it’s something he has to do. “You have to do this?” Colbert said. “Does he think acting like a buffoon is mandatory? Is this some sort of Speed situation? Somebody strapped a bomb to the country and if the president’s IQ goes above 55, America explodes?” When Trump brought up his meeting with Kim Jong-un, the audience booed and he told them not to react so harshly. “Don’t boo Kim Jong-un,” Colbert said. “He’s just a murderous dictator who fed his own uncle to dogs.” Trevor Noah On the Daily Show, Trevor Noah also played footage from Trump’s rally, including a line about his wife, claiming that she doesn’t have an easy life, despite what many think. “Who thinks Melania has it easy?” he said. “The number one story in America right now is that her husband had an affair with a porn star and then forgot to sign his own non-disclosure agreement. Melania still has to pretend that she’s happily married which is really hard. Sally Hawkins had an easier job acting like she wanted to fuck a fish.” He moved on to the meet with Kim Jong-un and commented on how unprecedented it will be: “It’s like a Sesame Street episode about group sex: it’s never happened.” Noah continued: “The experts have been trying to solve North Korea for 20 years and it’s only gotten worse so if the smart people can’t do it then why not try Trump? It’s like if you had a rare disease that the world’s top doctors couldn’t cure so you were like, ‘Why not let that dog in a hat have a try?’” Seth Meyers On Late Night with Seth Meyers, the host also spoke about Trump’s “unhinged performance” as well as Betsy Devos’s “trainwreck of an interview” on 60 Minutes. Meyers remarked on how little time Trump devoted to Saccone during the rally, despite the fact that he was the reason he turned up. “Trump’s like the friend you invite to your karaoke party who shows up late, doesn’t bring a gift and then sings Stairway to Heaven 10 times in a row,” he said. Trump also spoke about Oprah as a potential opponent, claiming he knows her weakness. “He talks about Oprah the way Lex Luthor talks about Superman,” he said. Meyers continued: “If Trump ever does debate Oprah, there’s a good chance it will end with Trump sobbing at the podium.” He then moved on to Betsy Devos who stumbled her way through an interview on Sunday. “She’s the highest-ranking education official in the country and she acts like a substitute teacher who is just realizing her US history isn’t up to speed,” he said. Finally, Meyers also brought up the meeting with Kim Jong-un and the possibility that Trump could fall “ass backwards” into some sort of resolution. “If that happens, I will be the first to admit that he wasn’t Darth Vader, he was Mr Bean,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"fashion/2018/mar/30/easter-egg-hunt-kits-daniel-kaluuya-fashion-trends","type":"article","sectionId":"fashion","sectionName":"Fashion","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-30T11:00:20Z","webTitle":"From Daniel Kaluuya to Easter egg hunt kits: this week’s fashion trends","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2018/mar/30/easter-egg-hunt-kits-daniel-kaluuya-fashion-trends","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/fashion/2018/mar/30/easter-egg-hunt-kits-daniel-kaluuya-fashion-trends","fields":{"headline":"From Daniel Kaluuya to Easter egg hunt kits: this week’s fashion trends","bodyText":"Going up The One Where No One’s Ready The Friends episode where Joey wears all of Chandler’s clothes.

Ndegeocello is no stranger to covers projects. Recent years have seen her pay homage to Nina Simone on 2012’s Pour une Âme Souveraine: A Dedication to Nina Simone, and Fats Waller, via guest spots on Selma scorer Jason Moran’s All Rise: A Joyful Elegy for Fats Waller. Ventriloquism casts a wider net, reworking classics by various artists, songs released between 1985 and 95 (the decade that preceded Ndegeocello’s feted debut, Plantation Lullabies). The result is curiously timeless. Soul, swing and funk classics of yesteryear become strange, new blooms under Ndegeocello’s care: the sweet, boyish new jack swing romance of Ralph Tresvant’s Sensitivity takes on a soft, vaudeville warmth; Janet Jackson’s Funny How Time Flies goes from lush, languid makeout fave to sombre, alt-rock rumination; and Sade’s Smooth Operator is taut, sly and rugged, where the original is famously silken. As reworkings go, these are bold offerings – creative, unpredictable and rich with Ndegeocello’s sensual contralto. There is intention here, a subtle, transformative magic.

The rules, agreed by EU finance ministers on Tuesday, will affect the UK financial services industry despite Brexit, because they enter into force six months before the likely end of a transition period, during which the government must obey all EU law. The finance ministers also added the Bahamas to the bloc’s tax blacklist, months after the former British overseas territory was caught up in the Paradise Papers leak of offshore secrets. Two other British overseas territories, Anguilla and the British Virgin Islands, were put onto a “greylist” of jurisdictions that have promised to reform their tax policies to meet EU standards. As a result of Tuesday’s agreement on tax transparency, accountants, bankers and lawyers will be obliged to report to national authorities “potentially aggressive tax planning schemes with a cross-border element”, or risk a penalty. Firms will be obliged to report corporate or personal income transfers to low-tax or no-tax jurisdictions, or places with weak controls on money laundering. National authorities will share information about these schemes through a central database. Penalties “should be proportionate and have a dissuasive effect”, but national governments are free to decide on fines or administrative sanctions when the directive is transposed into national law. The new rules were agreed by finance ministers from all 28 EU states including the UK. A senior civil servant went in place of the British chancellor, Philip Hammond, who was giving his spring statement in London. The reporting requirements come into force from July 2020 – six months before the end of a mooted Brexit transition period. Under the terms of a draft transition deal, the UK would be expected to follow EU law. The government is likely to face pressure to stick to EU tax rules after Brexit if it wants a close trading relationship with the bloc.Valdis Dombrovskis, a European commission vice-president, said the agreement would result in greater tax revenue for member states. He added: “The European Union will of course use its political influence to push for a similar agreement on an international level.” Tax campaigners welcomed the moves for greater transparency but called on Brussels to do more to clamp down on tax avoidance inside the EU. Oxfam’s tax policy adviser, Johan Langerock, said: “The commission rightly named and shamed several EU member states last week for their aggressive tax policies – but now action must follow those words to stamp out tax avoidance in the EU. Governments should tackle tax havens within the EU with the same urgency they are pressuring other countries to adopt tax reforms.” After the latest changes to the EU’s tax blacklist, the list of “non-cooperative jurisdictions” now stands at nine, while 62 fall onto the greylist. The Bahamas, St Kitts and Nevis, and the US Virgin Islands were added to the blacklist on Tuesday, as they were deemed to have not responded to EU concerns. Anguilla, Antigua and Barbuda, the British Virgin Islands and Dominica were added to the greylist. The EU published its first official blacklist last year but postponed judgment on Caribbean islands that had been hit by Hurricane Irma. Blacklisted countries could face restrictions on European development and investment funds but the EU has yet to agree sanctions. • This article was amended on 14 March 2018.

I really encourage people to move away from conventional definitions of politics when thinking about community. Party politics aside, there are many lively local underfunded projects that could do with your time. There is a service called Voluntary Action which will help you with all your volunteering questions, taking into consideration what you hope to gain, your skills and time commitments. I also spoke to Charlie Mackeith, who volunteers for a project called Centre 404, about the volunteering experience. Mackeith, who took two children with autism swimming while their parents had some respite, says: “When you live on some of these estates in big cities, it’s hard to conjure an idea of who you are living next to. These kids live in the block next to me and I’d never met them before.” Your question about whether to try to fix things from the inside or to focus your energies elsewhere, is important. Don’t commit yourself to a project where you will be a passive skill-giver rather than someone benefiting from an exchange. As Mackeith says: “It would be dangerous to see the kids I worked with as people in need of help.” I agree. Step out of your comfort zone and learn from others around you. And redefine “politics”. Sometimes it’s as simple as understanding people around you, and using your societal power to help others to do the same. • What do you think?

DS Janet Hills said stopping and searching young people on suspicion of simple cannabis possession alienated potential witnesses and sources of intelligence, and created an adversarial relationship between officers and the people they are supposed to serve. “It’s not worth the loss of trust or confidence with the community because of the huge violent crime problem we are working with,” she said. “It’s the same community that we need to give us the intelligence. It’s the same community that we need as witnesses. “When we use stop and search in that way it absolutely impacts our ability to reach and engage with the community where it counts.” Hills spoke after a meeting at City Hall called by the Greater London Authority to address disproportionality in policing and the justice system. It also examined how the findings and recommendations of the recent Lammy review could be implemented in the capital. The meeting, chaired by the deputy mayor for policing, Sophie Linden, and the deputy mayor for social integration, Matthew Ryder, heard research from the mayor’s office for policing and crime showing that black and mixed-race Londoners were less likely to feel the police treated everyone fairly. It comes after a row between the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, and David Lammy, the Labour MP for Tottenham, after Khan vowed to tackle a surge in knife crime by authorising an increase in stop and search. Hills told the meeting that officers shunted around London to carry out intensive operations to tackle knife crime as part of the Met’s Operation Sceptre often found themselves in unfamiliar areas. “Ultimately, it’s not giving us the contact we need,” she said. “The intelligence we need to do stop and searches is key, and if we are not getting it from the communities then we are going in blind.” Mark Blake, a Labour councillor in Haringey, said distrust and fear of the police among minority communities was rational given the difference in the treatment they received at the hands of officers compared with white people. Unlike the pupils at local comprehensives, the pupils at a private school near his home faced no contact from police, he said. Blake also pointed to the Met’s gangs matrix, a database of alleged gang members, as evidence of the force’s overemphasis on policing the black community. Research in 2016 found 78% of the people included in the database were black. Met officers at the meeting said they were ready to listen to community concerns. However, Mahamed Hashi, a Lambeth youth worker and chair of the borough’s stop and search monitoring group, said the problem was not with those at the top. “At a certain level there’s really good engagement,” Hashi said. “But the problem is that doesn’t filter down to the officers on the ground.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2018/mar/17/saturdays-best-tv-performance-live-winged-bull-in-the-elephant-case-below-the-surface","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-17T06:00:26Z","webTitle":"Saturday’s best TV: Performance Live: Winged Bull in the Elephant Case; Below the Surface","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/mar/17/saturdays-best-tv-performance-live-winged-bull-in-the-elephant-case-below-the-surface","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2018/mar/17/saturdays-best-tv-performance-live-winged-bull-in-the-elephant-case-below-the-surface","fields":{"headline":"Saturday’s best TV: Performance Live: Winged Bull in the Elephant Case; Below the Surface","bodyText":"Performance Live: Winged Bull in the Elephant Case 10.40pm, BBC Two When the second world war broke out, the National Gallery’s art collection was evacuated to Snowdonia.

Trump announced the shake-up in a tweet, adding that Gina Haspel, Pompeo’s deputy, would become the CIA’s first female director. Tillerson’s departure had long been predicted after a series of clashes over policy. But the announcement, made just four hours after the secretary of state landed in Washington after a tour of Africa, took Tillerson unawares. Under-secretary of state Steve Goldstein said: “The secretary did not speak to the president and is unaware of the reason, but he is grateful for the opportunity to serve, and still believes strongly that public service is a noble calling.” Goldstein was later fired, the state department said. Tillerson’s dismissal was immediate. State officials said they did not know if he would clear his office or send someone to do it for him. Officials said Tillerson had shown every intention of staying and had a full programme of commitments. Tillerson had recently predicted he would stay in office for all of 2018 at least. At 9.15am, Trump left the White House for California, to see prototypes for his border wall. Pausing by the Marine One helicopter, he told reporters he had been “talking about this for a long time”. “I’ll be speaking to Rex over a long period of time,” Trump said. “I actually got on well with Rex but it was a different mindset.” He added: “When you look at the Iran deal: I think it’s terrible, I guess he thought it was OK. I wanted to either break it or do something and he felt a little bit differently.” Tillerson has argued that the US should abide by the agreement about Tehran’s nuclear ambitions that was reached under Barack Obama in 2015. Pompeo is a longstanding opponent of the deal. “With Mike,” Trump said, “we have a very similar thought process. I think it’s going to go very well.” A graduate of West Point and Harvard and a former Republican congressman, Pompeo is widely seen as more of a loyalist than Tillerson, a former oil executive who had not met Trump before the election and grew increasingly at odds with his style and policies. The president said: “I’ve worked with Mike Pompeo now for quite some time. Tremendous energy, tremendous intellect, we’re always on the same wavelength. The relationship has been very good and that’s what I need as secretary of state. I wish Rex Tillerson well.” Last summer, Tillerson was reported to have called Trump a “fucking moron”, a report he did not deny. Trump was asked twice if he had fired Tillerson “because he called you a moron?” The president twice said he could not hear the question, then said: “I respect his intellect. I respect the process that we’ve all gone through together. We have a very good relationship for whatever reason, chemistry, whatever it is – why do people get along? “I’ve always, right from the beginning, from day one, I’ve gotten along well with Mike Pompeo, and frankly I get along well with Rex too. I wish Rex a lot of good things. I think he’s going to be very happy. I think Rex will be much happier now.” On Monday, Tillerson issued a much stronger response to the attempted nerve agent assassination of a former Russian spy in the UK than the White House, naming Russia as a suspect, a step Trump’s spokeswoman, Sarah Sanders, had avoided. Trump said he would speak to the British prime minister, Theresa May, on Tuesday. “It sounds to me like they believe it was Russia,” he said, adding that he would “take that finding as fact”. Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic leader in the House, said: “President Trump’s actions show that every official in his administration is at the mercy of his personal whims and his worship of Putin.” A senior White House official told reporters the firing was related to “upcoming talks with North Korea and various ongoing trade negotiations”. Responding to a question about his announcement of a meeting with Kim Jong-un shortly after Tillerson said talks were “a long way” off, Trump said: “No, I really didn’t discuss it very much with him, honestly. “I made that decision by myself. Rex wasn’t, as you know, in this country. I made the North Korea decision with consultation from many people but I made that decision by myself.” Chris Murphy, a Democrat on the Senate foreign relations committee, said Tillerson had “systematically and intentionally weakened American diplomacy” and added: “President Trump seems to want someone who does the same thing, only faster and while fawning over the president.” In a statement, Pompeo said he was “deeply grateful to President Trump” and added: “His leadership has made America safer and I look forward to representing him and the American people to the rest of the world to further America’s prosperity.” Haspel has come under scrutiny for her role in the CIA’s torture programme under the Bush administration and the agency’s destruction of evidence. Two CIA contract psychologists who helped established “enhanced interrogation” procedures sought to have Haspel testify last year in a legal suit brought by torture victims, in the hope of demonstrating they were acting on CIA instructions. The justice department prevented her appearing in court. Trump said Haspel was “an outstanding person”. “So I’ve gotten to know a lot of people very well over the last year,” he said, “and I’m really at a point where we’re getting very close to having the cabinet and other things that I want.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2018/mar/14/can-the-tv-adaptation-of-terry-pratchetts-discworld-succeed","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-14T06:00:44Z","webTitle":"Can the TV adaptation of Terry Pratchett's Discworld succeed?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/mar/14/can-the-tv-adaptation-of-terry-pratchetts-discworld-succeed","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2018/mar/14/can-the-tv-adaptation-of-terry-pratchetts-discworld-succeed","fields":{"headline":"Can the TV adaptation of Terry Pratchett's Discworld succeed?","bodyText":"In space, no-one can hear you scream, but laugher is a very different kettle of Babel fish. At least, in the UK it is. If there’s one thing that separates us from America in terms of TV and radio outings for science fiction, fantasy and even horror, it’s the fact that we like our genre liberally sprinkled with jokes. Look at what’s due or currently in production. The BBC has just announced a new series based on Terry Pratchett’s beloved Discworld comic fantasy novels. There have already been direct adaptions of Pratchett’s early novels in the series by Sky, including The Colour of Magic, starring David Jason as the irascible wizard Rincewind. The planned BBC series looks set to focus on the City Watch, the police force for the sprawling city-state Ankh-Morpork, first introduced in 1989’s Guards! Guards! Also filming right now, and again from BBC Studios, is Good Omens, based on the 1990 novel collaboration between Pratchett and Neil Gaiman. It is essentially an odd-couple buddy story as David Tennant and Michael Sheen play a demon and an angel who, having carved out quite cosy lives for themselves on Earth, team up to prevent the forthcoming Biblical Armageddon spoiling it all. A lot of the very British humour in both of these productions can trace its lineage to the Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy, arguably the foundation stone of modern comic sci-fi. Douglas Adams’ radio play that became a book that became a TV series is deserved of being labelled a modern classic, and it’s a story that could not have been told anywhere but Britain. Arthur Dent, woefully unprepared for a space adventure in his dressing gown and pyjamas, narrowly escapes the destruction of the Earth to make way for an intergalactic bypass after being rescued by the long-time friend he had no idea was actually an alien. And, lo and behold, Hitchhiker’s returned to the airwaves last week, back where it began as a radio show, with further adventures of Arthur and Ford Prefect (aliens were a bit lazy when taking Earth names; in the new series there’s a new character called Hillman Hunter, played by Ed Byrne) based on original notes by Adams, who died in 2001. These aren’t outliers in the world of British TV science fiction and fantasy, though. They’re the norm. Compare them to American shows such as Game of Thrones or the Walking Dead where (intentional) belly laughs are few and far between. The Handmaid’s Tale, apart from a couple of sardonic asides, is unremittingly bleak. Altered Carbon, though based on the work of a British-born author, Richard K Morgan, is pure Blade Runner dystopia. And even the inclusion of a Tribble for eagle-eyed fans in the third episode of the latest iteration of Star Trek, Discovery, hasn’t lightened the mood much. Even when America has had a fair stab at comedic sci-fi, in the form of the original 1960s series Lost In Space they only go and reboot it into what looks from the previews of next month’s Netflix series to be rather po-faced. The British take on Lost in Space was, of course, Red Dwarf, which debuted just about 30 years ago in February 1988, featuring among its cast Craig Charles, Danny John-Jules, and Chris Barrie as the dregs of an interstellar mining ship. Charles played the last human alive after being kept in suspended animation for three million years. Red Dwarf – which has had something of a resurgence recently, the most recent miniseries airing late last year – was played directly for laughs but still managed to become beloved of hardcore geeks. And therein lies the nub of the issue. We just don’t seem to do straight sci-fi or fantasy over here, but what we do as comedy usually works. That’s because it’s true to either its source material or its inspirations. Perhaps, as Brits, we’re too inherently embarrassed to try to play something which we feel at its heart is faintly ridiculous with a straight bat. Even Doctor Who, our most soaraway prime-time genre success, works best when it’s leavened with humour. The stall was set out in the very first episode of the contemporary run in 2005, when Christopher Eccleston’s ninth doctor, after being challenged by Billie Piper’s Rose that he can’t be an alien because he has a northern accent, responds, “Lot’s of planets have a north!” Why do we do it? Perhaps the answer lies in one of Adams’ descriptions of Earth from the original Hitchhiker’s: “This planet has — or rather had — a problem, which was this: most of the people living on it were unhappy for pretty much all of the time.” If British science fiction and fantasy can alleviate that at the same time as performing the basic requirements of the genre – to reflect modern life, to make us think and to be exciting – then I’d rather have one good old giggle than a dozen dour dystopias."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/mar/13/sergei-skripal-spy-poisoning-russia-uk-sanctions-eu-lack-consensus","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-13T15:14:30Z","webTitle":"UK's effort to rally allies over Sergei Skripal poisoning may fall short | Patrick Wintour","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/mar/13/sergei-skripal-spy-poisoning-russia-uk-sanctions-eu-lack-consensus","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/mar/13/sergei-skripal-spy-poisoning-russia-uk-sanctions-eu-lack-consensus","fields":{"headline":"UK's effort to rally allies over Sergei Skripal poisoning may fall short","bodyText":"The British foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, has said he is encouraged by the response from friends willing to rally to the UK cause over the poisoning of the former Russian spy Sergei Skripal. But EU officials warned privately that the bloc’s existing consensus on further sanctions against Russia has already been cracking, and it may be impossible to forge collective agreement on new measures. One official said the best that may happen is that the EU resolves to stick to its existing sanctions position rather than see it diluted. Following a round of diplomatic phonecalls coordinated with Number 10, Johnson had been buoyed by support overnight from the US secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, only to find that Donald Trump had fired him after repeated run-ins. Trump himself said on Tuesday that he would speak to Theresa May about the poison attack, after facing criticism for not swinging clearly behind the UK view that the Russian government was either responsible for the attack or for failing to control its nerve agent stocks. “It sounds to me that it would be Russia based on all the evidence they have,” he said. “As soon as we get the facts straight, if we agree with them, we will condemn Russia or whoever it may be.” Johnson was also claiming support from the Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, and the French foreign minister, Jean-Yves Le Drian. Guy Verhofstadt, president of the European parliament and an advocate of conditional engagement with Russia, said: “We stand shoulder to shoulder with the British people.” Support also came from the European commission vice-president, Frans Timmermans. No EU country has so far committed itself to further sanctions against Russia if the UK declares the Russian state had acted unlawfully on British soil. In a major test of UK diplomatic heft in a post-Brexit era, the UK has been putting out feelers to sense what countries would be prepared to do in a show of solidarity. In a sign that some EU countries will put the emphasis on the UK to put its own house in order, rather than agree new collective steps, Norbert Röttgen, chairman of Germany’s parliamentary foreign affairs committee, said the case showed the need to target the fudged boundary between the Russian state security apparatus and organised crime. “The case should be a reason for Britain to examine its open stance towards Russian capital of dubious origin,” Röttgen said. MEPs were questioning whether the UK would use new legislation – such as unexplained wealth orders that are included in the Criminal Finance Act 2017 – to challenge some Russian millionaires living in London. Ministers have insisted the orders will be used but say they cannot risk using them in a way that undermines the UK’s reputation for judicial independence. Röttgen is seen as close to the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, who on Monday had expressed the hope that the re-election of Vladimir Putin as president this weekend would represent an opportunity for Europe to propose a fresh start with Russia over how to handle Ukraine and the annexation of Ukraine. Discussing the EU’s approach to sanctions, one official said the Salisbury poisoning episode “makes it more likely we keep what we have got. The consensus has been beginning to crack”. Hardly any frontrank politician in Italy, for instance, favours sanctions against Russia even if some oppose them simply because they are seen as ineffective. The EU has recently become more focused on the threat posed by Russia in the western Balkans as well as the continued occupation of parts of Georgia, where deaths occur most days. The criticism of Russian behaviour in the Balkans, especially by the US, raises hackles in parts of the region. On Monday the Serbian defence minister, Aleksandar Vulin, derided recent US warnings of Russian interference in the Balkans as some of the most dangerous statements made since the western military alliance bombed the country in 1999. Inside Nato high command support for the UK position is strong, but the presence of Turkey, increasingly an ally of Russia in Syria, makes decisive action harder to coordinate. The episode underlines the extent to which UK’s post-Brexit foreign and security relations with the EU remain unresolved. Britain as a third party would not be automatically consulted on common foreign and security policy, including further sanctions coordination, but both sides have been deferring talks until the outline of a trade deal becomes clearer. The level of EU engagement with UK requests for help over Russia may influence the atmosphere of the Brexit talks. Speaking in London, Nathalie Tocci, special adviser to the EU head of external affairs, Federica Mogherini, said the scope for a win-win deal on foreign policy and security for both the UK and the EU was higher than in any other area, adding that the bargaining power was more balanced in this field than in any other. Some EU officials have suggestedthat even in a transition period, when the UK is confined to the role of rule taker, it might be possible to construct a pilot in which the UK defence contribution remained integrated, and the country was fully consulted on decision-making."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/mar/14/austerity-poor-disability-george-osborne-tories","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-14T09:00:07Z","webTitle":"Austerity really has hit poor people hardest – the figures prove it | Jonathan Portes","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/14/austerity-poor-disability-george-osborne-tories","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/14/austerity-poor-disability-george-osborne-tories","fields":{"headline":"Austerity really has hit poor people hardest – the figures prove it","bodyText":"On Tuesday, the chancellor announced that the government’s debt would start to fall relative to GDP – a target originally set by George Osborne in 2010. Back then, the then chancellor said “We’re all in this together”, while in 2012 his chief secretary to the Treasury, Danny Alexander, told delegates at the Liberal Democrat conference: “We simply will not allow the books to be balanced in a way that hits the poorest hardest.” On Wednesday, the Equality and Human Rights Commission publishes our research, which contains the most detailed and thorough assessment yet of those claims. Our analysis shows that, contrary to Alexander’s pledge, changes to taxes and welfare payments since 2010 have indeed hit the poorest hardest, whether you look at the record of the 2010-15 coalition government or that of the Conservative government elected in May 2015. Some changes, such as increases in the personal allowance and the minimum wage, have boosted incomes; but others, especially cuts to benefits and tax credits, more than offset this. Looking both backward and forward, by 2021-22 the overall impact of all these changes will have been to reduce the net incomes of the poorest fifth of households by about a tenth, on average, while making little or no difference to the incomes of the richest fifth. But it’s not just about whether you’re rich or poor. The pain is spread unevenly between men and women, and people of different ethnicity. Women lose more than men – especially single parents, whether they are in or out of work. The average lone parent family will lose a fifth of their net income. Pakistani and Bangladeshi households, which tend to have lower incomes and to have more children, also suffer a double whammy. And disabled people are very hard hit, particularly those with more severe disabilities. Households with both a disabled adult and a disabled child will lose, on average, about £6,500 a year. Perhaps the most harmful of the benefit cuts is the four-year freeze in most working-age benefits and tax credits. But the reduced generosity of universal credit, whose original intention was to improve work incentives and family incomes, now means that it will penalise those it was intended to help. The two-child limit for benefit payments hits larger families. And the changeover from Disability Living Allowance to Personal Independence Payment will hit people with severe disabilities – although the government’s decision to accept the recent court ruling that all claims should be reviewed, and reassess many of those affected, is likely to mitigate these impacts. The changes hit lower-income families with children the hardest, and so the likely result will be a sharp increase in child poverty – we estimate, over the next five years, an extra 1.5 million children in poverty, an increase of more than 10 percentage points. Osborne’s plan to reduce the deficit while cutting taxes for some inevitably implied major changes to the tax system, and cuts in benefits. But the precise mix of reforms implemented was a political choice, and it was certainly not inevitable that it would be the most vulnerable groups that would have to bear the brunt. Before making such changes, the Treasury should carry out – and publish – exactly the sort of analysis we have undertaken, precisely so that these impacts can be anticipated and mitigated. The government’s recent race disparity audit shows that civil servants are more than capable of doing this, if the political will is there. Our analysis shows that if the government continues the current trajectory, Osborne’s claim that we are all in this together will ring ever more hollow. On current plans, the next few years will see very substantial further cuts to the levels of welfare benefits, pushing more children into poverty and further disadvantaging the very groups – people with disabilities, certain ethnic groups, women and lone parents – that are already relatively worse off. A rethink is long overdue. • Jonathan Portes is professor of economics and public policy at King’s College London.

The collection, which includes a previously unknown photograph of Einstein as a five-year-old and the only surviving letter written by Einstein to his father, comes from the archive of Maja Winteler-Einstein and her husband Paul Winteler. A mix of letters, postcards and photographs, many of which have not previously been published, the documents range in date from 1897 to 1951. “What’s remarkable about them stems from the fact that he had this incredibly close relationship with his sister. It’s quite clear when he’s writing to her, there’s no role-playing at all,” said Thomas Venning at Christie’s, which will auction the letters at the start of May. “He was very conscious of what was expected of him after he became famous, and you don’t get any of that in letters to his sister. He says some things that I’ve never seen him say anywhere else, and I’ve catalogued many hundreds of his letters.” In 1924, nine years after he completed the general theory of relativity in 1915, Einstein would write to Maja that “scientifically I haven’t achieved much recently – the brain gradually goes off with age, although that’s not so unpleasant. It also means that you’re not so answerable for your later years.” Ten years later, he would write to her: “I am happy in my work, even if in this and in other matters I am starting to feel that the brilliance of younger years is past.” Venning said he had not seen Einstein admit this anywhere else. “It’s not him playing a role, you can see that thought going through his head. Which is true – if Einstein had died in 1916, his fundamental legacy would have been intact. He carried on working for another 40 years without making any other great breakthroughs. So it’s just an extraordinary moment which we get because of how close their relationship was. He didn’t have to reassure her,” he said. Tackling topics from his hobbies of sailing and playing the violin, to his difficult relationship with his first wife, the letters are “unpublished snapshots of Einstein, his private face”, according to Venning. In one from 1935, Einstein makes a rare acknowledgement of his achievements, writing to Maja: “In our main avenues of research in physics we are in a situation of groping in the dark, where each is completely sceptical about what another is pursuing with the highest hopes. One is in a constant state of tension until the end. At least I have the comfort that my main achievements have become part of the foundations of our science.” “It sounds unusually big-headed for Einstein – he was an incredibly low-key, humble person, always careful not to say anything that sounded too proud. But I think he felt he could say something to Maja,” said Venning. In 1923, in a letter that Christie’s has valued between £6,000 and £9,000, Einstein writes to Maja of his international fame, telling his sister and her husband that “I am becoming very much loved and even more envied; there’s nothing to be done about it.” “He’s not rejoicing in it, he’s just sort of accepting it. Einstein was the first scientist to be a world celebrity. Before that it just didn’t really happen to scientists, so he was in this unique position,” said Venning. The shadow cast by the rise of the Nazis in the 1930s, and the strength Einstein drew from his work, is starkly depicted in a letter written to his sister in September 1933. Earlier that year, Einstein had renounced his German citizenship in Antwerp, fearing for his life after the Nazis branded relativity “Jewish science” and publicly denounced him. He took up a role at Princeton University in New Jersey in October; his sister would follow him in 1939. “What will happen if we come back from Princeton next year? Will we even be able to? What will life be like there? The only unshakeable things are the stars and mathematics,” he wrote. “This is him facing up to the fact his whole life has changed. He’s going to a country he doesn’t really know. And so his whole world is falling to pieces, and he says this wonderful line,” said Venning. Christie’s will put the letters on view to the public from 18 to 20 April, and auction the collection online from 2 to 9 May."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"music/2018/mar/22/bcuc-emakhosini-review-south-africa-soweto-melissa-laveaux-turbans","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-22T15:00:07Z","webTitle":"BCUC: Emakhosini review – Soweto seven-piece shake up South African music","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/mar/22/bcuc-emakhosini-review-south-africa-soweto-melissa-laveaux-turbans","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/mar/22/bcuc-emakhosini-review-south-africa-soweto-melissa-laveaux-turbans","fields":{"headline":"BCUC: Emakhosini review – Soweto seven-piece shake up South African music","bodyText":"BCUC, AKA Bantu Continua Uhuru Consciousness, are a young seven-piece band from Soweto who are shaking up South African music. Vocals and sturdy harmony work have always played a dominant role in township styles, but here the tradition is updated and reworked with the powerful but subtle use of drums and bass. They play lengthy songs (the opener lasts nearly 20 minutes) that mix ancient and modern influences in a style that is distinctively South African, and includes soulful, elegant playing with passages that are as dramatic and frantically menacing as the best Congotronics bands in Kinshasa. BCUC have an impressive sense of dynamics, allowing songs to develop, fade away, change direction and then build to an often furious climax. Insistent, inventive bass guitar work holds it all together, as in Moya, which begins with a brooding riff and distant chanting, before the voices and percussion take over. Then there’s another switch, as echoes of what sound like ancient African war chants give way to cool, soulful vocals from Kgomotso Mokone, the one female member of the band, before the drums and chanting vocals return. Elsewhere, what they call their “africangungungu” and “afropsychedelic” music includes passages of sturdy township styles. There are stirring harmony vocals on Insimbi that would provide a reminder of Ladysmith Black Mambazo if it weren’t for the drums and bass riff. The final track, Nobody Knows, brings further surprises. It starts off with a reworking of Nobody Knows the Trouble I’ve Seen, the gospel classic that has been recorded by everyone from Louis Armstrong to Sam Cooke, but is then transformed as chanting, rap and percussion take over. Those who fear that South African music is becoming too bland, or dominated by US influences, should take heart. Also out this month Mélissa Laveaux’s Radyo Siwèl (No Format!) is a fresh, intriguing set from a Haitian singer-songwriter who had been away from her homeland for 20 years before returning to explore its culture and history. It is is dominated by protest and Vodou songs from the era of the US occupation between 1915 and 1934, and highly recommended. The Turbans are a British-based fusion band whose “music from manywhere” switches from the Balkans to the Middle East and from flamenco to North Africa. The best track on their self-titled debut (Six Degrees) is a cheerful love song to Hackney."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"education/2018/mar/13/debt-for-life-only-38-of-students-say-tuition-fees-are-good-value","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-13T14:33:50Z","webTitle":"'Debt for life': only 38% of students say tuition fees are good value","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2018/mar/13/debt-for-life-only-38-of-students-say-tuition-fees-are-good-value","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/education/2018/mar/13/debt-for-life-only-38-of-students-say-tuition-fees-are-good-value","fields":{"headline":"'Debt for life': only 38% of students say tuition fees are good value","bodyText":"Little more than a third of students believe their university course represents good value for money, according to research by the government’s new regulator for the higher education sector. The survey of almost 6,000 students by the newly established Office for Students (OfS) will add to concerns about the cost of going to university and the value for money it represents. Just 38% of those surveyed either mostly or definitely agreed with the statement: “The tuition fees for my course represents/represented good value for money.” A larger proportion, 44%, mostly or definitely disagreed, and 8% said they neither agreed nor disagreed. Asked to explain their views on value for money, one student said: “I expected to have at least a weekly tutorial every week before I came to university but that isn’t the case. The excess and waste of the university with regards to spending is obvious so I can only assume a tiny fraction of the tuition fee actually goes towards tuition.” Another said: “£9,000 a year for a degree, are you joking? The library was always overcrowded with half the amount of plug sockets for the number of seats. I will be paying this off for the rest of my life.” Almost a quarter (24%) of those surveyed did not feel properly informed about the additional costs of going to university, on top of tuition fees. They called for more transparency about how their £9,250 annual tuition fees were spent, and more information about additional costs including accommodation, books and extracurricular activities such as field trips. Just over half (54%) thought their overall investment in higher education was good value for money, with quality of teaching, learning resources and feedback the key factors in assessing this. Students were also asked about their views on using tuition fees to cross-subsidise their insitutiton. The research found they felt least comfortable with their tuition fees funding teaching on other courses, followed by wider research unrelated to their course and paying for management costs. The survey, which was carried out among graduates and school leavers as well as current students, comes at a time of increased uncertainty about the funding of higher education. Nicola Dandridge, the OfS’s chief executive, said: “Higher education providers should carefully consider the findings from this report and consider how they can improve transparency and clarity about fees and the cost of going to university, and most of all how they can ensure that every student has a fulfilling experience of higher education which can enrich their lives and careers.” Les Ebdon, the head of the Office for Fair Access, said it was shocking that nearly a quarter of students did not feel properly informed about the additional costs of going to university. “These costs can be very substantial, particularly for those who do not have ‘the bank of mum and dad’ to help out and have to find the extra money themselves,” he said. “This research provides further evidence of the need for universities and colleges to give clear, accurate information, advice and guidance to people considering study so that they know what to expect.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"science/2018/mar/13/isabel-gal-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-13T15:13:19Z","webTitle":"Isabel Gal obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/mar/13/isabel-gal-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2018/mar/13/isabel-gal-obituary","fields":{"headline":"Isabel Gal obituary","bodyText":"My mother-in-law, Dr Isabel Gal, who has died aged 92, was working at Queen Mary’s hospital for children in Carshalton, Surrey, in the 1960s when her research suggested that a hormone-based pregnancy test drug called Primodos caused birth defects similar to those seen with thalidomide. Her findings were published in the journal Nature in 1967. In 1975 the Committee on Safety of Medicines issued a warning which was printed on the packaging, but the drug remained in use in the UK until 1978 – and Isabel believed that she was subsequently frozen out of the medical profession. The case was taken up by the MP Jack Ashley, by several newspapers and more recently by Sky News, which made a documentary on the subject. In 2017 an expert working group set up by the Commission on Human Medicines concluded that there was no “causal association” between Primodos and severe disabilities in babies, but the Association for Children Damaged by Hormone Pregnancy Tests severely criticised the report. Isabel was born into a Jewish family in Hungary, the daughter of Geza Gunsberger, who worked for a timber merchant before founding a successful lingerie company, and Irma (nee Hacker), who came from Austria. Geza died in the Holocaust, while Isabel, her mother and her two sisters, Lia and Erica, survived Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp. Erica settled in England and the others returned to Hungary, Isabel qualifying as a doctor at the University of Budapest’s medical school and working as a paediatrician at Bokay hospital for children in the city. In 1953 she married a mathematician, Endre Gal, whom she had known since childhood; his father was the timber merchant for whom Geza had worked. In 1956 their daughter, Katinka, known as Kathy, was born, but with the Hungarian revolution in full swing they decided to flee the country, along with Irma. It was a risky business as they had to be smuggled over the border into Austria. Erica sponsored their move to England. She died in 2017. Isabel requalified in medicine at Edinburgh University; she found the Scottish accent easier to understand than Londoners’. With paediatrics as her specialty, she worked at institutions including Great Ormond Street hospital and Queen Mary’s, Carshalton. Isabel is survived by Endre, Lia and Kathy."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"fashion/2018/mar/31/the-best-spf-moisturisers-beauty","type":"article","sectionId":"fashion","sectionName":"Fashion","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-31T07:00:07Z","webTitle":"The best SPF moisturisers | Sali Hughes","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2018/mar/31/the-best-spf-moisturisers-beauty","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/fashion/2018/mar/31/the-best-spf-moisturisers-beauty","fields":{"headline":"The best SPF moisturisers","bodyText":"At this time of year, people start asking me for facial sunscreen recommendations, frequently with the enthusiasm one might convey for an impending smear test. We grudgingly accept it’s in our interests to protect skin from UVA and UVB (think A for Ageing, B for Burning), but the additional step and often greasy, thick texture of sunblock dissuades many. I take the view that those who aren’t spending extended periods outdoors would be better off with a day cream with added sun protection, killing two birds with one lighter, more agreeably textured moisturiser. One can always ramp up to a dedicated block in the summer, for long days on beaches and in beer gardens. Having worn a different protective moisturiser every day for weeks, my runaway victor is Merumaya Youth Preservation Moisturiser. It’s pricey at £37 for 30ml and the protection – SPF20 – is only just over the threshold of acceptability, but the texture is near perfect (luxurious but ungreasy, smooth and stable under foundation) and the airless pump packaging is ideal for travel and storage. The light cream contains lots of water-retaining (ergo skin-hydrating) hyaluronic acid as well as multiple antioxidants and broad-spectrum sunscreens, and unlike every other I tried, didn’t sting or blur when wandering into my eyes. My remaining recommendations require a separate eye cream, but still proved exceptionally good. I love Facial Moisturising Lotion SPF25 (£12, 52ml) from new brand CeraVe (look alongside the likes of E45 and Eucerin in chemists). This has a travel tube and a surprisingly elegant texture for its price and category. It contains good things like niacinamide for spots, though this means it’s not much cop over vitamin C serum, so choose your layers accordingly. Vitamin C serum devotees (like me) should opt for something like Murad Essential-C Day Moisturise SPF30, £59.50 (50ml), a silky, ungreasy, glow-giving cream that behaves impeccably under makeup. La Roche-Posay proved great, too, with two equally good versions of Hydraphase UV Intense day cream – Riche, for dry skins and Light for everyone else, both £17 for 50ml. Five reasons to be more cheerful about the pressing need to protect. I’ll accept no further excuses."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"music/2018/mar/16/jazz-album-of-the-month-keith-jarrett-standards-trio-after-the-fall","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-16T12:30:09Z","webTitle":"Jazz album of the month – Keith Jarrett Standards Trio: After the Fall","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/mar/16/jazz-album-of-the-month-keith-jarrett-standards-trio-after-the-fall","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/mar/16/jazz-album-of-the-month-keith-jarrett-standards-trio-after-the-fall","fields":{"headline":"Jazz album of the month – Keith Jarrett Standards Trio: After the Fall","bodyText":"Gary Peacock, Keith Jarrett’s double bassist in the piano star’s 35-year-old Standards Trio, once told JazzTimes that when: “You don’t feel you have to make a statement any more, you enter a space of enormous freedom.” It was perhaps a disingenuous observation, since Jarrett almost certainly had a statement in mind when he founded this influential band in 1983 – to cherish some old-school standards about melody, swing and acoustic sound, as well as celebrating the standard songbook repertoire from which so much original jazz has been launched. But in an era in which people can’t fall over each other fast enough to make statements, the trio’s casual bearing of familiar baggage, and liberated delight in spontaneous playing feels increasingly, timelessly fresh. Jarrett, Peacock and drummer Jack DeJohnette’s previously-unreleased After the Fall goes back to 1998, but it sounds no more dated than any creative classical music reappraisal of repertory materials. The pianist was emerging from chronic fatigue syndrome’s two-year silence, and this 1998 concert in Newark – just an hour’s drive from his home – was his comeback to the stage. The set bubbles with rediscovered energies and reconsidered meditations. The Masquerade Is Over, a softly unaccompanied opener at first, swells into briskly grooving, logically shapely piano variations. Charlie Parker’s bebop classic Scrapple from the Apple spins through brittle, hopping Jarrett figures, or lean and sleek ones turning on breezy elisions and trills. Bud Powell’s Bouncin’ With Bud is playful and snappy; Sonny Rollins’ slinky swinger Doxy is a group conversation; One for Majid a tumbling, staccato blues; Santa Claus Is Coming To Town is a sonorously gospel tease and John Coltrane’s Moment’s Notice a heedless gallop that betrays none of the pianist’s travails. The content and the backstory of this powerful release catapult it straight to the forefront of Jarrett’s voluminous catalogue. Also out this month The no-hiding-place exposure of an improvising sax/piano duo is a tough call but the British pairing of pianist Alcyona Mick and tenor saxophonist Tori Freestone make light of it (with singer Brigitte Beraha a significant interventionist) on the mix of Monk, Brazilian music, postbop and folk moods of Criss Cross. With album Red Alert, London pianist Janette Mason’s trio – fuelled by energies from the Bad Plus, David Bowie, Goldfrapp, Robert Wyatt and plenty more – uncork a typically eclectic, skilful and audience-friendly brew."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/mar/16/beyond-guinness-what-to-drink-this-st-patricks-day","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-16T15:00:08Z","webTitle":"Beyond Guinness: what to drink this St Patrick’s Day","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/mar/16/beyond-guinness-what-to-drink-this-st-patricks-day","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/mar/16/beyond-guinness-what-to-drink-this-st-patricks-day","fields":{"headline":"Beyond Guinness: what to drink this St Patrick’s Day","bodyText":"lt’s easy to caricature the Irish drinks scene, especially on St Patrick’s Day, when you get the impression that the entire world is drinking Guinness. Or are they these days? I was so disappointed by the way Guinness tasted last time I was in Dublin – far, far too cold – that I won’t easily be persuaded again, let alone by its new offering, Guinness Golden Ale. I’m not a Baileys kinda girl, either – particularly when I’m expected to pay £20 a bottle (at time of writing) for it. That’s likely to be down significantly by today, but even then I’d be surprised if it’s cheaper than Sainsbury’s Taste the Difference Irish Cream Liqueur (£12.50 for one litre; 17%), which continues to be the best own brand I’ve tasted, and has a real kick of Irish whiskey to it. Speaking of whiskey, which we should, Ireland has its own distinct style, which I’d loosely characterise as between scotch and bourbon and which owes its character to triple distillation and the use of a single pot still. It’s smoother and sweeter than scotch, but less full-on, rich and vanilla-y than bourbon. A good example is the smooth, gently rounded Green Spot (40%), which is made at the Midleton distillery in County Cork and, in my humble opinion, tastes its best on the rocks. Jameson has also brought out an interesting expression in its Caskmates series aged in stout barrels, which has a nice touch of dark stout bitterness. But the two whiskeys I’ve been most excited about are the Dingle Single Malt Batch No. 2 (46.5%), from an independent distillery, which is more delicate, complex and subtle than you’d imagine for being aged in Pedro Ximénez, oloroso and bourbon casks; and JJ Corry’s award-winning The Gael, which has revived the old practice of whiskey “bonding”, where whiskies were aged by local grocers. Despite the age of its constituent malts, which are blended 60:40 with grain, it’s a bright, fruity, spicy whiskey – although at £72.95, it’s not exactly cheap (from the Whisky Exchange). But it is delicious. My big St Paddy’s Day find this year, however, is a series of brilliant products from a small company called Johnny Fall Down that grows rare apple varieties on its farm in County Cork. The cider itself is well worth a try – more bitter than bittersweet, and beautifully refreshing – but the standout is the sweet, deeply appley Pom’O Apple Port, a neat take on Normandy’s pommeau and ideal with an Irish cheeseboard. Green Spot Single Pot Still Irish Whiskey £36.45 The Whisky Exchange, £41.19 Ocado, 40% Smooth, rich, typically Irish. Jameson Caskmates Stout Edition £24 Ocado, 40% Two Irish drinks for the price of one: the stout adds a nice bitterness. Pom’O Apple Port 500ml at The Dairy, London SW4; or online, 17% Sweet with a lovely, natural apple flavour.

Now a new campaign from the anti-waste charity Love Food Hate Waste is urging consumers to freeze bread and toast it straight from the freezer, and to consider eating toast as a snack at any time of day. The campaign, run by the government’s food waste advisory body Wrap, is focusing on adults between 18 and 34 after a new poll found that 69% of Britons in that age bracket admit to throwing bread away every week. Some 26% in this age group say they know you can freeze bread, but do not do it themselves. Previous research from Wrap showed that if everyone in the UK threw away on average three fewer slices of bread a week, the nation’s bread waste mountain would disappear. The new study also found that more than half of those polled (56%) eat bread at least four days a week, with just under a third (31%) consuming it every day. The majority enjoy it for breakfast and lunch, with only 19% having it at dinner and 23% as a snack. In the UK in 2015 alone, £13bn of edible food was thrown away from households. In total, 7.3m tonnes of food was thrown away.
