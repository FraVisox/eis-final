It just isn’t the police officer who shot him. Lakeith Smith was sentenced last week to 30 years for A’Donte’s murder, even though no one disputes it was an officer’s bullet that killed him. Smith is not even accused of having possessed a weapon. Under the state’s accomplice law, co-defendants can be guilty of murder if a death occurs when they are in the midst of committing a felony. Smith was one of five teens who were allegedly committing a burglary when responding officers opened fire, killing A’Donte. Smith, now 18, was also sentenced to another 35 years for crimes related to the the burglary, for a total of 65 years. “Because the sentences are consecutive, it will be a long time before he comes up for even the possibility for parole, at least 20 to 25 years,” prosecutor CJ Robinson said. “We are very pleased with this sentence.” Smith was the only one of the four surviving co-defendants to decline a plea deal. Under the deal he was offered, Smith would have served only 25 years. The other defendants are awaiting sentencing. According to juvenile justice reform advocates, youth defendants are often charged on accomplice statues. Situations like the one in Alabama, however, are rare. “This is certainly an uncommon case,” said Jeree Thomas, the policy director of the Campaign for Youth Justice (CFYG). “The defendant’s accomplice wasn’t even involved in the killing, it was a totally third-party, but they prosecuted him anyway.” Marcy Mistreet, the CFYG chief executive, added: “It just speaks to the excessive power that prosecutors have in our system to even seek these kinds of charges.” All but four states have some form of the law that Smith was charged under, which are usually referred to as felony-murder laws. At least a dozen, including Alabama, allow for individuals who commit a felony that ends in a death to be charged with murder even if the person killed is their own accomplice. Advocates say that, generally speaking, felony-murder laws are necessary in the same way racketeering laws are. A group of people may have different roles in the commission of a crime, but they are criminally responsible in the end. “If you have three people run into a bank and they have guns, and there’s a shooting, it doesn’t matter who pulled the trigger,” said Kent Scheidegger, the legal director of the Criminal Justice Legal Foundation, a victims rights advocacy group. “If you storm a bank with guns, you know it’s highly likely somebody is going to get killed and you’re still responsible for it.” But even Scheidegger, who has been called the country’s “most outspoken advocate for capital punishment”, thinks the application was excessive in Smith’s case. In large part because Smith was effectively convicted of the murder of someone who – legally – was not murdered. A grand jury ruled A’Donte’s death a justifiable homicide after determining that the eldest of the group, then 19-year-old Jhavarske Jackson, fired at officers and that Washington was carrying a gun. “You can’t be an accessory if there is no principal,” Scheidegger said. Jennifer Holton, Smith’s lawyer, said in closing statements: “The law reads that you have to be a participant in the crime to be guilty. It is a tragedy that a young kid was killed. It will be an injustice if you hold Lakeith responsible.” Jurors took less than 90 minutes to hand down a guilty verdict."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2018/apr/12/facebook-how-to-quit-delete-account-addiction-what-to-do","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-12T07:01:24Z","webTitle":"I'm angry at Facebook – but I'm also addicted.

How do I break free?","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"I am too far in to leave Facebook, but I want to register my disapproval of the company after their part in the data leak to Cambridge Analytica. What should I do? Ah, the urge to punish without denying yourself pleasure, if that’s what using Facebook can even be called at this point. But I understand your quandary: officially, I “hate” Facebook, the way I hate Amazon (which I still use) and hate my local supermarket for charging $7 for a loaf of bread because it’s another 10 blocks before you get to Trader Joe’s. But I still use them, too. First, of course, you should take what are now very well-publicized measures to tighten up the security of your account, although as I write this, I realize I haven’t done so myself. The reason for this is that, in spite of everything I have read about the incredible depth of information available to those potentially buying my data, including what articles I click through to and how long I spend on them, I continue to labour under the illusion I don’t use the platform enough to have data worth sharing. I never post or upload photos; I rarely comment on the postings of others, and when I do “like” something, it is usually because I want to give a thumbs up to the friend who has posted it, rather than communicate my passion for the thing they are sharing. In this way, I kid myself, I am opaque to the data thieves. Think I like cars because I liked a recent review of an Aston Martin?! Think again, suckers; the thing I liked was the author’s decision to quit her job and go freelance to become a motoring journalist, among other things, and there is no way even you guys can get far enough into my preferences to access that kind of information. This is, obviously, deeply delusional, as is the tiny, dumb urge I have to “mess with the system” by liking every posting I see across all political and social interest groups – that’ll show ’em! – effectively spoiling the ballot paper so my profile is insane. This is idiotic for lots of reasons, but mainly because of the numbers; lest we need reminding, Facebook has 2.1 billion users worldwide and even if everyone who threatened to quit actually did, it would barely cause a ripple on Facebook’s surface. And yet the instinct to get back at them is very strong. Without needing to do anything, there is some solace to be had, perhaps, in the knowledge that even though for years now Facebook has operated as a business whose primary function is to funnel consumer eyeballs to advertisers, one gets the impression that its upper management are still deeply invested in the idea of themselves as radical disrupters who are helping the world. Perhaps this is hopelessly naive, but from Zuckerberg and Sandberg down, it’s hard not to believe that the damage done by Cambridge Analytica to Facebook’s self-image – as a company less interested in making money than profoundly expanding our horizons etc – must surely make a small dent in their extraordinary self-righteousness. From a practical point of view, I have no idea how to wean myself off the platform, but I do know that, as with all addictions, acknowledgement is the first step to recovery. I was always hesitant to share pictures of my kids online and that reluctance has now hardened to a rule. And understanding that Facebook is not a neutral platform but a delivery system for corporate and political interests surely goes some way towards changing one’s relationship with it and becoming more sophisticated consumers of a potentially damaging product. If one is realistic about the chances of actually ditching Facebook to spend more time reading books or taking walks in the country, or talking to one’s children, then perhaps this scepticism will have to be punishment enough. After all, we interact with loathsome companies everyday; the error is believing them when they tell us they’re friends."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/apr/11/was-irelands-italia-90-vintage-the-world-cups-most-cosmopolitan-side","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-11T09:01:27Z","webTitle":"Was Ireland's Italia '90 vintage the World Cup's most cosmopolitan side?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/apr/11/was-irelands-italia-90-vintage-the-world-cups-most-cosmopolitan-side","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/apr/11/was-irelands-italia-90-vintage-the-world-cups-most-cosmopolitan-side","fields":{"headline":"Was Ireland's Italia '90 vintage the World Cup's most cosmopolitan side?","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"In response to Sam Waller’s question about international squads with the most players born abroad, we found a modern front-runner in Morocco, whose last squad had 20 of 28 players who were born outside the country – or 71.43%. As Ben Raza and others have pointed out, there was a memorable contender at Italia ‘90: “If we’re going to talk about home nations naming a squad where the majority of players were not born within that country, it’s hard to look beyond the Republic of Ireland in 1990, who named 16 foreign-born players in their 22-man squad,” says Ben. “The English-born players were: Chris Morris (Newquay), Mick McCarthy (Barnsley), Paul McGrath (Ealing), John Aldridge (Liverpool), Tony Cascarino (St Paul’s Cray in Kent), David O’Leary (Stoke Newington), Andy Townsend (Maidstone), Chris Hughton (Forest Gate), John Sheridan (Stretford), David Kelly and Gerry Peyton (both Birmingham), and both John Byrne and Alan McLoughlin were from Manchester. There was also one Glaswegian (Ray Houghton), fellow Scot Bernie Slaven (Paisley), and a Welshman (Kevin Sheedy from Builth Wells). That’s 16 out of 22 players, or 72.73%.” “The 1994 squad was similarly stacked with other ‘foreigners’ – 15 by my reckoning, including Terry Phelan, Alan Kernaghan, Phil Babb, Eddie McGoldrick, Jason McAteer and Alan Kelly were all born in England, whilst Tommy Coyne was a Scot. That’s 15 by my reckoning. However as Terry Phelan said in an interview around this time, not only did he feel Irish but ‘I’ve even got green eyes.’ So there you are.” Can anyone top that? Email or tweet @TheKnowledge_GU Sturming Graz comeback “In Group 1 of qualifying for the U-19 European Championship, the Netherlands beat Norway 6-1 in the opener,” wrote Stephan Wijnen last week. “Despite this, Norway still managed to win the four-team, three-match group (with a goal difference of -1) and the Netherlands finished bottom. Has any other country or club team ever won a group stage after such a bad start?” “In the 2000–01 Champions League, Sturm Graz started their Group D campaign with a 5-0 defeat against Rangers, but still went on to win the group,” says Dirk Maas. The Austrian outfit had five games to turn things around, but also lost their second away game 5-0 to Monaco. Graz won all three of their home games to go through above Galatasaray, with both sides on a negative goal difference, while Monaco and Rangers went out with positive goal differences. Legends return We’ve had plenty more shouts for players who have turned out in ‘legends’ teams despite barely, or never, playing for the clubs in question. “Up in Scotland, ‘Chic’ Charnley has been known to turn out for Celtic Masters/ Legends despite Celtic not being one the 15 clubs he represented during a 20 year career,” says Colin Armstrong. Staying in Scotland, the enigmatic Greg (no surname) nominates Sebastian Rozental (Rangers, 21 appearances), while Robin Renganathan takes us back to that Liverpool-Bayern game. “Zvjezdan Misimovic played only three first-team games for Bayern Munich and represented them as a ‘legend’ in the 5-5 against Liverpool.” Finally, as Sean De Loughry points out, sometimes players in legends matches have never played professionally at all. “A Manchester United Legends team that played in Ireland in recent years included two substitutes who had bid for their place on the bench, with a guaranteed 15-minute run out.” Knowledge archive “Given the rather precarious world economic climate, have any clubs been forced to take up a sideline business to stay afloat?” wonders Fergal McMahon back in 2009. Life is all well and good in the world of football global branding, especially for the world’s leading clubs. But spare a thought for those a little further down the ladder, such as Croatian third division outfit NK Nedeljanec. In 2004, when officials publicly revealed Nedeljanec’s financial strife, a plan was hatched by dedicated fans to save their team’s skins: the sale of potatoes, six tonnes of which were collected and then sold to raise club funds. “No one here has much money, but we have lots of potatoes to sell,” fans’ chief Ivan Fosnar told the Jutarnji List newspaper. “It is the least we can do seeing as we are so near to promotion to the second division. We’ll do everything we can to help our club. It is not a problem to donate these potatoes if that will be enough to save the club.” Grateful Nedeljanec officials had no, ahem, chip on their shoulder and accepted the donation, which they admitted would help the club survive until the end of the season.

Mike Rayment and others have pointed out that Ilunga claims to have kicked the ball away deliberately in a protest over bonuses. “I did that deliberately,” Ilunga said in 2010. “I was aware of football regulations. I did not have a reason to continue getting injured while those who will benefit financially were sitting on the terraces watching.

A match featuring two sendings off – the first, involving Liverpool’s Alex Greenwood, was highly controversial – concluded with second-half goals lifting the Lionesses two points clear of Wales. For a while it had seemed as if England were about to take a wrong turn along the road to the 2019 finals in France. By the final whistle, though, Neville had secured the second victory of his five games in charge and was all smiles. “We talked about Bosnia parking the bus but this was parking three or four buses,” he said. “It was football like I had never seen before. It was a patient performance. We had to wait but the girls stuck at it. The first goal was always going to be key.” After playing in front of a 25,000-plus crowd at Southampton, where they were held 0-0 by Wales last Friday, the Lionesses were watched by a few hundred locals on a mountain fringed practice pitch in Zenica. Yet if the Bosnian football federation’s training centre was low on atmosphere and spectators, Samira Hurem’s side exhibited a fierce determination to frustrate their guests at every turn. England were required to deconstruct a deep-sitting, extremely conservative, physical, 4-5-1 formation with the early moment when Mel Lawley was sent sprawling following Milena Nikolic’s wince-inducing challenge proving thoroughly emblematic. Ranked 57th in the world, Hurem’s players were dominated by their opponents but nonetheless soon had England jettisoning sweet passing ideals in favour of a series of long diagonal balls. Envera Hasanbegovic, Bosnia’s goalkeeper, looked uncertain on crosses but, protected by that reassuring defensive blanket, was surprisingly underworked in a low-key first half. Its highlight was Hasanbegovic’s diversion of Jade Moore’s eye-catching, top-corner bound, 30-yard shot as the keeper demonstrated that shot stopping is her skill. If England could not be blamed for turning slightly direct against such bloody-minded opponents, they initially lacked sharpness and incision. Although Moore, especially, did some very good things in a holding midfield capacity, her team could have done with a few more crisp one- and two-touch passing moves. As Hasanbegovic repelled Ellen White’s header Neville cut an increasingly frustrated presence. Watching Amira Spahic collect a booking for time-wasting after delaying taking a Bosnia throw it was easy to appreciate why. With his side largely restricted to long-range speculation, Neville’s problems intensified two minutes into the second half when, following a perceived dive, Greenwood, already booked for dissent, received her second yellow card despite the left-back having a case for a penalty for what looked like a trip. As he consoled a tearful Greenwood, Neville must have been aware that this was the sort of game which his tactically intelligent predecessor Mark Sampson invariably found a way to win. The new manager’s mood visibly improved when the increasingly inventive Duggan – who is now at Barcelona – volleyed beyond Hasanbegovic after connecting with Lawley’s superb cross. “Toni scored a brilliant goal,” Neville said. “She was fantastic.” Shortly afterwards Spahic was dismissed for her second bookable offence, a tug on Beth Mead, the Arsenal forward having just replaced Lawley. Duggan’s 25-yard left-foot drive hit the woodwork, Hasanbegovic saved White’s volley and Mead’s excellent movement ruffled Bosnia’s backline. When the latter was felled by Lidija Kulis, England won a late penalty. Hasanbegovic dived the right way but could not deny Taylor – newly on for Duggan – her 17th goal in 37 internationals."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/apr/11/killer-robot-weapons-autonomous-ai-warfare-un","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-11T09:00:00Z","webTitle":"We’re running out of time to stop killer robot weapons | Bonnie Docherty","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/11/killer-robot-weapons-autonomous-ai-warfare-un","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/11/killer-robot-weapons-autonomous-ai-warfare-un","fields":{"headline":"We’re running out of time to stop killer robot weapons","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"It’s five years this month since the launch of the Campaign to Stop Killer Robots, a global coalition of non-governmental groups calling for a ban on fully autonomous weapons. This month also marks the fifth time that countries have convened at the United Nations in Geneva to address the problems these weapons would pose if they were developed and put into use. The countries meeting in Geneva this week are party to a major disarmament treaty called the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons. While some diplomatic progress has been made under that treaty’s auspices since 2013, the pace needs to pick up dramatically. Countries that recognise the dangers of fully autonomous weapons cannot wait another five years if they are to prevent the weapons from becoming a reality. Fully autonomous weapons, which would select and engage targets without meaningful human control, do not yet exist, but scientists have warned they soon could. Precursors have already been developed or deployed as autonomy has become increasingly common on the battlefield. Hi-tech military powers, including China, Israel, Russia, South Korea, the UK and the US, have invested heavily in the development of autonomous weapons. So far there is no specific international law to halt this trend. Experts have sounded the alarm, emphasising that fully autonomous weapons raise a host of concerns. For many people, allowing machines that cannot appreciate the value of human life to make life-and-death decisions crosses a moral red line. Legally, the so-called “killer robots” would lack human judgment, meaning that it would be very challenging to ensure that their decisions complied with international humanitarian and human rights law. For example, a robot could not be preprogrammed to assess the proportionality of using force in every situation, and it would find it difficult to judge accurately whether civilian harm outweighed military advantage in each particular instance. Fully autonomous weapons also raise the question: who would be responsible for attacks that violate these laws if a human did not make the decision to fire on a specific target? In fact, it would be legally difficult and potentially unfair to hold anyone responsible for unforeseeable harm to civilians. There are also security concerns. Without any legal restraints on fully autonomous weapons, militaries could engage in an arms race, vying to develop deadly technology that may lower the need to deploy soldiers – while possibly lowering the threshold to armed conflict. The Campaign to Stop Killer Robots, which Human Rights Watch co-founded and coordinates, argues that new international laws are needed to preempt the development, production and use of fully autonomous weapons. Many roboticists, faith leaders, Nobel peace laureates and others have reached the same conclusion, as is evident from their open letters, publications and UN statements: the world needs to prevent the creation of these weapons because once they appear in arsenals, it will be too late. At the UN meeting going on now, one of two week-long sessions that will take place this year, countries are striving to craft a working definition of the weapons in question and to recommend options to address the concerns they raise. The countries have offered several possible ways to proceed. The momentum for a preemptive prohibition is clearly growing. As of Monday, the African Group and Austria have joined 22 other countries voicing explicit support for a ban. Other countries have aligned themselves with a French/German proposal for a political declaration, a set of nonbinding guidelines that would be an interim solution at best. Still others have explicitly expressed opposition to a preemptive prohibition and a preference for relying on existing international law. Despite this divergence of opinion, the discussion on the first day had a significant common thread. Almost all countries that spoke talked about the need for some degree of human control over the use of force. The widespread recognition that humans must have control over life-and-death decisions is heartening. If countries agree that such control needs to be truly meaningful, a requirement for human control and a prohibition on weapons that operate without such control are two sides of the same coin. These developments are positive, but the countries meeting this week clearly have much work ahead of them. To stay in front of technology, they should negotiate and adopt a new legally binding ban by the end of 2019. Only then will they have a chance to prevent the creation of a weapon that could revolutionise warfare in a frightening way. • Bonnie Docherty is a senior arms researcher at Human Rights Watch and associate director of armed conflict and civilian protection at Harvard Law School’s International Human Rights Clinic"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"business/2018/apr/10/dow-jones-rallies-strongly-after-china-promises-lower-tariffs","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-10T17:10:38Z","webTitle":"Dow Jones rallies strongly after China promises lower tariffs","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/apr/10/dow-jones-rallies-strongly-after-china-promises-lower-tariffs","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/apr/10/dow-jones-rallies-strongly-after-china-promises-lower-tariffs","fields":{"headline":"Dow Jones rallies strongly after China promises lower tariffs","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Wall Street has staged a sharp recovery after the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, promised economic reforms and lower import tariffs, soothing fears over the country’s simmering trade standoff with the US. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained by more than 500 points in early trading on Tuesday in New York, and ended the day 429 points up at 24,408. The biggest gains were tech stocks and companies such as Boeing and Caterpillar, which were seen to be among the biggest potential losers from a trade war between the world’s two biggest economies. European shares also rallied amid renewed hope for a solution in the trade showdown triggered by Donald Trump, with the FTSE 100 ending the day 1% higher at 7,266. The pound rose on international exchanges after Bank of England rate-setter Ian McCafferty said Threadneedle Street “shouldn’t dally” when it comes to raising the cost of borrowing – expected by investors from as early as next month. In his first public comments since the trade dispute started with Trump, Xi used a speech in Beijing to promise to open up the country’s economy. He also said China would raise the foreign ownership limit for companies operating in the nation’s aircraft, shipbuilding and motor industries. “This year, we will considerably reduce auto import tariffs and at the same time reduce import tariffs on some other products,” he said. The better news for investors comes after warmer words from both Beijing and Washington in the latest signs of a climbdown from the brink of a potentially damaging trade war. Writing in the Guardian, the Chinese ambassador to the UK said such an economic conflict “should and can be avoided”. While warning China had no choice but to take firm counter-actions in the face of Trump using the “law of the jungle” for trade disputes, Liu Xiaoming wrote: “China has not, however, closed the door to negotiations and consultations. On the contrary, we will continue to deepen reform and open up on all fronts with a view to building closer trade and economic partnerships with the world.” Seeking to solve the standoff through established international channels, China filed a complaint with the World Trade Organisation challenging Trump’s tariff plans for steel and aluminium imports, with the country asking for 60 days of consultations with the US. If those talks should fail, the next step would be for a panel of trade experts to make a ruling. In Britain, the biggest risers on the FTSE 100 included mining companies such as Anglo American and Glencore, which gained because of investors’ hopes that a resolution to the US-Sino trade dispute would reduce the likelihood of US punitive tariffs on commodities. The Trump administration has outlined $50bn of import tariffs on Chinese goods arriving in America, which China then said it would match for US imports. Trump then said he would consider an additional $100bn on Chinese products, raising the stakes and rattling financial markets last week. However, the US president said on Sunday that Beijing would ease trade barriers “because it is the right thing to do”, in a move that was seen as easing fears over the brewing trade war. Joshua Mahony of financial spreadbetting firm IG said: “Talk of China easing their import restrictions are helping drive global market sentiment higher.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2018/apr/10/letter-stephane-audran-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-10T16:17:36Z","webTitle":"Letter: Stéphane Audran was the perfect Cara in Brideshead Revisited","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/apr/10/letter-stephane-audran-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2018/apr/10/letter-stephane-audran-obituary","fields":{"headline":"Letter: Stéphane Audran was the perfect Cara in Brideshead Revisited","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"As the producer of Granada’s 13-hour television version of Evelyn Waugh’s Brideshead Revisited, I remember casting the net wide in our search for the actress to play Cara, the mistress of the exiled Lord Marchmain. But how lucky we were in Stéphane Audran. No actress could have confounded more absolutely Charles Ryder’s lurid expectation of “a voluptuous Toulouse-Lautrec odalisque”, or fitted more perfectly Waugh’s own conception: a “middle-aged, well-preserved, well-dressed, well-mannered woman”, the “neat prosaic figure” who briskly marshalled her two undergraduate charges, Ryder and Sebastian Flyte, as she guided them on their tour of the splendours of Venice. Audran was an actress of great subtlety. In a later scene in Marchmain Palazzo (filmed in the Palazzo Barbaro), in which she gently confronted Charles with the truth about his relationship with Sebastian, her delicate expressiveness provided a masterclass in intimate scene playing. Away from the set, Audran was an engaging colleague who offered a sometimes surprising twist to the workaday travails of a long location shoot. “Derek, who do you think I met today walking across the Yorkshire dales?” There was a second’s pause: “Derek, it was my skiing instructor.” What followed was a charmingly persuasive request for Granada to add another supernumerary to the hotel budget.

I was so happy, but I was also scared: had I died?” It was 2006, and Clemantine and her sister, Claire, thought they were being invited to appear on the Oprah Winfrey show to discuss their experiences of the Rwandan genocide. But, unbeknown to the sisters, the show’s producers had flown their family in from Africa. The last time they had seen their parents was in 1994, but although they knew they were alive, they had been able to speak only by phone and had no idea when they would be able to meet; they had also missed the birth of a new brother and sister, then aged eight and five. They’d had, Clemantine says, an idyllic childhood, growing up in the Rwandan capital, Kigali: her father ran a taxi business and her mother’s life centred on the family garden, where they grew mangoes, lemons and papayas alongside hibiscus, geraniums and peonies. The family were Tutsis, although that didn’t seem significant until the slaughter began. For Clemantine, the first sign of trouble was when her parents started to talk in whispers. Neighbours were disappearing, and there were loud, ugly sounds in the air that her brother Pudi said were thunder (Pudi survived the genocide, but died of meningitis before the reunion). One day, her mother told Clemantine, then six, and Claire, 15, to pack because she was sending them to their grandmother’s farm a few hours south. Her parents had hoped they’d be safe there, but a few days later there was a knock at the door and her grandmother told the girls to run. They ran; her grandmother, cousins, aunts and uncles were killed. The only thing Clemantine managed to take with her was a rainbow towel. “I held on to it. Claire and I lived on fruit. Days were for hiding, nights were for walking. Suddenly, we were refugees.” They remained refugees for the next six years, wandering through seven African countries. Clemantine’s book, published this week, details the highs and lows of that extraordinary journey: the refugee camps, foraging for food, the illnesses and unexpected kindnesses that taught them how to hold on to hope. Finally, when Clemantine was 12, she and Claire were given asylum in the US – She went to live with a family in Chicago and Claire, who by then had children of her own, lived nearby. In those early years in the US, Claire had a cleaning job, and Clemantine often helped her out. “We didn’t have a TV, but we discovered Oprah by watching it where we were working. We’d always make sure we were cleaning the sitting room at 4pm so we could catch her show. Claire used to say, ‘We’ll meet her one day, I just know we will.’” Clemantine entered a high school essay-writing competition, organised by Oprah’s show, about Night, Elie Wiesel’s book about the Holocaust, and why it was still relevant. She wrote about her experiences in Rwanda, which led her to Oprah. When the sisters were invited on, they could hardly contain their excitement. “They put us up in a hotel, and we thought, ‘This is insane: we’re going to meet Oprah!’ We spent hours getting ready.” Clemantine and Claire were in the audience when, midway through the recording, Oprah spoke to them from the stage. She asked Clemantine how long it had been since she and Claire had seen their parents, then she held up an envelope and said she had a letter from them. “She called us on to the stage,” Clemantine says. “Claire was holding on to me, she was shaking. Oprah handed me the letter and I began to open it, but then Oprah put her hand on mine. She said: ‘You don’t have to read it right now, in front of all these people, because… your family is here! We have flown your family here.’” Clemantine couldn’t believe what she was hearing. “I’d been praying and hoping for so long that I’d see my family – it was the constant thought in my mind. I remember when we were in South Africa, there was a man who looked exactly like my dad and I used to wait for him on the street when I knew he’d be passing, just so I could see him.” Now, with no warning , she was being swept up into her father’s arms, hugging her mother, cuddling her siblings. “Everyone was crying: everyone in the audience, all the crew. Everywhere you looked, there was someone with tears running down their face. They had to have a 30-minute break, just to give people time to recover, before they went back to recording the show.” In her book, Clemantine recalls how, after the show, the family were driven by limo across the city to Claire’s apartment. “Nobody talked in the car. In the apartment, nobody knew what to do, either. My mother, in her long blue dress, kept sitting down and standing up and touching everything. My father kept smiling, as if someone he mistrusted was taking pictures of him. Claire remained nearly catatonic: rocking, stone-faced.” Over the next couple of days, they went sightseeing in the botanic garden and for a ride on a ferris wheel, and then, on Monday morning, Clemantine’s parents and her siblings flew back to Rwanda. Clemantine went back to school. *** Today, Clemantine’s family have all moved to the US. They live in Chicago, and she lives in San Francisco. Now 30, she works as a human rights advocate. But the years of separation, she says, have left deep scars. “Claire and I are different people, and it’s hard to connect with our parents, because so much was taken away from us. When we’re together, we don’t really know where to begin; it’s difficult even to have a conversation.” She devoted her studies to researching the effects of family separation; she’s fascinated, she says, by how people are affected by loss, and what can and can’t be recovered after a family is ruptured. For her part, Oprah described the onscreen reunion as “one of the deepest, most joyful moments I’ve ever experienced”, calling it “beautiful… raw, raw, raw… pure”. What, though, does Clemantine make of it, 12 years later: was it right, or fair, that she and Claire were put through such a pivotal, emotional experience with no warning, and in front of millions? “You know, when people watch that clip they always feel something. Some feel joy, some feel sadness, some feel confusion, some feel anger. But for everyone it’s a trigger-point for something, and what I think it does, more than anything, is underline the power of our stories and the power of sharing our stories. Everywhere I go in the world, people have watched that moment and know what happened. I met someone from Australia who told me that clip had changed her life. So whatever anyone feels about it, it’s testament to the power of the human story and the power of reunion. I feel happy about that.” • The Girl Who Smiled Beads: A Story Of War And What Comes After, by Clemantine Wamariya and Elizabeth Weil, is published by Hutchinson at £16.99.

What should I wear? Sara, by email An excellent question and one I ask myself most days, because I generally work from home and while working from home does remove certain quandaries from your life – such as: “How long can I tolerate this commute until sweet death releases me?” and: “Sweet Jesus, how many times is Geoff from Accounts going to clear his throat, does he have a literal frog down there and, if so, can I go over and pull it out with my fist?” – others take their place. Nature, vacuum, etc. So while I no longer, thank goodness, have to endure the London tube every rush hour, I do find myself facing daily existential questions such as: “How do I stop myself from snacking from the fridge literally all goddamn day?” and: “If I’m not actually leaving the house, do I have to leave my bed?” Questions, questions. Clothing, of course, comes under this umbrella of new questions. Why bother to dress if you’re not going outside? To quote that famous philosophical saying, “If you wear an unironed shirt and no one sees it, was the shirt actually ironed?” The new homeworker tends to go through three phases with their clothes before settling down into something that works. The first is the pyjama phase, when you’re so excited about no longer having to go into an office that you celebrate by staying in your pyjamas for a day, three days, maybe five – what does it matter, right? But the thrill quickly wanes, partly because the postman starts giving you looks (and, as a homeworker, you will now be the drop-off depot for all of your neighbours’ Amazon, Asos, Argos, Ikea, Boots and John Lewis deliveries, so you will see an awful lot of your postman). But mainly because it starts to feel gross. Working in your pyjamas is a lot like working from bed (and the two often go together): it seems like such a great idea when you start, but you realise that if you’re dressed for bed, your brain will thinks it’s bedtime and totally fuzz out. So, not pyjamas is the first rule of homeworking. The next phase is when you react against pyjamas by dressing up – as if you’re going to work. This works for some people. Putting on a suit or smart dress gets them in the work mindset, I guess. I have a friend who likes to work from home in party dresses, as they make her feel like she is a) on it and b) having fun, even though she is sitting in her living room and knocking out more advertising copy. And that’s great – give that a go, see if it works for you. It absolutely never did for me. It just felt silly, as if I was some pathetic character in a movie, possibly one directed by the Coen brothers, who had been sacked and now sat at home in his suit, pretending nothing had happened. So, as I tend to do in all things, I go for the middle option (#centristhomeworker) and dress in clothes that are as comfortable as pyjamas but aren’t actually pyjamas. For me, this means cheering tracksuit bottoms, T-shirts, and slim-fitting jumpers. What do I mean by “cheering tracksuit bottoms”? Glad you asked! Ones that are not shapeless and depressing, but fit nicely, are colourful, and maybe even have rainbow stripes down the side. Asos.com is your answer here, and as you now work from home you’ll be there to accept its deliveries. I find that wearing a slim-fitting jumper – not a massive baggy thing that flops annoyingly over your hands when you’re typing – makes the tracksuit feel a little smarter so your brain doesn’t go into fuzz-out mode. As a kid, when I imagined my adult life, I sort of imagined myself as dressing like Melanie Griffith in Working Girl, striding around in a skirt suit. Instead, I sit around at home all day in a tracksuit. And because I’m such an adult, I’m good with that."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"world/2018/apr/10/letter-cardinal-keith-o-brien-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-10T15:09:19Z","webTitle":"Letter: Cardinal Keith O’Brien supported peace campaigners","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/10/letter-cardinal-keith-o-brien-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/apr/10/letter-cardinal-keith-o-brien-obituary","fields":{"headline":"Letter: Cardinal Keith O’Brien supported peace campaigners","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"In 2010 Cardinal Keith O’Brien visited our Quaker-based Peace and Justice group in Cumbria to speak about Trident, the UK’s weapon of mass destruction based at Holy Loch in Scotland.

The best memorial to all those who have lost their lives in Grenfell is that we as a nation choose collectively to invest in safe and secure public housing for all who need it.” This, Boughton’s first book, isn’t a reworking of the blog but an original work whose purpose is to argue passionately for that idea. For the past few years his writing has been an elegant and compendious ongoing exploration of Britain’s social history through its council estates. The book celebrates an era during which dreams of shelter and security for all – not just those who could afford to purchase it – were in large part made a reality, and asks us if we oughtn’t to consider reviving that dream before it gets destroyed completely. Some five million homes were built by and on behalf of local authorities in the first three-quarters of the last century, reaching a point where, at the end of the 1970s, around a third of all households, more than 40% of the population, lived in council housing. The gargantuan political and physical effort this took, Boughton argues, transformed society largely for the better. It saved an untold number of lives and gave dignity and security to millions. Britain’s first municipal housing, built at Vauxhall in north Liverpool in 1869, was established on the advice of Liverpool’s first medical officer William Duncan, who was among the first to establish a link between insanitary housing conditions and poor health. One third of the working-age population – 86,000 – – 86,000 people – were squashed into just over 2,000 cramped blocks, with a further 38,000 living in cellars. In Ancoats, central Manchester, a report by the physician John Thresh concluded that 3,000 to 4,000 people were “dying annually from remediable causes” – causes remedied, in other words, by decent housing. Piecemeal attempts at finding ways to “rescue” better-off – and socially better-regarded – working-class tenants from slum conditions came in the Victorian period from industrialists and investors who benefited from “5% philanthropy”, named after the promised rate of return on house-building schemes for artisans and clerks who tended to earn enough money to pay the higher rents. It took two world wars for local and central government to address slum clearance and to commission mass housing schemes which met the needs of growing cities. Quality and size went up and down according to whether Labour or the Tories were in government: Labour’s first years in power from 1924 were marked by improved minimum standards for council dwellings, which were reversed by the post-crash National government in the 1930s, leading to many pinched, uniform interwar flats. Nye Bevan famously instituted luxurious minimum standards for his postwar council houses, which averaged 1,055sq ft for a three-bedroomed house with a bathroom and separate lavatory. He condemned the interwar estates as “castrated communities” –the housing meant solely for working-class people who were taught they should be grateful for what they got – rather than council housing so good that anyone on any income would want to live in it. But Harold Macmillan, who became housing minister in 1951, built a larger number of smaller, cynically named “people’s houses”. One word Boughton keeps coming back to in his account of “the rise and fall of council housing” is “decency”. It can be used romantically, he acknowledges, as a kind way of overlooking how brutal living conditions can come to brutalise those who endure them. But it also sums up his view of what, and whom, council housing is for: a sense of societal decency and fairness, in which every member enjoys comfort and safety. Tories have always tended to see it as compensatory and temporary: you use it when you can’t buy your own, and only until you can buy your own. Historically, Labour tried to maintain a sense that council housing was for anyone who wanted it, a tenure as valid as ownership. We know which view has won out since the “right to buy” became law in 1980. The massive popularity of discounted home ownership among sitting tenants seemed to confirm the emerging neoliberal view that all anyone wants is individual control over individual goods. Yet the massive shift to private renting in the past decade – at best, unsatisfactory, at worst, dangerous – partly resulting from a diminished stock of council housing has brought more people into contact with the sharp end of housing insecurity and unaffordability. Housing has been rising steadily up the political agenda since the 2008 crash; the causes and consequences of the Grenfell fire made that concern a matter of urgency.

UK record labels enjoyed a 10.6% surge in earnings in 2017 to £839m, thanks to the digital popularity of a new generation of artists including Ed Sheeran, Sam Smith, Dua Lipa and Stormzy. It was the fastest growth since 1995, when Oasis, Blur and Pulp created a high-street CD sales frenzy. Music companies enjoyed a 45% year-on-year increase in subscription streaming revenue – from £239m in 2016 to £347m – as an industry hammered for a decade by illegal piracy now enjoys the success of music lovers turning to legitimate services such as Spotify, Apple Music and Amazon Music. Royalty income from the sale of CDs, which have been in decline since the onset of the digital music era almost two decades ago, edged up 0.7% on the previous year to £246.9m in 2017. Record labels may be enjoying the fruits of new-found digital growth, but they say that not all tech companies are treating the industry fairly. The report from music industry body, BPI, shows that labels and their artists earn more than double the royalties from vinyl record sales than they did from payments from the viewing of music videos on Google-owned YouTube last year. UK vinyl sales grew for the 10th consecutive year to a 26-year high of 4.1m units, driven by albums from Liam Gallagher, Fleetwood Mac and the Guardians of the Galaxy film soundtracks, generating £55m in royalties. By contrast, music video streaming, dominated by YouTube, which made ad revenue from more than 25bn UK music video streams last year, funnelled just £27m to the industry. This was a small increase on the £23.3m paid out in 2016. By comparison, revenues from LP sales rose a healthy 23.6% year on year, from £44.6m to £55m. Last year, a leaked memo from Steve Cooper, the chief executive of Warner Music, said its new deal with YouTube was so one-sided that it couldn’t be called a “free market, willing buyer, willing seller” negotiation. “Government action is is needed to remedy the continuing ‘value gap’ so that all digital platforms pay fairly for their use of music,” said Geoff Taylor, chief executive of the BPI and the Brit Awards. The BPI said the total £839m the labels made from streaming, downloads, physical sales and licensing for use in films, TV and computer games was the highest amount since 2010. However, it is still nearly one-third lower than the UK music industry’s peak year of 2001, when income topped £1.2bn. Taylor said there were no signs of growth slowing down, with innovations such as Amazon’s Echo smart speakers, which are promoting the playing of music around the home, and the launch of a premium music service from YouTube set to fuel further growth. “The changes labels have made to their business models and their investment in new talent have borne fruit,” Taylor said. “We are likely to see a continuing rise in 2018, with increasing awareness about consumers about the benefits of music streaming, and new developments that are likely to encourage the uptake of more subscriptions.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/apr/10/china-trade-war-usa","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-10T16:30:10Z","webTitle":"China does not want a trade war with the US, but it must defend itself | Liu Xiaoming","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/10/china-trade-war-usa","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/10/china-trade-war-usa","fields":{"headline":"China does not want a trade war with the US, but it must defend itself\r\n","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"A dark cloud hangs over China and the United States. America has announced successive protectionist tariffs pursuant to its domestic laws, forcing China to take counter-measures. The so-called “investigations” under legislation, such as section 301 of the US Trade Act of 1974, risk igniting a trade war between the world’s two biggest economies. But a trade war, which would be unpopular, damaging and anachronistic, should and can be avoided. There would be no winner in a trade war. If the Trump administration, by announcing unilateral protectionist measures, believes there could be, it must be suffering the damaging after-effects of the years in which it had a hegemonic mindset. It must also be suffering from historical amnesia. For the most recent “safeguard” tariffs – on steel by the Bush administration and on tyres from China by the Obama administration – all backfired. They did more harm than good to the US. Likewise, the previous 125 unilateral investigations carried out by the US under section 301 caused damage to many other countries, including the UK, Germany and France. Should a trade war erupt, the multilateral trade system would bear the costs, and the global economy, which is yet to fully recover from the last crisis, would be at risk again. The global trade arrangements, including the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade of 1947, and the World Trade Organisation, established in 1995, were built on international consensus, after the bitter lessons of the 1930s Great Depression and the second world war. These rules have contributed hugely to global trade and economic growth. All countries, including the US, must cherish and safeguard those achievements. To uphold the rules-based international trade regime as well as to safeguard its own legitimate rights and interests, China has taken counter-measures. The total value of our additional tariffs – first $3bn (£2bn) and then $50bn (£35bn) – is commensurate in scale with the measures taken by the US. In terms of what is affected, China’s measures cover 234 US products, far fewer than the over 1,300 Chinese products on the US proposed tariff list. China did not announce its counter list or file for WTO dispute settlement until the US refused to respond to our request for consultations over trade compensation within the WTO framework. Raising tariffs will not balance America’s books because the real problem is its excessive consumption and low savings rate. The trade imbalance with China is further aggravated by the long-term US restriction on high-tech exports to China. China, for example, imported $260.1bn of integrated circuit in 2017, but only $10.2bn, or 3.9% of that, came from the US. The Trump administration is putting domestic law above international law and forcing America’s trading partners to make concessions. It is tantamount to returning the international trade order to the “law of the jungle”. In the face of this, China had no choice but to take firm counter actions. China has not, however, closed the door to negotiations and consultations. On the contrary. We will continue to deepen reform and open up on all fronts with a view to building closer trade and economic partnerships with the world. This basic national policy will not change. China has set the goal of importing $24tn of goods in the next 15 years. To begin with, the first International Import Expo will be held in Shanghai in November. This will be China’s invitation to the world to share the opportunities offered by its fast development and huge market. It is China’s consistent position to address trade disputes through negotiations and consultations. China stands ready to carry out constructive negotiations with the US on the basis of mutual respect, equality and mutual benefit, as long as the US abandons unilateralism and trade protectionism. Since our accession to the WTO in 2001, there have been numerous trade disputes between China and the US. None has led to a large-scale trade war, and one important reason for that is that both sides respected the authority of the WTO and agreed to address differences according to its rules. Whoever ties the knot should untie it. The US should bear in mind the long-term and fundamental interests of both countries, as well as the need for a solid international trade order and sound world economy. The right way for the US to untie the knot is to stop playing the “zero-sum game”, and return to the table of negotiations and consultations. There is a Chinese adage that says, “A just cause enjoys abundant support, while an unjust one finds little.” I note that recently the spokesperson of the EU commission said that the EU does not support measures contrary to WTO regulations, and this is echoed by an increasing number of people from all sectors around the world – including the US – who voice strong opposition to trade protectionism. There is a dark cloud: but as long as the international community joins hands to safeguard the rules of international trade and to firmly oppose protectionism, I believe it can be dispelled. • Liu Xiaoming is the Chinese ambassador to Britain"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/apr/10/will-the-skripals-fully-recover-and-will-they-get-new-identities","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-10T16:16:24Z","webTitle":"Will the Skripals fully recover, and will they get new identities?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/apr/10/will-the-skripals-fully-recover-and-will-they-get-new-identities","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/apr/10/will-the-skripals-fully-recover-and-will-they-get-new-identities","fields":{"headline":"Will the Skripals fully recover, and will they get new identities?","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Where is Yulia Skripal now after being discharged from hospital? She has been taken to an undisclosed secure location. The location is a matter for the police, who remain the lead figures in the investigation, rather than the intelligence agencies. Although she is a potential material witness in the case, Yulia is free to leave if she chooses, to travel to another part of the country or abroad, or even to return to Russia. But she would have discussed with police the concerns over her safety. The fact that she has not yet spoken directly to the media has given rise to conspiracy theories, but it is understood that this was her own choice. The Russian embassy has requested access to her, as a Russian citizen. Why has this not happened? Russia blames the British government for refusing access and has asked for proof that she has rejected its approach of her own free will. The Foreign Office says she has decided herself not to meet Russian embassy officials, which suggests that she may not be planning to return to Russia any time soon. Is it true that the Skripals could be given new identities and resettled in the US with the help of the CIA? MI6 has an obligation to protect Sergei Skripal, as he was a double agent who worked for them. It would be doubly embarrassing if he was to be attacked again in the UK. But such a negotiation about resettlement seems unlikely to be conducted directly between UK and US intelligence agencies. In the end, it will be up to the Skripals where they want to live. They are free to stay in the UK, move elsewhere in Europe, or head to the US. Many Russian spies have opted to live openly in the UK and elsewhere and, until the novichok attack, the threat against them was regarded as low. Was the recording of a telephone conversation between Yulia and her cousin in Russia genuine? The initial British government response was that the conversation was genuine, but it did not confirm this, because of the circumstances surrounding the call, such as the decision at the Russian end to record it. Yulia had no problems in securing a visa to visit her father, and had been back and forth before, but the government declined to provide a visa to her cousin Viktoria, and did not offer an explanation. Will the Skripals make a full recovery? Experts say it is impossible to know at present because there is little information about the long-term impact of novichok. “The thing is with the novichok agents, we don’t really know an awful lot about them other than what has come from historical research,” said Michelle Carlin, a senior lecturer in forensic and analytical chemistry at Northumbria University. “In those cases there has been some long-term neurological damage, but then you don’t know how much they were exposed to, how quickly they were treated, versus the Skripals.” If there is neurological damage, it could take several forms. “This may include things like slowing of thought processes, a reduction of physical movement and respiratory problems – but we don’t know yet whether those will happen in this case,” said Carlin. Chris Morris, of the medical toxicology centre at Newcastle University, said the signs were positive for the Skripals, and DS Nick Bailey, the police officer who came into contact with the novichok, also appeared to have made a good recovery. “There is no reason to figure that Mr Skripal is not going to be the same,” he said. What sort of care will the Skripals need now? Morris said ongoing care would depend on how the individuals responded and, as with any traumatic event, psychological support would be important. Physiotherapy might also be necessary."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/apr/10/wall-street-sighs-with-relief-as-xi-jinping-finds-the-right-words","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-10T18:25:26Z","webTitle":"Wall Street sighs with relief as Xi Jinping finds the right words","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/10/wall-street-sighs-with-relief-as-xi-jinping-finds-the-right-words","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/apr/10/wall-street-sighs-with-relief-as-xi-jinping-finds-the-right-words","fields":{"headline":"Wall Street sighs with relief as Xi Jinping finds the right words","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"It says something when Wall Street trembles at every public statement from the leader of the free world but takes comfort from the general secretary of the Chinese communist party, but that seems to be the current state of the world. Share prices rose strongly on Tuesday from the opening after Xi Jinping pledged to lower protectionist barriers and to take seriously complaints from foreign companies about intellectual property theft. After last week’s bellicose rhetoric from Donald Trump, this was seen as an attempt by Beijing to reduce the trade tension between China and the US. Trump, it is hoped, will see Xi’s emollient words as evidence that his tough approach has worked and call victory without imposing threatened tariffs on Chinese goods. Once he has done so, China will remove the threat of retaliation. A tit-for-tat trade war will have been averted. If this sounds a bit too good to be true, that’s because it probably is. Trump has gone quiet on protectionism this week, but that’s only because his focus has temporarily switched from China to Russia, and from trade to Syria. Wall Street should not see a period of silence from the White House as a sign that peace has broken out. As Julian Evans-Pritchard, the China expert at Capital Economics, has pointed out, Xi’s concessions were less meaningful than they appeared at first blush, but were really just a bundling together of previously announced – and hitherto undelivered – pledges. Nor does Xi’s attempt to portray China as the defender of globalisation and free trade in the face of American isolationism and protectionism really stack up. China has higher tariffs than either the EU or the US, is far less open to foreign investment, and operates an economic model weighted deliberately in favour of state-run enterprises. Xi is operating a two-pronged strategy. Publicly, he is talking the language of conciliation. Privately, reports suggest that he is looking at ways in which a deliberate devaluation of the Chinese currency could counter US tariffs. That suggests that Beijing thinks Trump, unlike Wall Street, might not respond with great enthusiasm to warm words and reheated initiatives. That seems a reasonable assumption. ‘Cheer up, things couldn’t be better’ – Bank of England The Bank of England thinks it has done a remarkably good job over the past decade. Almost everybody is better off as a result of Threadneedle Street’s low interest rates and quantitative easing programme. Who thinks so? Why, the Bank of England, of course, which has had enough of carping from pensioners angry at nugatory returns on their savings and young people priced out of the housing market by the asset-price boom stimulated by cheap money. In a speech in Australia, the Bank’s chief economist, Andy Haldane, said the recession would have been deeper and more jobs would have been lost. After marking its own homework, the Bank has decided to award itself 10 out of 10 and a gold star. Monetary policy often works in subtle ways, according to Haldane, so it is not the fault of voters that they don’t easily grasp just how well they are being served by the Bank. What would help, he added, would be personal monetary policy scorecards that put a cash number on being employed and seeing the value of pensions and property go up. The Bank estimates this to be £23,000 a year for the average household. Having spent most of his speech explaining why 10 years of loose monetary policy had been good for Britain, Haldane said this should not imply that a tougher stance would be bad. If, in the face of rising inflation, a small increase in interest rates now avoided a bigger increase later, the impact would also be positive. The conclusion from this is that Haldane is inclined to vote for an increase in interest rates next month. His “Trust us, we know what we are doing” is an attempt to soften up the public for dearer borrowing. ‘The cheque is in the post’ – government Government action to tackle the late payment of suppliers by big contractors is welcome and long overdue. Whitehall departments are obliged to pay invoices within five days, but according to the commercial law firm EMW, it took one of the top 10 outsourcing firms 31 days on average to pay their suppliers in 2017, up from 29 days in 2016. Carillion took 62 days. Small businesses will doubtless greet this latest initiative with weary scepticism. They have heard this sort of talk many times before and are still waiting for it be turned into action."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2018/apr/12/messiaen-catalogue-doiseaux-aimards-birds-soar-and-sing","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-12T14:00:10Z","webTitle":"Messiaen: Catalogue d'Oiseaux – Aimard's birds soar and sing","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/apr/12/messiaen-catalogue-doiseaux-aimards-birds-soar-and-sing","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/apr/12/messiaen-catalogue-doiseaux-aimards-birds-soar-and-sing","fields":{"headline":"Messiaen: Catalogue d'Oiseaux – Aimard's birds soar and sing","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Olivier Messiaen’s Catalogue d’Oiseaux clearly means a great deal to to Pierre-Laurent Aimard, who studied with the composer and his wife, Yvonne Loriod – for whom the cycle was composed. Two years ago, Aimard marked the end of his tenure as artistic director of the Aldeburgh festival with a dawn-to-dusk performance of the pieces at Snape Maltings and the RSPB reserve at Minsmere. This, however, is the first time he has recorded the complete cycle of all 13 of the portraits of French birds, divided into seven books, which make up Messiaen’s most substantial work for piano. These discs – marking the start of a new partnership with Pentatone – show the same combination of fierce precision and marvelling fantasy that came across in the live performances at Aldeburgh. As Aimard demonstrates vividly, the Catalogue is one of the greatest, and most original, of all 20th-century keyboard works. The pieces transcend the songs on which they are based; this is much more than cosy description. There’s a virtuosic fierceness to some of the writing – in the rattling outbursts of the fourth piece, Le Traquet Stapazin (The Black-Eared Wheatear), for instance, or in the almost Lisztian flourishes that usher in the penultimate piece Le Traquet Rieur (The Black Wheatear) – while the nocturnal ruminations of the two pieces in the third book, La Chouette Hulotte (The Tawny Owl) and L’Alouette Lulu (The Woodlark), explore a darkly different world altogether. The recordings capture all that dexterity, and every nuance of the wonderfully varied keyboard colour that Aimard brings to the piano writing. The pieces are generously spread across three CDs, so that the central panel of the cycle, the half-hour long La Rousserolle Effarvatte (The Reed Warbler), has the second disc to itself. With such room to spare, it’s a shame that Aimard does not also include the piece that Messiaen composed in 1970 as a appendix to the Catalogue, La Fauvette des Jardins (The Garden Warbler), which proved to be his last major piano work, and is perhaps the finest of all his solo-piano bird portraits. As it is, though, this collection is arguably the best of the available versions of the complete Catalogue, especially as Peter Hill’s recordings (made in collaboration with Messiaen in the 1980s), appear to be currently unavailable."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2018/apr/10/belgrade-yuri-gargin-monument-head-bust-plinth-dismantled","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-10T18:14:25Z","webTitle":"Belgrade Yuri Gagarin monument shrinks away after head jibes","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/10/belgrade-yuri-gargin-monument-head-bust-plinth-dismantled","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/apr/10/belgrade-yuri-gargin-monument-head-bust-plinth-dismantled","fields":{"headline":"Belgrade Yuri Gagarin monument shrinks away after head jibes","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"In 1961, Yuri Gagarin’s legendary space flight lasted just 108 minutes. A monument in Belgrade to the first person in space did not last much longer, being swiftly dismantled after causing online hilarity owing to its curiously small head. On Sunday, a number of Serbian websites noticed that a monument to the cosmonaut had appeared on a street in the Serbian capital that beared his name. The large plinth and the small bust of Gagarin’s head prompted the website Noizz to quip: “The only way you can see it clearly is to launch yourself into the sky.” The monument’s unfortunate proportions prompted a barrage of online sarcasm and inspired an array of parodies, including the following tweet. The official unveiling was to take place on Thursday, Serbian media reported, but on Tuesday the monument was dismantled. A video published online showed a man climbing up a ladder and unceremoniously wrenching the undersized head from its plinth. Goran Vesic, a city official, said a new monument would be commissioned and would be vetted by all relevant institutions before installation. “Gagarin will have a memorial in Belgrade worthy of the contribution that he has made to humanity,” he said in a statement reported by the wesbite B92.net. There are dozens of monuments to Gagarin across the former Soviet Union. A town in western Russia close to his birthplace was renamed Gagarin in 1968 after the cosmonaut’s death in a plane crash."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2018/apr/25/flint-water-crisis-four-years-later","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-25T10:00:47Z","webTitle":"Flint crisis, four years on: what little trust is left continues to wash away","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/apr/25/flint-water-crisis-four-years-later","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/apr/25/flint-water-crisis-four-years-later","fields":{"headline":"Flint crisis, four years on: what little trust is left continues to wash away","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"LeeAnne Walters was one of the activists who brought Flint’s brown, lead-laden water to the world’s attention, thrusting plastic bottles of dingy liquid into camera lenses and the national consciousness. Four years later, you might think things have improved in the Michigan city. But Walters is still bathing her kids in bottled water, which she heats on the stove in four separate pots and a plastic bowl in the microwave. “I know as far as the lead in the water that’s OK, but it’s the lack of trust that was never rebuilt,” said Walters. “How do I put my kids in that, knowing they’ve suffered?” It is four years since the city’s water switched to the Flint river, without lead corrosion controls, prompting the public health crisis. In the aftermath, Flint received presidential visits, millions of dollars in donations and government aid. It is the subject of scientific studies. It has a Netflix series, Flint Town. Walters has now won the Goldman environmental prize for activism, which comes with a $175,000 unrestricted prize. And, importantly, the state of the water is improving. But, despite all this attention, regular people feel that little has changed since the crisis. Debra Furr-Holden, a researcher at Michigan State University who received a five-year National Institutes of Health grant to study how to deliver health resources to Flint residents, said even though federal agencies flung themselves at the city, “the impact of their presence is not known or real for the residents”. Rather, a paradox has taken hold. Most attention directed at Flint goes into cleaning up the city’s water supply, an undeniably vital goal. But it also feels like a bizarre one in a city where many people are unlikely to ever drink another drop of tap water as long as they live. “The biggest thing that people are not talking about is the psychological damage,” said Walters. “I’ve seen people go into full-on panic attacks, hyperventilating, trying to take a sip of water at a restaurant, and they just can’t do it. I know of a 17-year-old who is terrified to take a bath.” She added: “These things have not gotten better.” Multiple government workers were criminally charged over the disaster. The city switched its water supply back to Detroit’s water, away from the Flint river. But for the roughly 100,000 people who live here, the damage is done. The list of physical ailments is long. Flint resident Keri Webber’s daughter caught pneumonia-like legionnaires’ disease and has permanent lung damage. Her husband of 27 years suffered an eye stroke and has uncontrolled high blood pressure. Her daughters, variously, have kidney damage, fatty liver, anemia and lead-laden bones. Webber suffered a mini-stroke, where her memory was “fried”. When the crisis was at its worst, the family had 17 doctor’s appointments in five days. Other Flint residents have had recurring skin rashes. Gina Luster, an activist with Flint Rising, a local community group, needed a hysterectomy after she developed debilitating abdominal pain during the crisis. There were so many miscarriages in Flint that University of Kansas economists found the fertility rate dropped by 12%, and fetal death shot up by 58%. The mental scars are as tangible as the physical. Webber can only talk about water at a friend’s house – not in her family home – because her daughter has post-traumatic stress. Her daughter stopped her mother from doing dishes because she can’t stand the sound of running water; had carafes of water removed from restaurant tables as anxiety peaked; and ripped fellow students backward from water fountains when they leaned in for a drink. Webber smacks her lips three times before she says this sentence, irritated: “We’ve been guinea pigs.” The switch to the Flint river may have caused lead contamination from pipes, but it was not the river’s only problem. As early as the 1930s, fish died en masse in the river thanks to industrial pollution. High levels of bacteria, industrial waste and sewage were found in the river repeatedly over the next 90 years. “Who can land on this earth and tell a Flint resident their water is fine?” said Luster. “It’d have to be God.” Some activists believe Flint residents should receive fully covered healthcare (one called it “Flintcare”). America has the world’s most expensive healthcare, and for anyone not receiving insurance through Medicaid, a government program for the poor, bills pile up quickly. Currently, 41.9% of Flint’s residents live in poverty. Flint Rising activists said healthcare is top on the list of three demands. On 25 April, when, four years ago, officials switched Flint’s water supply, they plan to rally in Lansing, the state capital. To be sure, Flint is a town divided. Friends have been ripped apart by lawsuits, testimony and endless lobbying. Luster said that during the crisis, activists were “sleeping on each other’s couches, feeding each other’s kids. Now, a lot of us can’t even be in the same room”. But even residents independent of Flint Rising said free healthcare is a “no-brainer”. “I don’t think we should even be begging for insurance. It’s a no-brainer,” said Webber. “If this were any other town, this would not have happened. They would have insurance,” she added. Webber has Medicare, the government-run health program for elderly and disabled Americans, but even that requires her to pay about 20% of costs. Some Flint residents did receive Medicaid following the crisis, a common way for government to expand healthcare to families, usually following a natural disaster. “Even the notion that something else needs to be done to quantify the exposure is a waste of resources,” said Furr-Holden, the MSU researcher. “Water is not the worst thing that happened to Flint. Poverty and disinvestment are the worst things that happened to Flint. What the water crisis did was bring to light all the other issues.” If all Flint residents received fully funded health insurance – through an act of Congress, for example – the best recent example would be the James Zadroga Act, which established health benefits for people who responded to, worked or lived near Ground Zero on 9/11. Health officials in Flint have begun a “Flint Registry” to connect affected families to health services. New York City’s “9/11 Health Registry” is the largest in US history to track the health effects of a disaster. For LeeAnne Walters and many like her, the routine since sky-high lead levels were found in Flint’s water remains the same. Drive to the local supermarket to get water. Refill plastic gallon jugs with water not from Flint (the tap is next to boxes of water pitchers which filter lead). Do this a few times a week. Walters’ husband lives in Virginia. Every two weeks, the whole family – LeAnne, her brother Stephen, her daughter’s boyfriend Matt, and sons Garrett and Gavin (twins, seven) – pile into the minivan to head to Virginia Beach. It’s a two-week visit. Then they head home. Asked why she chose not to move to Virginia – why deal with the headache and heartache of living in Flint – she is indignant. “Because our work’s not done here,” she said, unflinching. She paused. Behind the false eyelashes she’s worn since Flint’s water caused hers to fall out, her eyes fill with tears. “Because these are my neighbors and my friends and family.” Because, she said: “You need to be able to fall apart.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"stage/2018/apr/13/tiff-stevenson-i-looked-like-a-giant-tampon","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-13T13:00:38Z","webTitle":"Tiff Stevenson: 'I looked like a giant tampon'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/apr/13/tiff-stevenson-i-looked-like-a-giant-tampon","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2018/apr/13/tiff-stevenson-i-looked-like-a-giant-tampon","fields":{"headline":"Tiff Stevenson: 'I looked like a giant tampon'","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The funniest standup I’ve ever seen ...

Did you have any similar teachers in your own life? In college, I was with this group of actors and, more than anything, I noticed how much confidence they seemed to have about their abilities. I didn’t have anything like that. And I had a voice teacher who pulled me aside and said, almost in a conspiratorial sort of tone, “I don’t know if you know this, but you know more about acting than anybody here could teach you.” He’s passed away since, but what a huge effect that had, just on my ability to believe in myself, that it didn’t matter if I wasn’t a good acting student, because on some level I knew what I was doing. You’ve described your approach as intrinsic rather than intellectual, and said your fellow acting students were better able to verbalize their processes. Was there a moment where you realized that there wasn’t a blueprint to success? Well, no, there wasn’t a moment. It was kind of like a secret – that I just didn’t tell anybody I didn’t know what I was doing. There was a paperback in an airport in some silly place of a non-authorized biography of Meryl Streep. I picked it up and flipped through it – I don’t remember the passage, and I’m certainly not going to paraphrase what she said – but it gave me the feeling that she also didn’t know, from an intellectual place, what it was that happened to make her good at what she does. All it made me feel was, maybe it’s OK that I don’t have the capacity to describe in words whatever the heck goes on. Like, God knows I’m in good company if Meryl Streep goes a similar way about it. You advocated for Nurse Jackie to die at the end of the series. Why did you feel so strongly about that, and was that informed by your own experiences with addiction? When I first read what was to be Nurse Jackie, it was not a comedy. It was very dark. Once Linda and Liz got a hold of it they lightened it up and made it funny and, someplace in there, the drug addiction came in. I have very personal feelings about that stuff because of my own addiction, but also that of many people in my life who I love. It was important to me, personally, that it be taken seriously as the epidemic that it is. I thought, “Well, look. If you guys have her doing drugs and not going to any kind of therapy or meetings or rehab with any consistency, this can’t end well.” Because that’s not fair to the viewership, who may be watching and thinking, wait a second, that’s not what happened to my family. I really wanted it to be more clear that she died at the end, but Showtime very much wanted to leave it ambiguous, so we came up with some sort of compromise. Had you ever felt so strongly about how a character of yours turned out? Never. It’s not something I’m normally involved in. I have tremendous respect for writers. It’s really so beyond my wheelhouse, to sit down with a blank paper and come up with stories and people and details. On The Sopranos, I was in such awe of what the writers could do that it would never occur to me to have ideas about my character’s arc. I often didn’t understand how Carmela fit into the larger picture, but I believed that somebody did, and I also knew that wasn’t my job. In Outside In, you were directed by Lynn Shelton, and Liz Brixius and Linda Wallem ran Nurse Jackie. Are there any differences between working on a set run by women versus more a male-dominated one like that of The Sopranos? You know, I have to say, it’s a little hard to generalize, because there are gentle men and there are bossy women. You know what I mean? It’s very much about the individual. For me, it’s really just about finding someone who is kind. Whoever is running the thing, you’ve got to be kind and open-minded and a team player. Not particularly precious about the work that they do. As I said, there are men that have been that way, and women that have been that way. So it’s sort of about the individuals. Cynthia Nixon is running for governor and recently tweeted out a video, narrated by you, in which you criticize “fake Democrats” in the New York state legislature. As a New Yorker, how do you feel about her candidacy? I know less about New York City specifically and more about the country, but as a resident there are things I care about in this city. I think it’s incredibly courageous for Cynthia to do this. For someone to say, ‘This is important to me, and I’m smart, I’m motivated, and I’m going to take on this new career and serve the people I live among.’ It can’t be easy. I’m sure she knows what she’s up against, not just Cuomo, but what we do to people in politics in our country. So I have tremendous respect for her and I think it’s very admirable. In a recent interview with Vulture, you said you hoped Louis CK gets a second chance because he “admitted that he did what he was accused of doing and admitted that it wasn’t right.” How do you gauge the sincerity and contrition of these men’s apologies? This is a very tricky topic and I don’t want to tread too heavily. There’s a lot of sensitivity right now and I have nothing but respect for all of that. I also have feelings about it. I don’t know how welcome they are. Even saying what I said about Louie there have been ramifications. With any kind of infraction, it’s very important that the person understand the gravity of what they’e done and take responsibility for it. There’s so much in flux right now, as far as this industry is concerned, and the power and strength of these movements, so like everybody else I’m watching what’s in front of me. There’s no way that this change isn’t a good thing. The chips will fall where they may. As a Buddhist, you’ve spoken about your belief in continuous consciousness, and the idea that after we die we’re rebirthed as another person or an animal, perhaps. Have you thought about what you’d be rebirthed as? According to Buddhism, when you’re born as a human, it is really quite rare and odd. Because when you’re human, you’re able to study the principles of Buddhism and go down the path of enlightenment. If you get rebirthed as an animal, you don’t have that capacity. So if I’m very lucky I’d get a chance to come back as another person. That’d be my druthers. But I hope it’s not an actor next time. I don’t think I’m cut out for this business. The work itself: I have never loved anything more. The business around it, though, I was not cut out for.

Thanks for taking part. Read more about how our weekly series works at the end of the piece. This week, as well as recommending songs about road trips, many of you shared memories of your own journeys. That’s why the playlist opens with Kate and Anna McGarrigle’s Talk to Me of Mendocino, a beautiful song that explains how the memory of a life-changing trip is almost as refreshing as the journey itself. Quite the opposite of Little Village’s Don’t Think About Her When You’re Trying to Drive, where the recollection of lost love seriously impairs the driver’s abilities to keep on the road. A special kind of road trip aims not to put miles away, but to roll out in a flashy status-symbol vehicle, which is the enjoyable accusation Wilson Pickett levels at Mustang Sally. Some women want to be seen; some don’t want to be seen. If, as Howlin’ Wolf suspects, the woman he seeks is hiding out somewhere along Highway 49, he’s got some search on, since it stretches from northern Arkansas to the Gulf of Mississippi. (And includes the junction at Highway 61, the famous crossroads where Robert Johnson, as legend has it, sold his soul to the devil.) There’s a musical restlessness in Tom Waits’s Diamonds on My Windshield, the beat-style poetry bouncing off the bassline matching the energy needed to keep awake on a long-distance drive. It’s the same with Joni Mitchell’s Black Crow, along with the jazzy appreciation that all that restless hunting after “shiny things” can leave you a little “ragged”. There was no shortage of nominated songs that reminded the listener of the grittier side of road trips. My favourite of those was David Bromberg’s The New Lee Highway Blues, where the musical effervescence of guitar, banjo and fiddle all play off lyrics documenting the terrible drudgery of the road. Eating carbonated crap Churning up inside Gas-soaked service station johns And then we’d ride A sweet but ultimately sad journey on foot is undertaken in the traditional song The Road Tae Dundee, sung by Bert Jansch. And a very moving song by Paul Kelly, They Thought I Was Asleep, goes back in time to when he was “a kid in the back seat listening in silent confusion to his parent’s grief”, as reader Xanh_cay puts it. For children, a road trip sometimes means displacement and disorientation, which I felt the harmonica solo really captured. A more soothing song, Mark Knopfler’s The Long Highway, was described by reader TrulyMadlyDerply as a “haunting, lyrical paean to California rock, with its mellow vocals and crystal-clear steel guitar”. Just so you don’t fall asleep at the wheel after that one, I give you Tom Cochrane’s Life Is a Highway, full of the energy and optimism you need to fuel your adventure. Finally, Paul McCartney, eschewing the symphonics, turns The Long and Winding Road into a piano man’s song. Similarly, the lyrics of the song strip the road trip down to its bare essences. You start from where you are. You go alone. It’s going to take time. Weather will be a factor. But hopefully, there’s a welcoming face at the other end.

The single In the Name of Man, released in May 2017, doesn’t appear on the album, and Heartbeat, which does, peaked at No 100 last autumn. All of which suggests what is euphemistically known as “a troubled gestation”. It’s not surprising Drew wanted to take time over his first album since 2012. After all, his career has been marked by distinctly different and perfectly executed phases: sink-estate horror rapper, sharp-suited soul man, chronicler of modern Britain. The good news is that Heaven Before All Hell Breaks Loose doesn’t stand still. Drew is singing again, not rapping, and he dips into dancehall, R&amp;B, drum’n’bass, gospel testifying and as many more styles as you can shake a stick at. The bad news is that the amount of time he’s spent seems to have made him unsure of his identity. There’s neither the comforting familiarity of The Defamation of Strickland Banks, nor the confrontational abrasiveness of Ill Manors. It feels as though he’s trying to split the difference between them. Lyrically, too, Drew seems less focused. It’s not that he’s shying away from big themes, more that the themes are too big for him to bring his gift for specificity to bear, so he ends up offering platitudes: “The situation worsens while we wait for things to change / Cause the ones we expect to put things right / Are the real ones here to blame,” suggests the title track. It’s all a bit think-about-it-yeah; he can be so much better."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"music/2018/apr/15/ellie-goulding-on-how-to-live-well-i-draw-the-line-at-eating-meat","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-15T05:00:04Z","webTitle":"Ellie Goulding on how to live well: ‘I draw the line at eating meat’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/apr/15/ellie-goulding-on-how-to-live-well-i-draw-the-line-at-eating-meat","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/apr/15/ellie-goulding-on-how-to-live-well-i-draw-the-line-at-eating-meat","fields":{"headline":"Ellie Goulding on how to live well: ‘I draw the line at eating meat’","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"At the beginning of my career I was doing that no-carbs thing, which I thought was going to keep me thin.

Over the past few years I started being a vegetarian again and it’s changed my life. I rarely have breakouts and my hair has never been so healthy. It’s really hard to find a reason to eat meat again. It’s dangerous to become friends with me because you will probably become vegetarian! I definitely eat fast food, but McDonald’s wouldn’t be the top of my list, although they did bring out a vegan burger and I respect them for that. To be honest, it depends how drunk I am, because you never know – but I draw the line at eating meat. I think when you’re an artist your mind can go to all kinds of places and it usually means you can feel everything. I have inclinations towards feeling blue and that’s when I go to the gym or for a walk – to release some endorphins. Travelling is the most unsettling aspect of my job. The time that I spend somewhere is always so fleeting and I’m never in one place for long. That can stir up emotions, you’re constantly re-evaluating and changing your life plans. I thought for a long time that I could never really take the time to nurture a relationship because I’m never around. I haven’t been touring for the past year, so I think this is the first time I’ve realised what it’s like to be in a relationship and learn to be with someone.

Let’s have some","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Housing is the defining domestic political issue of the day. It’s the nearest that most voters get, personally, to the wider economy. The latest research shows that many families are cramming into new homes that a generation ago would have been thought too small to live in. Despite televisions getting bigger, living rooms are a third smaller than the 1970s. While no celebrity chef is without a runway-sized island to prepare meals, kitchens are 13% smaller than in the 1960s. According to the LABC Warranty study, homes are now being built not just with smaller rooms, but fewer of them. If true, families have less space for children to study in and less room to dissipate the strains of relationships. What is agreed is that England has the smallest homes by floor space area of any EU country. It’s also not in doubt that extreme overcrowding can have profound effects on family health and social cohesion. So it is bizarre that the UK is one of the few western European nations to have no mandatory minimum space standards for housing. Little wonder that other nations have bigger homes while the UK gets shoe boxes. Ministers did introduce voluntary space standards for new homes in 2015, but as these could be ignored they only gave the appearance of solidity to pure wind. When this ruse was called out in 2016, the government said it would review how these were operating. Nothing has appeared. Part of this is to do with a rightwing legacy: Margaret Thatcher got rid of rules that set a reasonable internal size for public housing. Reintroducing legal standards in the interests of society is the right thing to do. It would also be a repudiation of a Thatcherite legacy, and is at odds with the direction of travel in housing. Under the Conservatives, housing interventions designed to promote social solidarity almost disappeared. The distribution of housing space is dominated by a largely untrammelled market in land. This has led to re-emergence of a housing inequality in space. By some calculations, the most spaciously housed tenth of the population have five times as many rooms per person than the most overcrowded tenth. The counter argument is that market mechanisms will sort this out: older people who have houses will die and release stock on to the market. Yet this reasoning does not stand up to scrutiny. Houses are needed and the reasons are largely to do with social justice, inequality and the distribution of political power. There must be an acknowledgment of the psychological comforts that domesticity affords. Past rules would need to be updated – homes must no longer find space for dining tables and upright pianos but be designed for the activities and furniture that are typical today. The Grenfell Tower tragedy provided a new background for politicians to think about housing. For too long politicians have cultivated voters reliant on house prices remaining high, and rising. The policies that have allowed this have had a damaging impact on a growing proportion of the population. So far Theresa May’s government has exaggerated how far it is prepared to intervene on the side of this section of society. Setting mandatory standards for house sizes is one test of whether this rhetoric will yield to reality."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"sport/2018/apr/11/wisden-three-women-world-cup-winners-2017","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-11T07:29:03Z","webTitle":"Wisden names three female World Cup winners in its five cricketers of 2017","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/apr/11/wisden-three-women-world-cup-winners-2017","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/apr/11/wisden-three-women-world-cup-winners-2017","fields":{"headline":"Wisden names three female World Cup winners in its five cricketers of 2017","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"A hat-trick of World Cup winners sees women make up the majority of Wisden’s cricketers of the year for the first time in the award’s history, with Heather Knight, Anya Shrubsole and Nat Sciver all named in the famous five for 2018. Only twice before have female cricketers been among the list of leading players from the previous English summer – Claire Taylor broke new ground in 2009, Charlotte Edwards followed five years later – but that heady day last July, when Knight lifted the trophy at a packed Lord’s, has seen the floodgates open. Making up the quintet are Jamie Porter, whose 75 wickets propelled Essex to their first County Championship title since 1992, and Shai Hope, scorer of twin hundreds as an unheralded West Indies side pulled off a shock five-wicket victory over England in the second Test at Headingley. Indeed, it is the first time since 2002 that no current England men’s international has made the list. The 130-year-old award can only be won once in a career, of course, although it is perhaps Tammy Beaumont, leading scorer and player of the women’s World Cup, whose case was strongest among those to miss out. Describing Knight’s achievement as “the culmination of a personal tour de force that helped change women’s cricket for ever”, Wisden’s editor, Lawrence Booth, noted the 27-year-old’s captaincy throughout a campaign in which she scored 364 runs at an average of 45, including a century against Pakistan. It is Shrubsole who is on the cover of the 155th edition, however, after the seamer lit up a Lord’s final that had been slipping away from the home side with a spell of five for 11, in figures of six for 46, that derailed India’s chase of 229 and, according to Booth, secured “national hero status”. Sciver, meanwhile, is credited for producing the most memorable shot of 2017 – the deliberate clip between her legs that was dubbed “The Natmeg” in some quarters – but is described as “more than a one-trick pony”, given her 346 runs in the tournament and figures of three for three with the ball against West Indies. New to Wisden this year is the introduction of an award for the leading Twenty20 cricketer in the world. It is another sign of the times, too, both in terms of the format’s recognition, some 15 years on from its inception, and the nationality of the winner: Afghanistan’s leg-spinning sensation, Rashid Khan. The 19-year-old has emerged as one of the most in-demand Twenty20 cricketers on the circuit – Wisden describes his googly as “one of the most dangerous deliveries in the world game” – with 80 wickets in 2017 at just 14 apiece. An economy-rate of 5.53 was equally impressive. This short-format award complements the existing men and women’s leading cricketer in the world categories, which this year are India’s two captains: Virat Kohli and Mithali Raj. Their sides lost their respective global finals – the Champions Trophy and the Women’s World Cup – but they enjoyed stellar returns personally. For Kohli it is the second year in succession he has topped the lot, with his 2,818 runs across all formats more than 700 ahead of Joe Root in second place. Raj, meanwhile, surpassed Edwards as the all-time leading run scorer in women’s ODIs and scored a record seven successive half-centuries. Elsewhere in Wisden, which is published on Thursday, Booth uses his notes to warn the England and Wales Cricket Board not to take the Ashes for granted after the winter’s 4-0 defeat in Australia amid a record run of 13 away Tests without a victory for the national team. The ECB’s chief executive, Tom Harrison, also sets out his vision for the new Twenty20 tournament from 2020 onwards – with the counter argument presented by ESPNCricinfo’s George Dobell – while Tanya Aldred has written on both sexism in cricket and the sport’s relationship with the environment.

It’s an attack on our country in a true sense. It’s an attack on what we all stand for.” So began Donald Trump’s passionate remarks to reporters before an afternoon meeting of the nation’s top military brass and national security officials. On the agenda was how America should respond to the Syrian government’s most recent chemical weapon attack against its own citizens. But that criminal attack was not the target of the president’s moral outrage. No, instead it was the news that the FBI “broke into” the office of Michael Cohen, Trump’s longstanding personal lawyer. “Broke into”, of course, is hardly accurate. Were the president more familiar with the rudiments of the rule of law, he would know that here in the United States the FBI cannot just barge into an office and grab everything in sight. Two down from the president’s beloved second amendment in the constitution is the fourth, which safeguards persons against unreasonable searches and seizures, and requires that search warrants be issued only “upon probable cause”. There must, in short, be a reasonable basis for belief that the search will uncover evidence of a crime. In this case, the heads – as of today – of Trump’s justice department signed off on the FBI’s plans and a federal judge agreed that probable cause had been satisfied. At this point it’s hard to say what exactly the FBI was searching for. Clearly, though, Mueller’s team is interested in something more than the $130,000 that Cohen paid to Stephanie Clifford, AKA Stormy Daniels – a payment the president claims never to have known about, in order to keep the lid on an affair that he claims never happened. What that something is presumably will only become clear when Trump faces his day of reckoning with Mueller. For the present, we know the FBI seized tax documents and business records, as well as emails of communications between Cohen and Trump. Such communications are protected by the attorney-client privilege, but that privilege is not absolute. The so-called “crime fraud” exception permits puncturing that privilege if it can be established that the client communicated with the intention of covering up a crime or fraud. The very fact that the FBI sought a warrant and conducted a raid – rather than issuing Cohen with a subpoena – clearly shows that it was worried that the lawyer, who has represented Trump for years and is proud to be known as his “bulldog”, would withhold or destroy evidence of criminal activity. But the most telling confirmation of the importance of the raid came from the president himself, whose unbalanced diatribe was remarkable even by his standards. We’ve heard the witch-hunt business before: the lasses in Salem had it easy compared to the trials our poor president has had to endure. But in calling a legally authorized raid on the office of his personal lawyer an “attack on our country”, Trump has done more than given strident confirmation to his extravagant narcissism. He has accused the nation’s top intelligence officials and administrators of justice of treason. We knew this day was coming. Whatever else we might say about Richard Nixon, he went quietly into the night. Not Trump. He will drag us through the misery of a constitutional crisis before, to quote John Brennan, he enters the dustbin of history.

Prices in Berlin jumped by 20.5% in 2017, according to the property consultancy Knight Frank, with other German cities also displacing cities in China in terms of rising prices. Berlin, Hamburg, Munich and Frankfurt were ranked in the top 10 in the world for price rises, with several Dutch cities not far behind. London was ranked 101st, with a 2% gain, while Auckland in New Zealand, once gripped by a property frenzy, dropped to 99th with a 2.2% increase. But attempts by the authorities in Vancouver to quell its soaring prices – including a 15% foreign buyer tax – appear to have stalled, with prices in the Canadian city jumping by 16% in 2017, the fourth fastest in the world. Berlin’s move to the top of risers followers several years of soaring prices; the average property price has increase by more than 120% since 2004. Foreign buyers have flocked into Berlin’s residential and commercial property market, with the US investor Warren Buffet agreeing a deal last month to acquire a top-end real estate agent in the city that sells apartments for as much as €3.8m (£3.3m). The boom has been fuelled by cheap borrowing and a fast growing population. The city’s population has grown by about 50,000 a year over the past five years to 3.5 million. It is projected to reach 4 million by 2035. The surge in prices has prompted warnings of a bubble waiting to burst. In February, Germany’s central bank, the Bundesbank, suggested that property in many German cities was at least 15% overpriced and could be as much as 35% overpriced in Berlin. But to buyers from London or New York, Berlin remains cheap even after years of 10% annualised rises. Apartments in prime parts of the German capital fetch only about a third of the price of equivalent-sized properties in London. On immowelt.de, a popular German property website, apartments in NeuKölln, which is regarded as one of the hippest neighbourhoods, can be found €175,000 and are marked by the agents as “Ihr cleveres investment”. Commercial property is also booming. Berlin’s Sony centre complex, emblematic of the city’s regeneration after the fall of the Berlin Wall, was bought for €1.1bn in October by the pension fund of Ontario’s municipal employees.

These days, there is a widespread belief that even the mascot needs to have read Moneyball, and not simply be able to critique the movie. The biggest clubs employ armies of data analysts, while advanced metrics and tactical analytics are the adornment of increasing amounts of commentary. Privately, you might think some of your friends speak the language of football statistics much as Andy Gray once spoke the language of Spanish, when he inquired of a La Manga hotel receptionist: “Eh senoreo, where’s the fucking taxio?” But like Andy, they certainly have a go, and forcefully so. In this occasionally stifling and frequently deeply boring atmosphere, it’s refreshing to hear of idiosyncratic tactical approaches. All respect to Chris Coleman, then, who this week gave the media a glimpse into his forward planning. “We just need to look and see what’s happened in the last five years,” the Sunderland manager explained, “and then do the opposite.” Obviously, Coleman was not being completely serious but there was something cheerily liberated about his comments. Liberation is what he is aiming for, what with Sunderland trapped in the Championship relegation zone. Perhaps Chris will turn out to be a counterculture hero – football’s equivalent of The Diceman, the protagonist of Luke Rhinehart’s cult anti-analysis novel, who makes all his decisions on the throw of a dice. An even closer analogue to the Sunderland manager’s “do the opposite” approach exists. There’s a Seinfeld episode called The Opposite, where George Costanza bemoans what feels like a lifelong losing streak. “It became very clear to me sitting out there today,” he tells Jerry and Elaine, “that every decision I’ve ever made, in my entire life, has been wrong. My life is the opposite of everything I want it to be. Every instinct I have, in every aspect of life, be it something to wear, something to eat … It’s all been wrong.” “If every instinct you have is wrong,” reasons Jerry, not entirely reasonably, “then the opposite would have to be right.” George duly decides to fight his natural impulses and see what happens, and is immediately rewarded when a beautiful woman agrees to a date, despite the fact he introduced himself to her with the words: “I’m unemployed and live with my parents.” As Coleman freely admits, this will basically be Sunderland’s approach to potential new signings – we’ve got a wantaway owner and you need to take a guess what division we’ll be playing in next season. It’s not just fictional sitcom characters failing to give absolute primacy to tactical science, though – real football people are at it too. A year or so ago, the Borussia Mönchengladbach coach Dieter Hecking let daylight in on magic when he said tactics were important “but you must not make any secret science out of it”. Many of the secrets that observers scientifically divined each week were quite beyond him. “Today there are even websites, presenting alleged thoughts of us coaches after the game,” Hecking marvelled. “I have read them once after a Wolfsburg game. I was wondering: ‘Am I supposed to have come up with these highly complex things?’” Soon after, the German FA’s head of coaching education, Frank Wormuth, declared tactics “overrated” and less important than the quality of players. Wormuth compared the fetishisation of modern tactical analysis to some pretentious art exhibition preview, “where people are seized by a canvas with colour patches, wondering what the painter wanted to tell them, and afterwards pay a lot of money for it. What did the painter want to tell us? Nothing. Perhaps he had just had a bad day.” At the England level, we are always encouraged to believe we have come a long way technically in the past 25 years or so. At the start of our journey, horrified documentary viewers were able to watch Graham Taylor’s tactical plan unfold as he judged a game was “made for Wrighty”, or bellowed rhetorically: “Can we not knock it?” At the end of our journey, we were deep in the realms of the FA elite development director Dan Ashworth’s spreadsheets. And yet, looking at England’s last major tournament exit to Iceland, you could be forgiven for thinking we had perhaps not journeyed anywhere at all but were simply knowing the place for the first time. As for Coleman’s do-the-opposite dossier, how might it pan out? I’m not sure if one is permitted to run so-called spoilers to Seinfeld episodes – the other day a chap wrote crossly to me saying I’d spoiled a plot point of Return of the Jedi (1983) for him, because he’d only got up to Star Wars: A New Hope (1977). But let’s live dangerously: at the end of The Opposite, George gets a coveted sporting job of his own, hired by the New York Yankees. The next episode opens with him offering batting advice and, though it’s not explicitly clear this is the continuation of do-the-opposite policy, George promptly approaches management with a creatively destructive scheme. The Yankees, he says, would be advantaged by switching from playing in polyester uniforms to cotton. Unfortunately, the cotton kits shrink, the Yankees end up running like penguins, and … well, spoilers. A reminder that asking: “What’s the worst that can happen?” is tempting fate in sport, and we can only hope Coleman’s convention-bucking goes better."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2018/apr/15/tuesdays-best-tv-ordeal-by-innocence-the-crystal-maze-famalam","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-15T05:00:09Z","webTitle":"Tuesday’s best TV: Ordeal by Innocence; The Crystal Maze; Famalam","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/apr/15/tuesdays-best-tv-ordeal-by-innocence-the-crystal-maze-famalam","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2018/apr/15/tuesdays-best-tv-ordeal-by-innocence-the-crystal-maze-famalam","fields":{"headline":"Tuesday’s best TV: Ordeal by Innocence; The Crystal Maze; Famalam","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Ordeal by Innocence 9pm, BBC One As we reach the final episode of this ghoulish, thrilling BBC drama, we know that wealthy philanthropist Rachel Argyll is dead, having been viciously clubbed over the head at her family estate.

The findings, based on multiple lines of scientific evidence, throw into question previous predictions that a catastrophic collapse of the Gulf Stream would take centuries to occur. Such a collapse would see western Europe suffer far more extreme winters, sea levels rise fast on the eastern seaboard of the US and would disrupt vital tropical rains. The new research shows the current is now 15% weaker than around 400AD, an exceptionally large deviation, and that human-caused global warming is responsible for at least a significant part of the weakening. The current, known as the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (Amoc), carries warm water northwards towards the north pole. There it cools, becomes denser and sinks, and then flows back southwards. But global warming hampers the cooling of the water, while melting ice in the Arctic, particularly from Greenland, floods the area with less dense freshwater, weakening the Amoc current. Scientists know that Amoc has slowed since 2004, when instruments were deployed at sea to measure it. But now two new studies have provided comprehensive ocean-based evidence that the weakening is unprecedented in at least 1,600 years, which is as far back as the new research stretches. “Amoc is a really important part of the Earth’s climate system and it has played an important part in abrupt climate change in the past,” said Dr David Thornalley, from University College London who led one of the new studies. He said current climate models do not replicate the observed slowdown, suggesting that Amoc is less stable that thought. During the last ice age, some big changes in Amoc led to winter temperatures changing by 5-10C in as short a time as one to three years, with major consequences for the weather over the land masses bordering the Atlantic. “The [current] climate models don’t predict [an Amoc shutdown] is going to happen in the future – the problem is how certain are we it is not going to happen? It is one of these tipping points that is relatively low probability, but high impact.” The study by Thornalley and colleagues, published in Nature, used cores of sediments from a key site off Cape Hatteras in North Carolina to examine Amoc over the last 1600 years. Larger grains of sediment reflect faster Amoc currents and vice versa. They also used the shells of tiny marine creatures from sites across the Atlantic to measure a characteristic pattern of temperatures that indicate the strength of Amoc. When it weakens, a large area of ocean around Iceland cools, as less warm water is brought north, and the waters off the east coast of the US get warmer. The second study, also published in Nature, also used the characteristic pattern of temperatures, but assessed this using thermometer data collected over the last 120 years or so. Both studies found that Amoc today is about 15% weaker than 1,600 years ago, but there were also differences in their conclusions. The first study found significant Amoc weakening after the end of the little ice age in about 1850, the result of natural climate variability, with further weakening caused later by global warming. The second study suggests most of the weakening came later, and can be squarely blamed on the burning of fossil fuels. Further research is now being undertaken to understand the reasons for the differences. However, it is already clear that human-caused climate change will continue to slow Amoc, with potentially severe consequences. “If we do not rapidly stop global warming, we must expect a further long-term slowdown of the Atlantic overturning,” said Alexander Robinson, at the University of Madrid, and one of the team that conducted the second study. He warned: “We are only beginning to understand the consequences of this unprecedented process – but they might be disruptive.” A 2004 disaster movie, The Day After Tomorrow, envisaged a rapid shutdown of Amoc and a devastating freeze. The basics of the science were portrayed correctly, said Thornalley: “Obviously it was exaggerated – the changes happened in a few days or weeks and were much more extreme. But it is true that in the past this weakening of Amoc happened very rapidly and caused big changes.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2018/apr/10/eu-will-seek-non-regression-clause-to-tie-uk-to-environmental-standards","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-10T16:03:48Z","webTitle":"EU will seek 'non-regression' clause to tie UK to environmental standards","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/apr/10/eu-will-seek-non-regression-clause-to-tie-uk-to-environmental-standards","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/apr/10/eu-will-seek-non-regression-clause-to-tie-uk-to-environmental-standards","fields":{"headline":"EU will seek 'non-regression' clause to tie UK to environmental standards","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The EU’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, has warned that Brussels will not rely on Michael Gove’s pledges over the environment but instead insist on a “non-regression” clause in any future deal after Brexit to tie the UK to the bloc’s high standards. Barnier said he welcomed a 25-year plan published in January by the environment secretary, a fervent Brexiter during the referendum campaign, under which the UK vowed to be a “global champion” of greener policies after 29 March 2019. But Barnier said in a debate in the European parliament on Tuesday that the 27 member states would be “extremely vigilant” in blocking any attempt by the British government to undercut current regulations to gain a competitive advantage. The future partnership with the UK “should include a non-regression clause and prevent the reduction of pre-Brexit standards”, the former French minister said. “If we make sure our partnership is based on a level playing field … then we should have strongly mitigated the threat of Brexit to EU environmental policy,” he told MEPs. “There will be no ambitions partnership without guarantees on fair competition, social standards, tax dumping and not least environmental standards.” Gove and the foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, have previously counselled Theresa May that the UK will only be able to reap the advantages of Brexit if the UK diverges from the EU in terms of its regulatory standards in some key sectors. However, the environment secretary has also insisted that the UK will “occupy the high ground” on green standards. Barnier said he hoped that Gove’s position would translate into the negotiation over the coming months, as the UK spells out how it intends a future trade deal to work. He said: “Does the UK want to stay close to European regulatory model or distance itself from it? “It’s a very important question because European regulatory model is underpinned by choices that are very dear to us. “What we hear from the UK could be seen as reassuring … This is reflected in the UK’s proposed 25-year plan on the environment. This is welcome but my responsibility as EU’s lead negotiator is to remain extremely vigilant.” Barnier added that he expected agreement on a non-regression clause to be difficult, and that he would want its scope to widen anything seen before. “We know Britain wants to integrate all existing standards in law,” he said, “but what happens on day plus-10? “Currently the UK is totally integrated but we are going to diverge. What will become of this divergence? Does it remain reasonable? Or does it become a tool for social, fiscal and environmental dumping? We face a huge risk of ratification from national parliaments if we don’t reassure people and provide solutions.” In an illustration of his intention to raise standards, Gove is consulting on a ban on the export of live animals. The National Farmers’ Union estimates up to 20,000 live sheep were exported to Europe in 2017. EU single market legislation currently prevents the UK from prohibiting exports of livestock."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/apr/17/rachel-roddy-recipe-spring-greens-pasta","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-17T11:00:36Z","webTitle":"Rachel Roddy’s recipe for spring greens and pasta | A Kitchen in Rome","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/apr/17/rachel-roddy-recipe-spring-greens-pasta","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/apr/17/rachel-roddy-recipe-spring-greens-pasta","fields":{"headline":"Rachel Roddy's recipe for spring greens and pasta","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Had I written this column yesterday, it would have been full of Roman spring sunshine. Today it is not. I read the other day that Rome has 28% more rain per annum than London, but also a full 270 days of sunshine each year, which goes some way to explain the way in which rain comes down over this city, in sheets or bathtubs. “How do the Romans manage the deluge?” my dad asked my partner Vincenzo, who replied, as if stating the obvious: “They stay at home.” It stops as suddenly as it starts, then the sun is back as if nothing happened: part miracle, part nonchalant teenager, drying everything off. This dance of rain and sun is one of the reasons Rome’s spring vegetables are the way they are: the sweetest peas and broad beans, great thistles, a chlorophyll-injected, grass-like vegetable called agretti, hops, borage as hairy as two-day stubble, ragged chicory, and all sorts of herbs and salad greens. I imagine asparagus, both wild and tame, to be rather like the older men and women of Testaccio, patiently waiting for the rain to stop and sun to return. When it does – bingo! They are in the piazza on the best bench, unfurling from coats, faces upturned towards warmth and light. I admire the way Romans treat spring vegetables: by not doing much to them. New-season spinach is wilted, drained, then cooked again with olive oil – possibly butter, too; and garlic, and maybe a handful of raisins (plumped up in warm water first). Agretti is boiled briefly then served all’agro, which means sour – so with lemon and olive oil. Young salad is dressed simply: salted quite a lot, oiled generously, but with just a jot of vinegar. When comes to cooking peas and broad beans, Romans often opt for a sort of steamy braise. This is done by first frying some onion and cured pork (pancetta, prosciutto, guanciale or bacon) in lard or olive oil until soft, then adding the podded peas, a pinch of salt and a little liquid (water, broth or wine), and bubbling until the peas are just cooked, with just a little juice left – more essence than anything. Quite how long you need to bubble depends on the peas or beans. The very first of the season need just a minute or two – more a dip than a bath – to maintain their grassy sweetness and colour (if they are not sweet enough, a pinch of sugar helps). As the season progresses and the peas get bigger and more starchy, they need longer in the braise, which means their colour darkens, but what they lose in “pop”, they gain in flavour. Peas cooked this way make an excellent side dish, with roast chicken, lamb chops or white fish. They are also lovely stirred into pasta, especially spirals of fusilli, bow-ties of farfalle or ears of orecchiette. If you do have pasta in mind, spring onions – both white and green parts – work well; and be generous with the extra-virgin olive oil. Cook until everything is soft enough to wrap around the pasta before adding your peas (fresh or frozen). If you are leaving out the cured pork, salt well and throw in a herb or handful of other cooked greens, then top with a big spoonful of ricotta (thinned with a little milk to make it softer) and a Roman rainfall-style handful of grated parmesan."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"business/2018/mar/29/gkn-shareholders-accept-melrose-takeover","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-29T18:34:43Z","webTitle":"MPs call for government to block Melrose's £8bn hostile takeover of GKN","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/mar/29/gkn-shareholders-accept-melrose-takeover","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/mar/29/gkn-shareholders-accept-melrose-takeover","fields":{"headline":"MPs call for government to block Melrose's £8bn hostile takeover of GKN","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"One of Britain’s oldest engineering firms is to be taken over by a company that has been labelled an asset-stripper, prompting calls for the government to block the £8.1bn deal on national security grounds. GKN, which was founded in 1759 and has 59,000 staff including 6,000 in the UK, succumbed to a hostile bid from Melrose after a lengthy and sometimes acrimonious corporate tussle that has spilled over into the political arena. Melrose, which buys underperforming firms to cut costs and sell on at a profit, appealed directly to GKN shareholders after the company’s board rejected two bids, narrowly winning their approval at a vote on Thursday afternoon. Investors’ blessing for the takeover signals an end to the independence of a 259-year-old engineering firm that provided the iron for the construction of Britain’s railways and produced Spitfires during the second world war. Business secretary Greg Clark said he would consider calls from MPs and trade unions to intervene on national security grounds, given GKN’s role in making components for military aircraft including the Lockheed F-35B fighter jet. Jack Dromey, the Labour MP leader of a group of 16 politicians who wrote to Clark urging him to halt the deal, said the buyout of GKN by Melrose was a “bleak day for British industry”. Liberal Democrat leader Vince Cable called for takeover rules to be strengthened to prevent “short-term speculators” snapping up shares in buyout targets in order to vote for a deal and pocket the profits. The acquisition of GKN, which began life as an ironworks near Merthyr Tydfil, is the largest hostile takeover in the UK since US firm Kraft bought Cadbury in 2010. That deal led to Cable, then business minister, calling for a “Cadbury law” to stop hedge funds and other short-term investors influencing takeovers. Christopher Miller, the chairman of Melrose, said he was “delighted and grateful” after narrowly winning the shareholder vote with 52.4% of investor support, just above the required 50.1% threshold. Melrose has consistently denied that its model of buying up businesses to sell on amounts to asset-stripping. It has made legally binding promises to keep GKN’s UK headquarters and retain a British workforce, maintain research and development spending and refrain from selling its aerospace business for at least five years. “Let me assure you that GKN is entering into very good hands,” said Miller, a protege of Lord Hanson, the 1980s wheeler dealer who built a corporate empire with a number of aggressive takeovers. GKN’s directors said on Thursday that it still believes that the deal “fundamentally undervalues” the company but that it now had no choice but to recommend investors sell their shares. Dromey said the government should not allow Melrose to complete the takeover. He said: “Today is a bleak day for British industry. The takeover by Melrose makes a mockery of any talk by government of an industrial strategy. “Britain’s takeover rules are in desperate need of reform. Yet again, as in the Kraft takeover of Cadbury’s, we have seen a jewel in the crown of British industry sold off because its shares were bought up by hedge funds.” Dromey said the deal would not have gone through if the previous coalition government had agreed to Labour’s calls to restrict investors from voting on acquisitions unless they had held shares for six months. The proposal was designed to prevent short-term speculators such as hedge funds buying up shares with the aim of influencing takeover outcomes for profit. “To let a 259-year-old British engineering icon like GKN be taken over by a short-termist asset-stripper like Melrose is a monumental failure by ministers,” said Dromey. “However, the government still has the power to intervene to block the hostile takeover takeover on defence and national security grounds. It should do so in the British national interest.” Cable said: “The very narrow result – like Brexit – suggests that this takeover is not universally popular amongst shareholders. It seems it was only secured through votes from short-term speculators.” Elliott Advisors, an “activist” investor with a history of intervening in takeovers, built up a 3.8% stake in GKN before the deal, which it urged fellow shareholders to back a week ago. Cable called for the government to change corporate takeover rules to curb the voting power of short-term investors. He added that ministers should also be able to intervene in takeovers that might affect investment in research and development. Clark said: “During the bid, Melrose made commitments which they are bound to honour including investment in research and development and maintaining itself as a UK business. “Now that shareholders have made their decision the government has a statutory responsibility to consider whether the merger in its proposed final form gives rise to public interest concerns in the areas of media plurality, financial stability and national security. “This assessment will be made by the appropriate authorities and the conclusion set out in due course.” Trade union Unite echoed Cable’s concerns and said it would be “holding Melrose’s feet to the fire” to honour its commitments to GKN but said the government should still consider blocking the deal. Unite’s assistant general secretary for aerospace, Steve Turner, said: “This takeover has put into stark relief the inadequacy of the UK’s takeover rules which put the interests of short-term speculators over those of the workforce and long-term investors. “We need an overhaul of UK takeover laws to strengthen the voice of stakeholders to ensure other British companies do not fall prey to corporate vultures looking to make a quick buck against the national interest.” During a two-month takeover battle, Melrose repeatedly accused GKN bosses of mismanaging the company, while opponents of the deal warned that Melrose would carve up the business and prioritise short-term profits over long-term success. Melrose told the Guardian that many executives within GKN had privately expressed support for the takeover. “There have been back-channels from within GKN indicating they’d welcome a new broom. We think a lot of people within GKN are really going to welcome Melrose coming in.” Melrose typically rewards senior staff with large financial incentives if they succeed in cutting costs to extract maximum value out of businesses it can then sell on. The deal is the largest hostile takeover launched in the UK since Kraft swooped on Cadbury in 2009 and has attracted public scrutiny from politicians and unions, as well as investors. Earlier this month, GKN’s largest customer, Airbus, said it would take its business elsewhere if the Melrose deal went ahead. Melrose first expressed interest in buying GKN in January. Subsequently GKN’s management revealed plans to merge its automotive business with the US firm Dana, in an attempt to fend off the hostile approach."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2018/mar/30/daca-cancellation-dreamer-uscis-immigration-dilemma-dream-act","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-30T09:00:16Z","webTitle":"A Dreamer’s impossible dilemma: where to die?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/mar/30/daca-cancellation-dreamer-uscis-immigration-dilemma-dream-act","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/mar/30/daca-cancellation-dreamer-uscis-immigration-dilemma-dream-act","fields":{"headline":"A Dreamer’s impossible dilemma: where to die?","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Ángel Martínez did not choose to leave his native Mexico at the age of seven for a life in the United States. But now, nearly 20 years later, he faces a wrenching choice: where to die? Does he stay in the country that is his home, and receive palliative care to relieve the pain of his terminal medical condition? Or does he travel to Mexico to say goodbye to his parents – and probably forfeit the chance to return? Martínez’s fate has become entangled in the national debate over immigration reform that was fueled by Donald Trump’s decision to cancel the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (Daca), an executive program that shielded nearly 700,000 young undocumented immigrants known as “Dreamers” from deportation. “I don’t think the Trump administration understands how this affects families and people like me who need to cross a border to be together,” said Martínez. “I belong with my mom – but I have to come back.” Martínez grew up in eastern Michigan and lives in the town of Mount Clemens, less than an hour’s drive from the US border with Canada. He was in middle school when he learned what it meant to be “undocumented”. One morning he woke up to learn that his mother had been apprehended by immigration officers during her night shift at a plastic manufacturing plant. She was deported to Mexico, but returned to the US about a year later to be with her family, he said. In 2007, Martínez was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia and ultimately required a bone marrow transplant. His recovery was complicated by the development of graft v host disease, a rare condition that occurs when donor cells attack the host’s organs and can cause severe damage to the skin, liver and lungs. After 10 years and 21 hospital admissions to manage the disease, Martínez has “no chance of recovery” and is unlikely to live through the year, according to a medical note written by his doctor. But hopes for Martínez to be reunited with his parents are dim. His mother and father are not allowed to enter the US because of past immigration violations. If Martínez were to leave the country without permission, it is unlikely he will ever set foot in the US again because he had lived in the country unlawfully before receiving Daca protections. He could try to beg for mercy at the border, but there is no guarantee he would be granted entry. Before Trump ended Daca, Dreamers like Martínez could apply for advance parole, a permission to temporarily travel abroad for educational, professional and humanitarian purposes, and then re-enter the US. But the benefit was stripped and never restored. With few options available, Martínez’s lawyer, Eleanor Sintjago, tried another route. She helped him submit an application for humanitarian parole-in-place, which is commonly used to reunite undocumented members of the US military and their families but can be granted to other applicants for “urgent humanitarian reasons” or significant public benefit. In the application, Sintjago argued that US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) has the “discretionary authority” to grant parole to Daca beneficiaries “in especially deserving cases”. “Ángel is not asking for much,” said Sintjago. “He is not asking for permanent legal status or for any more rights or privileges than he currently has once he returns.” On 8 March, Martínez received a terse reply: “USCIS is unable to grant the request for parole at this time.” His mother cried as he read the letter to her in Spanish, unable to explain to her why it had been denied. A spokesman for USCIS said the agency does not comment on specific cases but confirmed that it stopped accepting advance parole applications from Daca recipients on 5 September, when the program was ended.When Martínez was first diagnosed with leukemia in 2007, his mother quit her job to stay by his side in the hospital. But by the time he entered hospice care last summer, she was thousands of miles away, reachable only by phone. In 2015, she was stopped by police after making an illegal turn, turned over to Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and deported again to Mexico, where she now lives in the central state of Guanajuato, Martínez said. She calls her son at least every other day. But after each conversation, the same question lingers in the 2,000-mile distance between mother and son: will they ever see each other again? “This is very hard for her,” Martínez said. “She is sad and she gets depressed.” The Obama administration created Daca through executive action in 2012 after years of congressional inaction over the protection of Dreamers. The program allowed undocumented immigrants to apply for renewable two-year visas to live, work and study in the US without the threat of deportation. Martínez qualified for protections and found work, first at the fast-food chain Del Taco and then in customer service. He met his future wife, and in 2014, they married in a small courthouse ceremony in Mount Clemens. Since then, however, his health has continued to decline. He uses a walker to move around the house and wheelchair when his cousins take him to the movies or dinner. He struggles to raise his left arm. In September, his hopes soared when he received a letter from USCIS informing him that his Daca protections had been renewed for another two years. But four days later – as his lawyer worked to compile his application for “advance parole” to travel to Mexico to see his mother – the attorney general, Jeff Sessions, announced that the administration was ending Daca. Courts have since ordered the administration to restart the program while legal challenges to Trump’s decision proceed, but the benefit allowing Dreamers to travel was not included. Sheridan Aguirre, a spokesman for United We Dream, a national organization representing Dreamers and undocumented youth, said the little-known benefit was a “crucial” part of Daca that allowed them to reunite with their families, visit ailing relatives and attend funerals. “Every person should have the ability to be with their loved ones in those final moments of life,” he said. “Taking that away from folks is denying them that basic human experience.” According to USCIS, the agency approved approximately 42,600 travel permissions since 2012, when Daca began, through 30 August 2017. While Congress and the White House wrestle over the program’s future, the fates of hundreds of thousands of Daca recipients hang in the balance. “I hope that by telling my story I do get a chance to go see my mom,” Martínez said. “I also hope that I can change things for other people in the same situation as me.” Last week, lawmakers bypassed another opportunity to enact protections for Dreamers despite a last-minute threat by Trump to veto a budget measure because it “totally abandoned” the young immigrants.

The study by the Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science and Technology, ETH Zurich and the University of Illinois, counted microbes swimming inside the yellow toys and found the murky liquid released when ducks were squeezed contained “potentially pathogenic bacteria” in four out of the five toys studied. The bacteria found included Legionella and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a bacterium that is “often implicated in hospital-acquired infections”, the authors said in a statement. “We’ve found very big differences between different bath animals,” said microbiologist and lead study author Lisa Neu, alluding to other types of bath toys such as rubber crocodiles that also were examined. “One of the reasons was the material, because it releases carbon that can serve as food for the bacteria.” The study, published on Tuesday in the journal Biofilms and Microbiomes, said the scientists discovered a strikingly high volume of up to 75m cells per square centimetre and a variety of bacteria and fungus in the ducks. Tap water did not usually foster the growth of bacteria, the scientists said, but low-quality polymers in the plastic materials gave them the nutrients they needed. Bodily fluids such as urine and sweat as well as contaminants and even soap in bathwater add microbes and nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus and create balmy brine for bacteria. While certain amounts of bacteria can help strengthen children’s immune systems, they could also lead to eye, ear and intestinal infections, the researchers said. The scientists, who received funding from the Swiss government as part of broader research into household objects, said using higher-quality polymers to make the ducks could prevent bacterial and fungal growth."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"news/live/2018/apr/29/morning-glory","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-29T08:29:54Z","webTitle":"Morning glory","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/live/2018/apr/29/morning-glory","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/live/2018/apr/29/morning-glory","fields":{"headline":"Morning glory","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"When bread pudding and french toast collide.

Mark Rowe said crews were waiting to be deployed after the bombing – some of them so close that they had heard the explosion – but “the order never came down from the top”. His comments came after Greater Manchester fire and rescue service (GMFRS) was forced to issue an unreserved apology for turning up two hours late to the Manchester Arena attack because fire chiefs followed protocol instead of showing “pragmatism”. An official review of the response to the attack, published on Tuesday, prompted calls for ministers to rethink “inflexible” rules for dealing with terrorist atrocities so that emergency services can use common sense to save lives in future attacks. Rowe told BBC Breakfast on Wednesday: “Members were very angry that they weren’t being deployed to the scene. “There was frustration. Members have talked about their embarrassment that they weren’t deployed and also feeling ashamed that they were prevented from doing anything that night.” The report by Bob Kerslake, commissioned by the mayor of Greater Manchester, Andy Burnham, found poor communications between the police and fire service meant the “valuable” assistance of fire crews was delayed by two hours and six minutes after the bombing, which left 22 dead and scores injured. Many firefighters heard the explosion from their base just over half a mile away from the arena and were desperate to deploy, the report found. Instead, they were told to drive to another fire station three miles away and were left to watch reports on TV. Fire chiefs wrongly believed they were dealing with a marauding terrorist attack, like those experienced in Mumbai and Paris. When they arrived at the arena, more than two hours after Salman Abedi detonated his suicide bomb, the visibly frustrated fire officers were not immediately allowed on to the concourse to help because of communication errors between “risk-averse” officers in charge, the report said. Complaints from firefighters prompted Burnham to commission Lord Kerslake to carry out the independent review, which concluded the fire service played “no meaningful role”. The Manchester Evening News said it had been “inundated” with calls from firefighters in the 24 hours after the attack speaking of the shame they felt at being prevented from helping. Many had elite training in how to respond to a terrorist attack. One firefighter, who spoke to the paper on condition of anonymity, said: “Police from Wales and Yorkshire and ambulances from the East Midlands were at the arena helping the dead and wounded – 400 yards from our base. “It was heart-wrenching for those sat there, with news coming back that the general public were carrying dead, dying, and injured people on advertising boards. “Paramedics were coming back questioning why we weren’t doing anything when they needed us for basics like oxygen cylinders and to fetch and carry. To a man and woman the ambulance service went despite being told that it was still an active incident.” The security minister, Ben Wallace, admitted he was frustrated by failures identified in the Kerslake report, but rejected calls for changes in the rules for dealing with terrorist attacks. Speaking to BBC Radio 4’s Today programme on Wednesday, he said: “The overwhelming response by the emergency services to the attack in Manchester was positive. Was I shocked? No. I was frustrated about the failure that was identified, that an individual called Operation Plato, thinking it was a marauding terrorist firearms attack, and in doing so that communication to the fire service meant there was a delay in the fire service [response].” Asked whether counter-terrorist protocols would be changed in the wake of the attack, as Burnham called for, the minister said: “The protocols and the training and the exercising and the strategy all were there. When they are not followed we obviously have to look at why they weren’t followed, but overall [on] most of the occasions they were. Paramedics and police were there very very quickly. It was the fire service who were prevented, so it wasn’t that people were abandoned. Treatment was very quick and very real for many people.” Speaking on BBC Breakfast, Wallace added: “Quite rightly it [the Kerslake report] did pick out a failure in a communication between the fire service on the night and the police force in that local response. That is not in line with the guidance that is already in existence and the exercising. That is obviously a lesson to be learned to make sure people understand their role in the response.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/mar/29/majority-of-australians-support-phasing-out-coal-power-by-2030-survey-finds","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-28T17:00:08Z","webTitle":"Majority of Australians support phasing out coal power by 2030, survey finds","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/mar/29/majority-of-australians-support-phasing-out-coal-power-by-2030-survey-finds","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/mar/29/majority-of-australians-support-phasing-out-coal-power-by-2030-survey-finds","fields":{"headline":"Majority of Australians support phasing out coal power by 2030, survey finds","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"A majority of Australians would support phasing out coal power by 2030, including half the people in a sample identifying as Coalition voters, according to a survey by a progressive thinktank. The research funded by the Australia Institute says 60% of a sample of 1,417 Australians surveyed by online market research firm Research Now supported Australia joining the Powering Past Coal Alliance to phase out coal power by 2030. The Powering Past Coal Alliance – spearheaded by the UK and Canada – was unveiled at the COP23 climate talks in Bonn. The agreement is not legally binding, and the membership does not include Australia or other major coal exporters and users. The survey suggests there is a core level of support across Australia’s partisan divide for signing on, with 50% of Coalition voters supportive as well as 67% of ALP voters. The significant dissenters were One Nation voters, with only 36% supportive. A majority of Australians also supported increasing ambition on cutting greenhouse gas emissions, with 58% support, including 47% of Coalition voters in the sample. “The strong majority support for phasing out coal power shows how far the community is ahead of the government on climate change,” said the Australia Institute’s deputy director, Ebony Bennett. She said the Turnbull government’s approach on climate and energy policy meant Australia was at risk of missing out on jobs and investment associated with a global boom in renewable energy, and was out of step with public sentiment. The research follows a declaration on Wednesday at the National Press Club by the resources minister Matt Canavan that he was not interested in contemplating a discussion about a just transition for workers displaced by any phase out of coal consistent with Australia’s international climate obligations. Canavan said workers suffered when industries shut down or were phased out so euphemisms like “just transitions” were best avoided. “I don’t like the term transition, let’s be frank, if you want to shutdown the coal industry, say it – that’s what will happen.” The resources minister said expanding the coal industry was “not inconsistent with the obligations we’ve got to reduce carbon emissions”. He said countries were increasing investment in high-efficiency coal plants to reduce greenhouse gas emissions consistent with the Paris accord. Canavan did not mention that some countries, such as Japan, are increasing investment in high-efficiency coal because of a phase-out of nuclear power. Canavan also declared in response to a question about balancing his portfolio responsibilities to boost the resources sector with his responsibilities to the Queenslanders who elected him that he had been elected to parliament “on a platform that is unashamedly pro-coal”. While Canavan was elected because he was given a winnable position on the LNP’s Queensland Senate ticket, the resources minister said: “I got elected on the basis I will support the resources sector.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/ng-interactive/2018/mar/29/david-squires-on-the-socceroos-plan-to-gain-an-unfair-advantage","type":"interactive","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-28T17:00:09Z","webTitle":"David Squires on ... the Socceroos' plan to gain an unfair advantage","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ng-interactive/2018/mar/29/david-squires-on-the-socceroos-plan-to-gain-an-unfair-advantage","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/ng-interactive/2018/mar/29/david-squires-on-the-socceroos-plan-to-gain-an-unfair-advantage","fields":{"headline":"David Squires on ... the Socceroos' plan to gain an unfair advantage","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2018/mar/28/new-zealands-claim-it-has-no-russian-spies-is-perplexing-why-is-it-isolating-itself","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-28T04:50:29Z","webTitle":"New Zealand's claim it has no Russian spies is perplexing.

Why is it isolating itself?","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The New Zealand Labour government’s refusal to join international collective action against Russia over the nerve agent attack in the UK on former spy Sergei Skripal is perplexing. The 26-nation solidarity coalition expelling Russian diplomats and intelligence officers from their soil includes all of New Zealand’s major security partners as well as important trade counterparts. New Zealand is a member of the Five Eyes signals intelligence collection and sharing network including Australia, Canada, the UK and the US, so it has better knowledge than most as to what evidence the UK has to indicate that Vladimir Putin’s regime ordered the hit on Sergei Skripal. New Zealand is an extra-regional Nato and EU associate, and like the majority of the members of the coalition it is a democracy. New Zealand fashions itself as a good international citizen and honest broker in international affairs, so it seems odd that it would not join its closest diplomatic interlocutors in what is largely a symbolic gesture of repudiation of Russian misbehaviour abroad. The decision was made all the more quixotic by prime minister Jacinda Ardern’s claim that there are “no undeclared Russian intelligence operatives” in New Zealand and hence there was no need to expel anyone. She claimed to have assurances from the ministry of foreign affairs and trade (MFAT) that was the case, even though MFAT has no counter-intelligence function nor the ability to ascertain who is and who is not a Russian intelligence officer, declared or undeclared (that is the job of the Security Intelligence Service). So why has New Zealand chosen to isolate itself? Pragmatic assessments usually inform foreign policy decisions, particularly those involving choosing sides in international disputes. That is particularly true for small states when confronted with the demands of quarreling powers to take a position in favour of one side or the other. Lilliputians such as New Zealand usually think long and hard before taking an unpopular stand – particularly amongst friends. New Zealand’s decision not to participate in the solidarity coalition was made in the face of a direct request from the May government and in spite of the fact that the collective action is largely symbolic. Although Russian intelligence operations will be adversely affected in places like the UK, US and Germany, many of those being expelled are “normal” diplomats who can be recalled at some future date. So the downside to joining the coalition would seem relatively small even with Russian threats of retaliation, and the upside in terms of being seen to be a good diplomatic partner that supports international norms could well outweigh whatever the Russians can respond with. Perhaps there lies the explanation. New Zealand’s foreign policy in recent years has been trade obsessed and speculation has it that members of the foreign policy establishment see the possibility of advancing a bilateral free trade agreement (FTA) with Russia in the vacuum left by the trade sanctions levied on it in the wake of the Ukrainian invasion and annexation of Crimea. New Zealand and Russia opened talks on trade before the sanctions were imposed, then suspended them afterwards. Official advice from the foreign ministry is that violating the sanctions regime to try to exploit a possible window of opportunity vis a vis Russia is counterproductive at best. But talk in Wellington is that some in the Labour-led government are keen to resume negotiations, so taking a contrary stance on response to the nerve agent assassination attempt is a means of currying favour with Putin at a time when other competitors are not. It is also possible that Labour is attempting to stake out its “independent and autonomous” foreign policy credentials after nine years of the previous government’s rapprochement with the US and the other Five Eyes partners. Given the animosity felt towards Donald Trump (and to a lesser extent Theresa May) amongst Labour supporters as well as those of its coalition partners (New Zealand First and the Green party), this could be a way of playing David versus Goliath(s) for domestic audiences. And yet, pragmatic assessment of the situation would advise the Labour-led government to address the short and long term costs and benefits of alienating its most important foreign partners by refusing to join in the symbolic repudiation of Russia. By any objective measure, to include the possibility of securing bilateral trade with Putin’s regime, the costs of doing so will clearly outweigh the benefits even if it does not interfere with the daily business of intelligence sharing and military cooperation with the Five Eyes and other security partners. That is because in the diplomatic world the shadow of the future hangs heavily over present decision-making. The consequences of being shortsightedly contrarian are determined not by the contrarian but by those refused support on a matter of international consequence and foreign policy alignment. With that in mind the question remains: what does the New Zealand Labour government expect to gain from its contrarian stance?

A scene they had expected, but that nevertheless seemed surreal to them, unfolded on television: Donald Trump announced he was shrinking two national monuments in Utah. After he had finished, staff did a final legal review of a webpage they had prepared earlier and published it. On Patagonia’s site, the words “The President Stole Your Land” appeared in large white letters against a black background. “We were flattered with how viral it went and how provocative it ended up being,” said John Goodwin, brand creative director for Patagonia. On Thursday, Patagonia lobbed another volley in the fight for public lands: that message reappeared on the Patagonia homepage, with the addition of “and You Were Lied To”. An accompanying blogpost calls the monument reductions “deliberate and directly influenced” by the energy industry. In a lot of industries, mixing business and politics so blatantly might seem taboo. But when it comes to America’s protected landscapes, outdoor companies have determined that the benefits far outweigh the risks and launched an unprecedented effort opposing the Trump administration. In the face of efforts to open up public land to mining and drilling, big outdoors has begun to flex its muscles. “What we have to do as an industry,” said Peter Metcalf, the founder and recently retired CEO of the climbing company Black Diamond Equipment, “is organize in the same way that the NRA and the right-to-lifers have, and make public lands a primary, binary voting issue.” The outdoor industry, like many others, is confronting the emerging reality that under Trump, US consumers are looking more and more to brands to take a stand. To the extent that companies are adopting more radical positions than they have historically, “that’s probably a direct reflection of the radicalism, in the other direction, of the Trump administration,” said Marina Welker, associate professor of anthropology at Cornell, whose research focuses on the ethical relationship between business and society. This has perhaps been most publicly visible in the gun debate, in which even generally conservative companies such as Walmart are taking action that goes against the administration. That debate has also made ripples in the outdoor industry: in early March, REI put a hold on orders from Vista Outdoor, a supplier that owns brands including the water bottle and hydration-pack manufacturer CamelBak but earns the bulk of its profits on guns and ammunition. For companies like Patagonia and REI, whose employees and customers tend to share the “crunchiness” associated with conservation values and a passion for the outdoors, coming out strongly against the administration’s attacks on public lands was a natural next step. What’s more surprising, however, is the unified way the whole sector has mobilized. Companies that have long been engaged with these issues have turned up the volume on their advocacy, while companies that hadn’t previously taken a strong stance have begun reaching out to their customers. “For our industry, it didn’t take a lot of discussion,” said Amy Roberts, executive director of Outdoor Industry Association, which represents more than 1,200 outdoor businesses. The fact that the outdoor industry can now make an economic argument for the value of public lands – a recent report from the Outdoor Industry Association says the outdoor recreation economy generates $887bn a year – has also increased its political clout. The first sign that the industry was mobilizing in a serious way came shortly after Trump was elected. With the backing of prominent brands including Patagonia, REI and the North Face, the Outdoor Retailer trade show pulled out of its longtime home in Salt Lake City following an unsuccessful effort to convince the Utah governor, Gary Herbert, to reconsider his position on multiple public lands issues. Since then, outdoor companies have lent their support by donating money, getting the word out and, in Patagonia’s case, suing the administration over the reductions of Utah’s Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante national monuments by about 2m acres. The North Face, Osprey Packs, Black Diamond, and several other companies were founding partners on a project to build a new Bears Ears education center. Patagonia recently launched a new activism hub, Action Works, with the goal of helping people get involved with environmental issues near where they live. “We saw Utah’s lawmakers continue to threaten places that are invaluable to our environment, communities, and economy,” Arne Arens, president of the North Face, said in a statement. “When it came to taking a stand on Bears Ears last year,” he explained, “we were most worried about ramifications if we didn’t do something.” The decision to take any kind of political stance carries risks. When Keen launched its Live Monumental campaign in 2015, the outdoor footwear brand experienced this firsthand. The campaign sought protection for five different landscapes, and the company’s support for one of them – Oregon’s Owyhee Canyonlands – touched a nerve with some customers. As a producer of footwear for construction and ranching as well as hiking and boating, Keen has a broad customer base, and retailers from the surrounding region reported negative feedback from a few customers. “It blew over for the most part,” said Erin Gaines, Keen advocacy manager, though she added that a couple of retailers from the area surrounding the Owyhee did sever their relationships with the company as a result. Yet Keen’s takeaway from the experience is one that has since resonated throughout the industry: the support far outweighed the backlash. John Sterling, executive director of the Conservation Alliance, which collects dues from outdoor companies to fund grassroots conservation efforts, said the mobilization of outdoors companies only appears extraordinary absent its context. What’s going on is not normal, he argued. Never before has a president, in one fell swoop, stripped protections from 2m acres. “The election and the politics that have followed have been a direct assault on the lands that mean so much to the outdoor industry,” said Sterling. “The response right now is at the scale of the threat.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2018/mar/29/us-wildlife-extinction-species-report","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-29T15:00:17Z","webTitle":"Alarmed conservationists call for urgent action to fix 'America's wildlife crisis'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/mar/29/us-wildlife-extinction-species-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/mar/29/us-wildlife-extinction-species-report","fields":{"headline":"Alarmed conservationists call for urgent action to fix 'America's wildlife crisis'","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"An extinction crisis is rippling though America’s wildlife, with scores of species at risk of being wiped out unless recovery plans start to receive sufficient funding, conservationists have warned. One-third of species in the US are vulnerable to extinction, a crisis that has ravaged swaths of creatures such as butterflies, amphibians, fish and bats, according to a report compiled by a coalition of conservation groups. A further one in five species face an even greater threat, with a severe risk of being eliminated amid a “serious decline” in US biodiversity, the report warns. “America’s wildlife are in crisis,” said Collin O’Mara, chief executive of the National Wildlife Federation. “Fish, birds, mammals, reptiles and invertebrates are all losing ground. We owe it to our children and grandchildren to prevent these species from vanishing from the earth.” More than 1,270 species found in the US are listed as at risk under the federal Endangered Species Act, an imperiled menagerie that includes the grizzly bear, California condor, leatherback sea turtle and rusty patched bumble bee. However, the actual number of threatened species is “far higher than what is formally listed”, states the report by the National Wildlife Federation, American Fisheries Society and the Wildlife Society. Using data from NatureServe that assesses the health of entire groups of species on a sliding scale, rather than the case-by-case work done by the federal government, the analysis shows more than 150 US species have already become extinct while a further 500 species have not been seen in recent decades and have possibly also been snuffed out. Whole classes of creatures have suffered precipitous drops, with 40% of freshwater fish species in the US now vulnerable or endangered, a third of bat species experiencing major declines in the past two decades and amphibians dwindling from their known ranges at a rate of about 4% a year. The true scale of the crisis is probably larger when species with sparse data, or those as yet unknown to science, are considered. “This loss of wildlife has been sneaking up on us but is now like a big tsunami that is going to hit us,” said Thomas Lovejoy, a biologist at George Mason University. Lovejoy was consulted on the study and said it “captures the overall degradation of American nature over recent decades, rather than little snapshots”. Species have been battered by the destruction of forests, prairie and wetlands to make way for mass agriculture, urbanization, roads and mining. The use of pesticides in farming is linked to the decline of key pollinators such as bees. Meanwhile, improved transportation between states and from other countries has unleashed diseases such as fungal infections that have ravaged certain frogs and bats. Invasive species including feral hogs, nutria and emerald ash borers have torn apart wildlife habitats such as forests and riverbanks, often with little to slow them. Climate change is a further blow, with rising temperatures, sea level rise and altered rainfall all having consequences for species as diverse as bears, which are finding certain foodstuffs hard to come by, and monarch butterflies, which have seen their numbers drop by about 90% in recent decades and which are considered acutely sensitive to changes in weather patterns. “Species are living in smaller patches of habitat and not interacting with other members,” said Erle Ellis, a professor of geography and environmental systems at the University of Maryland. Ellis has co-authored research on how the world is moving toward its sixth great mass extinction event. “Extinctions are ramping up, and if that continues it will be one for the history books for the whole planet. The world is getting very humanized and I’m very concerned about the cost to biodiversity. It’s a challenge that will face us throughout this century and beyond.” The conservationists’ report calls for a major funding boost for recovery plans drawn up by states within the US. By “dramatically ramping up investments in proactive state-based conservation”, the US can stem and even reverse its species losses, the report states, pointing to success stories such as the reintroduction of Canada lynx to Colorado, wood bison to Alaska and the bolstering of trout populations across 17 states. There are about 12,000 species with recovery strategies across various US states, although wildlife conservation has typically suffered from funding shortfalls at the state level. The federal Fish and Wildlife Service was initially targeted for a budget cut under the Trump administration, although Congress recently handed it a modest increase in funds. “The states and counties are very uneven in their capacity so ideally you’d get some federal leadership,” said Lovejoy. “What’s quite promising is that there are civil society organizations who really care about this stuff. At some point the American public will wake up. “When you look at the trends of extinctions, it’s easy to get discouraged. The good news is that living things like to make more of themselves. Give them a chance and they will recover. Thank God for sex.” US Fish and Wildlife wouldn’t comment directly on the report. A spokeswoman for the agency said: “The ultimate goal of the Endangered Species Act is recovery. The greatest chance we have of achieving that goal is by working with diverse partners, including states and private and non-profit organizations, to leverage our cumulative knowledge and resources.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2018/mar/28/who-bit-beyonce-mystery-takes-over-social-media","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-28T03:57:10Z","webTitle":"Who bit Beyoncé?

In an earlier version of the story, Haddish suggested that the actor was flirting with Jay-Z at the time, before Beyoncé intervened.Haddish said that she later approached the pop-star about the incident. “So I said to Beyoncé, ‘Did she really bite you?’ She was like, ‘Yeah.’ I was like, ‘She gonna get her ass beat tonight.’ She was like, ‘Tiffany, no. Don’t do that. That bitch is on drugs. She not even drunk. The bitch is on drugs. She not like that all the time. Just chill,’” Haddish said. When asked for comment, a representative for Beyoncé told GQ: “I absolutely cannot comment on any of this, as I have no knowledge.” The episode, referred to as bite-gate, has sent internet sleuths into a frenzy, tweeting #WhoBitBeyonce and attempting to identify the culprit. A party guest list compiled by magazine The Cut found actors Sanaa Lathan and Sara Foster were in attendance, both of whom denied being the biter. Foster, who starred in the TV series 90210, responded to the allegations in an Instagram post, stating, “I wish I could get close enough to Beyoncé to bite her”. Sanaa Lathan declared on Twitter that the only biting she would do to Beyoncé would be in the form of a love bite. The TV presenter Chrissy Teigen also weighed in, tweeting: “I can only think of one person who would do this. But I cannot say. But she … is the worst”. The speculation continues."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/mar/28/pells-barrister-accuses-magistrate-of-bias-towards-prosecutors","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-28T03:50:55Z","webTitle":"Pell's barrister accuses magistrate of bias towards prosecutors","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/mar/28/pells-barrister-accuses-magistrate-of-bias-towards-prosecutors","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/mar/28/pells-barrister-accuses-magistrate-of-bias-towards-prosecutors","fields":{"headline":"Pell's barrister accuses magistrate of bias towards prosecutors","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Cardinal George Pell’s defence barrister, Robert Richter QC, has accused the magistrate presiding over Pell’s committal hearing of being biased towards prosecutors, calling on her to disqualify herself from the case. Richter made the application while cross-examining Det Supt Paul Sheridan, who worked with the taskforce established to investigate Pell. Richter pressed Sheridan about events alleged to have occurred at a movie theatre in 1978, and about efforts police made to verify those allegations, including investigating when the film was screened. Magistrate Belinda Wallington intervened to say she was not convinced the film had screened within the timeframe Richter stated it had, and challenged the line of questioning. She also asked Richter to stop shouting. Richter, known for his theatrical questioning, responded by calling on Wallington to “disqualify herself from hearing this matter on the basis of a biased view of the evidence”. Wallington responded: “Your application is refused.” The case continued. The court also heard that when a police taskforce to investigate Pell was established in March 2013, no allegations against him had been made to police. Richter put it to Sheridan that the police investigation, named Operation Tethering, “was an operation looking for a crime and a complainant”. “It was a ‘get Pell’ operation, wasn’t it?” Richter said. “Despite the police looking for people and asking them to complain, it was basically a complete non-starter and was put on ice, as it were, for some time until there was an allegation, if you can call it that ... made in March 2014.” Sheridan, who was one of the detectives who travelled to Rome in 2016 to interview Pell at the Vatican, responded that Operation Tethering was an “intel process to see if there were unreported serious crimes”. But he agreed with Richter that no-one came forward to police for one year, and when police approached someone who made a complaint in 2002 that was later dropped, that person did not want to talk to them. Richter told Sheridan that police had put Pell and his defence team at “forensic disadvantage” by initially presenting them with allegations without telling them the specific date, time and locations the offences were alleged to have occurred. “That’s problematic for someone who is presumed innocent to get their minds around,” Richter said. Sheridan responded; “I’d agree that’s a challenge, yes”. On Wednesday afternoon, Det Senior Constable David Rae was cross-examined by Richter. When asked by Richter about any notes he took the first time he spoke to complainants making allegations against Pell on the phone, Rae responded that it was not his practice to take notes during the initial conversation. Richter put it to him that not taking notes was a breach of police procedures. “No, it’s my practice,” Rae replied. “Your practice then,” Richter replied, “is appalling.” Rae said the reason he didn’t take notes in the first instance of speaking to them on the phone was because he would “cut them short” and make an appointment with them to get a full and detailed statement. “Your practice is not to collect an evidentiary trail of what you assert,” Richter said. “I disagree with that assertion,” Rae replied. Richter also criticised Rae for not reading psychiatric reports of some of the witnesses. “Well what do you know about their psychiatric history as to whether or not they are people who make up things?,” Richter asked. “Nothing,” Rae replied. “You just took them at their word, yes?” Richter asked. “On face value I take them at their word,” Rae agreed. The officers were also accused by Richter of putting more serious allegations of abuse at the hands of nuns and other people on the “back-burner” in order to pursue what he described as “less serious” allegations against Pell. Pell, who is 76, is the highest-ranking Vatican official to be charged in the Catholic church’s long-running sexual abuse scandal. He has taken leave from the Vatican in Rome to attend court. He has strenuously denied all allegations, which relate to historical sexual offences. Further description of the charges against Pell cannot be given for legal reasons. When the hearing adjourns on Thursday afternoon, magistrate Belinda Wallington will decide whether there is enough evidence to order Pell to stand trial. Her decision is expected some time in April. The committal hearing continues."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/mar/29/steve-smith-should-say-sorry-to-my-mum-for-ball-tampering-scandal","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-28T19:12:43Z","webTitle":"Steve Smith should say sorry to my mum for ball tampering scandal | Ben Smee","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/mar/29/steve-smith-should-say-sorry-to-my-mum-for-ball-tampering-scandal","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/mar/29/steve-smith-should-say-sorry-to-my-mum-for-ball-tampering-scandal","fields":{"headline":"Steve Smith should say sorry to my mum for ball tampering scandal","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Every Christmas at my mum’s place, her two sons fight over who gets the second bedroom. And every year she makes the same joke: we’ll both be out on our ear when her third son, Steve Smith, is finally able to visit for the festive season. We are “cricket people”. My parents met at a second-grade game in Newcastle. Mum was the scorer for her older brother’s side. Dad had a mop haircut and one scoring shot, a hoick over deep square leg. Their sons had no chance: cricket tragics to a fault. Sports fans – the rain, hail or 2am kick-off variety – attach themselves to players for all sorts of reasons. As a girl, Mum loved the rogue Doug Walters. Dad still talks about how fast and scary Jeff Thompson was. My brother can recite Steve Waugh’s career statistics. When I was about 15, Adam Gilchrist became my hero. I saw him play for New South Wales long before he made the international scene and felt it gave me a claim to being a real fan, like someone who saw Bruce Springsteen before 1975. Favourite players come and go. Some get replaced. Others can never be. About the time Gilchrist retired, my brother started talking about this young kid who had made his debut for NSW, and who would end up breaking all sorts of scoring records. Just imagine how many runs he’d make by the time he retired. He’d be the Best Since Bradman. Phillip Hughes was from my the same part of the world as my wife. We all rode his career highs and lows. Mum was on her computer at home, streaming the Sheffield Shield, when Phil was hit. I cried in the middle of a newsroom. We grieve more profoundly for people who have been part of our lives. Phil was part of my family. He died living my own dream. Not just living it, but fighting tooth and nail for it. The only way he ever responded to setbacks, to being dropped three times, was by going back to the crease and scoring runs. Smith took Hughes’s mantle in a lot of ways. As the talented young bloke from NSW, the Best Since Bradman, on track to break every record in the book. And the object of Mum’s devotion, her “third son”. “My Smithy.” Steve Smith owes my mum an apology. Stuff the ICC and Cricket Australia and the South Africans and his team-mates. It’s the fans he has so badly let down, everyone who spent hundreds fronting up to the Ashes this year just to see him bat, in the same way they once came to watch Bradman. I’ve spoken to Mum several times about it this week. She was getting text messages from gloating friends and colleagues, as if she harboured some maternal responsibility. And she was ashamed in the same way she would have been if one of her actual sons had been caught cheating. It’s not the way she brought us up to play or respect the game. Sports fans can be one-eyed. Football supporters notoriously loathe diving but can find shades of grey when one of their own heroes stumbles at a phantom touch. On Sunday morning our first instinct was to search for a grey area in Smith’s actions. Anything that might somehow deflect some of the criticism or salvage his reputation. But it seems clear there were no mitigating circumstances and we’re left with a hollow feeling."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2018/mar/27/spain-argentina-international-friendly-match-report","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-27T22:05:36Z","webTitle":"Spain’s winning identity intact as they hit Argentina for six in friendly win","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/mar/27/spain-argentina-international-friendly-match-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/mar/27/spain-argentina-international-friendly-match-report","fields":{"headline":"Spain’s winning identity intact as they hit Argentina for six in friendly win","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"For a long time Spain lamented the fact that they were world champions of friendlies but not when it came to the actual tournaments, so there will be a reluctance to fall into the old, momentarily forgotten trap of reading too much into results such as this. The optimism will be inevitable, though, after their performances in Düsseldorf on Friday and against Argentina on Tuesday night – even if their opponents were without Lionel Messi, the one man who can often seem like the entire team. He watched from the stands as his team-mates were defeated 6-1 with a hat-trick from Isco and one each from Diego Costa, Thiago Alcântara and Iago Aspas. Unable to escape the group in Brazil four years ago, incapable of winning a knockout game at Euro 2016, Spain look like the Spain that won three tournaments in a row. Only some of those footballers are still around – Andrés Iniesta and Sergio Ramos started, while David Silva had been released after the game in Germany and Sergio Busquets was injured – but the identity remains. It has been recovered by Julen Lopetegui. Argentina, meanwhile, are yet to find theirs. Without Messi – without Angel Di María, Sergio Agüero and Paulo Dybala either – it felt as if there was not much point seeking it here. Time is running out to build a mechanism that works. There was little here to offer optimism for the Argentinians in Madrid who made this an occasion, bar occasional first‑half moments from Giovani Lo Celso and Meza. When they came forward there were glimpses of vulnerability at the back for Spain. But there was velvet elsewhere. This game was only 28 minutes old when the olés began; Spain by then were 2-0 up. If there had been disappointment at Messi’s absence, Isco, Iniesta and Asensio made up for it. Iniesta’s last waltz promises to be something special; the men he leaves behind do too, the transition as smooth as their exchanges. Their positions were fluid and fast, playing together superbly, with Jordi Alba racing up to the left and Koke and Thiago behind them. In front of them was Costa. At the other end was Gonzalo Higuaín. And while Higuaín missed the first chance of the game, scuffing a simple opportunity, Costa took his after 12 minutes. Crashing into Sergio Romero as he scored, he seemed to have hurt himself, staying down while the stadium PA operator momentarily held off blasting out Seven Nation Army. Instead it was Romero who had to depart, replaced by Willy Caballero. The opener, like the second, had been provided by Asensio. Costa was withdrawn at half-time and his replacement made an almost instant impact. Argentina had got one back from Nicolás Otamendi’s header just before the break but the lead was extended swiftly. The third was provided by Aspas, on as a substitute, who dashed round Caballero and pulled the ball back for Isco. Álvaro Morata’s chances of going to Russia appeared reduced then and even more so soon after, as Aspas sped this game up, always involved. Three minutes later Thiago made it four, the multiple substitutions began and it threatened to get edgy as Argentina’s frustration showed in their tackles, but Spain had still not finished. David de Gea – yes, De Gea – provided the assist for Aspas to make it 5-1 and then Isco completed his hat-trick, departing to a standing ovation that, like so many of Spain’s moves, had been building from the start."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/mar/28/trump-lawyers-mueller-investigation-none-for-president","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-28T15:46:52Z","webTitle":"Lawyers, lawyers everywhere.

And none to represent Trump","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"It matters that Donald Trump can’t find a great lawyer to represent him. Just ask Richard Nixon. In disgrace following his 1974 White House resignation, Nixon paced and pondered the “what ifs” from exile in San Clemente, California. He placed a call to Washington, DC to the one man he thought could have made a difference and saved him from his ignominious fate and place in American history as the only president to resign from the job. “I wish you were my lawyer,” he told Edward Bennett Williams, who, at the time, was the most famous litigator since Clarence Darrow. But it was way too late for such regrets. It may be too late for Donald Trump, too. Lawyers, including John Dowd, have been ousted. Lawyers, most notably Michael Cohen, have been exposed as thugs allegedly paying hush money to a porn star. Lawyers, well-placed Republicans like Ted Olsen, have said no. More recently, other lawyers, like Chicago’s Dan Webb, also declined to come aboard. Lawyers found conflicts to prevent them from representing Trump, like Joe DeGenova and his wife, Victoria Toensing. Lawyers, lawyers everywhere but none who jump for Trump. He will, of course, eventually find someone willing to serve as lead counsel alongside his existing, threadbare team. Unsurprisingly, he seems in utter denial that there is any problem with his legal representation. On Sunday, peeved by news reports that he cannot find a willing lawyer, the President tweeted: “Many lawyers and top law firms want to represent me in the Russia case...don’t believe the Fake News narrative that it is hard to find a lawyer who wants to take this on. Fame &amp; fortune will NEVER be turned down by a lawyer…” The problem for the white-collar defense bar’s crème de la crème is that Donald Trump is so blatantly the client from hell. He won’t listen. He won’t obey instructions. He is headstrong. He is a bully. Sometimes, he doesn’t pay his bills. Most of all, it’s possible that he isn’t capable of discerning fact from fiction. This last foible could get any lawyer who represents him into very deep legal hot water. No one wants to get disbarred for the fame and fortune of representing President Trump. Then there’s the justifiable concern over all the unforced legal errors that the defense side, led by Trump himself, has already committed. They begin with Trump’s disastrous appointment of Michael Flynn as his first National Security Adviser. Flynn, who was indicted last year, is now believed to be cooperating with Special Counsel Robert Mueller. The Flynn error was soon followed by the even more disastrous decision by Trump to fire former FBI Director James Comey when he refused to dump the Flynn investigation. The Comey firing is being fly-specked by Mueller and his team of investigators to see whether there were White House efforts to obstruct justice. The trail leads way back to the 2016 campaign, when Jared Kushner, Donald Trump Jr and Paul Manafort met with the Natalia Veselnitskaya, a Russian lawyer, who claimed to have valuable dirt on Hillary Clinton. Was this meeting early evidence of collusion with Russia to bend the American election Trump’s way? Mr Manafort has also been indicted, on multiple counts, by Mueller with a trial expected to begin in September. That’s a lot of pre-game action for any lawyer, no matter how experienced, to handle. Then there’s the storminess of the Stormy Daniels mess and Cohen’s unsavory $130,000 to buy her silence. There’s been speculation that those funds could constitute an illegal in-kind campaign donation. Of all white collar cases, election law violations are ones many of the best white-collar defense lawyers view as chicken shit and not worth their time. So good luck finding a strong lawyer to go up against Stormy’s media-savvy and smart-on-his-feet lawyer Michael Avenatti, who only the other day was on cable television musing about the stupidity of Trump’s existing lawyers. On Morning Joe on Tuesday, Avenatti uttered this eminently quotable line: “In 18 years of practice I’ve seen some really good chess players. These folks are paying tic tac toe.” It’s hard to disagree with that.

Yes Joe Hart England’s most capped player will surely revert to his role at the 2010 finals as third-choice. Yes Nick Pope His push came late at Burnley but the 25-year-old was always an outsider. No Defenders Joe Gomez Gareth Southgate spies real promise in the versatile defender, despite an ankle injury limiting him to 10 minutes across both games. Yes Alfie Mawson Will have benefited from involvement with the seniors over the past week but only an outside chance of travelling. No Kyle Walker An asset at right wing-back but now also in central defence. A key player in Russia. Yes Danny Rose Patchy form at club level and not quite the certainty he once was. But a natural wing-back with tournament experience. Yes John Stones Southgate’s preference in the middle of the back three, even if he is guilty of over-confidence at times. Yes Ryan Bertrand A back problem denied him involvement but he has been a regular under this regime. Yes James Tarkowski Shaky on debut and likely to be edged out in the final reckoning by more experienced campaigners. No Harry Maguire Impressed against the Dutch and fits the system.

Given that knee condition flares up regularly, can Southgate risk him at a tournament? No Dele Alli Southgate opted against starting him in these fixtures but his link up with Kane remains an asset. Yes Jesse Lingard Thriving at this level having made a fine impression in both games. Now challenging Alli for a starting berth. Yes Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain Offered a chance centrally having impressed at Liverpool and suits the style Southgate is promoting. Yes Jordan Henderson Thrived as a midfield pivot in Amsterdam and his leadership qualities have earned praise from the management. Yes Forwards Raheem Sterling Mightily impressive in both games and that 20-game scoring drought will surely not be prolonged for much longer. Yes Danny Welbeck A fringe player at Arsenal with 15 international goals to his name but may be the odd one out. In the balance Marcus Rashford So sprightly last week, and can operate wide or centrally. His pace and opportunism make him an asset. Yes Jamie Vardy Failed to touch the ball in Amsterdam but finished emphatically at Wembley. A powerful option from start or bench. Yes Sure to go if fit? Harry Kane, recovering from an ankle problem, will lead England’s line while Phil Jones is a relatively experienced option at centre-half. Still in contention? Gary Cahill and Michael Keane would need strong finishes to the season while Ruben Loftus-Cheek and Harry Winks must prove their fitness."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/2018/mar/28/essentially-cheating-ball-tampering-has-hit-australias-reputation-julie-bishop-says","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-27T22:17:00Z","webTitle":"'Essentially cheating': ball tampering has hit Australia's reputation, Julie Bishop says","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/mar/28/essentially-cheating-ball-tampering-has-hit-australias-reputation-julie-bishop-says","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/mar/28/essentially-cheating-ball-tampering-has-hit-australias-reputation-julie-bishop-says","fields":{"headline":"'Essentially cheating': ball tampering has hit Australia's reputation, Julie Bishop says","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Australia’s foreign affairs minister, Julie Bishop, says the national cricket team’s ball-tampering scandal has damaged the country’s reputation, describing the actions of the three players at the centre of the controversy as “essentially cheating”. Politicians, commentators and former players have continued to weigh-in on the scandal after Cricket Australia chief executive James Sutherland revealed overnight that the three players at the centre of the scandal would be sent home from the tour. Speaking to reporters on Wednesday, Bishop said she’d been approached by “many” overseas high commissioners and ambassadors in Canberra about the scandal, saying international officials were “stunned” by the actions. “They are astounded that elite sportsmen in our country could behave in this way,” she said. “Some are asking how could this happen? What did they think they were doing? It’s just not cricket.” Asked whether the scandal had damaged Australia’s international reputation, Bishop said it had “in the sense that these were elite sportsmen representing our country”. “Australia is seen as a country that plays fair, that plays by the rules [and] abides by the rules,” she said. “Any attempt to gain an unfair advantage … essentially cheating, is a surprise. I think people were taken aback.” Speaking later on breakfast television she reiterated her criticism of the players, saying they had “brought Australian cricket into disrepute” and was glad they were being brought home from the tour. Her comments came shortly after Sutherland held a press conference in South Africa stating that only three players had been involved in the ball tampering. Sutherland said Darren Lehmann would keep his job as head coach, but the three players at the centre of the scandal would be sent home from the tour in disgrace. Steve Smith, the Australia captain, his deputy, David Warner, and the batsman Cameron Bancroft have been told to expect “significant sanctions” in the next 24 hours for their role in the plot in which Bancroft was caught scuffing the ball with a piece of grit-covered sticky-tape. His finding that only three players were involved in the scandal left many bemused. Footage shows Lehmann communicating with the 12th man, Peter Handscomb, via walkie talkie before the latter ran on, seemingly to tell Bancroft he had been caught on camera. Former England players Michael Vaughn and Kevin Pietersen tweeted their scepticism, while the former Australia captain Michael Clarke wrote that Australian cricket would remain “in deep shit” until administrators gave “the truth, the full story, accountability and leadership”. “To [sic] many reputations on the line for the full story not to come out. Cape Town change room is a very small place!” Reports in the wake of the controversy have suggested that Warner has fallen out with the rest of the Australian side and on Wednesday morning the respected ABC commentator Jim Maxwell questioned whether the decorated batsman would ever play for Australia again. “As far as Warner is concerned the punishment should actually be greater [than what is handed out to Smith and Bancroft], from what I’m hearing, and the players have pretty much ostracised him,” Maxwell said on Wednesday. “I would have a feeling that beyond any ban he may never play for Australia again out of all this because he’s so much on the nose with the players and probably the public too with some of his behaviour. “The leopard spots came back in the last few weeks. I think he’s the main problem right now with the side, in terms of its attitude – there are others who may be accused of the same.” Sutherland had been expected to detail the punishments to be handed out to the players, but did say that at least in the short term the wicketkeeper Tim Paine would take over captain duties. The former England cricketer and broadcaster Jonathan Agnew said Sutherland’s press conference had created “more questions than answers”. “Too many contradictions, like rapidly diminished leadership group and use of walkie talkie, to make this go away,” he wrote. “Current blood lust is way over the top, but cricket public &amp; sponsors want clarity, trust in the team and a culture change.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2018/mar/28/the-danger-of-nostalgia-a-tough-timely-final-season-of-the-americans","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-28T11:00:00Z","webTitle":"The danger of nostalgia: a tough, timely final season of The Americans","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/mar/28/the-danger-of-nostalgia-a-tough-timely-final-season-of-the-americans","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2018/mar/28/the-danger-of-nostalgia-a-tough-timely-final-season-of-the-americans","fields":{"headline":"The danger of nostalgia: a tough, timely final season of The Americans","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"In one of the most interesting scenes in the sixth, and final, season of The Americans, Elizabeth (Keri Russell) and Claudia (Margo Martindale) teach Paige (Holly Taylor) to cook as part of her immersion into Russian culture. “It’s peasant food,” Claudia tells Paige, as she slices carrots. “They know how to survive. We’re always having droughts, famines, wars.” “My mother used to make pots of this,” Elizabeth laughs, “We’d eat it for weeks.” “You never got sick of it?” Paige asks. “That wasn’t an issue,” Elizabeth says, still smiling and clearly amused by her daughter’s question, which indicates the huge cultural gulf between them. As a born-and-raised American girl, Paige first thinks of food in terms of choices, not in terms of hunger. Claudia and Elizabeth can introduce Paige to Soviet TV dramas, play Tchaikovsky records for her, and make bowls of zharkoye all day, but her experience of Russian culture is one of a foreigner dabbling in a new tradition, rather than someone who intuitively understands her ethnic heritage. For Elizabeth, the Russia she grew up with also lacks a solid foundation in reality. Her memories of the motherland do not reflect any of the harsh realities she has had to endure since becoming a spy. The Russia of her dreams isn’t real at all; it’s an imaginary place. This season’s focus on Elizabeth’s insistence on Soviet greatness, despite all evidence to the contrary, is particularly searing right now. When The Americans first aired in 2013, the 80s world of politics was meant to capture a particular historical time period that seemed safely far away. Today, Russian-US relations are again dominating the media, and the rallying cry to make America great illustrates how many in the US are also yearning for a return to an indeterminate past. Despite the giant clunky computers and big hair, in its final season, The Americans’ close look at cold war politics seems current, as does its incisive look at the power and pitfalls of nostalgia. For the past five seasons, we’ve seen how the Jennings family both adapts to and resists America’s cultural pull. Though Philip and Elizabeth learn about American culture the same way that Paige learns about her family’s Russian traditions — through formalized instruction that makes them aware of American attitudes and sensibilities, expressions, and points of cultural reference. Over the years, the biggest growing difference between Philip and Elizabeth’s experience of American culture is that Philip grows a fondness for it, while Elizabeth continues to spurn it. It’s not just the flashy cars and big comfortable houses that Philip is drawn to either; it’s the gentler sensibility, his quiet acceptance of the American Dream. As the series progresses, he starts to attend Erhard Seminar Trainings (EST) where he learns to get in touch with feelings he was forced to push down when he was training for his work as a spy. When Paige comes home distressed over something she’s seen, he tenderly advises her, “It’s better to feel bad and go through it than to pretend not to feel anything,” words of wisdom that are more Mister Rogers than Mr. and Mrs. Smith. When gearing up for work at the newly expanded travel agency, he inspires team spirit by encouraging entrepreneurship. His goal isn’t to preserve the motherland any longer; he is happy to make a personal profit. In contrast, Elizabeth continues to feel no warmth for any aspect of American culture at all, even though she has lived in the United States for twenty years. She disparages the quirks that Philip finds endearing and refuses to see the Russian culture she grew up in as anything other than right and true. In a particularly poignant scene, Elizabeth offers Phillip the zharkoye that she, Claudia, and Paige had spent the day making, even though she knows they aren’t allowed to keep it in the house. Elizabeth beams at her husband expectantly. “It smells great,” he tells her and then sighs, “I just ate a whole order of Kung Po Chicken and Lo Mein.” He gestures to the disposable containers are all over the table. Elizabeth is clearly disappointed. Even when Phillip takes a bite and tells her it is delicious, his tepid response is not enough for her. She wants Phillip to crave the old country in a way that he clearly doesn’t. She flings the food in the sink, washing it all down the garbage disposal. Elizabeth’s loyalty to the motherland blinds her to any of its flaws, and also hinders her ability to see things that are right in front of her — that many of the Americans she has killed have been good people who didn’t deserve to die, that when she insults Americans she is talking about her son and daughter too. When Phillip suggests that things might be opening up, that maybe one day they will be inviting Stan, their neighbor and FBI nemesis, to share in a meal of zharkoye, Elizabeth is insulted, but Phillip persists: “It’s not just politics. It’s young people. It’s music. It’s different.” he tells Elizabeth, “They’re talking about opening up a Pizza Hut in Moscow.” “I don’t want to be like them,” Elizabeth replies, angrily. These first few episodes of season six illustrate just how deep the cultural wedge between the two of them has gotten. To Elizabeth, the Americans are still the proverbial “other.” To Phillip, they’ve become a kind of second family. The Americans has always been a hard-eyed and often violent look at people who are willing to betray basic human morality and decency in the name of the country they love. In the world of the show, compassion is often portrayed more as a risk than an asset, a message that Philip and Elizabeth both learned through years of indoctrination. And yet, in this season we see more clearly than ever before how Elizabeth’s obsession with the Russia of her youth is slowly destroying her. Despite the abusive ways the Soviet government has treated her and her family, the narrative that the old ways are falling out of favor amongst her own people demands that she be willing to rewrite her own story, something she just doesn’t seem ready to confront. The Americans certainly shows that this kind of willful historical revision is both terrible and also a fairly common human response to trauma. Philip has always been the most easily identifiable protagonist. He loves deeply. He dislikes violence. He struggles to come to terms with a terrible childhood. But in its final season, The Americans’ focus is on the far less likable Elizabeth, deeply cutthroat, occasionally cruel, consistently loyal. Season 6 seems to be offering the chance for Elizabeth to find out who she is outside of the cause she has devoted her life to. “What do you see?” a dying woman asks her, as she shows Elizabeth one of her drawings. When Elizabeth can’t go beyond the most basic assessment, the woman urges her to try to draw something herself. “It’s light and dark. That’s all.” the woman tells her, gesturing at an ordinary coffee mug. At first, Elizabeth resists, but, eventually, after some more prodding, she gives in. She looks confused, frustrated, and maybe even a little amused or even excited, as she is suddenly forced to see the world in front of her exactly as it is. The Americans starts in the US on FX from 28 March and in the UK on ITV4 from 4 April"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"us-news/2018/mar/28/alton-sterling-death-baton-rouge-louisiana","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-28T17:24:58Z","webTitle":"Alton Sterling shooting: lack of charges prompts sadness but not surprise","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/mar/28/alton-sterling-death-baton-rouge-louisiana","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/mar/28/alton-sterling-death-baton-rouge-louisiana","fields":{"headline":"Alton Sterling shooting: lack of charges prompts sadness but not surprise","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"At the Triple S mart in northern Baton Rouge, where in July 2016 Alton Sterling was killed by police officers, it was mostly business as usual on Tuesday. Out front, Travis Hicks sold CDs under a portrait of Sterling while folks filtered in and out for lottery scratch tickets, Gatorade and chips. To the side, another vendor hawked boiled crawfish, $4 a pound. The only discernible sign of anything unusual was a small group who had gathered in the wake of Louisiana attorney general Jeff Landry’s decision not to charge officers Blane Salamoni and Howie Lake over Sterling’s death. After a scuffle, Salamoni shot Sterling – who had been selling CDs – six times. Some were saddened, others angry. Some wanted to show up to “do something positive”. None could register much in the way of surprise. “I knew nothing was going to happen after what happened with the last one,” said Queen Shakur, referring to the federal decision not to indict the officers that was handed down last summer. Authorities in Baton Rouge spent Monday night fortifying parts of the city, throwing up barricades and installing floodlights. They called in reinforcements from other parts of Louisiana, in case people took to the streets. But no demonstrations arose. Out front of police headquarters, as in the rest of city, all was quiet. “The people wasn’t going to tear up the city because, let me tell you, the people, we already knew the verdict,” said Rosalyn Scott, another resident who had come to the Triple S. Scott said she remained hopeful that at the very least Salamoni would be fired at the conclusion of an administrative review. But it was a hope that could only be expressed in the most cynical of terms. “You’ve got to give the people something,” Scott said. “You didn’t give them a conviction, you didn’t give them an arrest, so you gotta give the people something to shut them up. If you don’t give them that firing, this city just might go crazy.” The Baton Rouge police chief, Murphy Paul, said on Tuesday he expected the review to last about a week. Other officials have suggested an announcement could be made by Friday. The investigation of Sterling’s death revealed that within seconds of arriving at the convenience store on 5 July 2016, in answer to an unidentified caller’s report of having been threatened with a gun, Salamoni approached the 37-year-old father of five with a gun pointed at his head. Sterling was carrying a gun. The officers said they thought he had reached for it. The store owner said he had not. Use-of-force experts cited in Landry’s report were critical of the officers’ conduct, though they concluded that the shooting was “reasonable”. The silence that greeted Landry’s report may not only have been the product of fatalist discouragement. It may have been tactical, too. Shaena Johnson, an organizer with Astraea LGBTQ Racial Justice Fund, told the Guardian a group of young activists had asked her to tell media the lack of visible protest was intentional, and that plans for demonstrations were still in the works. “They don’t want the national activists to come in and steal their light so that’s why they’re doing it the way they’re doing it,” Johnson said. Many young activists, she said, were frustrated by the way out-of-town figures with large national followings showed up in the city to protest against Sterling’s death and received an outsized share of the media’s attention. The arrest of well-known protester DeRay McKesson made headlines nationwide. More than 200 people, Scott among them, were jailed in total. Johnson said the young activists were spreading messages by word of mouth rather than flyers or social-media posts. “There is a strategy,” she said. “The young folks are active and they are moving. They are the ones that were moving last time. They just didn’t get credit for it.” This article was amended on 28 March 2018 to correct that Shaena Johnson works for Astraea LGBTQ Racial Justice Fund and is no longer at Empower Baton Rouge."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/live/2018/mar/28/markets-nervous-after-tech-shakeout-and-ahead-of-us-gdp-business-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-28T13:53:15Z","webTitle":"Shire jumps on possible offer from Japan's Takeda, markets nervous after tech shakeout - as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2018/mar/28/markets-nervous-after-tech-shakeout-and-ahead-of-us-gdp-business-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/live/2018/mar/28/markets-nervous-after-tech-shakeout-and-ahead-of-us-gdp-business-live","fields":{"headline":"Shire jumps on possible offer from Japan's Takeda, markets nervous after tech shakeout - as it happened","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"It was another volatile session for stock markets. After Tuesday’s slump on Wall Street, driven predominantly by sharp declines in technology stocks, European markets opened mostly lower. However they came off their worst levels as the US market managed to stage a mild recovery, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average currently marginally in positive territory, up 35 points, although the tech-heavy Nasdaq is down around 1%. Amazon in particular is being hit by reports that the US president plans to go after the company and altering its tax treatment. The FTSE 100, now up around 9 points, was supported by news of a potential bid for UK listed pharmaceutical group Shire from Japan’s Takeda. Shire’s shares jumped, valuing the company at more than £35bn at one point. Elsewhere there was more bad news for the UK high street, with retail sales falling in March for the first time since October, according to the CBI. But the US economy grew more strongly than expected in the final quarter. And there was a positive report on the eurozone economy from S&amp;P Global ratings. On that note, it’s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we’ll be back tomorrow. Back with Shire, and Ketan Patel at EdenTree Investment Management says it could be a key moment if a deal goes ahead: If a bid does materialise from Takeda for drug maker Shire, it would be a watershed moment for Japanese pharma. There hasn’t been a cross border transaction in the sector, excluding joint ventures and small generic M&amp;A. Takeda’s cash laden balance sheet appears a good fit for Shire’s struggling balance sheet, following recent large scale M&amp;A. The attraction for Takeda is the highly lucrative rare disease market in the US, which comes with exceedingly high margins and is largely exempt from the usual pricing pressure that affects the wider pharmaceutical sector. After Tuesday’s tech-inspired slump, there is little respite for the sector despite US markets generally starting the day on a slightly more positive note. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 121 points or 0.53% in early trading, while the S&amp;P 500 has edged up 0.05%. But the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite has opened down 0.35%. The stronger than expected US GDP figure will revive talk about how many interest rate rises the Federal Reserve will sanction this year. Dennis de Jong, managing director at UFX.com, said: Robust jobs growth and healthy consumer spending have been attributed to today’s stronger than expected US GDP data, as the country’s economic outlook appears in rude health and the 3% growth target appears within touching distance. ...As a result of the strong economic outlook, questions may be raised around the possibility of Fed Chair Jerome Powell introducing a June rate hike. It may be a case of US growth being monitored before any rate decision is made, but markets could be volatile between now and then. The 2.9% growth in the US economy, although better than the initial estimates, shows a slowdown from the 3.2% rise recorded in the third quarter. The figures were helped by the biggest rise in consumer spending for three years, offset by a surge in imports. The Bureau of Economic Analysis said: The increase in real GDP in the fourth quarter primarily reflected positive contributions from personal consumption expenditures, nonresidential fixed investment, exports, residential fixed investment, state and local government spending, and federal government spending that were partly offset by a negative contribution from private inventory investment. Imports, which are a subtraction in the calculation of GDP, increased. Breaking news: Something for Donald Trump to tweet about. The US economy grew more strongly than expected in the final quarter, up 2.9% on an annualised basis compared to expectations of a 2.7% increase and an initial estimate of 2.5% growth. Here’s some analyst reaction to the possible Shire deal. Peter Welford at Jefferies says the structure of any deal is uncertain: We see the potential strategic rationale for the deal and have long highlighted Shire is currently trading at a substantial discount to our fundamental 4300p or so value given overhangs, notably haemophilia competitive concerns. Nevertheless Takeda’s near.$42bn market cap versus Shire’s $47bn or $66bn enterprise value raises questions on a potential deal structure.... We presume Takeda would need a significant equity raise to acquire Shire, suggesting a “merger” is perhaps better terminology, which may raise hurdles to the successful completion of any future deal. Jack Scannell at UBS says other bidders could emerge: Since Takeda’s market cap is close to Shire’s we assume a potential offer would have to include a substantial percentage in equity and how Shire’s board and shareholders would react is hard to predict. However as Shire’s share price is significantly below the net present value of our cash flow estimates, Takeda could trigger discussion of other bidders. Shire does not strike us as an obvious take-over candidate. There is presumably a price at which the financial engineering would work. However, Shire’s specialty focus and mix of therapeutic foci means that most buyers would struggle to extract substantial operational synergies while escaping from competition problems, in our view. Also Shire’s low corporate tax rate could rise in most scenarios were the company acquired. It would also be a bold acquisition in our view given the uncertain trajectory of Shire’s haemophilia business. A merger of equals in this context might be more feasible. The potential offer for Shire has helped the FTSE 100 come off its worst levels after the morning’s earlier declines. The UK’s leading index is now down just 0.12% or around 8 points, with Shire up 18% and fellow drugs group GlaxoSmithKline 1.5% better. Elsewhere though the fallout from the US tech slump continues. Germany’s Dax remains down 0.7%, while France’s Cac is 0.9% lower. Meanwhile US futures are suggesting a rebound of sorts on Wall Street, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average forecast to open around 67 points higher. Here’s our story on the possible takeover of Shire by Japan’s Takeda: Shares in the UK-listed drugmaker Shire surged after Japan’s biggest pharmaceutical company, Takeda Pharmaceutical, said it was considering making a takeover approach. Shire’s shares jumped as much as 33% to £38.79 on the news, and later traded 17% higher at £36, valuing the company at £32.8bn. Takeda’s market value is about £29bn, around the same as Shire’s at last night’s closing price. Shire is best known for its ADHD drug Adderall but its focus in recent years has been on rare diseases. The company is based in Dublin for tax purposes but run from Boston. Most of its operations are in the US. The news comes three-and-a-half years after US firm AbbVie abandoned its agreed $54bn (£34bn) takeover of Shire, after a US clampdown on so-called tax inversions by US companies buying an overseas business to secure a lower tax rate. Shire then turned acquiror and completed its $32bn purchase of US firm Baxalta last June. In November it reported a drop in sales of haemophilia drugs, which became its biggest source of revenue following the deal. The full report is here: Here is the full statement from Takeda, which includes more detail of the Japanese company’s thinking: Takeda believes that a potential transaction with Shire presents an opportunity to advance Takeda’s stated Vision 2025, build on its current strong momentum, and create a truly global, value-based Japanese biopharmaceutical leader. In particular, a transaction with Shire would: · strengthen Takeda’s core therapeutic areas of oncology, GI and neuroscience · accelerate Takeda’s vision to be a leader in specialized medicines that are transformative to patients through the addition of Shire’s leading global rare disease franchise · further enhance Takeda’s robust R&amp;D strategy, concentrating on key therapeutic areas · reinforce a strong and large-molecule focused late-stage pipeline within Takeda’s core therapeutic areas to complement Takeda’s own pipeline and discovery capabilities · balance Takeda’s geographic focus to align with the market opportunity in the U.S. · drive financial value from a strong combined financial profile Clearly defined strategic and financial objectives are core to Takeda’s disciplined approach to acquisitions, including in relation to its dividend policy and credit rating, which are well-established. Any potential offer for Shire, if made, would have to align with this strict investment criteria. Back to Shire: More from the CBI’s high street survey: More bad news for the high street, with a new survey showing a slump in sales this month. Reuters reports: British retail sales fell for the first time in five months in March as heavy snowfall combined with the financial strains on many households, a survey by the Confederation of British Industry showed on Wednesday. The CBI distributive trades survey’s retail sales balance fell to -8 from +8 in February, confounding a median forecast of +15 in a Reuters poll of economists. “Against a backdrop of stagnating household incomes and weak consumer confidence, the lengthy cold snap earlier this month has heaped added pressure on retailers,” Ben Jones, a CBI economist, said. “Freezing conditions and transport disruption caused people to avoid the high street. With many forced to work from home, telecoms firms saw record internet traffic, yet on-line shopping slowed sharply given the potential for disrupted deliveries.” A measure of sales for the time of year was the weakest since April 2013, the survey showed. Retailers expected sales volumes and orders to grow in April but only at a subdued pace. Elsewhere, the latest report from the Bank of England’s network of regional agents has just come out with some good news to cheer British workers. Used to detect early warning signs for the economy, the quarterly report compiles the views of businesses recorded by the Bank’s 12 regional outposts. In their latest assessment, the agents say companies are handing out pay rises worth between 2.5% and 3.5% - which would be inflation-busting for staff at the top end of that range. Firms are also telling the agents inflation is beginning to fade. Elsewhere in the report for the first three months of the year, there’s an interesting look at how company chief executives are preparing for Brexit. Apparently, two fifths from more than 3,000 firms surveyed are not spending any time at all each week on Brexit. They had better hope the government’s transitional arrangements, agreed in principal earlier this month, will help smooth the process as advertised. Meanwhile, there’s a contrarian view over the collapse of Carillion. Far from being the disaster for the wider construction industry forecast by experts, firms tell the agents it hasn’t had much of an impact at all. There has been “little evidence of a significant impact on the supply chain or on the availability of credit to the sector” so far, the agents report. Shire shares - which climbed as high as £38.79 on news of the possible approach by Takeda - have come off their best levels. The rather conditional nature of the Japanese statement means Shire is now at £35.45, still 15% better on the day. Takeda says it is at a preliminary and exploratory stage in considering a bid, and no approach has been made to the Shire board. Meanwhile Takeda - Japan’s biggest pharmaceutical company - is worth some £29bn. This is less than Shire’s value after today’s jump, but around the same as the UK-listed company was worth at last night’s closing price. Shire is worth £35bn after its shares jumped to £38 on the news of Takeda’s possible approach. Breaking news: Pharmaceutical group Shire has soared 25% after Japan’s Takeda says it is considering making a takeover approach to the company. Takeda has until 5pm on 25 April to decide whether to make a firm bid or walk away. The Easter break couldn’t have come at a worse time for stock markets, says David Morrison, senior market strategist at GKFX: Investors were already on edge having been shocked by February’s equity sell-off triggered by the dual spike in volatility and bond yields. Despite a strong rebound, the major stock indices remain fragile with many in danger of breaking back below some major technical levels – in particular, the lower level of the S&amp;P’s bullish trendline advance since February 2016. This has been brought sharply into focus with the sell-off in tech stocks, which have lead the market rally for so long, catalysed by the scandal surrounding Facebook’s cavalier attitude to its users’ data. Now we have a long holiday weekend which coincides with the close of the first quarter. Once again, bonds are in focus – particularly the US 10-year Treasury. But this time yields have slumped with the 10-year crashing back below the key 2.80% level which has held as support for the past six weeks. Investors are piling back into the perceived “safe haven” of fixed income as stock markets slide... And this comes against a backdrop of tighter monetary policy from the Federal Reserve, concerns over the outbreak of trade wars and worries about changes in key White House personnel leading to a more hawkish foreign policy. All-in-all, investors will see plenty of reasons to reduce equity exposure as we head into the weekend. Markets could be in for a run of volatility similar to the summer of 2015, says Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG: Markets remain under pressure as the sell-off in tech spreads once more to the wider equities space. The bounce on Tuesday looks like a flash in the pan, with more and more investors heading to the exit. It is looking increasingly likely that we have a re-run of August 2015 on our hands; equities then had months of volatility to contend with before the rally resumed. With trade wars and the tech scandal weighing on sentiment we may well have more downside to content with... The rout in global growth stocks has been seen in the falls in mining and bank names in London. Particularly hard hit among the banks are the Asia-focussed giants HSBC and Standard Chartered, while miners have seen further outflows as investors downgrade their optimistic views on global economic expansion. Oil prices are on the slide after a surprise rise in US stockpiles. Brent crude is currently down 0.6% at $69.68 a barrel while West Texas Intermediate - the US benchmark - is 1% lower at $64.6. The American Petroleum Institute said late on Tuesday that US weekly crude stocks had risen unexpectedly by 5.3m barrels to 430.6m barrels. Here’s an interesting chart on market bubbles: The eurozone is seeing steady economic growth, thanks to a revival in world trade, according to S&amp;P Global Ratings. In a new report, the agency says: Global momentum has lifted the eurozone’s economic prospects, and it now appears to have reached cruising altitude. The economic and monetary union closed 2017 on a high note, with GDP growth at 2.5%, its fastest pace in a decade. ...S&amp;P Global Ratings’ economists say the chief reason for this is the revival of world trade, which has put the eurozone’s industries back in motion. Capacity utilization was just short of its 2007 high, triggering stronger investment and boosting industry prospects for this year. However, the general fall in sentiment surveys at the start of 2018 indicates that eurozone growth is leveling off. Firms are increasingly reporting that supply constraints, rather than demand, are a drag on output. Nonetheless, for now, we expect the growth momentum will stay solid, thanks to the broad-based economic expansion and strong domestic fundamentals. It added: Strong fundamentals in the eurozone suggest that economic expansion will continue at a brisk pace, and we have raised our GDP growth forecasts for the region to 2.3% this year and 1.9% in 2019. We’ve also raised our euro-dollar exchange rate forecast to $1.27 in 2018 and $1.3 in 2019, since we expect the dollar’s weakness will persist. The current growth cycle appears to have peaked, but the remaining slack in the labor market and productivity rebound will keep inflationary pressures in check until the end of 2019. Because inflation will likely remain subdued this year, we expect the ECB will only gradually wind down its asset purchase program from September until the end of this year. As the gap between structural and real unemployment diminishes, earnings growth will accelerate. Thus, we think underlying inflation is set to move closer to the ECB’s target at the end of 2019, giving the ECB enough leeway to raise rates in Q3 2019. Meanwhile the pound is edging higher, up 0.16% against the dollar at $1.4177 and 0.21% better against the euro at €1.1430. Lee Hardman, currency analyst at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi, said: The ongoing reduction in Brexit risks and more hawkish outlook for Bank of England policy are the key drivers behind the pound’s upward momentum. The pound has derived some additional support from a report that Irish officials have been told to expect new plans “imminently” on how Britain plans to avoid a hard border with Northern Ireland. While short on details, the report has further boosted confidence that the UK and EU can find a workable and timely solution to the Irish border issue to support plans for a “smooth &amp; orderly Brexit”. Nevertheless, it still remains a potential banana skin for the pound in the coming months if intensified Brexit talks do not progress as well as hoped. Among the day’s company news, furniture group DFS has bucked the gloom in the high street with an upbeat outlook. It reported a 7.4% fall in underlying half year profits to £30m, in line with expectations, and chief executive Ian Filby said: We have seen a strengthening trading performance across the first half of the financial year and through February into March. We therefore remain confident that, despite the current challenging market conditions, the group will deliver modest growth in [earnings] and generate strong cashflow across this financial year, in line with our expectations. Analysts at Stifel issued a buy note, saying: Management is striking a confident tone today (despite a challenging market), as the group heads into an easier comparison phase....The shares were pricing in bad news, so we’d expect to see a decent relief rally today. Indeed the shares are up nearly 6% in early trading. Stifel added We still believe in the long-term attractions of DFS Furniture. It is a highly cash generative market leader, which is consolidating the physical market at the same time as some online pure players re-evaluate their business models. More on the tech fallout, which saw the US FANG stocks have their worst day for more than two years. Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at Think Markets, said: The tech sector is predominantly getting battered, mainly due to the woes of Facebook’s data breach. We clearly have three kind of investors when it comes to the Facebook; firstly there are some who are jumping out of the ship, pushing the stock price lower. Secondly, we have investors who are watching the show from the sideline and thinking there is more pain to come as we do not know how big the potential fine could be. This is not helping the stock price either. Finally, we have those who are not interested in Facebook anymore as they think that the regulatory burdensome on Facebook is too risky for their appetite and they do not want to get involved in this stock. We personally think, that Facebook has strong fundamentals and it has become the part of everyone’s daily life, so once we have a clear idea about the potential sum which the firm would have to pay as a result of this situation, the stock price could present a potential opportunity. As for the FANG stock including Microsoft, Twitter, it is likely that the Facebook incident would open the door for more scrutiny for other firms, and lawmakers would see how other firms are using user data. This could really open the can of worms and open a potential opportunity for short sellers. Following the falls on Wall Street and in Asia, European markets have indeed dropped back in early trading. The FTSE 100 is down 0.7%, with software group Sage slipping 1.8% and mining shares also among the leading fallers. France’s Cac and Spain’s Ibex have fallen 0.9% while Italy’s FTSE MIB is 0.88% lower. In Germany, the Dax has dropped 0.77%. In the wake of the decline of the US technology stocks, Europe’s tech index is down 1.1%. Here are IG’s opening calls for European markets: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. An early rally on Wall Street went south by the close of play yesterday, and the turnaround is likely to weigh on European markets at today’s open. Relief that the US and China appeared to be talking about averting a damaging trade war between the world’s two biggest economies had given some support to markets. But a tech turnaround saw the Dow Jones Industrial Average drop 1.4% while the Nasdaq Composite dropped 2.93% and the S&amp;P 500 fell 1.73%. The so-called FANG technology stocks - Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, and Google (now Alphabet) were under pressure on fears of growing regulation in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica revelations. Tesla was also a big faller, down more than 8% on news of a Federal investigation into a fatal crash in California. The drop in the US filtered through to Asia, with the NIkkei 225 down 1.4% and the Hang Seng 1.57% lower. In Europe the FTSE 100 is forecast to open down around 50 points, back below 7000, while Germany’s Dax could drop 120 points after European markets ended higher on Tuesday. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets, said: For all the gains seen in US markets over the past 18 months the bulk of these have been driven by tech stocks, and yesterday these tech stocks swooned quite sharply, reversing a good proportion of Monday’s gains, in the process dragging the S&amp;P500 back down towards its 200 day moving average. This rolling over in tech stocks looks set to weigh on European markets this morning, with a lower open as markets mull over the potential for uncertainty over a tech sector that could catch a cold as a result of Facebook’s woes around user data. With the increasing focus on what is going with respect to how Facebook has managed its users personal data, it must surely be only a matter of time before attention turns to the rest of the tech sector, and how companies like Alphabet, Twitter, Microsoft and Apple to name a few, manage their own users personal data. If lawmakers do turn their attention to the rest of the sector, which seems likely, then it is hard not to see how other tech companies will escape scrutiny on how they use this user data, raising the prospect that we could uncover other practices that invite scrutiny. In the run-up to the Easter break there is a smattering of economic news in the form of the CBI’s monthly snapshot of the retail sector and the latest US GDP figures. The US economy is expected to have grown by 2.7% in the fourth quarter on an annualised basis, up from 2.5%. Jasper Lawler at London Capital Group said: The economic backdrop was supportive in the last quarter of 2017. Robust jobs growth and healthy consumer spending comfortably propped up the economy, which is expected to be reflected in an upwards revision for economic growth to 2.7% on an annualised basis from 2.5% in the previous estimate. The reading will not yet include the benefits from the tax cuts, nor the more recent uncertainties over global trade. However, given how quiet the economic calendar is, the reading is expected to attract attention anyway. A surprise to the upside, could boost the possibility of a June rate hike up from the CME FedWatch odds of 78%, lifting the dollar back towards 90.00. On the contrary, should growth remain around 2.5%, we could see buying demand for the dollar decline and the greenback look to test 89.00 once more.

Its breakfast burritos ($5.95) and locally baked pastries make solid morning snacks, while lunchtime favourites includean “ultimate” club sandwich ($11.95) with roast chicken, bacon and avocado, plus salads and soups.

Head for main drag Chestnut Street, a couple of blocks back from the bay, and look out for a big faux-barn-door facade.

The produce is from Oak Hill, a small organic farm in nearby Sonoma County. • 2105 Chestnut Street, bluebarngourmet.com Lombard Street Za Pizza Some say “you can’t get a good slice” in San Francisco. Sure, it’s no New York but spots such as Za’s might change your mind. Five minutes from “the world’s crookedest street” is Hyde Street, a tree-lined slice of old San Francisco. Za’s is pleasingly cosy, with a few tables and a slim bar where you can grab an Anchor Steam ale and watch the chefs as they stretch and dress specialities like the Potesto (roasted red potatoes and homemade pesto) or the Vincent Van Dough – a simple mix of tomato, fresh basil and garlic. A medium pizza is $26.50 and a large $32, but large means large: easily sharable for four. There’s also a slice-to-go menu ($6 each) that changes daily and includes a meat and a veggie option. • 1919 Hyde Street, zapizzasf.com City Lights bookshop Yan’s Kitchen After visiting the birthplace of the Beats, head next door to Jack Kerouac’s old watering hole, Cafe Vesuvio, and knock back a quick martini. For a meal, nearby Chinatown is full of delicious spots, and Yan’s Kitchen is the kind that makes you feel instantly at home. Check tablecloths and lace curtains give the place a diner feel, while the menu is rich with Chinese-American comfort dishes such as General Tso’s chicken, egg-fried rice, and Mongolian beef (dishes around $8.75 each). Be sure to start with a round of potstickers ($5), whose ratio of crunchy shell to hot oily pork centre is worth its own poem. • 57 Columbus Avenue, on Facebook SFMOMA Ferry Building Marketplace and Ferry Plaza Farmer’s Market Our architecture critic may have called it a giant meringue but museums like SFMOMA are a great place to work up an appetite. The best spot for lunch is the nearby San Francisco Ferry Building, a glorious indoor market of cafes, restaurants and bars. On Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays, a pop-up farmer’s market takes over the space. Top choices include RoliRoti, which serves succulent rotisserie chicken and porchetta sandwiches ($8.50) and Hog Island Oyster Co, which in the summer shucks fresh oysters (from $3) from the nearby Tomales Bay that are perfect with a squeeze of lemon. • One Ferry Building, ferrybuildingmarketplace.com Mission District Panchita’s Restaurant No 2 There are plenty of reasons to come to the Mission – the sunny Dolores Park, the colorful street murals – but the best is to eat; this is, after all, the birthplace of the “mission style” burrito. Panchita’s #2, a Salvadoran pupuseria with communal wooden tables, sums up the area’s warm vibe. Pupusas are thick corn cakes with a savoury filling, fried on a hot griddle. Take your pick of chicken, pork, bean, courgette, mushroom and more, which all come with a side of curtido, a tangy cabbage and carrot slaw. At $4 each (or two for $7), one makes a filling snack while two make a great cheap meal. • 3091 16th Street, panchitas-restaurant-no-2-san-francisco.sites.tablehero.com The Castro Philz Coffee This historic LGBT neighbourhood is a great place to wander while clutching a cup of coffee from Philz, one of the city’s best-loved local chains and a pioneer of artisanal (some might say fussy) brews. Founder Phil Jaber opened his first shop 25 years ago and his obsessive care is in every cup. Your own personal barista will talk you through a menu of more than 20 custom varieties. My favourite is the fragrant Philharmonic, with fresh mint. • 549 Castro Street, philzcoffee.com Haight-Ashbury Padrecito Haight Street, like the hippies who made it famous, isn’t known for great food. But stray just a few blocks off the main drag and you’ll find the outstanding Padrecito, one of my favourite brunch spots. Lazy Sunday afternoons here usually consist of chilaquiles ($16; fluffy scrambled eggs laced with tortilla strips) and sopes de machaca ($17; slow-braised beef on crispy corn cakes with baked eggs), a dish so hearty it’s almost wrong to call it breakfast. All of that is washed down with a few spicy chipotle “bloody marias” ($11). This brunch will keep you going long into the evening. • 901 Cole Street, padrecitosf.com The Painted Ladies and Alamo Square Souvla The colourful Victorian houses, made famous by TV’s Full House, are in the heart of NoPa (North of the Panhandle), an area often overlooked by visitors. A delicious recent addition is Souvla, a Greek cafeteria that reveres the spit-roast. Pick your main (lamb, chicken, pork or sweet potato) and your vehicle (wrap, $12-14, or salad, $13-$15), then grab some sides (fries with lemon and olive oil are $5) and a seat in the backyard patio. Ingredients such as pickled onions, feta, and fennel keep the salads bright, while the wrap bread is pillowy. The frozen greek yogurt ($5) is divine: get it topped with baklava and honey. • 531 Divisadero Street, souvla.com Ocean Beach and Land’s End Louis’ Restaurant The 19th-century Cliff House, perched precariously above Ocean Beach, is the city’s most famous ocean-view restaurant, with a pricey menu to match. If you’d rather skip the $20 omelettes then head up the hill to Louis’ Restaurant. This place has been run by the same family since 1937 and the menu is full of diner-style meals: egg dishes start from $9.25; the burgers ($11.25) are good and so is the clam chowder ($6.50 a cup). And here’s the thing about Louis’: you get the same million-dollar view in a far better setting, relaxing in window booths that overlook the Pacific. If you ask the lovely staff, they’ll lend you a pair of binoculars for whale watching. • 902 Point Lobos Avenue, louissf.com Looking for a holiday with a difference?

With limited preparation time, the Socceroos were disjointed and listless in a 4-1 drubbing at the hands of a lower-ranked opponent. The Dutchman got several of his selections wrong and Australia appeared a side unsure of what to do against a predictable, old-fashioned side content to lump the ball long. Normally predictable and dependable players made simple mistakes and looked all at sea. It was arguably the national team’s worst defeat for some time. Fears mounted about what the 65-year-old from Deventer, famed for his pragmatism and do-whatever-it-takes-to-get-the-job-done mentality, would do to Ange Postecoglou’s all-attacking, full-pressing team. Would the Socceroos just park the bus and hope for the best in Russia, instead of the bold and spirited display we saw in Brazil? Was a World Cup whitewash on the cards? Many of those concerns, some clearly over the top, have been allayed and daggers sheathed after a battling 0-0 draw with Colombia in London. Facing a team ranked 13th in the world – one that reached the last eight of the 2014 World Cup, boasts players on the books of Bayern Munich, Arsenal, Milan, Barcelona, Tottenham and Sampdoria, and beat France 3-2 in Paris only four days ago – there were worries the Socceroos could be well and truly blown off the park at Craven Cottage. But Van Marwijk’s team stood up to Los Cafeteros in a see-sawing 90 minutes in south-west London. While certainly they rode their luck at times, and had a left post and a dynamic Danny Vukovic dive to thank for keeping Miguel Borja at bay, this was a Socceroos performance of considerable merit. Not only did the Australians look composed and confident in their new 4-2-3-1 formation, but their speed of play and passing was light years ahead of that seen in their ordinary Oslo outing. Even the lack of Aaron Mooy, arguably Australia’s form player with Huddersfield Town, didn’t derail them. The back four was compact and unforgiving, while Massimo Luongo was a revelation in Mooy’s spot. The QPR midfielder had a hand in everything and showed why he deserves a regular place in Van Marwijk’s starting XI. The return of Tomi Juric to lead the frontline added some experience and allowed Andrew Nabbout to move back to his familiar position on the wing. Having Tom Rogic in the No 10 role, instead of makeshift playmaker Jackson Irvine, meant the Socceroos held the ball better and created more opportunities in the final third. In Norway they barely mustered a shot on goal, but against Colombia chances fell to Juric, Nabbout, Luongo and Matthew Leckie. Aziz Behich was a handful for them to contain and Josh Ridson put in a good sift. Even though the South Americans dominated possession, enjoying 62.6% of the ball, and Borja and James Rodríguez left their finishing boots at home, there was renewed steel and intensity from the Socceroos. The jump of in class of Colombia, along with a raucous atmosphere more like a World Cup game than the stale environment in Norway’s Ullevaal Stadion, rubbed off on Australia. They lifted and performed accordingly. Those rose to the challenge and showed why, on their day, they can challenge some of the best teams in the world. More time on the training park, and more time for Van Marwijk to get his messages across, led to a more professional, eye-catching display. A month-long camp in Turkey, combined with two more friendlies against European nations, is still to come and can only be beneficial, along with the return of Trent Sainsbury. The Socceroos are not the finished article yet and have a way to go. But doom and gloom about the upcoming World Cup campaign is unfounded. With more time with his players Van Marwijk can get his vision fit and firing on all cylinders. It may not be the evangelic and idealised outfit of Postecoglou, but it will be one that Australia can still be proud of. And maybe one that can match the famed feats of the Golden Generation and get out of the group stage. The former Netherlands coach has already given four debuts in two matches, installed a new tactical system and refreshed the Socceroos training camp. Players have spoken about the fun and relaxed atmosphere that exists already under him, compared with the tense and strained mood of the Postecoglou era. Postecoglou liked to remain distant from his players and keep them on their toes in a bid to create an edgy environment. But Van Marwijk is all about keeping his cattle content and comfortable. The early signs are that this different approach, this changing of the guard, can actually bear fruit. If the Socceroos can do it against Colombia, then matching France, Denmark and Peru in three month’s time is not beyond their grasp."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/mar/28/russias-ambassador-denies-kremlin-placed-spies-in-australia","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-28T03:51:39Z","webTitle":"Russia's ambassador denies Kremlin has spies in Australia","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/mar/28/russias-ambassador-denies-kremlin-placed-spies-in-australia","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/mar/28/russias-ambassador-denies-kremlin-placed-spies-in-australia","fields":{"headline":"Russia's ambassador denies Kremlin has spies in Australia","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Russia’s ambassador to Australia has categorically denied the Kremlin has placed spies in its Australian embassies, six days before two of its diplomats will be ejected at the order of the prime minister. Australia’s foreign affairs minister, Julie Bishop, met with the ambassador, Grigory Logvinov, on Wednesday to condemn Russia for its alleged chemical weapons attack on UK soil that left a former spy and his daughter in a critical condition. Earlier in the day, in a long and at times rambling press conference that touched on Russian casualties during the first and second world wars, ongoing issues with Nato, and Le Carré-esque hints of Australian intelligence agents interfering with Russian embassy staff, Logvinov said it was laughable to suggest that Russian spies were operating in Australia. Speaking from Russia’s embassy in Canberra, he said if he agreed the diplomats being expelled from Australia were spies, it “admits that all other Russian embassies are half-spy embassies”. “Embassies are consisting of diplomats,” Logvinov said. “Some embassies, well, our embassy here, is quite small. It’s average, actually. We have embassies that are bigger in the US – well, [the US embassy] was big, now it is much smaller.” That was a reference to US president Donald Trump’s decision this week to expel 60 Russia officials who Washington said were spies, including a dozen based at the United Nations. Logvinov would not say what the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, thought of the Turnbull government’s decision to expel two officials, nor if it would lead to a permanent breach between the countries. But he condemned Australia for participating in a “well-orchestrated campaign” to discredit Russia, saying the coordinated move by more than 20 countries to expel more than 150 Russian officials was based on little evidence from Britain, and only served the US’s campaign to discredit Russia. “All of these anti-Russian campaigns we’d consider as very rude, very primitive and incompetent provocations,” he said. “It’s quite clear, the campaign about so-called Russian interference into domestic politics in the US … [has] turned out to be nothing. “It’s up to the west to finally stop and understand that anti-Russian campaigns have no future.” Malcolm Turnbull said this week that Russia’s alleged use of a chemical weapon to try to murder a former Russian intelligence official, Sergei Skripal, and his daughter, Yulia, in Salisbury on 4 March reflected a pattern of “aggression” by the Russian government that had to be stopped. “It reflects a pattern of recklessness and aggression by the Russian government, including the annexation of Crimea, the invasion of eastern Ukraine, the downing of MH17, cyber attacks and efforts to manipulate western nations’ elections,” he said in the prime minister’s courtyard in Parliament House. “There are credible reports that Russia was actively undermining the credibility of the Brexit referendum, last year’s presidential elections in France, and Catalonia’s referendum in Spain, and in the United States, one of the oldest and formidable democracies in the world, debate is raging about whether Russian intelligence operations may have tipped the presidential election.” But Logvinov questioned many of those charges on Wednesday, and cast doubt on the US and British version of those issues. He said British authorities were refusing to release evidence of Skripal’s poisoning, and he questioned why Russia would want to murder its own citizens. “Now this Skripal case, who has seen this Skripal after the alleged poisoning?” he asked. “Who has seen any real medical reports … [showing] some alleged nerve agent?” On Wednesday afternoon Logvinov attended a meeting with Bishop in which she dressed him down, explaining Australia had expelled “two diplomats we believe are undisclosed intelligence operatives” because it shared the “outrage that a chemical nerve agent would be deployed in any circumstances”. Bishop demanded a “credible explanation” about how the Russian military-grade nerve agent could have been deployed. Logvinov agreed it was a “very serious incident” and claimed Russia wanted a “proper investigation” under the auspices of the chemical weapons convention."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/apr/03/revealed-facebook-hate-speech-exploded-in-myanmar-during-rohingya-crisis","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-03T00:06:57Z","webTitle":"Revealed: Facebook hate speech exploded in Myanmar during Rohingya crisis","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/03/revealed-facebook-hate-speech-exploded-in-myanmar-during-rohingya-crisis","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/apr/03/revealed-facebook-hate-speech-exploded-in-myanmar-during-rohingya-crisis","fields":{"headline":"Revealed: Facebook hate speech exploded in Myanmar during Rohingya crisis","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Hate speech exploded on Facebook at the start of the Rohingya crisis in Myanmar last year, analysis has revealed, with experts blaming the social network for creating “chaos” in the country. Evidence of the spike emerged after the platform was accused of playing a key role in the spread of hate speech in Myanmar at a time when 650,000 Rohingya refugees were forced to flee to Bangladesh following persecution. Digital researcher and analyst Raymond Serrato examined about 15,000 Facebook posts from supporters of the hardline nationalist Ma Ba Tha group. The earliest posts dated from June 2016 and spiked on 24 and 25 August 2017, when ARSA Rohingya militants attacked government forces, prompting the security forces to launch the “clearance operation” that sent hundreds of thousands of Rohingya pouring over the border. Serrato’s analysis showed that activity within the anti-Rohingya group, which has 55,000 members, exploded with posts registering a 200% increase in interactions. “Facebook definitely helped certain elements of society to determine the narrative of the conflict in Myanmar,” Serrato told the Guardian. “Although Facebook had been used in the past to spread hate speech and misinformation, it took on greater potency after the attacks.” The revelations come to light as Facebook is struggling to respond to criticism over the leaking of users’ private data and concern about the spread of fake news and hate speech on the platform. Alan Davis, an analyst from the Institute for War and Peace Reporting who led a two-year study of hate speech in Myanmar, said that in the months before August he noticed posts on Facebook becoming “more organised and odious, and more militarised”. His research team encountered fabricated stories stating that “mosques in Yangon are stockpiling weapons in an attempt to blow up various Buddhist pagodas and Shwedagon pagoda”, the most sacred Buddhist site in Yangon in a smear campaign against Muslims. These pages also featured posts calling Rohingya the derogatory term “kalars” and “Bengali terrorists”. Signs denoting “Muslim-free” areas were shared more than 11,000 times. When the monitors working with Davis called officials about the signs, they were told the officials knew nothing about them. When he tried to fund a team of local journalists to investigate and report on them, the journalists all declined for reasons of safety. Davis said this was the defining moment. “People just thought ‘oh well, we can just keep on doing what we do.’” Facebook the only source of information Among Myanmar’s 53 million residents, less than 1% had internet access in 2014. But by 2016, the country appeared to have more Facebook users than any other south Asian country. Today, more than 14 million of its citizens use Facebook. A 2016 report by GSMA, the global body representing mobile operators, found that in Myanmar many people considered Facebook the only internet entry point for information, and that many regarded postings as news. One cyber security analyst in Yangon, who asked to remain anonymous for fear of online attacks, said: “Facebook is arguably the only source of information online for the majority in Myanmar.” In early March, UN Myanmar investigator Yanghee Lee warned that “Facebook has become a beast.” “It was used to convey public messages but we know that the ultra-nationalist Buddhists have their own Facebooks and are really inciting a lot of violence and a lot of hatred against the Rohingya or other ethnic minorities,” she said. Myanmar has agreed to a visit by the UN security council after months of resistance, but it remains unclear whether ambassadors will be allowed to go to Rakhine state, the body’s president said Monday. A Facebook spokeswoman said the company was ramping up efforts to remove hate content and people who repeatedly violate the company’s hate-speech policies. “We take this incredibly seriously and have worked with experts in Myanmar for several years to develop safety resources and counter-speech campaigns,” she said. “We now have around 14,000 people working across community ops, online ops and our integrity efforts globally – almost double where we were a year ago – and will have more than 20,000 by the end of this year.” On Monday, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg told Vox that the spread of hate speech on the platform in Myanmar was “a real issue”. Serrato called on Facebook to be more open with its data. “Right now, we have no way of knowing which people like or share certain posts so we cannot track how disinformation or hate speech spreads on the platform.” But Davis said the damage was done. “I think things are so far gone in Myanmar right now ... I really don’t know how Zuckerberg and co sleep at night. If they had any kind of conscience they would be pouring a good percentage of their fortunes into reversing the chaos they have created.” Facebook has been accused of fomenting violence elsewhere in the region. In March the Sri Lankan district of Kandy was the site of mass riots and arson by Buddhist nationalist fanatics. The Sri Lankan minister for telecommunication, Harin Fernando, told the Guardian the government ordered Facebook and other social media services to be shut down at the height of the violence. “This whole country could have been burning in hours,” Fernando told the Guardian. An analysis of 63,842 Facebook posts by Yudhanjaya Wijeratne, an author and data researcher, concluded the social media ban took fewer than half the country’s Facebook users offline, many likely turning to a VPN to access the service."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/mar/27/gareth-southgate-questions-penalty-decision-for-italy","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-27T22:53:23Z","webTitle":"Gareth Southgate: Italy’s penalty was not ‘clear and obvious’ for VAR","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/mar/27/gareth-southgate-questions-penalty-decision-for-italy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/mar/27/gareth-southgate-questions-penalty-decision-for-italy","fields":{"headline":"Gareth Southgate: Italy’s penalty was not ‘clear and obvious’ for VAR","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Gareth Southgate has expressed doubts over whether James Tarkowski’s challenge on Federico Chiesa should have been referred to the video assistant referee after Italy were belatedly awarded a penalty to clinch a draw three minutes from time. The German referee, Deniz Aytekin, considered his decision after viewing a rerun of the incident on a screen on the halfway line and awarded the spot‑kick much to England’s frustration. Lorenzo Insigne duly converted, the first goal Southgate’s team have conceded in six matches. “We have to accept the ruling but I don’t think it was a clear and obvious error,” the England manager said. “It’s one you can debate all day. “It looks like James stands on him but it’s during the running process and he’s going down anyway. The referee had a good view already. I don’t think with incidents like that VAR will clear things up. An obvious handball and stuff like that then maybe ... I prefer referee’s decision is final. That’s my starting point. It’s sport. We shouldn’t be talking about how much money is lost. It’s based on sport. “But if we go with technology then VAR is the right thing to do but it must be clear and obvious – otherwise it’s just opinion again – and there must be a better way of communicating with the fans. There’s a clearer communication with those in the stadium in other sports. I suppose if we’d had it in Holland the other night we might have had a penalty and a red card after two minutes. I don’t know whether it’ll be ready at the World Cup. But if it’s for straightforward decisions, then it’s OK. Other countries are further ahead in the experiment than we are. But the rules are the rules. I’m just glad it’s not the World Cup just yet.” Southgate was more encouraged by his team’s performance which, until rhythm was disrupted amid a flurry of substitutions, saw England dominate the Italians. “In terms of the last four games, we’ve played four of the biggest football countries in the world – they’re at different levels of progression – and we’ve been competitive in every game. Our patterns of play have become far clearer. What’s really pleased me is the guys are solving problems on the pitch themselves: changes of formation from the opposition; working their way through different pressing tactics. That’s a real plus.” Dele Alli failed to feature in either England friendly, with Southgate suggesting he had struggled in training “with a little injury problem” over the 10-day get-together. “But he’s an important player for us, no question,” said the manager, who must submit his provisional squad for the World Cup by 14 May. “We wanted to get Adam Lallana on as an important part of his rehabilitation. Dele always wants to play. He’s disappointed with that, but he’s a really good player and an important member of the squad for us.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"us-news/2018/mar/29/san-diego-homelessness-big-tents","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-29T10:00:14Z","webTitle":"San Diego unveils unorthodox homelessness solution: big tents","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/mar/29/san-diego-homelessness-big-tents","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/mar/29/san-diego-homelessness-big-tents","fields":{"headline":"San Diego unveils unorthodox homelessness solution: big tents","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Bob McElroy strode through the busy entrance of the vast, gleaming-white tent, greeting people right and left. The prominent homeless services provider calls the new structure, located on the outskirts of downtown San Diego, “the Rolls-Royce of tents”. It is double-insulated and has wifi. And it is the sunny seaside destination’s millionaire-funded attempt to get a grip on an emergency that sees thousands of homeless people sleep on its streets every night. The industrial-sized tent holds 324 people in neatly spaced, numbered bunks. People can bring their pets, and 70 dogs also live in the shelter. It offers a bed and services – from healthcare to employment assistance to showers and laundry – while people wait for a place of their own. In appearance, it evokes a military installation or a refugee camp. “You come in here with nothing and they provide everything,” said Sylvia Saliman, 58. Saliman sat on her top bunk with Daisy, her American blue nose pitbull, who was napping after a long walk. Saliman said she had been homeless for 16 months and in the shelter for two. She said she’d lost everything except her dog. Thanks to the tent, “I’m doing great right now,” she said. Cities throughout the western and southern US, such as San Diego, face a dilemma: they are grappling with visible, intransigent street homelessness, and the supply of affordable housing is meager and increasing only slowly. This tent, along with two others built by the city, fills the gap – it is known as a “bridge” shelter. Officials from California cities large and small, including Los Angeles, San Francisco, Fresno and Oxnard, have come to tour the structures. The Fresno city council member Steve Brandau brought a group to San Diego in February and said a huge tent could be the solution for his city’s shortage of about 150 beds. “We like the San Diego structure,” he said, “the feel of it, the types of services provided.” It is not the first time San Diego has housed people in large tents. For nearly three decades, two such structures, one for veterans and one for adults, went up during winter months. But that program was scrapped in 2015. “In the communities where they’re solving homelessness, they’re not doing it with tents,” the then city council member Todd Gloria told the San Diego Union-Tribune. A spike in homelessness, especially downtown, and, last year, a deadly outbreak of hepatitis A that killed 20 people and had the city washing its sidewalks in bleach, forced city leaders to reconsider. Two wealthy San Diego businessmen, Dan Shea, a restaurateur, and Peter Seidler, managing partner of the San Diego Padres baseball team, told Mayor Kevin Faulconer they would put up $1.5m for new tents if the city would fund the operations for at least two years. Shea and Seidler say they represented a larger San Diego business community frustrated by a lack of action on the part of elected officials. It will take years to build the necessary housing, Shea said in an interview with KPBS radio. “Do we just leave those people on the street for five years, seven years, 10 years waiting for housing to be built?” Beds are prioritized for people with mental or physical disabilities who qualify for housing subsidies. They are also available for people who just need a few months of respite to get back on their feet. Everyone in the shelter is paired with a housing “navigator” whose job is to find appropriate housing as quickly as possible. Altogether, the three tents have almost 700 beds. “Without this, can you imagine how hard it is to find a client on the streets?” said Amy Gonyeau, chief operating officer for Alpha Project, the service provider that runs the tent for adults. “Now we know where they are – well, at least 700 of them.” The goal is for providers to move about two-thirds of shelter residents into permanent housing within four months, yet early data shows meeting this goal might prove challenging. During its first four months of operation, 44 people from the largest tent, with its capacity of more than 300, moved into permanent housing. Another 15 exited to other programs or moved in with family or friends. As elsewhere in California, “there is no permanent housing,” McElroy said about the lagging housing placements. “Folks with jobs and good credit and college educations, they can’t find places to rent … If [housing] was there, we’d be taking them out by the friggin’ busload.” Despite the delays, McElroy said, a tent is still better than a street corner. A few bunks over from Saliman was Danila Hendrix, also 58, who had been in the shelter since early January. She had been in the tent that closed in 2015, then back out on the street, where she was the victim of multiple assaults. A housing navigator is helping her find a new home. “I’m getting weary,” she said. “I just want a key to my own door.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/mar/27/tunisia-costa-rica-international-friendly-match-report","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-27T20:24:21Z","webTitle":"Wahbi Khazri gives warning to England in Tunisia victory over Costa Rica","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/mar/27/tunisia-costa-rica-international-friendly-match-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/mar/27/tunisia-costa-rica-international-friendly-match-report","fields":{"headline":"Wahbi Khazri gives warning to England in Tunisia victory over Costa Rica","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Wahbi Khazri may not have lit up Sunderland during 18 months in the north-east but he served notice of his ability to make an impact against England at the World Cup by delivering a fine performance in Tunisia’s impressive victory against Costa Rica. Khazri scored the game’s only goal and generally revelled in the central striking role that he has recently been assigned by his country’s manager, Nabil Maâloul. A midfielder for most of his career, Khazri has flourished as a lone attacker since joining Rennes on loan from Sunderland last summer. His clever movement and tidy interplay with Tunisia’s fleet of technically deft midfielders made him a constant menace. Tunisia had to earn the right to play, as this was far more heated than most warm-ups and not only because of the red flares ignited by Tunisian fans after Khazri’s goal just after the half-hour. Tempers rose on the pitch before that as the North Africans took exception to Costa Rica’s decidedly retro tackling – which may also worry Southgate given that England face Costa Rica in a friendly at Elland Road on 7 June. Khazri’s main flaw was also in evidence: he is combustible. He was lucky to avoid a red card after aiming a retaliatory kick at Kendall Waston, who collapsed clutching his knee. If there was any contact it was very slight but that was thanks to the French official who jumped between the pair like a boxing referee. He then let Khazri off with a yellow card. Moments later Khazri ran on to an exquisite pass by Dylan Bronn and flicked the ball over Waston. Keylor Navas blocked his first shot but Khazri tapped in the rebound. Tunisia deserved their lead. They were slick and inventive from the start, no doubt convincing Southgate’s spies that they will be no pushovers in Russia. Despite the absence through injury of their most ingenious player, Youssef Msakni, Tunisia played with skill and imagination, with Saîf-Eddine Khaoui and Naïm Sliti especially dangerous in advanced midfield roles. “I am very proud of the performance,” Maâloul said. “We are developing a style that we want to impose at the World Cup.” Costa Rica rarely threatened to score but did muster a few counterattacks. In the 83rd minute Mouez Hassen, on his debut, made a fine save to thwart Josué Mitchell. It was an impressive way for the goalkeeper to mark his debut for his country and make his case for solving Tunisia’s most problematic position."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"society/2018/mar/27/great-ormond-street-hospital-charity-keep-presidents-club-donations","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-27T19:30:51Z","webTitle":"Great Ormond Street to keep Presidents Club donations","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/mar/27/great-ormond-street-hospital-charity-keep-presidents-club-donations","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/mar/27/great-ormond-street-hospital-charity-keep-presidents-club-donations","fields":{"headline":"Great Ormond Street to keep Presidents Club donations","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Great Ormond Street Hospital (Gosh) has said it will keep £530,000 it collected in donations from the disgraced Presidents Club Charitable Trust. The children’s charity had said it would return the money after a Financial Times investigation exposed alleged sexual harassment by senior figures in business and politics at a men-only charity dinner hosted by the charity at the Dorchester hotel in central London. After pressure from other Gosh donors, the charity’s board of trustees decided at a meeting on Tuesday to keep the money they had received between 2009 and 2016. The annual Presidents Club said it would close in January after an undercover reporter employed as one of the 130 hostesses at the event revealed allegations of repeated groping, diners asking female staff to join them in their bedrooms at the hotel, and some men putting their hands up skirts. After the exposé, a Gosh spokesperson said: “We are shocked to hear of the behaviour reported at the Presidents Club charitable trust fundraising dinner. “We would never knowingly accept donations raised in this way. We have had no involvement in the organisation of this event, nor did we attend and we were never due to receive any money from it.” A number of other charities, including Evelina children’s hospital and Clatterbridge cancer charity, also said they would return thousands to the Presidents Club. But on Tuesday, Gosh reversed its decision. A spokesperson for Great Ormond Street Hospital Children’s Charity said: “Our thinking is always guided by our aim to maximise the support we give to the hospital and the families it cares for. “Following feedback from our supporters, guidance from the Charity Commission and taking into account the impending closure of the Presidents Club Charitable Trust, the trustees have decided to retain the funds donated by the trust. “We would like to thank all of our donors for their support, it is only through their generosity that we can make a difference for seriously ill children cared for at the hospital.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2018/apr/02/labours-julie-morgan-we-have-long-way-to-go-on-gender-equality","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-02T13:27:39Z","webTitle":"Labour's Julie Morgan: 'We have long way to go on gender equality'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/apr/02/labours-julie-morgan-we-have-long-way-to-go-on-gender-equality","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/apr/02/labours-julie-morgan-we-have-long-way-to-go-on-gender-equality","fields":{"headline":"Labour's Julie Morgan: 'We have long way to go on gender equality'","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"A prominent Labour politician has expressed her “terrible disappointment” at the dearth of female leaders in the party and said an expectation still lingered that men would get the top jobs. Julie Morgan, who is campaigning for the new post of deputy Labour leader in Wales, argued that better, fairer decisions and more effective laws were made if more women were in senior positions. Morgan is standing against the Swansea East MP Carolyn Harris for the post of second-in-command, after the Labour party in Wales ruled that either the leader or deputy in Wales must be a woman. Morgan, whose late husband, Rhodri, was the charismatic Labour leader and first minister of Wales in 2000-09, said: “It’s very important to make sure we have a woman in the top two in Wales. With Jeremy Corbyn, Carwyn Jones [Morgan’s successor as Welsh leader] and the Scottish leader [Richard Leonard] all male, it seemed very important that we have a system to ensure at least one leader or deputy is a woman.” Asked what she thought of the lack of women in top jobs in the party, Morgan said: “It’s a terrible disappointment.” Labour does have more female MPs and assembly members than other parties. But Morgan, the assembly member for Cardiff North, said: “There is still this expectation among politicians and members to some extent that a politician is a man. We’ve had to work very hard to shift this idea.” Over the years the party has tried to make this shift, including by introducing all-women shortlists and a twinning system under which two adjacent constituency Labour parties picked a man and a woman to stand in assembly elections. The measures had some success and in 2003 equal numbers of men and women were elected to the assembly. But now there are 34 men and 26 women. “Any time there has been a pause and we haven’t used those mechanisms, it’s reverted back to men getting the posts,” said Morgan. “We still have a long way to go on gender equality. “As a party we want to improve people’s lives. To make laws as effective as possible you must have representative groups making the decisions. If it is too male-dominated you won’t get such good laws.” Morgan said Welsh Labour, which has been in government since the first assembly election in 1999, remained one of the most successful brands in the British Labour party. But the death of Carl Sargeant, who apparently took his own life after being sacked as a minister amid allegations of inappropriate behaviour, has put pressure on the first minister and the party. Morgan knew Sargeant well and worked closely with him. “We are still heartbroken and still trying to recover from the shock of it,” she said. “It has caused a lot of upset and anxiety. There are inquiries ongoing. We have to wait and see how they turn out. “We may need to look at the systems we have in place to make sure people do feel able to come forward with complaints but there also needs to be support for those who are complained about.” There have been allegations from within Welsh Labour about how Sargeant was treated in Cardiff and wider concerns about bullying. Morgan said she believed the new deputy leader could act as a bridge between Cardiff and the rest of the party. Morgan, who was the MP for Cardiff North for 13 years, said she felt she had a “political link” with Corbyn. She said: “I’ve been in a lot of the same lobbies as Jeremy. I voted against the Iraq war, student top-up fees, Trident.” Ironically, Morgan is facing the same electoral college system that twice thwarted her late husband’s bid for the leadership before he eventually became first minister. Under the system, more weight is given to the votes of MPs, assembly members, unions and other bodies than to those of ordinary members. Morgan has campaigned for a one member, one vote system for decades. “The electoral college system isn’t democratic or transparent. It’s come up at every hustings,” she said. The winner of the deputy leadership contest will be announced at the Welsh Labour conference this month. If she wins, Morgan plans to pitch her red gazebo – a familiar sight in Cardiff North during campaigns and leafleting operations – at sites around Wales. “One of the issues that has come up is that different parts, such as Ynys Môn – Anglesey – sometimes feel out on a limb, that things are too Cardiff-centric,” she said. “I’m very keen that the Labour party should be the party for the whole of Wales.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2018/mar/28/uber-arizona-secret-self-driving-program-governor-doug-ducey","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-28T18:36:59Z","webTitle":"Exclusive: Arizona governor and Uber kept self-driving program secret, emails reveal","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/mar/28/uber-arizona-secret-self-driving-program-governor-doug-ducey","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2018/mar/28/uber-arizona-secret-self-driving-program-governor-doug-ducey","fields":{"headline":"Exclusive: Arizona governor and Uber kept self-driving program secret, emails reveal","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Arizona’s Republican governor repeatedly encouraged Uber’s controversial experiment with autonomous cars in the state, enabling a secret testing program for self-driving vehicles with limited oversight from experts, according to hundreds of emails obtained by the Guardian. The previously unseen emails between Uber and the office of governor Doug Ducey reveal how Uber began quietly testing self-driving cars in Phoenix in August 2016 without informing the public. On Monday, eight days after one of Uber’s self-driving vehicles killed a pedestrian in a Phoenix suburb, Ducey suspended the company’s right to operate autonomous cars on public roads in Arizona. It was a major about-face for the governor, who has spent years embracing the Silicon Valley startup. Uber’s behind-the-scenes efforts to court Ducey, and the governor’s apparent willingness to satisfy the company, is made clear in the emails, which were sent between 2015 and 2007 and obtained by the Guardian through public records requests. They reveal how Uber offered workspace for Ducey’s staff in San Francisco, praised the governor lavishly, and promised to bring money and jobs to his state. Ducey, meanwhile, helped Uber deal with other officials in Arizona, issued decrees that were friendly to the company, tweeted out an advert at the company’s request, and even seems to have been open to wearing an Uber T-shirt at an official event. There is no way to know whether tougher regulations would have prevented the death of 49-year-old Elaine Herzberg, who was struck by an Uber-owned Volvo while it was in self-driving mode on 19 March. Uber immediately suspended its self-driving vehicle testing in Arizona, Pittsburgh, San Francisco and Toronto. The first fatal crash involving a self-driving vehicle and a pedestrian in the US has sparked a national discussion about the safety of a technology, which tech companies claim will dramatically improve road safety. However the correspondence between Ducey and Uber will now throw a spotlight on the Arizona governor’s office – and raise questions about his apparently laissez-faire approach to safety. While Arizona’s neighbour California has some of the toughest self-driving regulations in America, other states, such as Michigan and Florida, are at least as permissive as Arizona, with few restrictions and little oversight of highly automated vehicles. ‘A real thought leader’ Arizona was not always a friendly state for Uber. In April 2014, then-governor Jan Brewer vetoed legislation that would have exempted taxi-hailing companies from insurance regulations imposed on traditional taxis. Uber and Lyft continued to operate in the state, however, risking fines for their drivers. In late 2014, Brewer was replaced by Ducey, a fellow Republican, and Uber almost immediately began its charm offensive. A month after being sworn in, Ducey met with David Plouffe, Barack Obama’s former campaign manager, who had been hired by Uber as a senior vice-president, and another Uber executive named Justin Kintz. The following week, Kintz wrote to Ducey: “I know [Plouffe] and [Uber founder] Travis [Kalanick] are as excited as I am to expand our footprint in Arizona, and we are encouraged that the state legislature is interested in codifying a permanent regulatory structure for ridesharing.” One of Ducey’s first acts as governor was to instruct officials not to pursue ride-share drivers over taxi licensing rules. Uber seemed to have secured a political ally in Ducey who signed a bill legalizing ride-sharing at a high-profile ceremony in April 2015, flanked by Uber and Lyft drivers and executives. In the run-up to the ceremony, Uber staff wrote to Ducey’s office with some questions. “Is the governor still interested in wearing an Uber shirt at the event? We’re looking into polo shirts, and it would be great to get his size,” wrote one. “Can we swap out the order and have the Uber driver [introduce the governor]?” wrote another. “I think this makes more sense since this is ultimately about them.” While Ducey’s team agreed to Uber’s scheduling preference, photographs from the signing show him wearing a plain blue shirt. Nevertheless, Uber was pleased with Ducey’s performance. Justin Kintz sent a gushing email to Ducey’s chief of staff calling the governor “a real thought leader on these innovation issues”. Uber also said it would send out an “all-rider, all-driver email thanking the [governor] and the state of AZ for their leadership.” In June of 2015, Uber opened a customer support centre in Phoenix that would bring 300 jobs to the city. Two months later, Ducey held a joint press conference with Uber to announce a $25,000 gift by the company to the University of Arizona’s College of Optical Sciences. Uber said that it would base a fleet of mapping cars at the university, and collaborate with academics on laser-ranging lidars. The same day, Ducey issued an executive order clearing the way for the public testing and operation of autonomous cars, so long as they had human safety drivers inside the vehicles to take over controls in the event of an emergency. Ducey’s decree also allowed fully driverless pilot programs to take place on university campuses. Uber could not have asked for a better order if it had written it itself. (Uber says now that it did, in fact, suggest some concepts for the order.) The executive order also acknowledged public concerns about the safety of self-driving vehicles. It established a self-driving vehicle oversight committee of experts to advise state agencies and propose new rules – although Uber proposed the company should be part of that group. In February 2016, Ashwini Chhabra, the head of policy development at Uber, wrote to a transportation policy adviser in Ducey’s office: “Wanted to follow up from our meeting earlier in the month, to discuss the AV oversight committee you are convening. Uber would be happy to participate in that, and I will be our representative to that effort.” In the end, Uber did not get its own seat on the oversight board mandated to police self-driving programs. But the company is likely to have been pleased by the composition of those who did: all eight of the oversight board’s members are employed by the state and serve at the pleasure of Arizona’s pro-Uber governor. Some were political appointees, others administrators. Only one of its members could be considered an expert in self-driving technologies: Larry Head, a professor of systems engineering at the University of Arizona. According to its website, the oversight committee has only met once. (Ducey’s office said the committee actually met twice.) It has called no witnesses, demanded no documents, taken no actions, and issued no recommendations. ‘We couldn’t do this without you guys’ After securing the backing of Arizona’s governor, Uber’s next objective was ensuring its drivers could pick up passengers from the state’s main airport, Sky Harbor, which falls under the jurisdiction of the Phoenix city council. In May 2016, Danny Seiden, Ducey’s deputy chief of staff, asked Craig Hulse, one of Uber’s public policy managers: “Who do you deal with in mayor’s office on airport issues?” Hulse provided names of people in the office of Phoenix’s mayor, who, like most of its city council, is a Democrat. The following month the council passed a plan that was favorable to Uber. One council member later complained that Ducey had threatened retaliation if a ride-sharing plan for the airport did not go through. “There’s been pressure placed on us by the governor,” Laura Pastor, now vice-mayor of Phoenix, told AZ Central. When the plan eventually passed, one of Uber’s first tweets was to thank Ducey. The next month, Uber launched its Eats food delivery service in Arizona. Uber’s communications manager, Taylor Patterson, alerted Ducey’s office on 11 July, requesting a gubernatorial plug. “We’d love if you could push out this tweet sometime tomorrow. ‘Welcome @ubereats to AZ! Embracing the sharing economy makes getting fresh food at the tap of a button possible.’ As always thank you so much for your support. We couldn’t do this without you guys.” The following day, Ducey duly tweeted, “Great to have @UberEats in Az! Embracing the sharing economy makes getting fresh food at the tap of a button possible.” He included a direct link to the Uber Eats website. The following month, in August 2016, Uber made a major announcement: it would soon launch driverless vehicles on the streets of Pittsburgh, enabling its customers to hail self-driving cars for first time. It seemed like a bold and perhaps risky move for a technology that many experts believed was far from being fully road tested. Chhabra, Uber’s head of policy development, told Ducey’s office that Phoenix need not feel left out. The city could be close behind: “The expansion in Pittsburgh is a step in this direction, but we’re more excited than ever to bring [our self-driving effort] to fruition in AZ.” In fact, Uber was already planning to quietly upgrade the mapping cars it had in Arizona to autonomous vehicles. On 19 August, Chhabra wrote Seiden, the governor’s deputy chief of staff, to let him know that “starting this weekend” Uber would “start testing some self-driving functionality”. It was an innocuous-seeming email that in fact announced a major precedent. “There will be safety drivers at the wheel, so won’t look much different from what’s already been on the road but wanted to flag it for you nonetheless,” Chhabra said. Remarkably, the public appears to have been kept in the dark. Because of Arizona’s regulatory vacuum, neither Uber nor Ducey were obliged to inform the public that Uber’s cars would now be driving themselves on public roads. Neither, it seems, did they believe they had an ethical duty to do so. Uber says that it did not make a public announcement because its efforts were focused on launching the Pittsburgh pilot. Uber did, however, at least suggest keeping someone in local law enforcement in the loop over that Uber’s self-driving vehicles would be on state roads. Chhabra wrote to Seiden, saying Uber wanted to give Phoenix police department “a heads up” about the secret program, and asking if he would recommend someone “discreet” to contact. Contacted by the Guardian, Ducey declined to explain why the governor’s office chose to keep the program secret. However the emails make clear the links between his office and Uber were getting closer all the time. When Seiden took a trip to San Francisco that August, Uber offered him the use of its offices. “I’m happy to host you here at Uber and set you up with a work space and any meetings, etc.” wrote a public affairs manager. ‘Arizona welcomes Uber with open arms’ In December, Uber launched its self-driving cars in San Francisco, without applying for the autonomous vehicle testing permits that California requires. It was an audacious move, and it backfired after California revoked the registration of Uber’s 16 test vehicles after several had been spotted running red lights in the city. Blocked from using the vehicles in California, Uber had a quick fix. It put the cars on a on flatbed truck and transported them across the border, to Arizona. Ducey could not have been happier. “Arizona welcomes Uber self-driving cars with open arms and wide open roads,” he wrote in a statement at the time. “While California puts the brakes on innovation and change with more bureaucracy and more regulation, Arizona is paving the way for new technology and new businesses.” Ducey did not mention that Uber had, in fact, been secretly testing its self-driving cars in the state since the summer. Ducey’s office failed to provide a substantial response to the Guardian prior to publication. However on Wednesday, his office denied that Uber’s initial autonomous car testing program – which occurred four months before the governor officially announced the arrival of self-driving cars banned from San Francisco – had occurred “in secret”. Ducey’s team did not dispute that the governor and Uber did not disclose to the public details of the company’s initial testing program. However the spokesperson argued that the governor’s executive order made clear self-driving cars would be road-tested in the state. “Arizona has been very public about the testing and operation of self-driving cars – it has been anything but a secret,” the spokesperson said, adding: “The governor’s executive order first and foremost prioritized public safety, as with all initiatives related to this technology. The order did not benefit any single company, but paved the way for testing, which had already been occurring around the country.” The self-driving vehicle oversight committee created by Ducey appeared not to have any qualms about the sudden arrival of experimental vehicles banned from San Francisco after apparently breaking traffic laws. Committee member Larry Head issued a statement that read: “People should be a little more open-minded and be excited about the opportunity. Technology is really cool.” The next month, in January 2017, Ducey delivered a state of the state speech that Uber’s Kintz called “outstanding” in an email to his staff. The governor’s address was certainly beneficial to Uber; Ducey declared that Arizona’s approach to self-driving technology would be “the opposite approach” to California, which he said had moved “backwards with more nutty ideas”, and added: “We will move forward by rolling up our sleeves and rolling back more regulations that are standing in the way of job growth.” By the time of the fatal crash earlier this month, around half of all Uber’s 200 self-driving cars were located in Arizona. The fatality has shed light on the quality of Uber’s self-driving program technology, which can be measured by the number of times human drivers are forced to take over the controls from the autonomous computer. According to the New York Times, Uber’s human drivers had to intervene far more frequently than those working for its rivals. It reported that Waymo, Google’s self-driving car spinoff, said that in tests on roads in California last year, its cars went an average of nearly 5,600 miles before the driver had to seize control of its vehicles. As of March, Uber was struggling to meet its target of 13 miles per “intervention” in Arizona, according to the Times. It is also unclear how much economic reward Arizona has reaped from its relationship with Uber in returning for opening itself up as a low-regulation testing ground for the company. Uber has retained its high-level executives and engineering know-how, for example, in San Francisco and Pittsburgh. And despite the fanfare Ducey created around Uber’s collaboration with Arizona’s College of Optical Sciences, its dean told the Guardian: “Our dialog with Uber has not led to any significant ongoing research engagement.” But Ducey still has sleeves to roll up. Two weeks before the fatal crash, he issued a new executive order explicitly allowing fully driverless vehicles on Arizona’s roads, as long as companies claim that their vehicles comply with federal safety standards. In a statement he wrote 17 days before Herzberg was killed, Ducey said: “This executive order embraces new technologies by creating an environment that supports autonomous vehicle innovation and maintains a focus on public safety.” • This article was amended on 28 March 2018 to correct the amount of time that elapsed between the fatal crash and the suspension of Uber’s self-driving program, and to include a statement from the governor’s office that was received after publication. It was further amended on 29 March 2018 to correct to an erroneous reference to Hulse emailing Seiden for names of officials in the mayor’s office. As the story now makes clear, the email requesting names was sent by Seiden to Hulse."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/mar/27/may-wants-west-to-develop-long-term-response-to-russia","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-27T18:45:54Z","webTitle":"May wants west to develop long-term response to Russia","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/27/may-wants-west-to-develop-long-term-response-to-russia","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/mar/27/may-wants-west-to-develop-long-term-response-to-russia","fields":{"headline":"May wants west to develop long-term response to Russia","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Theresa May has warned that the west needs to develop a long-term response to the renewed Russian threat as she claimed more than 25 countries had joined the unprecedented coalition taking diplomatic action against Vladimir Putin in response to the nerve agent attack in Salisbury. British officials are convinced that the Russian president is privately taken aback by the scale of the coalition that has formed against Russia, and may even in the medium term see the need to recalibrate how he handles the west. May’s warning came as more EU members, as well as Nato, joined the group of countries expelling Russian diplomats or recalling their own diplomats from Moscow. States joining the coalition of disapproval included Ireland, Belgium and Bulgaria, even if they only expelled a token single diplomat or, as in the case of Bulgaria, just recalled its own ambassador from Moscow for consultations. The Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, earlier announced that he was cutting the size of the Russian mission to Nato by a third from 30 to 20, and insisted the measures would materially affect Russian intelligence gathering. Praising the unprecedented coordination he said: “This will send a clear message to Russia that there are costs and consequences for their unacceptable pattern of behaviour.” The main EU countries that had declined to take any action are Greece and Austria, but even inside Austria there was controversy as the government asserted it was neutral between Russia and the west. The Czech president, Miloš Zeman, also sounded a note of dissent against expulsions by his government, saying he wanted trustworthy evidence to prove the UK’s allegations of Russia’s involvement in the poisoning of Russian double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter, Yulia. The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, was attacked by the far-right AfD, the biggest opposition party, over Berlin’s decision to expel four Russian diplomats. Alexander Gauland, the co-leader of the party, said: “Germany has nothing to win and much to lose if it lets itself be drawn into a new cold war by rabble-rousers and if it wilfully blocks diplomatic channels.” The foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, will argue in a speech on Wednesday that the scale of the response shows that Putin realises he is facing a new level of resolution, but to sustain it will require intensified defences against Russian hybrid warfare including cyber-attacks, energy and disinformation. Johnson also told MPs that the EU’s response was a good omen for the UK’s efforts to remain close to the trade bloc’s foreign and security policy after Brexit. Speaking to senior cabinet members in London on Tuesday, May said countries had acted against Russia not just out of solidarity but because they recognised the threat it posed. “Yesterday was a significant moment in our response to this reckless act of aggression, but there is still more to be done as we work with international partners on a long-term response to the challenge posed by Russia,” she was reported as saying by her spokesman. Later she told MPs she had seen no evidence that UK democratic processes had been successfully interfered with by Russia. As Russia prepared to mount tit-for-tat reprisals against countries that have expelled Russian diplomats, Sergei Lavrov, the Russian foreign minister, blamed the coordinated action on a US blackmail campaign, adding it revealed how few truly independent countries existed any longer in modern Europe. “When one or two diplomats are asked to leave this or that country, with apologies being whispered into our ears, we know for certain that this is a result of colossal pressure and colossal blackmail, which is Washington’s chief instrument in the international scene,” he said. A spokesman for the Russian embassy in London said: “The short-term goals are clear: to compensate for the loss of international influence by taking up the leading role in ‘containing’ Russia, and to divert public attention away from the not-so-successful Brexit talks. “The problem is that, in the longer run, we are witnessing quite a dangerous trend in western policy not only towards Russia, but the world at large.” Russian reprisals for the wave of expulsions are expected in the next few days."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/mar/27/uk-remain-high-terror-alert-two-years-whitehall-sources-say","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-27T19:07:03Z","webTitle":"UK to remain on high terror alert for at least two years, sources say","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/mar/27/uk-remain-high-terror-alert-two-years-whitehall-sources-say","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/mar/27/uk-remain-high-terror-alert-two-years-whitehall-sources-say","fields":{"headline":"UK to remain on high terror alert for at least two years, sources say","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Britain faces at least two more years of heightened terror alert, with risks from state players including Russia as well as the aftermath of the collapse of Islamic State, Whitehall sources have said. Speaking as the government launched its national securitycapability review, the sources said the risk level – currently at severe – could soon rise to critical, thanks to the possible return of scores of Isis fighters to the UK and the potential threat from states such as Russia, North Korea and Iran. Instability in north Africa, Yemen, Sudan and Syria were also said to be causes of concern. Unveiling a “fusion doctrine” for tackling national security threats, the prime minister says in the foreword of the review that every part of government and its agencies will have a part to play. “Over the past year in the UK we have witnessed appalling terrorist attacks in London and Manchester, but also a brazen and reckless act of aggression on the streets of Salisbury: attempted murder using an illegal chemical weapons, amounting to an unlawful use of force against the UK,” Theresa May says. The review was partly a response to last year’s attacks. The Salisbury poisoning came too late to be considered, although sources believe the way it has been handled justifies the approach the review sets out. But the capability review fails to meet any of the criticisms made by parliament’s joint committee on national security, published late last week. MPs and peers on the committee, including former foreign and defence secretaries of both main parties, were strongly critical of the lack of additional money. In January, the National Audit Office identified a potential £20bn shortfall in the defence budget, and the national security review was conducted on the basis that there would be no significant increase in the £56bn budget. The committee’s report warned that “financial constraints are distorting the UK’s national security”. The review also fails to answer the committee’s criticism of the decision to separate reviews of national security capability from strategic defence. The MPs warned that the separate defence review announced in January meant the review of national security capability had become an uncomfortable “halfway house” between a “quick refresh” of capabilities and a full review. The committee argued that defence and national security strategy cannot be separated. Its report said reviews should be a “joined-up process led by the Cabinet Office” and called for a detailed description of how coherence between the modernising defence programme and domestic security, cyber and modern deterrence can be ensured. The fusion doctrine is meant to embed recommendations made in the 2016 Chilcot report into the Iraq war, which called for a more accountable system to support collective cabinet decision-making after ministers failed to effectively challenge claims there was an imminent threat from weapons of mass destruction. Senior Whitehall officials believe the way the Salisbury attack was handled has shown that the threat from a “more aggressive” Russia was correctly assessed and proved the value of cross-government working. The response to the attack was both quicker than it had been when the Russian exile Alexander Litvinenko was poisoned more than a decade ago, and more coordinated. It brought together the diplomatic network, communications and law enforcement. Some of the details of the process that led to this week’s coordinated response to the Russian attack and the expulsion of more than 100 “intelligence diplomats” from scores of countries are now becoming clear. The UK shared “unprecedented” amounts of intelligence to allies in the EU and Nato in order to persuade them of Britain’s case that there was no plausible alternative to Russian responsibility. That intelligence is believed to include evidence that Russia had been working on the nerve agent novichok despite failing to report it to the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, and on systems that would allow it to be used for assassinations.

No player born in the United States has won or even competed for a world championship since Bobby Fischer in 1972. The Miami-born, Brooklyn-raised Caruana draped himself in an American flag amid applause from the gallery at the Kühlhaus after winning as black over Russia’s Alexander Grischuk to complete the 14-game double round-robin with nine points, one better than Azerbaijan’s Shakhriyar Mamedyarov and Russia’s Sergey Karjakin, who finished on eight apiece. Ding Laren, China’s first ever candidate, was the lone competitor to finish the fortnight undefeated with one win and 13 draws, good for fourth overall with 7.5 points. “I am absolutely thrilled,” Caruana, the world No3, said afterward. “Coming into today, I wasn’t sure what would happen and things couldn’t have gone better. A few days ago, I thought the tournament was already out of my hands, but somehow things just came together perfectly at the end. I really couldn’t be happier.” Caruana, 25, led the eight-man field from start to finish, weathering a shaky two-game period over the last week and holding off a dogged fightback by the resilient Karjakin, whose dramatic win over the American in 48 moves on Saturday briefly thrust him atop the leaderboard beside the leader with two rounds to play. But Caruana, benefiting from an extra rest day, bounced back on Monday to defeat pre-tournament favorite Levon Aronian of Armenia, while Karjakin was held to a draw by Wesley So of the United States. That set the stage for Tuesday’s final round in which four competitors entered with a mathematical shot at the title. But after Karjakin drew with Ding, Caruana outlasted Grischuk over 69 moves and more than six hours to book his place across the board from Carlsen, who will be making his third defense of the world championship in the best-of-12-games match from 9-28 November in London at a venue to be determined. “It’s still so far away, but I’ll prepare very seriously for it,” said Caruana, who earned the winner’s share of €95,000 ($117,827) with Tuesday’s candidates win. “I’ll come well-prepared. It will be a tough fight, but right now I’m not even thinking about it.” Caruana first rose to prominence in 2007, when he became the youngest grandmaster in American history less than two weeks before his 15th birthday, a mark since bested by Sam Sevian. He’d come agonizingly close to competing for the world title in 2016, but was forced to play for a win against Karjakin in the final round of the candidates due to tie-breaker rules and fell short. Instead, it was Karjakin who pushed Carlsen to the limit in that year’s world championship match in New York City. Caruana, who is a dual US-Italian citizen but spent his childhood in Brooklyn’s Park Slope neighborhood, competed internationally for Italy from 2005 until 2015, when he changed federations to compete as an American. He represented the United States on the first board at the most recent Chess Olympiad in 2016, leading the nation to their first gold medal at the tournament since 1976. The lone other American to compete for a version of the world title since Fischer’s 1975 abdication was Russian-born grandmaster Gata Kamsky, who played under the US flag when he lost a 20-game match to Russian star Anatoly Karpov in 1996, when the championship was fractured between rival governing bodies and Garry Kasparov was generally recognized as the world’s strongest player."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/mar/27/manchester-arena-bombing-fire-service-arrived-two-hours-late-says-report","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-27T11:00:04Z","webTitle":"Manchester Arena bombing: fire service arrived two hours late, says report","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/mar/27/manchester-arena-bombing-fire-service-arrived-two-hours-late-says-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/mar/27/manchester-arena-bombing-fire-service-arrived-two-hours-late-says-report","fields":{"headline":"Manchester Arena bombing: fire service arrived two hours late, says report","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The fire service played “no meaningful role” in the aftermath of the Manchester Arena bombing because they arrived two hours late, a review of the response to the attack has found. Although two fire crews were stationed close enough to the Arena to hear the explosion, they were sent to a rendezvous point three miles away amid fears that there was a marauding terror attack and they would not be safe, the review concluded. When they eventually arrived at the Arena, more than two hours after Salman Abedi detonated his suicide bomb on Monday 22 May 2017, the visibly frustrated fire officers were not immediately allowed on to the concourse to help because of communication errors between “risk-averse” officers in charge. Dawn Docx, the interim chief fire officer of Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service (GMFRS) said she apologised unreservedly for the failures in the previous leadership of the service at the time of last May’s outrage. “It is clear that our response fell far short of what the people of Greater Manchester can expect,” she told a press conference following the publication of a report by Lord Bob Kerslake into the emergency response to the attack. The fire service decided to send in units only after a senior officer overheard a conversation at 00.15 on Tuesday in which he learned armed police had been deployed an hour and a half earlier to check the incident was not a marauding terror attack of the type seen in Paris. Fire officers later told Kerslake’s reviewers that had they been told this key information by police earlier they would have potentially sent in special rescue teams sooner, knowing the scene was likely to be secure. Vodafone also comes in for heavy criticism in the review. The phone company operates an emergency phone system that should kick in following a terror attack, allowing other police forces to help call handlers in Greater Manchester. It should also allow the local force to set up a casualty bureau to coordinate information about the missing and injured. But the National Mutual Aid Telephony system operated by Vodafone experienced a “catastrophic failure”, Kerslake found. This caused significant stress and upset on the night to the families involved, who were “reduced to a frantic search around the hospitals of Greater Manchester to find out more”. Vodafone, which has held the Home Office contract to provide the service since 2009, must give urgent guarantees that it does not happen again and put tested back-up systems in place, said Kerslake. Greater Manchester fire and rescue service (GMFRS) and the north-west fire control both accept they “let down the people of Greater Manchester and other visitors to the city that night”, said Kerslake. The local fire service has three special response teams equipped with “Sked” stretchers intended for the rapid extraction of casualties from a terror attack. But the teams were never deployed and casualties were instead carried out by Arena staff on advertising boards and railings. Some casualties complained they lay injured for two hours while the fire service waited for orders three miles away: despite GMFRS being the first and only fire and rescue service in England to have trained and equipped all its firefighters and pumps to respond to cardiac arrests for the ambulance service. The independent, 226-page report was commissioned by Andy Burnham, the mayor of Greater Manchester, after he was contacted by disgruntled fire officers desperate to deploy but who were left to watch the response unfold on TV. Burnham said the fire service followed protocol too rigidly: “As this report repeatedly makes clear, there is a danger of inflexibility in applying a theoretical response rather than responding to the unique reality every incident poses. This can lead frontline responders to make judgements that might be right on paper but wrong in practice and this in part explains the fire service’s mistakes,” he said on Tuesday. He called ont he government and home office to ensure that any protocols provide “sufficient flexibility to respond to the different circumstances.” The then £155,000-a-year chief fire officer, Peter O’Reilly, has now retired, keeping his pension with no action taken against him. Asked if any officers had been disciplined for their handling of events, Docx said: “We are very much a learning organisation. We are not seeking to go down a discipline route.” Andy Burnham said no one individual should bear all the responsibility for failures and no one should be “scapegoated”. Kerslake concludes that had GMFRS assets been deployed immediately then firefighters would have been much better placed to support and, potentially, to accelerate the evacuation of casualties from the foyer. The failure by fire chiefs as “extraordinary” and “incredible”, he told reporters. But he insisted he was not able to determine whether quicker deployment of firefighters could have saved lives. That will be for coroners’ inquests to decide. In contrast, he said the actions of the arena staff, British Transport Police (BTP) and members of the public who stayed to help showed “enormous bravery and compassion”. Police and ambulance personnel were also very rapidly on the scene and there followed “a remarkably fast deployment of armed officers” to secure the area and paramedics to attend to the wounded. As well as representatives from the emergency services, the council and the Arena, 200 members of the public affected by the attack on 22 May were interviewed by Kerslake’s team, including family and friends of 11 of the 22 people who died. Many complained about being “hounded” and “bombarded” by the media. Some said photographers took “sneaky” pictures through a window when they were being told their loved ones had died. At one hospital, a reporter sent a tin of biscuits for staff containing a note offering £2,000 for information. Several people told of the physical presence of crews outside their homes. One mentioned the forceful attempt by a reporter to gain access through their front door by ramming a foot in the doorway. The child of one family was given condolences on the doorstep before official notification of the death of her mother. Another family told how their child was stopped by journalists while making their way to school. There were at least two examples of impersonation, said Kerslake. One respondent said they talked to someone pretending to be a bereavement nurse; another said journalists phoned the hospital pretending to be from the police. “To have experienced such intrusive and overbearing behaviour at a time of such enormous vulnerability seemed to us to be completely and utterly unacceptable,” Kerslake writes. He asks the Independent Press Standards Organisation (Ipso) to review the operation of its code and consider developing a new code specifically to cover similar events in future. While some families were grateful to have received money from the We Love Manchester emergency fund, which raised £20m from members of the public, others were angry. Some objected to the awards being made public. “We weren’t happy ... that every member of the country now knows what’s in our bank account,” said one. Others complained that bereaved relatives received more than those who survived with horrific injuries. Some reserved their ire for the government: “My family feel very angry and let down by the government as there has been no help, support or funding in any way ... if it wasn’t for the generosity of the public ... we would probably be homeless.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2018/mar/27/labour-has-taken-too-long-to-stamp-out-antisemitism-says-corbyn-ally","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-27T08:10:00Z","webTitle":"Labour has taken too long to stamp out antisemitism, says Corbyn ally","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/mar/27/labour-has-taken-too-long-to-stamp-out-antisemitism-says-corbyn-ally","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/mar/27/labour-has-taken-too-long-to-stamp-out-antisemitism-says-corbyn-ally","fields":{"headline":"Labour has taken too long to stamp out antisemitism, says Corbyn ally","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Labour has taken too long to stamp out antisemitism in the party, a key ally of Jeremy Corbyn has said. The shadow business secretary, Rebecca Long-Bailey, said it was imperative for the party to urgently address the problem to ensure that the Jewish community felt welcome. In an interview for BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, she said: “Jeremy has always been a militant opponent of antisemitism, but too often the issue has been dismissed as a few bad apples when we need to take very serious root and branch action, to root out the cause of the problem.” Her comments came after some Labour MPs joined protesters outside parliament following claims from Jewish leaders that Corbyn had become a figurehead for antisemitism. Corbyn himself conceded that his party had failed to address the problem and issued his strongest apology yet over his 2012 backing of a graffiti artist behind an antisemitic mural. Long-Bailey, a staunch supporter of Corbyn who is touted as a potential future party leader from the left, said it was “devastating to realise that the Jewish community had lost faith in our approach to antisemitism”. Lord Levy, Labour’s former chief fundraiser, said he was considering leaving the party over the issue. Asked if he still felt at home in the party, he said: “I’m not sure. I put myself under the microscope continually because the provenance of Corbyn comes from a certain element of the left and they seem to be able to call the shots. If these people are antisemitic [and if] they do not believe in zero tolerance on antisemitism, they should not be part of this Labour party.” Long-Bailey insisted Labour did take a zero-tolerance approach to antisemitism but this had not been “enforced as effectively as it should have been”. She also called for faster implementation of recommendations made by Shami Chakrabarti in a report for Labour on allegations of antisemitism. She said: “There will be clear efforts now to roll out a political education programme specifically to make sure that every single person in the Labour party is aware of all forms of antisemitism ... to make sure nobody suffers in the way that they have done.” Long-Bailey said she hoped Jewish leaders would help Labour to tackle the issue. “I would really welcome a meeting as urgently as possible between Jeremy and the Board of Deputies and the Jewish Leadership Council because we have to work collaboratively on this,” she said. On Corbyn’s comments about the mural, she said: “It was clearly an antisemitic mural, and Jeremy has apologised for not looking at it. We are all human unfortunately and it’s a lesson to us all to look clearly at the things we are supporting or commenting on on Facebook.” Levy was reluctant to accept Corbyn’s apology. He said: “It is all well to say that he didn’t realise what was in it, I just don’t accept that. I think this is a man who does not have sensitivity to understanding where the community comes from and what the Jewish community stands for and believes in.” On Monday night, the former Labour prime minister Tony Blair said he did not believe Corbyn was antisemitic but said there were people around the leader who “don’t really think this is a serious issue”. He told BBC Two’s Newsnight: “I think up to now at least they haven’t really got it. I think they would be very wise to listen to what the Jewish community is saying today and act on it.” Asked why action on the issue had taken so long, he replied: “I don’t know. Because I think there are people, around him at least, that don’t really think this is a serious issue, and hopefully now they realise that it is.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2018/mar/28/the-remarkable-story-of-terrorism-and-trauma-that-inspired-a-new-opera","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-28T03:29:41Z","webTitle":"The remarkable story of terrorism and trauma that inspired a new opera","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/mar/28/the-remarkable-story-of-terrorism-and-trauma-that-inspired-a-new-opera","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/mar/28/the-remarkable-story-of-terrorism-and-trauma-that-inspired-a-new-opera","fields":{"headline":"The remarkable story of terrorism and trauma that inspired a new opera","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Shortly after the September 11 terrorist attacks, five emaciated teenage girls turned up independently at a hospital in Manhattan. Each was suffering from identical symptoms. They could not eat, they said, because their oesophagus was blocked: flesh from the victims, and debris from the Twin Towers, had become lodged in their mouths. “The ear, nose, and throat surgeon who examined the girls discovered that their throats were, indeed, constricted,” writes journalist Susan Faludi in her 2007 book The Terror Dream: Fear and Fantasy in Post-9/11 America. “But he could find no obstruction, no debris, and, needless to say, no body parts.” This real-life medical anecdote has since been repeated and re-fangled as an allegory for the impossibility of articulating the horrors of September 11 – and is now the inspiration for a new Australian opera. The Howling Girls, by composer Damien Ricketson and director Adena Jacobs, premieres on Wednesday night at Carriageworks in Sydney. Featuring soprano Jane Sheldon and six teenage girls, the opera is, above all, an interrogation of the voice. Ricketson and Jacobs, working with Sydney Chamber Opera, had explored a number of tales including The Little Mermaid, who sacrifices the power of speech for love, and the drowning of Ophelia, before settling on The Howling Girls. “The thing we realised they all had in common was what it means to have a voice; what it means to have your voice constricted; and what it means to re-find your voice,” says Ricketson. In a recent preview of the performance, Sheldon stands on a bare stage that emulates a tomb. Wearing an eerie transparent shroud-like gown, her arms pinned to her side, she splutters, pants, hacks and rasps. In the silence between, there is the roll of a drum. Then the chorus of girls – in furry black gowns, a gaggle of prehistoric birds – use Aztec death whistles to shriek in unison. The scene is deeply distressing and yet strangely addictive. The Howling Girls, an abstract opera that aims to create an otherworldly altered state, bristles with primal sounds. There are also fractures of language so distant they are barely comprehensible. “It’s an attempt to remake or reconstitute the voice after a trauma. Is that even possible?” asks Jacobs, clutching her own neck as she talks. As Faludi writes in The Terror Dream, the story of the choking girls (first reported in a book by literary professor Judith Greenberg) suggested “an inability to digest the catastrophe”. Which begs the question: are the girls “a metaphor for our failure to ‘swallow’ the experience of 9/11 – or for our inability to express it?” Female bodies are “always on the front line, the first place in which politics plays out and where society tries to reinstate control,” insists Faludi, speaking to The Guardian on the phone from her home in Massachusetts. (Although The Howling Girls was in part a response to The Terror Dream, Faludi has not been involved in the development of the production.) Female voices were silenced post-9/11, Faludi argues in her book: from a 40% drop in women appearing on Sunday talk shows to the censure of feminist figures like Susan Sontag who, after speaking out against the official Bush administration narrative, were “verbally drawn and quartered in the public square”. “What raced into that space were chest beating op-eds by conservative to right-wing men saying this all shows we need to go back to John Wayne America,” she says. “There was this weird impulse to have traditional cowboy-like heroes and to redefine the victims as women. It was very hyper masculine.” The Howling Girls uses the choking girls to explore the phenomenon of “mass hysteria”. In the Victorian era, explains Faludi, hysteria was a “mute protest – an inability to say, ‘Hey I don’t fit the picture of this culture and it is actually doing me psychological and physical damage’. And so in that way you can see these girls after 9/11 being emblematic of the sense that something that is deeply wrong with how we are dealing with this crisis. But not having the words, so enacting it on our bodies.” Jacobs, who directed the opera, agrees: “Certainly, the seed of the work relates to a question of the female voice and hysteria as a kind of mode of communication which is beyond language.” The concept of “hysteria” has historically been a way to regulate or dismiss the behaviour of women. But Jacobs is also interested in an argument within feminist theory that hysteria can be “repurposed as a very subversive force outside the regular masculine mode of language”. To that affect, The Howling Girls is a wordless opera (it has no libretto). Built on a mainly electronic score, it has no narrative and no sense of place, beyond that of a ghostly burial chamber where voices rise and gurgle through the vault. Instead of lyrics, the music itself functions as a means of expression, creating an aura of ritual, of panic, of anxiety and of fragmentation. Nowhere is this more apparent than in a 36-minute endurance piece Sheldon performs: the noises she emits – wailing, moaning, howling – mimic those made by human beings in times of uncontrollable anguish. Critically, much of the score has been developed to bypass the brain, instead creating a near-violent corporeal impact on those listening. To do that, the opera features low tones and frequencies that are felt as vibrations first and heard second. Ricketson, the composer, notes: “It’s very visceral.” Abuse of the body – represented by the choking girls but also, artistically, by the dogged stamina Sheldon must show in her performance, and by the spectators, who must tolerate a profoundly uncomfortable experience – is one way “to form a kind of inarticulate protest”, says Faludi. And yet The Howling Girls arrives at a time that many hope will be a new era forged by the #metoo movement. Significantly, it opens just a few days after porn star Stormy Daniels spoke on 60 Minutes about her alleged affair with Donald Trump, despite attempts to shut her down (and shut her up). The Howling Girls may be a wordless opera. But it is by no means silent. It is telling that it has emerged as women are finally beginning to talk, in whatever means they have. Women “are getting tired of being the recipients of the country’s illnesses”, says Faludi. They are saying, “I kept quiet. No longer.” • The Howling Girls is on at Carriageworks in Sydney until 7 April"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/mar/28/call-for-national-inquiry-into-protection-of-indigenous-children","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-28T00:22:01Z","webTitle":"Call for national inquiry into protection of Indigenous children","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/mar/28/call-for-national-inquiry-into-protection-of-indigenous-children","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/mar/28/call-for-national-inquiry-into-protection-of-indigenous-children","fields":{"headline":"Call for national inquiry into protection of Indigenous children","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"An Australian Law Reform Commission report on Indigenous incarceration has recommended a national inquiry into the removal of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children, saying out-of-home care is a clear pathway to youth detention and adult imprisonment. The report was tabled in parliament by the attorney general, Christian Porter, on Wednesday. It made 35 recommendations, including abolishing the ability of states and territories to jail people for unpaid fines, and abolishing all mandatory sentences that have a disproportionate effect on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. It recommended investment in local, Indigenous-led diversionary programs through a justice reinvestment process, and said that all states should introduce a statutory custody notification scheme. It also recommended national targets around reducing Indigenous incarceration and violence toward Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. But it said it did not have the scope to examine the impact of child protection and child removal policies on the overrepresentation of Indigenous Australians in detention, and recommended the federal government commission another national inquiry. “It is the view of the ALRC that the incarceration rate of adult Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples cannot be fully and satisfactorily addressed without a national review of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children in child protection, and the state and territory laws that see such children placed into out-of-home care,” the report said. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children make up 5.5% of all people aged 0-17 in Australia, and 36.2% of all children in out-of-home care. Indigenous children are placed in out-of-home care at a rate of 56.6 per 100,000 – 10 times that of non-Indigenous children – and children in out-of-home care are 16 times more likely to be under a youth justice supervision order than children in the general population. The report also recommended state and federal police review their complaints-handling mechanisms, finding that a significant proportion of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples do not trust that complaints to police are properly and independently investigated. It recommended states and territories review police regulations to ensure that discretionary powers, like the power to issue a caution rather than a charge, are used fairly and without discrimination. It also recommended that states and territories abolish laws criminalising the use of offensive language, or at least narrow their application to language that is “abusive or threatening”. According to 2016 figures, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people were seven times more likely than non-Indigenous people to be charged with a criminal offence after an interaction with police, 11 times more likely to be held on remand awaiting trial or sentence, and 12.5 times more likely to receive a sentence of imprisonment. However, the median length of imprisonment for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people was shorter, suggesting that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples were being jailed for less serious crimes. Half of all Indigenous prisoners received a sentence of two years or less, and 45% received a sentence of six months or less, compared with 27% of non-Indigenous prisoners. The former attorney general, George Brandis, announced the inquiry in 2016 and received the final report in December. The inquiry chair, federal court judge and Gadigal-Wirradjuri man Matthew Myers, was criticised by the Institute of Public Affairs after he suggested that one finding might be that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples needed to be treated differently under the law to achieve true equity under the law. The final report dismissed concerns raised by the IPA that it was pushing for a “parallel justice system”, saying the focus was on “achieving substantive, not just formal, equality before the law”. It quoted a former high court chief justice, Gerard Brennan, who said that formal equality may be “an engine of oppression destructive of human dignity if the law entrenches inequalities”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/mar/28/its-been-a-week-since-i-quit-facebook-it-feels-like-liberation","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-27T17:00:22Z","webTitle":"It's been a week since I quit Facebook.

It feels like liberation","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The revelations about Cambridge Analytica’s harvest of Facebook data signalled the end of the end for me. The beginning of the end had come a year or so earlier when I deleted the Facebook app from my phone (yes, I reinstalled it; I’ll deal with the addiction shortly) because I felt it had become an unhealthy compulsion – somewhere between not being able to stop eating one of those huge buckets of synthetic-buttery popcorn at the cinema and hating yourself for watching Midsomer Murders week after week after week. I was a late adopter of Facebook, having opened an account before leaving it mostly dormant for years. I’m a cyber Luddite and didn’t quite know what to do once I’d opened it. The whole “Like” thing I found as pointless and empty as making friends with people I’d never – and had no special desire to – meet. Still, I let them all in. So by the time I’d actually engaged I’d already friended hundreds of people I didn’t know at all. Once I started posting I was soon checking the app on my phone dozens – perhaps more – times a day, especially after I’d shared a pic of my dogs, something I’d written or something I’d read that I thought friends (real or virtual) would like. The little thumbs-up (and eventually other emojis) were a drug. But why has so-and-so (who I’ve never met but who I know lives alone with her seven corgis and is obsessed with Claire Foy) suddenly stopped liking every one of my posts? Did the depression finally win over? And why doesn’t such and such, who I am actually real life mates with, ever – ever! – like my stuff? What sort of friend are they? Still, I didn’t need my kids’ encouragement to resist (with a couple of exceptions) posting about them; I compensated with dozens of pics of my dogs who, in any event, often seem to like me more. One of the things that shat me to tears about Facebook from day one was the way real and virtual friends boasted about the unparalleled genius of their children with violins, golf clubs, diabolos, any and every ball, skis, chemistry assignments, fashion and speech night orations – about how they were the most loving, giving, responsive children in the universe who always cleaned their rooms, looked like angels when they slept, had breath like fresh vanilla beans, emptied the dishwasher without being asked, walked and talked at nine months, always said thank you and by the way I really, really love you Mum and Dad, washed their own clothes, got straight A-pluses, and never projectile vomited onto the ceiling, got caught up with a dodgy crowd, got busted underage by the cops or lost in the dark tunnel of adolescence. We are all, the kids I’ve helped raise included, exceptional in some way – or so it’s said. But if I told the truth about mine on Facebook (“Yeah I came eleventh – whatevs ...”; “I told you – I hate Osso-Bucco with risotto Milanese.”; “There’s no icecream ... and by the way, did you know your generation has wrecked the world?”; “Stop asking – I’ll shower on the weekend.”; “Dad, did you ever wish you were born into a different family – just asking?”) they’d seem diminished. Then there are all of those perfect, seamless marriages, lived in architecturally flawless citadels to emotional, financial and familial success, with enviously curated interiors and perched by water or bucolic bush. Facebook can give you that, it seems. It’s why I’m always so stunned to hear of the divorces and the eating disorders, the breakdowns, infidelities and addictions when real life, as is its way, eventually outs the grimy truth. Mostly they don’t post that stuff. The pathology of both real and cyber-friends started to concern, anger – and especially – distract me. Not nearly all, of course; I’m good actual friends with people I’ve connected with on Facebook. Just as I feel I’ve lost real friends because of it, too. “These are not really your friends,” I’d find myself saying to the image on my phone of a troubled person I did know and care about. “I wish you’d lose the desire to share with total strangers what happened in yesterday’s psychotherapy session.” My writing habits are set in stone: 45 hours a week – more, if need be, towards the apex of a major project. I’ve never had what some call “writers’ block” – never much believed in it either. My answer has always been to stomp and slosh on through the swamp. But I’ve only ever been a Facebook compulsive during the construction of one (the latest) of my six books. And it literally distracted me off the rails a couple of times as I checked the app, again and again – a convenient out from the swamp on the screen, yes, sure, but also a repetitive impulse I desperately wanted to shelve because it shredded concentration. Facebook was an Exocet into the bunker of my obsessive compulsions. The ads in my feed – for dog food, arborio rice, books about history, children and violins, parenting websites – I found increasingly creepy, insidious, infuriating. The quizzes and pop psychological profiles (Which historical figure do you most resemble?) – obviously harvesting ruses – enraged me; if a friend completed and shared one, I, too, was potentially caught in the data harvest (as the CA files illustrate). On the positive side, I found Facebook a wonderful way to connect with communities, and maintain contact with a bunch of men and women – and younger people – who I know and care about. I loved seeing what the blokes in my skiing gang are up to, maintaining close contact with the writers I know and the ease with which I could contact Indigenous people and historians with whom I align. Already I wonder if it’s to my professional detriment. And I do miss the positives. In the past 10 days I’ve wanted to share important articles – one about National Geographic’s truth telling on its racist past, another on a book in the Indigenous space, pulped because of serious cultural transgression. I’m doing a public event in Sydney this week with a historian I greatly admire; ordinarily I’d have shared notification about that, too. I’d like to share this on Facebook. As someone who works alone I miss the easy interactions. But I’ll not miss the sense of emptiness and occasional anger when I considered the dross and the confected realities in my feed. At the moment it feels like liberation. Never say never. I may yet reopen a properly managed professional page. But meanwhile, friends know where to find me.

There’s the Austrian woman who discovered, at 22 years old, that her mother and father were not her biological parents. The two families in Assam, India, whose newborns were given to the wrong mothers. And a French woman who took someone else’s baby home. It’s true. Doctors and nurses who hold lives in their hands sometimes make mistakes. The GP-turned-writer Susi Fox’s psychological thriller Mine teases out this nightmare and uses it to explore cultural anxieties about birth and hospitals. Fox examines the dark side of motherhood – mental illness, failure, violent thoughts – and refuses to look away. Mine’s protagonist, Sasha, wakes up beneath fluoro lights. Her stomach bears the wounds of a caesarean but there’s no sign of her baby. Her husband is absent. When the harried nurse finally takes her to a tiny infant in a humidicrib, Sasha knows with chilling certainty that this isn’t her baby. Fox, a doctor for 16 years, divides her time between clinics in New Gisborne and Fitzroy. She told Guardian Australia that Mine was inspired by a particularly haunting dream. “I was holding a baby in my arms and showing the baby to a group of faceless people. I was saying to them: ‘This is not my baby.’ They all turned away. They didn’t believe me. It was profoundly unsettling.” After going to a writer’s clinic for doctors, the story “took on a life of its own”. The resulting novel is disorienting, throwing into question the sanity of the narrator, the trustworthiness of doctors and the reader’s understanding of right and wrong. “Not being believed is a frightening place to be,” Fox says. “It plays into the whole #MeToo movement: when women speak up, they’re often not heard.” She is calm, measured. Evidence of gender bias in the medical system is well-documented. Women’s pain is often dismissed. A study, The Girl Who Cried Pain, revealed that “women who seek help are less likely than men to be taken seriously”. Endometriosis, in which tissue similar to the lining of the uterus grows outside the uterus and can cause chronic pain, takes seven to eight years to diagnose. While things are changing, Fox says the androcentric way medicine is studied and taught affects how doctors assess their patients. “In heart disease, for example, the traditional presentation of chest pain is taken from men’s experience,” she says. “Women’s pain is seen as ‘atypical’ so women are already presented as the other.” Mine also touches on the horror of historical sexism in the medical industry. “Women were being locked up in psychiatric institutions due to hysteria,” says Fox, referring to the diagnosis, born of the Greek word for womb, hystera, that came of age in the Victorian era. Attributed to women who exhibited sleeplessness, irritability and anxiety, it was treated by doctors by manually stimulating patients to orgasm – or by confinement. In Mine, when Sasha rejects the infant that is supposedly hers, she is diagnosed with postpartum psychosis, voluntarily admitted to the psychiatric ward, plied with sedatives and treated with suspicion. Mine also explores the taboo of the bad mother. As Sasha paces, trembling, through surreal hospital hallways and into a ghoulishly lit premature nursery, she encounters women who certainly don’t fit the saintly image of motherhood. She befriends Ondine, a woman who tried to hold her son underwater to finally stop him crying – before her husband intervened. Fox has met many women with similar burdens. A doctor’s surgery can function as the last resort for desperate people, where anxieties and secrets tumble out. “GPs and psychologists are the modern-day priests,” she says. “People come to confess.” It is not the job of doctors, though, to judge. Fox is comfortable with silence, and is careful choosing her words. When she talks about a local mothers’ group she got to know as a junior doctor in regional Victoria, it’s easy to imagine her in her role as confidante. “One [mother] would come in and say, ‘I’m not sleeping, I’m not doing well – but everyone else in my mothers’ group is doing fine.’ Then, that afternoon, a different mother from the same group would come in and say the same thing. The next day, a different mother, but again the same complaint! “I was trying to show in the book that women aren’t so alone in things,” Fox says about the multiple ways – from depression to violent thoughts – that extreme stress manifests for mothers. A traumatic birth, or the alienation humidicribs can create when treating premature infants, can increase the risk of postnatal mental illness, Fox says. “Postpartum psychosis is a rare condition that affects one in 1,000 women. It presents quite quickly after birth with delusions – ideas that are not based in reality – and hallucinations, so seeing or hearing things.” While postpartum psychosis is rare, postnatal depression is far more common, experienced by one in seven women who give birth in Australia each year. Fox hopes to weaken the taboos surrounding motherhood’s dark side. “It’s not uncommon at all for women to have ideas about hurting your baby,” she says. “It’s a frightening experience but no one talks about it. I want to shine the light on things that aren’t spoken about.” • Mine by Susi Fox will be published on 2 April by Penguin Random House Australia and on 14 June by Penguin Random House UK • In Australia, the crisis support service Lifeline is on 13 11 14.

Yet somehow we have ended up debating why using a harmful racial stereotype as your business model is a bad idea. Adelaide’s new Asian gastropub, Hotel Longtime, opened with little fanfare until members of the local Asian community caught wind. The venue boasts a ping pong club room dubbed the “gentleman’s lodge” and neon signs with phrases such as “long time good time”. Alex Fahey had said the name was “all a bit of fun”, and the owners now deny knowledge of the phrases being derogatory. I started a petition to change the venue name because Asian friends had contacted me feeling shocked, upset and powerless. The phrase echoing in our minds is “me love you long time” which is directly associated with Asian prostitution. You may have heard it – especially if you are of Asian descent, under 40 and grew up in Australia. You see, I am a half-white, half-Asian female born in Adelaide, who grew up in the era of Pauline Hanson and One Nation, when far right groups had greater freedom in expressing their bigotry. I remember Hanson’s 1996 speech making waves in Australia, with her suggestion that “we are in danger of being swamped by Asians”. In South Australia the same year, Port Lincoln mayor Peter Davis announced: “If you are a child of a mixed race, particularly Asian-Caucasian or Aboriginal-white, you are a mongrel. That’s what happens when you cross dogs or whatever. I’m not a racist … but I do recognise that cultures are different.” I was devastated. In a community where nearly everyone was Caucasian, not only was I facing regular hostility towards my Asian heritage, but also hostility towards being a “half-caste”, being told at school, “my mum says you’re a mongrel”. By teenage years, phrases like “me so horny”, “me love you long time” and “two dollar, sucky sucky” were commonplace. The most famous origin of these epithets is from Stanley Kubrick’s 1987 film Full Metal Jacket, which depicts the grim realities of war, including the widespread sexual exploitation of local women by western soldiers in Vietnam. But these quotes were quickly taken out of context and entered into popular western lexicon, with little insight as to the origin or the after-effects of military occupation in Asia. Consequently, many people who use these phrases (usually in an “Asian” accent), are unaware of their power. Early on people used them to tease and humiliate, but as I reached puberty, they took on a more sinister role: to test my response to racially and sexually charged comments. If I reacted negatively, the atmosphere became hostile and I was told it was “just a joke”. If I gave a weak grimace, it was taken as a green light to continue with “I bet your pussy is so tight”, “how much do you cost then?”, or worse. I craved to be white. Yet I still felt “lucky” to have a western first and last name, because I saw my other Asian friends being abused or excluded even more. In the case of Hotel Longtime, Alex Fahey’s wife Tin Chu is Vietnamese, having moved to Australia in 2007. This does raise the question as to whether being associated with persons of Asian descent validates the use of a negative stereotype, and yet in other cases of an ethnicity reclaiming a stereotype or slur, it has been through first acknowledging the origin and context, then repurposing it to empower the community. As the owners of Hotel Longtime refute any association with the stereotype, we can rule out that this was their intention. To perpetuate this is demeaning and sexualising, for Asian women in particular. It is a gateway stereotype that leads to graver long-term consequences, including harassment, abuse, discrimination and an assumption of sexual subservience. The countless experiences of others and myself is proof of that. I recommend Caroline Wang’s blog A Letter To Asian Girls for deeper insight into the experience of Asian women growing up in Australia. For a country whose first prime minister said non-white races were “unequal and inferior”, and which has a history of racist policies, it’s not surprising an undercurrent of white imperialism still exists. I hope however, that by sharing stories of the Asian diaspora, we can begin to dismantle harmful stereotypes that affect us on a daily basis. • Alice Whittington is born, raised and educated in Adelaide.

In fact the last 20 years have been a financial disaster for forest management in Tasmania. According to my calculations, Forestry Tasmania’s total operating cash losses over the 20 years from 1997-2017 are $454m. The annual reports of Forestry Tasmania from 1997 to 2017 (if you can understand what the accounts don’t say) and the 2008 report of the Tasmanian auditor general, reveal that the regional forest agreement (RFA) has comprehensively failed to deliver on its “economically sustainable” promise. Yet the state government continues to see things differently. Tasmania’s resources minister, Guy Barnett, says he believed the existing RFA had allowed the industry to operate “responsibly and competitively” and support jobs as well as having “significant environmental outcomes”. The early RFA years were profitable – underpinned by a massive boom in industrial logging and the export of low-value woodchips – but cash operating surpluses have persistently declined since 2004. The past 10 years reveal substantial and ongoing deficits, with income not covering all operating costs. We also need to consider what has happened to the underlying asset value as the forests have been logged or plantations sold off. In 1998, the forest estate of Tasmania comprising lands, roads and forests was valued at $852m. Fast forward 20 years, the value of that public forest estate is now only $101m. That’s a write-down of $751m. Native forests used for timber production now appear to be worth an estimated $44m, and that value continues to erode. In economic terms, what we are witnessing are the last days of a one-off “mining” operation destroying natural capital. Adding together those cash operating losses and the asset write-downs, the big picture is that since 1998 – the first full year of the RFA – Forestry Tasmania’s operations have produced cash and non-cash losses of $1,306m. That’s an average $65m loss every year. My figures have never been challenged by either the government, the timber industry or Forestry Tasmania. In 2008 the state auditor general sounded the alert, repeating this annually, including a detailed report into the company’s financial performance in 2011. Forestry Tasmania insiders must have known about the inherent flaws in their business model when woodchipping started declining after 2004. For a state-run business enterprise, the corporation’s financial reporting may adhere to prevailing accounting standards, but so often those standards are used to obfuscate rather than explain. This has allowed the Tasmanian native forest industry to perpetuate a giant fraud on taxpayers. In early 2016, I was so alarmed by this sorry saga of insolvency – largely hidden because the corporation is publicly owned – that I prepared a detailed 17-page briefing note for two new board members of the restructured corporation, rebranded as Sustainable Timbers Tasmania (STT) in July 2017.That correspondence has never been acknowledged nor have I been asked to provide the board with a briefing. Similarly, I made a thorough submission on the economics driving the timber industry to a Tasmanian parliamentary inquiry into the 2011 sale of the Triabunna woodchip mill by Tasmanian timber behemoth, Gunns. The claim at the time was that the export woodchip model was broken, and Gunns was broke. I was the only person to give an overview of all the circumstances leading up to the sale of the woodchip mill, but I wasn’t called as a witness, although some of the final report referred to what I had noted. The inquiry was a witch-hunt into why the mill was unexpectedly sold to environmental philanthropists Graeme Wood and Jan Cameron, who promptly shut it down. Vested timber interests in Tasmania were outraged that a consortium of local millers had been blindsided. The outrage of the industry was confected, as evidence to the inquiry subsequently revealed. Treasury was given only a day to assess the loan and found the need for the mill by the industry was not supported by robust evidence. Forestry Tasmania was about to bear most of the risks, and the applicants were heavily geared with little backup security and a history of making losses. Unfortunately it’s still business as usual in Tasmania, a terrible lose-lose scenario – taxpayers foot the bill for increasingly uneconomic forestry operations, and diverse forest landscapes worth untold millions of dollars for their water, carbon and tourism values lose value as they are industrialised. Four years ago, the Hodgman Liberal government was elected on a pledge of ending public subsidies to the forest sector. It hasn’t kept that promise. The government has assumed responsibility for $113m of unfunded superannuation liabilities that Forestry Tasmania had on its books for past employees. The arrangement may not have been a cash injection, but cash grants have also been made. Taken together with the superannuation costs, it means that more than $161m of financial support has been provided to the corporation since the government came into office. There’s also ongoing special treatment of forestry in financial arrangements with the commonwealth. As part of the Commonwealth Grants Commission methodology for calculating states’ GST entitlements, most specific purpose grants – for example national partnership arrangements – are taken into account and deducted from the states’ GST share. Not so with forestry. All of the Australian government grants to Tasmania relating to the $277m Tasmanian forests intergovernmental agreement (TFA) in 2011 and the $250m Tasmanian community forest agreement (TCFA) in 2005 have been quarantined when calculating Tasmania’s GST share. So rather than Tasmania’s share of GST being reduced, the forestry grants have been additional, an off-the-books bonus. This lack of concern for accountability and financial risk when throwing native forestry a lifeline is something governments of all political persuasions have had difficulty dealing with. When STT prepares its accounts these days, they don’t reflect real values. For example, the government business enterprise doesn’t own the land it logs and the land is valued at nothing. If a forest is clear-felled, most people would accept that the landscape has indeed suffered a loss of intrinsic worth – a myriad of environmental, aesthetic, water catchment and carbon values. But no one is doing that big-picture accounting, and those other values are not reflected in the financial accounts. It is poor public policy when this loss of value is never properly taken into account when the state decides whether to log or not. The greatest irony of all is that these other environmental values were meant to be incorporated into “ecologically sustainable forest management” that the first Tasmanian RFA has failed to deliver. Unfortunately, the extended RFA that was signed last year – effectively a rolling blank cheque forever – almost certainly guarantees that nothing will change. We won’t be getting an internationally competitive, sustainable native forest timber industry. The only way that will happen is if people are prepared to pay a lot more for their timber, and we log much less of it. The tragedy for Tasmanians is that long-term industrial timber contracts have locked the state into commercial arrangements that are not profitable. We can argue all we like about whether there’s enough timber there, or whether the logging is ecologically sustainable. The reality is Tasmania won’t make money at the contracted prices, and the state will continue clear-felling forests for ply, pulp and chip that could be producing sawlogs for decades to come. Over the next 20 years – no matter what the extended RFA promises – history clearly tells us that we will see a continuing contraction of the native forest industry in Tasmania. In response to questions from the Guardian, Tasmania’s resources minister Guy Barnett said: “The Tasmanian RFA provides a balanced framework for sustainable management of production forests. Over 20 years of operation so far, the RFA has the runs on the board – enabling forest industries to operate responsibly and competitively in global markets and supporting thousands of jobs in regional communities. “Over the same period there have been significant environmental outcomes. The State of the Forests report 2017 shows that in 1996 just 55% of Tasmania’s old-growth forests were protected in reserves. Today that figure has grown by more 300,000 hectares to 87%, or more than one million hectares in total. “The government has been working with Sustainable Timber Tasmania to improve the bottom line and looks forward to significantly better results for the year to June.” As told to Gregg Borschmann"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/mar/27/the-problem-with-labors-tax-policy-nobody-understands-it","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-27T01:15:53Z","webTitle":"The problem with Labor's tax policy?

Nobody understands it","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"It’s the tax debate that is set to dominate the political agenda for months to come that most Australians don’t understand. Which is precisely why dividend imputation credits are shaping up as such a potent weapon for both sides. In one corner, a party that has discovered a way of raising a lazy $6bn per annum to help fund its political agenda while claiming that it is taking from the rich to give to the poor. In the other, a party saying that its opponents are coming after pensioners, robbing them of their last piece of dignity, or at least the cheque from the government that mysteriously appears around tax time. In this era of fact-free politics, dividend imputation credits provide the political parties with yet another vehicle to talk about feelings; and the great thing about feelings is that they are all able to be manufactured and manipulated by the professionals. As this week’s Essential Report shows, both sides to this debate are starting with a blank slate. Reflect on this – 79% of the voting public have little or no understanding of an issue that the prime minister believes will be an election battleground. Nothwithstanding these degrees of ignorance, those respondents who make it through this basic definition of the dividend imputation credit are currently evenly split between supporters, opponents and those with no opinion: When companies pay dividends to Australian shareholders out of after-tax profit, shareholders receive franking credits, which they can claim as a tax deduction. If the shareholder does not pay any tax, they receive a cash refund from the tax office. This system is known as “dividend imputation” and these cash payments cost the government about $6bn per year. While support and opposition are level, the partisan divide is substantial – and there are also significant age and gender dynamics, with women and younger voters more likely to be in favour of the changes. In other words, this is a little understood policy, for which views are evenly split, but starkly divided between different segments of the electorate, making it a classic empty vessel for professional political campaigners. Fill that vessel up with a set of messages and you get an idea of where each side will try to sail it. For Labor, the billions becomes yet another element of the fiscal war chest it is building, adding to the $65bn corporate tax cut that it is not interested in paying, the changing to negative gearing and capital gains, the tightening of family trusts. By framing the issue about logic: “it doesn’t make sense” and alternatives: “there are more important priorities”, the opposition appears to have a winning set of messages. But shift the argument to taking money away from retirees “no matter how wealthy they are” and support swings to the government proposition, even as 40% acknowledge the issue is too complex for them to form an opinion. In this way the complexity creates risk, opportunity and reward for all players prepared to have a crack. There’s a similar dynamic at play in the broader tax debate, where Labor has been particularly active in identifying opportunities to end concessions for the well off, while the Coalition has been single-minded in its desire to nail the company tax cut. Labor would take succour from the positive response to most of its revenue raising measures – but would also see the rising levels of support for the corporate tax cut with some concern. Which brings me back to the opening point – the reason accountants have been able to create an industry out of helping people avoid tax is that so few people understand its complexity. While each measure can be argued to a sympathetic audience, the reality is that engagement is low, understanding is weak and a desire to engage in the complexity of the system is close to non-existent . This also explains the final table, which would have Bill Shorten and Chris Bowen shaking their heads is frustration. For all their assault on the two class tax system, right now fewer voters trust Labor to manage a fair tax system than their opponents. Some of this is likely the result of the pensioner hysteria whipped up by the Coalition which Labor has moved to neutralise today. But it is more likely just a sense that the Coalition is better on all things economic, even a fairer tax system. When it’s facts versus feelings, feelings prevail in modern political campaigns. Which is why if Labor wants to cash in on their activist and progressive taxation agenda they will need to start talking less about the machinery and a lot more about what they will do with the windfall.

According to geophysicists from Southern Methodist University, the ground is rising and falling in a region that has been “punctured like a pin cushion with oil wells and injection wells since the 1940s”. There were nearly 297,000 oil wells in Texas as of last month, according to the state regulator. Many are in the Permian Basin, described in a Bloomberg article last September as the “world’s hottest oil patch”. But the Southern Methodist report warns of unstable land and the threat of sinkholes. “These hazards represent a danger to residents, roads, railroads, levees, dams, and oil and gas pipelines, as well as potential pollution of ground water,” Zhong Lu, a professor, said in a statement. Wink – a tiny town 400 miles west of Dallas best known as the childhood home of the singer Roy Orbison – attracted national headlines in 2016 when the same scientists warned that the land between two expanding sinkholes a mile apart was deteriorating, risking the formation of more sinkholes or even the creation of a colossal single hole. Injection of wastewater and carbon dioxide increases pore pressure in rocks, a likely cause of uplift. Lu told the Guardian that cracks and corrosion from ageing wells may help explain the sinking. A “subsidence bowl” near one of the Wink sinkholes has sunk at a rate of more than 15.5in a year, probably as a result of water leaks through abandoned wells causing salt layers to dissolve, the report found. Elsewhere, a lake formed after 2003 as a result of sinking ground and rising water. Another Southern Methodist University study last year indicated that wastewater injection, often a byproduct of fracking, is a likely cause of recent earthquakes in Texas – with the Dallas-Fort Worth area, one of the most populous in the country, a hotspot. Seismic activity in previously quiet and sparsely-populated parts of west Texas has soared in the past couple of years as the energy industry has expanded its attention beyond the Midland-Odessa area towards a mountainous and tourist-centric region near the border with Mexico. For the shifting land study, the scientists analysed medium-resolution satellite radar imagery from four counties in the west Texas oil patch taken between November 2014 and April 2017. The area they examined, 4,000 sq miles, is about half the size of Wales. Now the team is studying a far wider region, from Texas to Florida, and expects to find more evidence of ground movement. “It’s crazy and just one more clear sign that we need to get off of oil as fast as possible,” said Luke Metzger, executive director of Environment Texas, an advocacy group. While Texas remains the dominant oil-and-gas producing state, renewable energy is booming: last year the state’s wind power capacity grew to exceed its capacity for generating electricity from coal-powered plants."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/mar/27/russia-to-respond-harshly-to-us-expulsion-of-diplomats","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-27T14:21:56Z","webTitle":"Nato expels seven staff from Russian mission over Skripal poisoning","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/mar/27/russia-to-respond-harshly-to-us-expulsion-of-diplomats","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/mar/27/russia-to-respond-harshly-to-us-expulsion-of-diplomats","fields":{"headline":"Nato expels seven staff from Russian mission over Skripal poisoning","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Nato has announced it is cutting the size of its Russian mission by a third, removing accreditation from seven Russian staff and rejecting three other pending applications. The Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, said the permanent size of the Russian mission would be cut from 30 to 20 people, adding the announcement was “a clear and very strong message that there was a cost to Russia’s reckless actions” in poisoning the Russian double agent Sergei Skripal in Salisbury earlier this month. He claimed Russia had underestimated Nato’s resolve and said the announcements would reduce Russia’s capability to do intelligence work across Nato. The move came after more than 20 western allies ordered the expulsion of dozens of Russian diplomats in response to the nerve agent attack in the UK in a show of solidarity that represents the biggest concerted blow to Russian intelligence networks in the west since the cold war. Speaking in Brussels at the end of consultations with Nato allies on Tuesday, Stoltenberg added that he did not think Russia had expected the west to show such resolve, pointing to the increased Nato military presence on the Russia border, higher defence spending and continued sanctions for Russia’s illegal annexation of Crimea. He said the Nato response was aimed not just at the poisoning in Salisbury, the first use of a nerve agent on Nato territory, but a response to a broader pattern of unacceptable and illegal behaviour. The US state department said that Donald Trump had “personally ordered” the expulsion of 60 Russian diplomats in Washington and New York who US intelligence believe to be spies, and the closure of the Russian consulate in Seattle. It was the biggest single expulsion order in US history. The department’s spokeswoman, Heather Nauert, said that Washington had played a key role in organising the global response. US officials, she said “have worked tirelessly over the past three weeks to achieve this unprecedented level of cooperation and also coordination”. Earlier on Tuesday the Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, claimed the US had used “colossal blackmail” to force European and other western powers to expel Russian diplomats, and promised Moscow would respond harshly to the expulsion of more than 100 Russian diplomats worldwide. Speaking at a conference on Afghanistan in Tashkent, Lavrov said: “When one or two diplomats are asked to leave this or that country, with apologies being whispered into our ears, we know for certain that this is a result of colossal pressure and colossal blackmail, which is Washington’s chief instrument in the international scene.” Briefing the cabinet on Tuesday, the prime minister, Theresa May, reported that 23 countries had expelled more than 115 Russian intelligence diplomats. She told her cabinet colleagues this represented an unprecedented series of expulsions that has demonstrated to the Kremlin “that we will not tolerate their attempts to flout international law, undermine our values or threaten our security”. She added allies were not only taking these actions out of solidarity with the UK but also because they recognised the threat that these Russian networks pose to the security of their own countries and the pattern of aggression that had affected every country. Only a handful of EU countries including Austria, Portugal, Greece and Malta, have declined to take any steps. Many countries have confined themselves to a tokenistic expulsion of a single diplomat, a move designed to register support for the UK, as opposed to causing disruption to the Russian state. Britain is now waiting to see if other states follow May’s example and announce they will not be sending official delegations, as opposed to sporting teams, to the World Cup in Russia this summer. British officials acknowledge that public opinion in many countries, notably Germany, is not hostile to Russia, and there is a strict political limit to the sanctions the EU collectively is willing to take."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/live/2018/mar/27/ftse-100-and-european-markets-set-to-rise-after-wall-street-surge-business-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-27T13:57:39Z","webTitle":"FTSE 100 and European markets rise as Wall Street rally continues – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2018/mar/27/ftse-100-and-european-markets-set-to-rise-after-wall-street-surge-business-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/live/2018/mar/27/ftse-100-and-european-markets-set-to-rise-after-wall-street-surge-business-live","fields":{"headline":"FTSE 100 and European markets rise as Wall Street rally continues – as it happened","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Signs that the US and China could be talking behind the scenes about avoiding a trade war have given global markets a lift after last week’s slump. European markets, which had missed out on Monday’s gains, have moved sharply higher today, with the FTSE 100 currently up around 2%, Germany’s Dax 1.7% better and France’s Cac climbing 1.3%. At the US open, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has also risen after Monday’s 700 point gain. There were signs of weakness in the European economy, as business sentiment fell by more than expected in March. Elsewhere our monthly Brexit watch showed the UK economy showing signs of steadying a year ahead of the country’s departure from the European Union. On the corporate front, the insolvency service wants to disqualify former BHS owner Dominic Chappell from being a director for up to 15 years. In the bid battle for GKN, which comes to a head on Thursday, predator Melrose has promised to keep the company’s aerospace division for at least five years. And more bad news for retailers, with profit falls at H&amp;M, Moss Bros and Game Digital. On that note it’s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we’ll be back tomorrow. The rally on US markets on Monday which saw the Dow Jones Industrial Average add nearly 700 points has continued at the opening of trading. The easing of fears over a possible trade war between the US and China has lifted the Dow another 50 points or 0.2%, while the S&amp;P 500 opened up 0.3% and the Nasdaq Composite up 0.48%. Sterling is falling back after its recent strong run after last week’s agreement between the UK and EU on a Brexit transition deal. A spate of profit taking has seen the pound fall 0.8% against the dollar to $1.4114 and 0.3% against the euro to €1.1399. The UK economy is steadying after the initial fallout from the vote to leave the European Union, according to our monthly Brexit watch series. Richard Partington reports: As the one-year countdown to Brexit looms, the British economy is showing signs of steadying from the fallout triggered by the EU referendum, according to a Guardian analysis of economic news over the past month. After progress with Brussels towards a two-year transitional deal to smooth Britain’s formal exit from the EU on 29 March 2019, the pound has risen back towards the highest levels seen since the leave vote. Inflation triggered by the drop in sterling after the referendum is finally beginning to fade, just as pay rises begin to come through for workers. But while the Guardian’s latest Brexit dashboard hands support to Philip Hammond’s reasons for feeling “Tiggerish” at the spring statement earlier this month, sharp challenges remain. The full story is here: And here are the monthly statistics: And the experts’ verdict: Following the collapse of BHS, the insolvency service has said it will bring proceedings to disqualify Dominic Chappell, who bought the department store group from Sir Philip Green from running a company for up to 15 years. Its full verdict: We can confirm the Insolvency Service has written to Dominic Chappell and three other former directors of BHS and connected companies informing them that we intend to bring proceedings to have them disqualified from running or controlling companies for periods up to 15 years. We can also confirm that we have written to Sir Philip Green, also a former director of BHS, informing him that we do not currently intend bring disqualification proceedings against him. As this matter may now be tested in the Court it is not appropriate to comment further. Royal Bank of Scotland has made its first acquisition since its ill-fated purchase of ABN Amro which went sour during the financial crisis. PA has the details: RBS has snapped up accounting software firm FreeAgent, marking the lender’s first acquisition since its controversial crisis-era deal to buy ABN Amro. The taxpayer-owned bank said it had agreed to buy the company for around 120p per share, valuing it at 53 million. The decision comes weeks after the company reported its first profit in a decade and as the Government prepares to start selling off its 72% holding. Chief executive Ross McEwan said: “We have been impressed by FreeAgent and its technology and are excited by the enhanced offering we will be able to provide to our customers. “We believe that a technology-enabled solution for our business banking customers will make it easier for our customers to build their businesses safely and securely.” It marks RBS’s first foray into deal-making since its 49 billion acquisition of Dutch bank ABN Amro in 2007, which quickly turned toxic. In 2008, RBS was forced to announce an emergency rights issue, asking existing shareholders to inject 12 billion into the firm to strengthen its reserves. Months later, the value of RBS shares plunged 90%, prompting a 45.5 billion Government bailout. FreeAgent specialises in cloud-based accounting software and mobile applications aimed at businesses with 10 or fewer employees. Given Donald Trump’s keenness on a strong stock market he may not want to really follow through on his trade war threats, suggest Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at Oanda There are a lot of risks that financial markets have shrugged off over the last couple of years, to the amazement at times of investors, but the prospect of a trade war is clearly not one of these. [This] has weighed heavily on risk appetite over the last couple of weeks with US equity markets posting significant losses on Thursday and Friday as things heated up. The message over the weekend though was far less confrontational and suggested the US would be open to scrapping the tariffs in exchange for certain other concessions such as reduced tariffs on important cars. Ultimately, Trump’s target was and remains to reduce the county’s sizeable trade deficit with a number of countries and while he may give the impression that a trade war is a worthwhile sacrifice, I’m not sure he’s as keen on it as he makes out. The question now is how big a concession other countries are willing to make to appease him, if any, and whether it will be sufficient enough for him to sell it to US voters as a worthwhile victory. Given the reaction we’ve seen in markets over the last couple of week’s I don’t think he’ll be keen to follow through on his threats and risk sending markets into a tailspin. European markets continue to gain ground. With the Dow Jones Industrial Average expected to open around 170 points higher, the FTSE 100 is now up 140 points or 2%, Germany’s Dax is 2.01% higher and France’s Cac has climbed 1.5%. As far as the FTSE 100 goes, the rise comes after four straight declines and marks the biggest one day rise for nearly a year (since 24 April 2017). The outlook for the eurozone economy could well become less benign over the summer as uncertainty impacts sentiment, says Bert Colijn, senior eurozone economist at ING Bank. And there is little in the latest confidence survey which will please the European Central Bank, he says: This drop in the eurozone sentiment indicator from 114.2 to 112.6 rounds out the second month of disappointing survey data for the Eurozone. While the economy continues to perform strongly, some clouds have reemerged on the horizon. Trade war concerns take centre stage and are adding uncertainty to the outlook for businesses and impacting the view on the general economic situation for consumers. Both manufacturers and the service sector experienced declining sentiment. Consumer confidence was unchanged after a large drop in February as lower expectations for inflation offset a weaker view on the economy and household finances. Last month, the drop was mainly due to a decline in expectations from manufacturers and consumers. The developments in recent production, new orders and exports were only slightly negative. This month, we see indicators for recent production and new orders have come down somewhat more. Even though still at elevated levels of activity, this does signal that some moderation of growth seems to be under way. On the bright side, employment expectations in services continue to improve despite uncertainty about global growth, meaning that the job market is likely to stand firm in the months ahead which should limit the downside to consumption growth as well. Export orders books only dropped from 2.5 to 2, indicating that the main channel through which trade concerns impact the economy for the moment is confidence and not yet trade itself. The inflation outlook came down in March as both consumers and businesses in manufacturing and services saw selling price expectations decrease. As pipeline price pressures seem to level off a bit and the economic outlook is coming down from cloud nine, there is not much in this survey that will please the ECB. Expect continued dovish talk as the summer and decision on QE approaches. European businesses have become more downbeat, according to the latest snapshot of economic sentiment. The European Commission’s index for the eurozone fell to 112.6 in March from 114.2 in the previous month, below estimates of a level of 113.4. There was decline optimism among the manufacturing, service and retail sectors, but the construction sector showed a small improvement. But consumer sentiment was unchanged from February to March. In the EU as a whole, the index fell by 1.9 points to 112.5, partly due to a sharp drop in the UK. The Commission said: The marginally stronger decrease of the headline indicator for the EU (-1.9) was mainly due to the marked deterioration of sentiment in the largest non-euro area EU economies, the UK (-4.2), and Poland (-2.0). In line with the euro area, confidence deteriorated strongly in industry, services, and retail trade, while it increased slightly in the construction sector and remained unchanged among consumers. Back with GKN and the hostile bid from Melrose, union Unite has repeated its opposition to the proposed takeover. In a letter to GKN shareholders it lists a number of reasons why: A Melrose takeover has the potential to severely damage GKN’s customer base The timescales required in the aerospace and automotive industries is not compatible with Melrose’s approach Melrose does not have the skills or experience needed to make this bid a success Melrose’s plans for splitting the company will weaken its future prospects Increase in debt will increase risk Role of short-term investors in the takeover process - their support for the bid is motivated by a desire to make a short-term profit through arbitrage GKN stakeholders united in opposition to Melrose’s bid - Concern has been expressed by the company’s customers, its trade unions, its pension fund trustees, politicians and a growing number of long-term shareholders. The union concludes: We do not believe this bid is in the long-term interest of GKN and are concerned that it would jeopardise the company’s future. The choice facing investors is between a long-term future for GKN or a short-term, high-risk approach from Melrose. We therefore ask you not to accept Melrose’s offer. So far it seems there may not be any profit taking when Wall Street opens later, despite Monday’s near 700 point surge on the Dow Jones Industrial Average. The futures are pointing to a 100 point plus rise on the Dow in early trading, which should continue to give some support to European markets. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: US markets look set to build on yesterday’s gains despite their biggest one day gain in over 2 years, as trade concerns move further into the background. Shares in focus are likely to include Facebook which, despite dropping below $150 for the first time since July last year, still managed to close higher on the day. Ahead of Thursday’s deadline for GKN investors to decide whether to accept the hostile £7.9bn bid from turnaround specialist Melrose or back the board, comes the daily update on the battle. This time Melrose has made some commitments to try and keep interested parties - not least the UK government - happy. Reuters has the details: Melrose on Tuesday pledged to own the Aerospace division of its bid target GKN for at least five years and to increase funding in apprenticeships and R&amp;D in a last-ditch bid to win government backing for its hostile takeover. In one of Britain’s most hotly contested corporate battles for years, shareholders have until 1pm BST on Thursday to accept the hostile bid from turnaround specialist Melrose or GKN’s plan to split off its auto unit and combine it with US group Dana, leaving GKN focused on Aerospace. Some politicians have objected to Melrose buying GKN because they fear it could break up the mainstay of Britain’s engineering sector and sell it on to foreign buyers. On Tuesday Melrose said it would keep the Aerospace unit until April 2023. Melrose said it reserved the right to list the Aerospace division on the stock market however and added that were it to be approached by a strategic buyer in that time, it would seek the approval of the government to sell. The group said it would also pump a further £10m into the company over five years to support the creation of between 100 and 150 new apprenticeships in engineering, technology and science, a key area of focus for the government which is promoting an industrial strategy as it leaves the EU. It has also committed to spend at least 2.2 percent of sales on research and development, saying this figure should be seen as a “floor, not a ceiling on our ambitions”. More downbeat news from the high street. Fashion retailer H&amp;M has reported a 61% fall in first quarter profits and said higher inventories would lead to increased markdowns in the second three months of the year. The Swedish company had already warned in February that weak demand would hit its earnings. Elsewhere Game Digital said half year revenues rose from £498m to £517m but profits fell 25.5% from £16.5m to £12.3m. It said it would continue to negotiate property savings, close stores and rationalise retail working hours, but looked forward to a large number of new software releases, especially in the final quarter of this year. And Moss Bros confirmed last week’s warning by unveiling a 6.1% fall in annual profits to £6.7m, hit by stock shortages and a tough retail environment. Richard Hunter, head of markets at interactive investor, said: Last week’s profit warning may have taken some of the sting out of the situation, but Moss Bros is already facing an uphill struggle for the remainder of its trading year. After the rise on Wall Street and Asia as trade tensions between the US and China ease, European markets have followed suit. The FTSE 100 is up 90 points or 1.3%, Germany’s Dax has opened up 1.8%, France’s Cac has climbed 1.35% and Italy’s FTSE MIB is 1.48% better. The only faller in the UK’s leading index is drinks giant Diageo, down marginally after it announced that the appointment of Ursula Burns to its board - due on 2 April - would be delayed following news she would be made interim executive chair of Nasdaq listed Veon. Another factor for the renewed buoyancy in stock markets comes from North Korea, says Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at ThinkMarkets : Investors have reacted positively to the surprise visit of North Korea’s leader Kim Jong Un to China. This is his first trip outside his country since he became the leader of his country. Traders are considering this event as a further evidence of de-escalation of tensions in the Asia region. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. A surge on Wall Street has lifted Asian markets and is expected to do the same for European shares, as investors become increasingly convinced the US and China can resolve their trade issues. After last week’s rout in the wake of President Trump announcing $60bn of tariffs on Chinese imports to the US, on top of his steel and aluminium sanctions, signs that the two sides were talking has led to a market revival. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: The rebound in the US [came] as China moved to assuage US concerns about its trade policies by pledging to open up its markets to external companies. Chinese officials also pledged to overhaul protection for intellectual property rights. There was also an offer to buy more US semiconductors, as well as offering to finalise rules that would allow foreign financial firms to take stakes in Chinese securities companies, along with talk of lowering the tariff that is levied on US car imports of 25% These concessions while fairly modest would allow the US administration to claim progress on changing the status quo where trade is concerned and could pave the way for further discussions further down the line. So the Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 2.81% or 669 points - the third highest points gain ever and its best percentage gain for nearly two and a half years. Although to put that in context, the percentage rise was less than the 2.93% slump recorded on Thursday after Trump unveiled the Chinese move. Nevertheless, the revival on Wall Street has pushed Asian shares higher, with the Nikkei 225 up 2.3% and the Hang Seng around 0.9% better. European shares missed out on the gains yesterday, partly on concerns about a slowdown in the region’s economy, said Hewson, with the US tax reforms which helped support Wall Street before the tariff shenanigans unlikely to give much of a lift to European companies. But they are expected to benefit in early trading, with the FTSE 100 expected to open around 80 points higher, Germany’s Dax up 170 points and France’s Cac around 60 points. Elsewhere it is another fairly quiet day on the economic front, apart from eurozone and consumer confidence figures and a US manufacturing survey. On the corporate front, GlaxoSmithKline is planning a review of its Horlicks business as part of a deal to buy out Novartis’ 36.5% stake in their Consumer Healthcare Joint Venture for $13bn. And one of the founders of Superdry, Julian Dunkerton is leaving the retailer on Saturday to “devote more time to his other business and charitable interests.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/live/2018/mar/28/colombia-v-australia-world-cup-warm-up-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-27T21:07:23Z","webTitle":"Colombia 0-0 Australia: World Cup warm-up – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2018/mar/28/colombia-v-australia-world-cup-warm-up-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/live/2018/mar/28/colombia-v-australia-world-cup-warm-up-live","fields":{"headline":"Colombia 0-0 Australia: World Cup warm-up – as it happened","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Here’s John Davidson’s match report. Thanks for reading. So much better from Australia, they looked a team compared with the rabble in Oslo. Much cleaner in possession, aggressive in midfield and some encouraging individual performances that raise a few selections questions (eg does it work better without Mooy? Is Josh Risdon the right-back? Is Mat Ryan’s spot safe?). Far from the finished article, but with Sainsbury and Jurman to come back, the signs are a whole lot brighter than a few days ago. Colombia will be disappointed not to have put away a theoretically much inferior team. They came on strong in the second half, Borja made and missed a hatful of chances after coming on for Falcao, but anyone backing them as a dark horse for Russia will probably be thinking again after watching that. Dramatic rearguard action in the last 10 minutes, but Australia will take an enormous amount from that result. 92 mins: Borja against the post again! Moreno swings in a great free-kick, and Borja gets a left foot on it, but can only find the same post again. Unlucky. 90 mins: Irvine comes on for Luongo, who has been outstanding. 89 mins: Three minutes of added time. 88 mins: Chaos in the box! Bodies everywhere as Colombia attack from the right, but Australia scramble it away for a corner. They are hanging on. 86 mins: Great save Vukovic! He was a bit unlucky to concede the pen, a little touch from Degenek taking the ball into a difficult area, but that save will give him a huge lift. Not the worst penalty you’ve ever seen, he got down low with a strong left hand. Vukovic goes left and beats away Borja’s effort! 84 mins: Vukovic brings down Borja as he chases a long ball. 82 mins: Yimmi Chara, another sub, looks good down the right, but his cross is way too high for Borja. Or anyone less than 3m tall. 81 mins: James Troisi is on for Rogic. And James is going off, replaced by Moreno. 80 mins: Against the post! Borja again! He has been a handful. Rose in the middle of the box and looped a header against the right-hand post with Vukovic stranded. 77 mins: James slips and bunts it straight into the wall. 76 mins: Milligan fouls Borja on the edge of the box, and this is dangerous. James? 72 mins: Kruse for Nabbout. Can’t say Nabbout has been too prominent, but he’s an option at least. Certainly happier out wide than in the middle, as he was against Norway. 71 mins: Robbie Kruse is imminent. Unless he just likes wearing a singlet on a cold night. 68 mins: Luongo almost scores a wonderful goal, weaving through the defence with lightning feet, but he can’t get his shot away from Ospina! He is class when he’s on. Borja’s disallowed goal. 64 mins: Colombia have raised the tempo here and definitely look the more likely scorers. Socceroos getting stretched. 63 mins: Amazing miss by Borja! Brilliant cross from the left and he steams in on the six-yard box and heads wide with the goal gaping. Australia were opening right up there. 62 mins: Cahill is on for Juric. 61 mins: Vukovic! Bacca gets away from Risdon down the left and crosses for James, whose header is beaten away by the debutant. He’ll feel good for that. 60 mins: Mina goes up against Leckie in one of those childish not-quite-headbutting displays. Some feeling in this game – Leckie is annoying everyone. 58 mins: Rogic free-kick into a good area is put behind by Mina for a corner, with no Socceroos nearby. From the corner Leckie has a decent chance but his header is ... not good. 57 mins: Another bad loss of possession, this time by Milligan, gives James a sight of goal, but he shoots comfortably over. 55 mins: Now Borja misses a glaring chance after being put through by a more direct ball, though he’s given offside again. 54 mins: Disallowed goal! Borja sticks it away brilliantly but Bacca, who crossed from the left, was offside. That all came from a bad giveaway by Jedinak. 50 mins: Murillo in some trouble after going down with what looks like a hamstring. He’s going to be replaced by Yerry Mina, the young Barcelona defender. 48 mins: Borja gets in a tangle with Degenek and Behich near the goalline and reacts angrily. Bobby Madley calms it down. Corner to Colombia leads to a chance for Borja to put in an acrobatic overhead that goes just over the bar! 47 mins: Good try Nabbout! Lovely work from Rogic again sets up the Jets man but his shot goes wide. 45 mins: Australia win a corner after Juric’s neat flick nearly lets in Rogic. Luongo’s delivery is not great this time. Danny Vukovic is on for his international debut, on his birthday. No other changes for Australia, but Colombia are bringing on Borja and Lerma for Falcao and Aguilar. Can’t argue with this: Andy Harper makes the point that Australia do much better against a team that wants to keep the ball, but struggle so badly against a more direct approach, regardless of quality. They can probably safely assume Colombia won’t resort to lumping it forward today. Australia will be hugely encouraged by that half. Without creating many chances they have looked much brighter than against Norway. James and Falcao have been quiet for the most part, with all Colombia’s best moments coming through Mojica on the left. But all square is a fair reflection so far. 42 mins: Great ball releases Mojica yet again, but his cross is cleared by Degenek and at the end of an Australian counter Juric has a strong effort from a tight angle that goes just wide. Good effort! 41 mins: Rogic finds Juric in the middle, who tries to release Leckie, but it’s too far and Ospina collects. 39 mins: Space opens up for James, but his right-foot shot is easily covered by Jones. 37 mins: Luongo is showing something that Mooy and certainly Jedinak don’t have, the ability to go past people and open up defences with a dribble rather than a pass. Promising stuff from him. 36 mins: Australia’s best passage so far, involving Luongo and Behich, ends in a corner. Great delivery and Leckie can’t keep his header down! 33 min: James puts it wide after a good cross from Mojica, then blasts the ball back into the crowd in frustration and gets a bake from his own fans for it. 32 min: Free kick for Australia on the left after Uribe brings down Luongo. Luongo swings it in, but Colombia clear. 30 min: Tomi Juric takes a head knock, and that means Tim Cahill gets a run up the touchline. But he looks OK. 28 min: The decibels go up as James stands over a free kick, but he sweeps it wide for Mojica on the left, whose dangerous looking cross is put behind for a goal kick. 27 min: Leckie bites in on Mojica again. He’s not making himself popular with the Colombian fans. 24 mins: Chance for Bacca as the ball bounces around in the area, but Australia clear comfortably enough in the end. 20 min: Leckie penalised for a foul on Barrios. Not much end product so far, but Leckie is already a lot busier than against Norway. 18 min: Good pressure from the Socceroos after Ospina makes a bit of a meal of a high ball. Much more positive signs here. 16 min: Behich makes great ground down the left, and when his cross is cleared poorly Luongo’s feeble shot is deflected wide. Nothing from the corner. Good moment for Behich though. 14 min: Lovely play from Luongo in midfield eventually comes to nothing. Losing Mooy at least gives him the chance to stake his claim and so far he’s looked bright in moments. 11 min: Falcao released down the right into a dangerous space, but he can’t pull his cross back far enough to elude Jones, who falls on it gratefully. How nervous must Jones be - hasn’t played for the national team since that Ecuador game. 8 min: Degenek gives it away and Leckie does well to close down Mojica on the left. 6 min: James tries to release Carlos Bacca with a long ball, but it’s overhit. James was everywhere against France, it’s hard to imagine the Socceroos keeping him quiet all night. 5 min: Colombia inches away! Uribe beats Brad Jones to the header after a cross from James on the right, but puts it just past the post. That should have been the opener. 4 min: Very quiet opening, and Australia will not mind that at all. A really healthy crowd in at a chilly Craven Cottage, and we’re off. The last time Australia played South American opposition at Craven Cottage and switched their goalkeepers, in March 2014, they went 3-0 up against Ecuador, but ended up losing 4-3. Pretty sure they would settle for that again. Van Marwijk was just asked why he’d kept Milligan and Degenek at the centre of the defence after their very uncertain performance against Norway. “We don’t have a lot of possibilities.” Colombia have also shuffled five from the game against France, but James Rodriguez and Radamel Falcao both start. So Australia without Aaron Mooy, who has a minor injury, that’s a big blow. They show five changes from the team that started against Norway, with Brad Jones in goal (Danny Vukovic will come on later). That means a start for Mass Luongo, and Josh Risdon, Tomi Juric and Tom Rogic all come in, replacing Bailey Wright, Dimi Petratos and Jackson Irvine. (It’s not a piano accordion, more of a giant cheese grater. Anyway.) Luckily the Colombian fans haven’t forgotten the piano accordion. Some team news: Why are Australia playing Colombia? Because Peru are in their World Cup group, and Colombia is very near Peru, just as Norway is around the corner from Denmark, also in the group. Michael Cox of zonalmarking.net has a handy run-down of how many other countries subscribe to this barely scientific theory of preparation. Colombia face Poland, Senegal and Japan in Russia, so geographically this game will be all but useless for them. Australia have been looking on the bright side since their really terrible 4-1 defeat against Norway on Friday. “Sometimes these losses can be beneficial,” said new coach Bert van Marwijk. Striker Tomi Juric believed there were “some positives to take out of it”. And Jackson Irvine said: “The good news is it can only get better.” Unfortunately, none of these things is really true. Few teams look better equipped to inflict further pain on the Socceroos than Colombia, after their highly impressive 3-2 win against France in Paris on the same day. The contrast could hardly be greater. Few current international coaches have been in place as long as José Pékerman – the Argentine was appointed in 2012 – and he oversees a stable team, full of confidence. Van Marwijk goes into his second game in charge trying to engineer a rapid transition in style with a shell-shocked squad. With only two more friendlies to come before the World Cup, he needs to show immediate improvement. Van Marwijk has talked about how both players and coaches need pressure to perform. He’s got it.

The visit, which would be Kim’s first to China since taking power in 2011, comes before historic meetings with his counterparts in South Korea and the US, expected to take place later this year. A “special train” carrying a high-level Korean official had been spotted in the north-eastern Chinese border city of Dandong, Japan’s Kyodo News reported. According to footage captured by Japan’s Nippon TV, a distinctive olive green train with yellow stripes – similar to that used by Kim’s father, Kim Jong-il, when he visited China in 2011 – arrived in Beijing on Monday. Citing three sources close to the matter, Bloomberg said on Monday that the North Korean leader was in the Chinese capital. On Tuesday, a heavily guarded motorcade was seen in the centre of Beijing, while police blocked off streets around the main railway station. The green train believed to be carrying Kim left Beijing on Tuesday afternoon, according to reports. Hua Chunying, a spokeswoman for China’s ministry of foreign affairs, said in a briefing on Tuesday that she was “not aware of any information” regarding a visiting dignitary from North Korea. Asked about the train and the large motorcade, Hua said: “At present, I really have no information on that.” Online search terms for North Korea, as well as nicknames for Kim including “Kim fatty the third”, were blocked on the Chinese microblogging site Weibo this week. After years of provocations and missile tests, Pyongyang has made an unexpected diplomatic effort recently. Kim is expected to meet with the South Korean president, Moon Jae-in, in April and to hold a summit with the US president, Donald Trump, in May. Relations between North Korea and China, long-time communist allies, have been strained as Beijing has supported international sanctions against Pyongyang over its nuclear programme. Since taking over from his father more than six years ago, Kim had not been invited to Beijing nor had he met the Chinese president, Xi Jinping. Adam Cathcart, a lecturer in history at the University of Leeds who researches Chinese-North Korean relations, said travelling by train has been a feature of North Korean propaganda. “The key detail does appear to be the train. If it were the foreign minister or Kim Yong-nam [North Korea’s nominal head of state] they would simply fly in from Pyongyang,” said Cathcart. Kim Il-sung, Kim Jong-un’s grandfather and the country’s first leader after its establishment in 1948, arrived in China by train for his first visit to the country in 1982. Kim Jong-il’s mausoleum in Pyongyang includes a map of all the former leader’s foreign travels by train as well as a train car. His 2011 train journey to China was also commemorated at an ice sculpture festival held in North Korea’s Samjiyon county in February. Kim Jong-il reportedly had six private luxury trains that he used within North Korea, stopping at the 20 stations built exclusively for him, according to the South Korean newspaper the Chosun Ilbo in 2009. He also travelled by train on his rare visits abroad to China, Russia, and eastern Europe. Kim Jong-un probably uses one of his father’s trains. According to Chosun Ilbo, they are protected by armour plates and equipped with satellite phones, flatscreen televisions, conference rooms, bedrooms and reception halls. The trains typically travel at no more than 37mph (60km/h). “All the details about this trip are almost the same as those during Kim Jong-il’s visit,” said Cheng Xiaohe, an associate professor at Renmin University’s school of international studies in Beijing. “First, they both took a green train. Second, both visits were sudden, without information ahead of time. Third, it’s always Japanese media who first discover and report [the news]. From all these details I think it is Kim Jong-un this time.” Additional reporting by Wang Xueying."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/mar/27/dutton-should-prioritise-refugees-on-nauru-not-white-south-africans-unhcr-says","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-27T02:37:25Z","webTitle":"Dutton should prioritise refugees on Nauru, not white South Africans, UNHCR says","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/mar/27/dutton-should-prioritise-refugees-on-nauru-not-white-south-africans-unhcr-says","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/mar/27/dutton-should-prioritise-refugees-on-nauru-not-white-south-africans-unhcr-says","fields":{"headline":"Dutton should prioritise refugees on Nauru, not white South Africans, UNHCR says","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The United Nations high commissioner for refugees has rejected Peter Dutton’s suggestion that white South African farmers should receive “special attention” for migration to Australia. At a press conference in Canberra to warn of the “devastating” impact of detention on children, the UNHCR director for Asia and the Pacific, Indrika Ratwatte, said refugees on Nauru should be prioritised and quotas should not be spent on any decision to open migration to South African farmers. On Tuesday seven backbench MPs raised the plight of white South African farmers in the Coalition party room, and the response from Dutton confirmed Australia could issue humanitarian visas even if they didn’t qualify as refugees. Ratwatte has returned from an inspection of facilities on Nauru, making him the most senior UNHCR official to witness Australia’s offshore processing facilities first-hand. On Tuesday Ratwatte described the mental health of people he saw as “very, very shocking” and said the growing trend to self-harm and children as young as 10 attempting suicide was “symptomatic of the despair and hopelessness prevailing there”. He noted that 40 children on Nauru had spent their entire lives in detention and another 60 had spent half their lives, four years or more, in detention. Ratwatte warned that keeping refugees on Nauru was leading to family separation, citing the example of a 14-year-old girl on Nauru separated from her mother and siblings receiving medical attention in Australia. “This little girl was in a catatonic state – she hasn’t gotten out of her room in months – who has not taken a shower and is in a state of complete stress and trauma.” He said that while it was encouraging the United States is taking a “significant number” of refugees, there will still be 1,000 refugees in need of resettlement solutions to leave detention. In recent weeks the home affairs minister, Peter Dutton, and the former prime minister Tony Abbott have called for white South African farmers to receive “special attention” due to alleged elevated rates of violence against them associated with possible land redistribution. Ratwatte responded: “The decision of the government to open its migration pathways to different categories of people is a sovereign decision but from the UNHCR perspective we do encourage that resettlement opportunities that are for refugees and humanitarian quotas, that are for deserving cases, should not be impacted by these decisions on migration. “[Places] should be preserved for those who are truly vulnerable and in need of protection and a solution.” Seven backbench MPs – including Andrew Hastie, Andrew Laming, Craig Kelly, Jim Molan and Luke Howarth – raised the issue in the party room, warning of high rates of violence in South Africa and defending Dutton against charges of racism. Concerns were expressed white South African farmers may not qualify as refugees, even if they left South Africa, because of the possibility they could move to cities in country and be free of persecution. But the party room was assured Australia could still grant humanitarian visas. Applications, including from referrals in Australia, will be considered. Asked if the people on Nauru were more deserving, Ratwatte said the “facts speak for themselves” and it was self-evident from the trauma and vulnerability of those on Nauru – more than 80% of who have been assessed as refugees – that they are deserving of “prioritised solutions”. Ratwatte refuted claims that refugees and asylum seekers engaged in self-harm to transfer to Australia, saying it was “not the case”. “Nobody should be in a position to seek such dire recourse – for children in particular, swallowing razors and taking medication overdoses is not what this is all about. They should have safety and protection.” He noted the Australian government’s position that offshore detention was needed to prevent deaths at sea but said it had a responsibility to ensure the policy “does not lead to individuals eventually being harmed on land”. Malcolm Turnbull has so far refused New Zealand’s offer to accept 150 refugees from Manus Island although he has suggested it could be considered after the US resettlement deal. After Dutton’s comments, several Turnbull government ministers including Julie Bishop and Mathias Cormann have publicly stressed the non-discriminatory nature of the humanitarian visa program. Despite the apparent contradiction, Bishop told the party room stressed the consistency of her stance with Dutton’s because both agree that South Africans would qualify under existing humanitarian visa rules."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/mar/28/waternsw-boss-told-cotton-grower-of-bid-to-keep-his-usage-data-from-being-released","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-27T17:00:22Z","webTitle":"WaterNSW boss told cotton grower of bid to keep his usage data from being released","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/mar/28/waternsw-boss-told-cotton-grower-of-bid-to-keep-his-usage-data-from-being-released","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/mar/28/waternsw-boss-told-cotton-grower-of-bid-to-keep-his-usage-data-from-being-released","fields":{"headline":"WaterNSW boss told cotton grower of bid to keep his usage data from being released","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The head of WaterNSW wrote to a cotton grower saying he was exploring an exemption from the state’s freedom of information laws so it would not be required to release water usage records in future. In a letter that has come to light during proceedings seeking the release of grower Peter Harris’s water usage data, department head David Harris (no relation) wrote that he was “sympathetic with the submissions” Peter Harris had made about protecting his water usage data. The New South Wales Environmental Defenders’ Office (EDO) had sought its release. “As a consequence WaterNSW is actively exploring how waterholders’ information can be further protected, including through amendments to the Government Information Public Access Act,” he wrote in a letter dated 10 November 2017. The proposal to keep such information secret flies in the face of recommendations by an independent inquiry headed by Ken Matthews, who was commissioned to urgently investigate the culture and performance of NSW’s water bureaucracy. He concluded that “a systemic fix” was required and that key to that change was more transparency and independence. “Accordingly, changes proposed include enabling the public to readily access from a single source all details of individuals’ water entitlements, licence conditions, meter readings, water account balances and trading activities,” Matthews wrote in his report. A spokesman for WaterNSW said the agency was on record supporting the Matthews’ report recommendations in the same way as the minister for regional water. He said the agency “supported the provision of water resource information to the public” but “considered it appropriate that the current public consultation process include discussion on whether Matthews’ recommendation should be extended to include the public release of information on individuals’ positions in the private water-trading market”. WaterNSW has since announced it is prosecuting Peter and Jane Harris for illegally taking water from the Barwon Darling, eight months after the allegations were originally aired in July 2017 by Four Corners. But WaterNSW has inspected the Harris property and another facing water theft allegations just once. According to answers provided to NSW parliament last week, the two properties of the two people charged with water theft this month were visited once – in the immediate aftermath of Four Corners. Rumleigh, owned by the Harris family, was inspected on 18 August last year. Burren Downs, owned by the Barlow family, who are also being prosecuted, was inspected on 2 August 2017. WaterNSW said it had “scheduled a site visit in the near future” to each property. “WaterNSW conducts routine compliance inspections across regional NSW, including in the Barwon-Darling. WaterNSW will not make comment on matters currently before the court,” the spokesman said. The opposition’s water spokesman, Chris Minns, said this was further proof the NSW government could not be trusted to conduct compliance and enforcement when it came to serious allegations of water theft. “When will the leadership of this department stop the soft-touch enforcement and start protecting these precious rivers and waterways?” Peter Harris has said he will vigorously defend himself against the allegations. Anthony Barlow has previously told the ABC he believed he had secured permission to take water. The EDO has been separately pursuing a civil case against Peter Harris, demanding he return more than 5bn litres of water he is alleged to have illegally taken from the Barwon-Darling river. EDO is also embroiled in a case before the NSW Civil and Administrative Tribunal (Ncat) over release of Peter Harris’s water usage data. While WaterNSW agreed to the release of the data, it is being resisted by Peter Harris who was consulted as a third party, as he is entitled to be. The state’s water administration is also under investigation by the NSW ombudsman, which has been highly critical of WaterNSW’s record of enforcing the water laws. Earlier this month it issued a stinging report after WaterNSW provided inaccurate figures about its record in taking prosecutions."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"news/datablog/ng-interactive/2018/mar/27/how-socio-economic-disadvantage-varies-area-by-area-in-australia","type":"interactive","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-27T02:08:07Z","webTitle":"How socioeconomic disadvantage varies area-by-area in Australia","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/ng-interactive/2018/mar/27/how-socio-economic-disadvantage-varies-area-by-area-in-australia","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/datablog/ng-interactive/2018/mar/27/how-socio-economic-disadvantage-varies-area-by-area-in-australia","fields":{"headline":"How socioeconomic disadvantage varies area-by-area in Australia","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The Index of Relative Socioeconomic Advantage and Disadvantage (Irsad) is a measure based on census data that summarises the economic and social conditions of people and households within an area.

A wave of expulsions of suspected Russian intelligence agents has taken place across the world as allies backed the UK over the Salisbury poisoning. Theresa May welcomed what she called “the largest collective expulsion of Russian intelligence officers in history” after more than 100 Russian diplomats alleged to be spies in western countries were told to return to Moscow. May has told the Commons that Yulia and Sergei Skripal’s critical condition is unlikely to change in the near future and they may never recover. More than 130 people might have been exposed to the novichok nerve against used against the Skripals, May said. Australia has become the latest country to join the campaign, giving two Russian diplomats seven days to leave. In a moment of reckoning for the Kremlin, the US is throwing out 60 Russian officials including a dozen based at the UN and has ordered Moscow to close its west-coast consulate, in Seattle. Germany, France and Poland are each to expel four agents, Ukraine is to expel 13, while Canada is expelling four and will deny an application for three more diplomatic posts. Other countries joining in have included Lithuania, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Italy, the Netherlands, Estonia, Latvia, Croatia, Finland, Hungary, Sweden, Romania, Albania and Macedonia. Iceland has announced it will not send officials to the World Cup. Our diplomatic editor, Patrick Wintour, says the Salisbury attack “may be the moment when the west collectively decided it was time to warn that Russia’s ‘disruption as usual’ had to come to an end”. New Zealand’s prime minister, meanwhile, announced that the government couldn’t find any Russian spies to expel, though it did summon the ambassador and make its “serious concern” known to Moscow. * * * London has fallen – House prices have continued to drop in London, according to Hometrack. Values fell by 5% in almost half of postcodes in the capital, and by up to 8% in the central City of London – there were also falling values in suburban areas such as Harrow, Kingston upon Thames and Elmbridge. It seems well overdue: staggeringly, since 2009 there has been an 89% rise in property prices across London, putting home ownership out of reach for most. Still, in the capital as a whole, annual prices rose by £5,000 in January to take the value of a home to £486,000, while average house prices dropped in the north-east of England by £7,000 to stand at £123,000. Cities such as Edinburgh, Liverpool and Manchester have been registering house price growth in excess of 7% per year. * * * ‘We just want leadership’ – An antisemitism row continues to swirl around Jeremy Corbyn and Labour, with the party today accused of ignoring a complaint about the leader appearing to endorse antisemitic material. Rafael Behr writes that from antisemitism, to Russia, to Brexit, Labour centrists must be starting to feel that Corbyn’s version of the party is not for them. Might Corbyn’s behaviour precipitate a Labour split? The example of the Social Democratic party, founded 37 years ago this week, is telling, Behr writes. “It might be very hard to convert a Corbynised party into something else, but that doesn’t mean it would be any easier starting again from scratch.” * * * Kim possible – North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un, may have turned up in China for an “unannounced state visit”, according to reports. Hotels along the route of a North Korean train’s journey into China were closed to bookings to avoid scrutiny, while security was tightened in Beijing and a North Korean embassy car made its way to the Great Hall of the People where foreign dignitaries are often hosted. The intriguing development comes as Kim Jong-un tries to remodel himself in short order from nuclear rogue to international peacemaker. Kim is preparing to meet South Korea’s President Moon and, if all goes to plan, Donald Trump, which is why Beijing might have summoned him. “China won’t be at any of those meetings... so I think they feel they’ve got to get back in the game,” said one expert. * * * So how does it taste? Nestle says it has cut the sugar in a chocolate bar by 30% by spraying it into warm air while mixed with milk and water. The “structured sugar” dissolves faster in the mouth, says the confectionery company, delivering a sweeter taste. Public Health England wants food makers to cut out 20% of sugar over the next two years. It will issue a report soon to show whether food manufacturers have made any progress. A sugary drinks levy comes in on 6 April. * * * Can that fell to Earth – China’s broken Tiangong-1 space station is still falling from the sky, and there is still nothing you can do about it. There are even predictions it might come down on April Fool’s day. Science writer Michael Slezak traces the spacecraft’s doomed path and assesses the likelihood of it hitting and hurting anyone. * * * One good intern – A former intern is starting legal action against the magazine publisher Monocle after her experience working there for £30 a day. Amalia Illgner says it was her dream to work at the chic monthly but the experience was soured when she filed a big story and realised that “everyone else … the fact-checker who was emailing me, the subeditor, the features editor, the photographer … was being paid to work on this story. I had taken home £150 for the week, and my byline had a monetary value of zero.” It is a story, she says, repeated all over the arts, media and politics in the UK where interns are churned through but end up receiving little or no money, and no job at the end. Illgner is pushing for all interns to be paid the national minimum wage. Lunchtime read: Dash of Tabasco to save its home The centuries-old home of the famed fiery condiment is under threat from the seas encroaching on Avery Island. The McIlhenny company of Tabasco fame has the money to do something about it – building levees, installing pumps, replanting wetlands. But, writes Oliver Milman, elsewhere along the coast of Louisiana a manmade calamity is unfolding at the rate of a football field of land lost to the water ever 100 minutes. The lower reaches of the Mississippi river have been too aggressively channelled via levees and other barriers, while wetlands have been drained or cut apart for farming, logging and oil and gas drilling. The marshes are dying as a result and the land they hold together dissolving away. “We’ve had 300 years of bad decisions,” said David Muth of the National Wildlife Federation. Another land loss expert puts it more bluntly: “I hate to use the words ‘written off’, but those coastal communities are on their own.” Sport Australian players, including captain Steve Smith, and coaching staff were waiting to hear their fate as Cricket Australia chief James Sutherland landed in South Africa before the conclusion of an investigation into the ball tampering scandal that has rocked the sport. Never mind coaches or supremos, writes Matthew Engel – on a cricket field the captain is responsible and there is no easy way out now for Smith. Eddie Jones’s training sessions are likely to come under scrutiny after a report published on Monday revealed that the severity of injuries sustained during England camps in his first full season in charge drastically rose. The European champions, Portugal, suffered a dramatic first-half collapse and had João Cancelo sent off just after the hour in an embarrassing 3-0 World Cup warm-up defeat by the Netherlands. And Zeke Upshaw, a player with the Detroit Pistons’ G-League affiliate The Grand Rapids Drive, has died two days after collapsing during a game. Business Asian shares have risen on news that the US and China might negotiate their way out of a trade war. It set off a rebound earlier on Wall Street, and Asian markets have followed suit with gains across major indices. The pound traded at $1.423 and €1.143 overnight. The papers The expulsion of Russian diplomats by Britain’s allies in the wake of the Salisbury poisoning dominates the front pages today. The Guardian splashes on “Russian diplomats in US and Europe expelled as UK allies turn the screw”, while the Financial Times goes with “Washington takes lead as Britain’s allies expel 100 Russian diplomats.” The Express has the same story under the headline “World unites against Putin”, while the Mirror has the short and sweet: “Putin the pariah”. The Telegraph leads on May’s claim that “We’ve crippled Russia’s spy web”. Away from the fallout from the poisoning, the Times and the Mail lead on antisemitism in the Labour party. The Mail goes protests by the Jewish community, with the headline “Enough is enough, Mr Corbyn”, while the Times has: “Antisemites will destroy Labour, senior MPs warn”.

But ball-tampering is what you’d expect in today’s world","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"So sportsmen cheat. Big deal. Sometimes they get caught. Bad luck. Sometimes they cheat blatantly and are accused of “stupidity”. Australians used to pride themselves on the belligerence of their cricketers, as against the genteel northern hemisphere’s “sportsmanship”. What seems to have hurt most in the latest ball-tampering scandal is not the tampering but the idiocy. From booing terraces to newspaper headlines to the prime minister himself, Australia has risen in horror at the blatancy of their team’s malpractice in South Africa. The history of cheating in sport is as old as quick-drying plaster in boxing gloves. Cycling and athletics have been cursed by drugs. Rugby has its fake blood scam. Football players “dive” to win penalties. Motor racing is a high-octane contest between technicians and inspectors. Cricket is periodically corrupted by match-fixing. Sport was once a leisure activity. Until the 1960s, a line was drawn between amateurs and professionals, with the covert assumption that the former were nobler – and less inclined to cheat – than the latter. What mattered was not to win but how you played the game. Those days are over. “Amateur”, once a term of approbation, is now a term of abuse. Professional means serious, successful and rich. As professional sport gets ever more lucrative, so does the financial – and patriotic – incentive to cheat. As fast as sportsmen and women try to bend the rules, camera surveillance tries to keep up with them. Refereeing has become not an art but a science. Rugby and cricket are interrupted as referees deliberate in front of screens. Even football has now conceded camera replays of fouls and dubious goals. This will render it as stoppage-plagued as American football. Sport has long been a metaphor for life. We are constantly told that rules are made to be broken, whether in high finance, school exams or even democracy. We learned this week that an appearance on a Trump talent show could be offered in exchange for sex. We learned that an election or a referendum could be influenced with fake news. The whole world seems set up as a standing invitation to cheat. To this there is no answer but ever more assiduous regulation. But that involves another cost. If we cannot trust each other – or the referee – in sport any more than in any other field of human endeavour, our faith in the informal bonds of community declines. If we cannot trust a cricketer to obey the rules, how can we trust a politician or a captain of industry? Or perhaps we should just relax a bit, and concentrate on things that matter. The world does not end if a scuffed cricket ball drifts an inch off its predictable line. • Simon Jenkins is a Guardian columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"business/2018/mar/26/embrace-smart-meter-rollout-or-go-bust-big-energy-firms-warned","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-26T12:04:08Z","webTitle":"Embrace smart meter rollout or go bust, big energy firms warned","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/mar/26/embrace-smart-meter-rollout-or-go-bust-big-energy-firms-warned","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/mar/26/embrace-smart-meter-rollout-or-go-bust-big-energy-firms-warned","fields":{"headline":"Embrace smart meter rollout or go bust, big energy firms warned","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The UK’s big six energy companies have been warned that they face going out of business if they drag their heels on the nationwide switch to smart meters. While large energy suppliers publicly support the £11bn government scheme to offer the meters to every home and business by the end of 2020, some are installing them slowly and privately complain of the cost. Sacha Deshmukh, the chief executive of Smart Energy GB, the body behind the Gaz and Leccy adverts, said energy firms must change to survive. “Some legacy companies, of the old large six, have really embraced the fact that the only choice they have for the long term is to embrace this. You can either embrace this or fight it and find your business will be gone in less than five years,” he said. Deshmukh said that the meters would help lower barriers to entry in the energy market and give consumers more choice. Companies such as Tesco and Sky would soon offer energy as part of a bundle of services, he predicted. “Almost anyone who’s in any retail market will have energy as part of their package.” In an interview with the Guardian, Deshmukh admitted the programme had been delayed but disagreed with Lord Teverson’s warning that ministers are “living in la la land” about hitting the 2020 deadline. “Yes it’s been delayed. Now we’re getting back on track,” he said. The causes of those delays – establishing the national communications infrastructure for the meters – were now in the past, he claimed. More than 8m meters have been fitted in homes, and new installations are currently running at 13,000 a day or 400,000 a month. Consumer group Which? has calculated that installers will need to fit 24 meters a minute, 24 hours a day, every day, to meet the 2020 goal. Deshmukh said the installations would peak at 1.2m per month, but would not be drawn on when the industry would reach that rate. He also insisted there are enough installers to fit them all. Unions have raised this as a concern. The first-generation meters that account for almost all the installations so far have also come under fire for going “dumb” after customers switch supplier, a problem which industry chiefs say has tarnished the scheme. But Deshmukh said such interoperability issues were limited, and he was confident they would be fixed by an upgrade this autumn. He also defended the government extending a deadline for fitting the older meters, saying it was “important to keep the pace going”. The government’s spending watchdog is reviewing the economic case for and rollout of smart meters. Smart Energy GB said the rollout costs accounts for £20 of an average £1,1000 bill. Deshmukh said that not only was the economic argument overwhelming, but the meters were essential to bring forward more green energy."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/apr/04/which-legends-boast-the-fewest-appearances-for-their-football-club","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-04T09:00:20Z","webTitle":"Which 'legends' boast the fewest appearances for their football club? | The Knowledge","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/apr/04/which-legends-boast-the-fewest-appearances-for-their-football-club","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/apr/04/which-legends-boast-the-fewest-appearances-for-their-football-club","fields":{"headline":"Which 'legends' boast the fewest appearances for their football club?","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"“Bjorn Tore Kvarme scored for Liverpool Legends against Bayern Munich Legends in a 5-5 draw at Anfield recently.

We need not look very far to get the ball rolling, according to Julian Unkel. “While Tom Starke didn’t play in that specific game, he is part of the FC Bayern Legends. Starke has 12 appearances for Bayern in total, two of them this season, when he came out of retirement due to Manuel Neuer’s injury.” The 37-year-old was even drafted into Bayern’s Champions League squad but did not play. Back to Liverpool, and Rob Davies cannot quite believe why John Durnin – who played only twice, both times in the League Cup for the Anfield club – is a staple part of the Masters team. “God knows how many games he has played for them but he is always in the team every time I see them,” he huffs. Bob Bolder is also a fixture in the aforementioned legends’ team “despite having not made a single appearance for the Reds”, notes Tim Street. Back to the early noughties we go, with Old Trafford in focus. “Surely there can’t be many players with less appearances for the club they represent as a ‘legend’ than Bojan Djordjic,” argues Tom Leonard, among others. “He only ever played two games for Manchester United, only one in the league and never a full 90 minutes. What’s more, he’s actually appeared as a United ‘legend’ on three different occasions, meaning he has appeared in more games for United post-retirement than he ever made in his playing career.” Mike Coxon adds that Danny Webber and Ben Thornley also represented Manchester United Legends v Barcelona last September despite appearing three and nine times respectively for the club. Webber netted twice against Barcelona, with Dion Dublin entering late on too. Patrick O’Brien points out that Dublin made only 12 appearances across two seasons. “Djordjic came on as a sub,” he recalls, “equalling his first-team record of one sub appearance. So, two ‘legends’ with a combined career record in the red shirt of 15 appearances.” Then there’s Peter Beardsley, who turned out for United against Rangers despite chalking up only one appearance against Bournemouth in 1982. Or Alan McLoughlin and Fraser Digby, courtesy of Sean DeLoughry, who both mustered a big fat zero in terms of first-team outings for United. Delving into the archive, we might have already found our winner in the shape of Nick Culkin, brought to these pages by Tom Solan a couple of years ago. The goalkeeper replaced Raimond van der Gouw during injury-time in 1999, meaning his debut lasted all of little over a second. You can catch the cameo at the end of this clip. Elsewhere, Matt Prior volunteers the lesser-spotted Edwin Congo. “I don’t know the reason why, but he’s played (and scored) for Real Madrid Leyendas despite not making a single first-team appearance during his time at the club.” Any more for any more?

Has a home nation ever named a squad where the majority of players were not born within that country? And what’s the highest percentage of any squad of any nation? Algeria had 15 French-born players in their 2014 World Cup squad (65%), but I’m sure there is higher,” muses Sam Waller. In Morocco’s latest squad for their games against Serbia and Uzbekistan, they called up 28 players, with 20 of those being born outside of the country they play for. Eleven of those who were selected are French by birth, while another six were born in the Netherlands, another two are from Spain, while one started life in Canada. Overall this means 71.43% of the squad were not born in the African nation, greater than the Algerians in 2014. It is expected Morocco will be the best represented by players born outside their country to play at the World Cup in Russia. Knowledge archive “While playing his first game for Southampton, Russian full-back Alexei Cherednik was rumoured to have rolled the ball into play instead of the conventional throw-in. If this is true, is it the most extreme case of a professional footballer’s ignorance of the game’s most basic rules?” enquired Will Champion in 2006. We couldn’t find any official confirmation of the Cherednik incident, Will, but we did unearth one report in which it was claimed that Barry Horne was called upon to give the Russian throw-in lessons. Nothing more substantial than that, we’re afraid. “Surely the best example involved that player from Zaire in the 1974 World Cup,” screamed dozens of readers (almost as many as those wondering whether the original questioner really is Coldplay tub-thumper Will Champion) regarding an incident etched firmly in the memory. We’ll leave former England assistant manager Lawrie McMenemy - of all people - to recall exactly what happened, as he rates it his favourite World Cup moment. “I’ll always remember a player called Alunga Mwepu, from Zaire,” explains Lawrie. “He famously stood in the wall when Brazil were given a free-kick from 30 yards out. When the referee blew his whistle, Mwebu ran from the middle of the wall headlong towards the ball and, before the Brazilian [Rivelino] could take the kick, hoofed it as far as he could up the field. First of all everyone was baffled, then helpless with laughter. The ref only gave him a yellow card.” For thousands more questions and answers take a trip through the Knowledge archive Can you help? “In the game between Crystal Palace and Liverpool, on 31 March, five players with double barrelled hyphenated surnames were involved (Fosu-Mensah, Loftus-Cheek, Oxlade-Chamberlain, Alexander-Arnold and Wan-Bissaka).

Some may know me from television, playing such roles as “whore in a helicopter” offering my services to newly elected MPs in Armando Iannucci’s Election Night Armistice, or not starring in Miranda Hart’s Miranda. Or from film, being the one who doesn’t snog Colin Firth, Hugh Grant or Patrick Dempsey in Bridget Jones’s Diary I, II and III. More recently, I got to be crashingly rude to Seinfeld legend Julia Louis-Dreyfus’s vice-president, in the HBO sitcom Veep. This character happened to be from Finland. Veep is part-improvised, so, for research, I cyberstalked Finnish politicians on YouTube and keep a store of pleasing Finnish facts for emergencies. It’s an inexpressible pleasure waiting for precisely the right moment to release the information that Helsinki has a Burger King with a sauna or reference Finnish heavy metal. My character, Minna, is notable for her tendency to tag on an overshare: “Finland tops both the Yale environmental sustainability index and the UN development technological achievement table. Coincidentally, we also lead the world in coffee consumption and use of sex toys.” I became obsessed with the Finnish education system after the 2010 documentary Waiting for Superman highlighted problems with US education. Finland, in contrast, has topped educational tables for more than 20 years. This is interesting to me because Finland also has the most inclusive education system in the world and my son, Olly, has Down’s syndrome. Appropriately supported, kids with Down’s syndrome (DS) do miles better in mainstream education. Olly is in year 8 and loves his school, but it is struggling. Around here, kids with DS end up in special schools by year 9. In Finland less than 2% of disabled children go to special schools, and they got rid of their grammar school equivalents 40 years ago, so the vast majority of Finnish children are learning, playing and growing up together. In Finland, kids don’t fail; instead, teaching adapts. Whether a child needs extra help because there’s trouble at home, Finnish isn’t their first language or they have a disability, teachers will do what it takes to get them learning; 30% of Finland’s children receive some kind of special help during their first nine years of school. There are so many bright and talented disabled children who could shine in mainstream schools with the right support. Yet the current political debate in the UK is moving against inclusion, as if it were an unrealistic ideology that always resulted in lower standards. Finland’s success suggests the opposite. We need an inclusive education system for so many reasons. We need it so kids with additional needs can participate in the cultural and economic activities of the communities in which they live. The Prison Reform Trust reports that 70% of people admitted to prison require mental health support. The impact of excluding kids is huge and long-lasting. We need it for typical kids – because they need to know who their neighbours are. They need to know that humans are a diverse breed but that we can have rewarding relationships. A 2010 study by the US Department of Justice showed that disabled teens between 12 and 15 years old were twice as likely to be victims of violent crime as teens without disabilities. In the UK, disability hate crime against children has increased by 150% between 2014 and 2016. We can do something about this by knowing each other and being known. Children learn so much from each other, not least how to be kind to someone who finds life harder than they do. Lastly we need it because a diverse society is a richer society. I recently met a Finnish mother whose antenatal screening showed that her child had a high probability of being born with Down’s syndrome. “I’ll keep it,” she said. “In Finland we all grow up together, I have friends with Down’s syndrome. Besides,” she added, “Finnish women are strong.” I’ve been an actor 20 years, so it’s rather galling to have to recognise the growing impact documentaries are having on the world. Now I’m working with the Videocamp Film Fund 2018, which launched at the UN on World Down’s Syndrome Day, in partnership with Unicef. It offers one film-maker $400,000 to make a film on the theme of inclusive education. The fund exists to get films that change minds and provoke debate out to the widest possible audience. Access to its catalogue of films is free, so anyone, anywhere in the world can organise a pop-up screening. So far Videocamp has made more than 19,000 screenings possible, and they have been held everywhere from the UN to the Amazon. Stories of inclusion in education need to be brought to life in all their personal, painful, comic, mundane and heartwarming reality. The immense sense of victory after a learning breakthrough, the family hugs and battles at the school gate, the irrepressible joy of getting the giggles with your friends in assembly. If people can see that on the big screen perhaps government policy can begin to shift too. • Sally Phillips is an actor"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"sport/2018/mar/26/joe-root-does-not-suspect-australia-of-ball-tampering-during-ashes-series-cricket-steve-smith","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-26T10:09:45Z","webTitle":"Joe Root does not suspect Australia of ball-tampering during Ashes series","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/mar/26/joe-root-does-not-suspect-australia-of-ball-tampering-during-ashes-series-cricket-steve-smith","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/mar/26/joe-root-does-not-suspect-australia-of-ball-tampering-during-ashes-series-cricket-steve-smith","fields":{"headline":"Joe Root does not suspect Australia of ball-tampering during Ashes series","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Joe Root says he does not suspect Australia of any ball-tampering during the recent Ashes series. The England captain’s remarks, following his side’s defeat against New Zealand in Auckland on Monday, were made after renewed speculation surfaced following the ball-tampering Australia were involved in during their current Test series against South Africa. Root reiterated that he was unaware of any foul play during the Ashes. “Not to my knowledge. I personally wasn’t aware of anything going on throughout that series. I have enough to worry about at the moment‚” he said, before acknowledging, “all this is disappointing for Test cricket and for cricket in general.” Australian captain Steve Smith and his deputy, David Warner, have been stood down following the revelations. Root has always tended to take a different line to Smith over the responsibilities of a captain. During the Ashes series Smith, when challenged about some of the behaviour of his team on the field, would fall back on the line that he had received no complaints from the umpires or the match referee. Therefore the assumption was that all was well. Root is prepared to accept that the captain has a greater obligation than that to ensure the game is played properly. “As captain you’re responsible for how everyone else behaves. I have to look after my own group and make sure I’m happy with how they conduct themselves. But any international player should know the rules. I should not have to back that up. It’s as simple as that. “Every time you go out on the field you know there are a load of cameras. You are under the spotlight. It’s important that you give everything and you do everything to win. But in the right way‚” added Root. In the meantime with the Christchurch Test starting on Friday, Root must address the issues of a lack of consistency among his batsmen and a lack of potency among his bowlers, relatively simple and familiar problems that Smith would love to have right now."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"money/2018/may/07/pool-basement-wealth-super-rich-digging-down-london","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-07T14:43:34Z","webTitle":"'A pool in the basement is a clear marker of wealth': how the super-rich are digging down","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2018/may/07/pool-basement-wealth-super-rich-digging-down-london","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2018/may/07/pool-basement-wealth-super-rich-digging-down-london","fields":{"headline":"'A pool in the basement is a clear marker of wealth': how the super-rich are digging down","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"With its eclectic fusion of Regency and mythological motifs, Havona House stands out amid the stucco-fronted Victorian townhouses in Notting Hill’s Pembridge Villas. The newly built mansion’s mock neoclassical columns and the limestone carvings of Greek deities on the facade reflect the roots of its owner, property investor Costas Diamantopoulos. Stepping inside the 8,600 sq ft (800 sq m) property, which is on the market for £25m, you are confronted by an array of opulent features, including a free-floating stone staircase, hand-blown glass pendants and marble en-suite bathrooms. But the most extraordinary parts of this substantial home, just a short walk from bustling Portobello Road market, lie below ground in a double-level basement, which cost £4m to build. On its first floor is an underground garage, in which up to three cars can be parked via robotic platforms. On the lower floor is a 70ft swimming pool, which is filled by a waterfall that cascades over mirrored panels, with a cinema screen to the left. Mango onyx marble panels line the right-hand wall, with a Turkish bath, sauna, shower and a gym further on the other side. At the far end is a £30,000 plaster sculpture of four dancing figures, based on a painting by Poussin. The artwork also hints at the room’s special feature: at the push of a button, hidden hydraulic legs raise the ceramic-tiled floor to transform the space into a dancefloor. “In four to five minutes you can go from having a pool to a huge area of entertainment,” says Diamantopoulos. This is the second basement development Diamantopoulos has built in London in 10 years. He oversaw a much smaller one in 2008 under his former home in Cheyne Place, opposite the Chelsea Physic Garden, although it, too, has a pool, cinema screen, gym and sauna. This property is also for sale, for a comparatively modest £12m, under the terms of Diamantopoulos’s divorce settlement. But he says his family regularly congregated in the basement when it was their main residence. He would swim in the oval blue-tiled pool, inspired by his childhood memories of the Greek islands, making use of the wave machine, or relax in the sauna, while his older daughter and her friends would use the gym. “If someone has the space and the ability, I would always recommend a basement,” he says. As decadent as they may seem, the features of Diamantopoulos’s basements are typical of many of those built under central London’s most exclusive neighbourhoods in the past decade, according to a new study by Newcastle University’s global urban research unit. The report, Mapping Subterranean London: the Hidden Geography of Residential Basement Developments, found at least 4,650 basements were granted planning permission in Kensington and Chelsea, Westminster, Hammersmith and Fulham, Haringey, Camden, Islington and Wandsworth between 2008 and 2017. According to their planning applications, these schemes boast at least 376 swimming pools, 456 cinemas, 996 gyms, 381 wine stores and cellars, 340 games and recreation rooms, 241 saunas or steam rooms, 115 staff quarters, including bedrooms for nannies and au pairs, 65 garages, 40 libraries, two gun stores, a car museum, a banquet hall and an artificial beach. Roger Burrows, professor of cities at Newcastle University and one of the basements study’s authors, says its findings illustrate the impact of the global super-rich on the UK housing market. The number of UK-based ultra-high-net-worth individuals (UHNWIs) – those with investable assets of at least £21m – has increased by 28% over the past decade, according to estate agents Knight Frank, with the vast bulk – around 4,900 – based in London. After the 2008 financial crash, Burrows notes, prime London property became a popular investment for the international wealthy, as seen in the growing number of luxury tower blocks lining the Thames. At the same time, he says, ultra-rich overseas buyers seeking substantial properties in central London have pushed out “old money” and affluent professionals into lower-income areas, leading to a widespread crisis in housing affordability. “In the last 10 years, we’ve had this very visible change to London’s property market, with all the high rises going up,” Burrows says. “But the replacement of the nearly and merely wealthy by the uber-wealthy isn’t as physically present because a lot of it has been happening underground. These basements are an architectural marker of the transnational elite moving in to London either to live or as an investment.” The vast amount of extra space built under prime London properties contrasts starkly with the shrinking size of newly built homes bought by average families. For example, living rooms are nearly a third smaller than equivalent homes built in the 1970s, falling from 268 sq ft in the 1970s to 184 sq ft in a house built since 2010, according to another recent study. Burrows says: “One cannot but be struck by how the amount of living space different households have available to them differs now. In our research we have come across some basement developments in central London where just the pool, gym and cinema combined are larger than the newbuild rabbit-hutch homes that many people have to put up with.” Nowhere is this more evident than in Kensington and Chelsea, the capital’s richest borough, which has the highest number of large and mega-basements, often two or more storeys deep and extended under the garden. Beth Holroyd, co-author of the study, says variations in the scale and sumptuousness of basements reveal the wealth gap between London’s merely rich, such as corporate lawyers and accountants, and the global super-rich, including bankers and oligarchs. Holroyd says: “There is a clear pattern of association between the level of neighbourhood affluence and both the size and extravagance of the basements. The pool is a clear marker of wealth.” On Tregunter Road, in the Boltons conservation area of Chelsea renowned for its Italianate Victorian housing, the researchers found 22 approved basements, with features including 12 swimming pools and five cinemas. Five of these basements are standard-sized, 11 are classified as large and six as mega. One of the mega-basements, with a pool, gym and car lift, is in an 8,000 sq ft townhouse on the market for £26m. Four of the basements are currently under construction. Outside one, a huge red crane lowers building materials into the rear garden, under which, planning documents suggest, a two-storey basement with a pool, cinema, gym, wine store, steam room, salon and staff room is being created. Another two-storey basement with almost identical features is being excavated under a house across the street. “I can see that from my garden,” says local resident Shirley, who lives round the corner on the Boltons, gesturing at the crane with her walking stick. “We’ve had something like that or worse going on for years. We’ve had incredible noise and vibrations. I’m sure there have been momentary gaps. Our feeling is it’s too extreme. Very wealthy people buy them hoping to get the price rise and do them up and sell them and the next person does the same. Only a few of them are here all the time.” Alistair Langhorne and Claire Bunten, directors of LAB Architects, have been designing basements in the Boltons conservation area since 2008. On a tour of the area, Langhorne says that even here most of their clients want a basement to enhance their family life, rather than for property speculation – although Bunten admits that the budgets for some schemes were “otherworldly”. “They’ve all probably got homes elsewhere in the world but this is their main residence,” adds Langhorne. Their first basements in the neighbourhood included a 15-metre deep one for a film director’s home, with a swimming pool, sauna, gym and car lift. “There’s a glass lift through the middle of the staircase that goes down to the basement [and] arrives at the deep end of the pool,” says Langhorne. The pair say their early designs favoured slick, minimal finishes, with stone and glass, often contrasting with the decor of the period homes above. They eschew “naff” cinemas with reclining seats and cup holders in favour of media rooms with bespoke furniture and hidden screens. But Bunten says some of their later designs became more attuned to their clients’ international luxury lifestyles. For example, one project for a Turkish family on Tregunter Road involved a complete house renovation, including a basement with a swimming pool, gym, sauna and nanny’s room. “It’s beautifully finished. When [the clients are] in that upper echelon, they’re influenced a lot by new hotels and by travel, so they have a broader set of cultural references.” The basement boom began in the late 1990s in Hammersmith and Fulham and Wandsworth, according to architects and developers, with middle-class families renovating their Victorian coal cellars. Excavations became more substantial as planning constraints made building above ground in central London extremely difficult, while, from 2010 onwards, stamp duty rises on property purchases over £1m made the costs of moving prohibitive, forcing owners to expand downwards. Only 23 of the basements the Newcastle researchers identified in these boroughs have pools – compared with 224 in Westminster and Kensington and Chelsea – and the vast majority are standard-sized – one storey under the footprint of the house. Architect Ian Hogarth, whose own west London basement was featured in an episode of Channel 4’s Grand Designs, says most of the basements he has designed are in Hammersmith and Fulham. “They’re working families, they’re not oligarchs,” he says. “OK, they are people who generally work in the City or in corporate law – we’re not doing a basement for teachers or a lecturer – what I would call the normal London wealthy. They’re not people with outrageous luxury lifestyles. I guess most of the country would laugh if you say they’re struggling, but they are trying to pay for the nursery; in order to keep both parents working they have to take a nanny, and the nanny becomes someone they have to house within their home. [Basements are] not necessities. They’re aspirations for a family in a certain stratum.” Yet, as the Newcastle University study notes, super-rich investors soon caught on to how significantly a basement could increase the value of a property. “At the other end of the spectrum are the people who do it purely for commercial gain,” says architect Mike Wiseman, partner at the Basement Design Studio, who has worked on more than 2,000 basement applications since 1996. “We’ve had properties up near Regent’s Park where it’s already a big detached mansion with a garden and they want a basement underneath on two levels that is adding another 10,000 square feet. And when that person calls you, they’re asking: ‘What do you think I should put in it?’ They don’t need it! They certainly don’t want the space. Maybe the [main] property’s worth £2,000 per square foot, and the basement maybe £1,500 or even £1,000 per square foot. But because I can build that for £500 per square foot, there’s a simple commercial decision there. I’m not a fan of those particularly.” Steve Graham, author of Vertical, which explores how high-rise and subterranean living has become increasingly luxurious, says it is ironic that basements became investment schemes for the super-rich. He says: “Throughout human history basements have been dank spaces associated with poverty and disease, which the most desperate people would be forced to inhabit. Basement developments represent a reversal of [this] because of this super-concentration of wealth in London, aspiring for the trappings of a super-luxury lifestyle.” There are signs, though, that this trend may be in decline, partly owing to the post-Brexit fall in property prices in prime London, but mainly because several central-London boroughs have introduced more stringent planning rules governing basement developments. Kensington and Chelsea’s revised basement policy of 2015 restricts basements to a single storey, extending to no more than 50% of the garden. Westminster council followed suit in 2016. Bunten believes the demand for basements will continue, but she says owners are becoming more discerning about how they fit them out. “There’s less of ‘here’s a checklist’ or ‘we need a pool because that’s what next door has got’,” she says. “It’s more about ‘what we need’. It’s less speculative. Pre-recession, there was this uplift in value from extra square footage that meant you were just printing money and that has changed.” But Burrows believes that mega-basements will continue. “There will always be a few uber-wealthy types who seem immune to the vicissitudes of the economy, politics and local planning policies,” he says. “They always seem to find ways of getting around restrictions to build their luxury pools, galleries, cinemas or virtual reality golf courses. There may be fewer of those really massive basements now, but the trend is not finished yet.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"world/2018/mar/26/clara-ponsati-ex-catalan-minister-to-hand-herself-into-scottish-police","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-26T10:05:29Z","webTitle":"St Andrews hits out at Spanish bid to extradite Catalan academic","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/26/clara-ponsati-ex-catalan-minister-to-hand-herself-into-scottish-police","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/mar/26/clara-ponsati-ex-catalan-minister-to-hand-herself-into-scottish-police","fields":{"headline":"St Andrews hits out at Spanish bid to extradite Catalan academic","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"St Andrews University has described an attempt by Spanish judges to extradite a Catalan academic as a politically motivated attack on free speech. Prof Sally Mapstone, the principal of St Andrews, said the university was deeply concerned by the extradition application issued on Friday against Clara Ponsatí, an economist at the university. A former head of St Andrews school of economics, Ponsatí was education minister in Carlos Puigdemont’s Catalan government when it organised an illegal independence referendum last year. She is one of five former ministers named in European arrest warrants issued by Spain’s supreme court on Friday. Puigdemont was arrested by German police on Sunday under one warrant, prompting protests across Catalonia. After returning to St Andrews this month to resume her post as an economics researcher, Ponsatí is due to voluntarily attend a police station in Edinburgh on Wednesday where she is likely to be detained before a preliminary court appearance that day. As condemnation of Spain’s actions grew to include implied criticism from Nicola Sturgeon, the Scottish first minister, Mapstone said: “Clara is a valued colleague and we are committed to protect and support her. “As her employer and an institution committed to the defence of free speech, we are deeply concerned by recent developments, their motives and potential consequences. “In the current circumstances, we believe there are legitimate arguments that Clara is being targeted for standing up for her political beliefs. That is anathema to us, and we will continue to offer her every appropriate support, while respecting due legal process.” Meanwhile, Catherine Stihler, a former rector of St Andrews and a Labour MEP for Scotland, wrote to Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European commission, urging him to condemn Spain’s use of European arrest warrants in a political dispute. Stihler said people had a right to self-determation, which was upheld by the treaty of the United Nations, and using an EU-wide legal process to help suppress internal political opponents risked damaging the bloc’s reputation for upholding those rights. “I urge the commission to ensure the fundamental human rights of these individuals are respected when they come to face trial and that European arrest warrants are proportionately used where there is a significant risk to the public– such as terror-related incidents – and not with the intent to settle domestic political disputes,” she said. Ponsatí’s lawyer, Aamer Anwar, said she would resist the application as they had serious doubts she would receive a fair trial and that Scottish courts do not recognise the offence of sedition she is being accused of. “I am instructed to oppose the extradition on the basis that this is a political prosecution of Clara and a systematic attempt to criminalise the desire for independence by more than 2 million voters in Catalonia,” he said. The full extradition case is due to take place some weeks later, and it is expected Anwar will apply for bail. “We will submit there are no guarantees of due process in Spain, of a right to a fair trial in a country where most members of the Catalan government are already in prison or in exile. If returned we submit she will be subjected to degrading and inhumane treatment by the Spanish authorities.” Speaking to the BBC several weeks ago, Ponsatí said: “It will be interesting to see how they argue such a request because the alleged crimes of sedition and rebellion do not exist either in Scotland or in England and Wales. “But if they do then I would face justice and see what judges have to say here. I trust they will not be accepted but one never knows.” Sturgeon distanced her government from the case on Sunday, insisting that she could have no role in the legal process, despite calls from nationalist activists for her to intervene. She tweeted: “I know that many will wish that @scotgov was able to do or say more – I understand that. But I hope there can also be an understanding of the position as outlined and the importance of protecting due process and the independence of our legal system.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2018/mar/26/what-are-your-experiences-of-county-lines-drug-trading","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-26T10:18:36Z","webTitle":"What are your experiences of 'county lines' drug trading?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/mar/26/what-are-your-experiences-of-county-lines-drug-trading","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/mar/26/what-are-your-experiences-of-county-lines-drug-trading","fields":{"headline":"What are your experiences of 'county lines' drug trading?","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The issue of children being forced to sell drugs in rural areas has resulted in a surge in the number of slavery victims in Britain, according to the National Crime Agency (NCA). In 2017, 5,145 potential victims were flagged to the National Referral Mechanism, an increase of 35% from 2016 and nearly triple the number reported in 2013. The problem of county lines drug trading, where young people are recruited by dealers who groom them and offer them money to set up and sell drugs in out-of-town locations, is thought to be partly behind the rise. Will Kerr, the NCA director, said that the rise was partly due to greater reporting but of particular concern was the rise in young people being explotted for sex or drug trafficking.

There is an ancient story of a devout man who, travelling through a drought-stricken land, arrives at the gate of a beleaguered town. A woman is there gathering sticks and the traveller asks her for a drink and a morsel of bread. The woman replies, “I have nothing baked, only a handful of meal in a jar, and a little oil in a jug; I am now gathering a couple of sticks, so that I may go home and prepare it for myself and my son, that we may eat it, and die.” The story unfolds to reveal the woman baking a small loaf for the traveller and also feeding herself and her son. Returning to Monbiot’s thoughts, maybe it is more beneficial to speak plainly of distress and suffering experienced, and to share the very thing that we count essential to our life and sensibility. Pauline Harris Lydney, UK Alternatives to meat Professor Eleanor Riley is being extremely myopic in her justification for researching gene-editing in pigs (23 March). Killing purposely bred sentient beings is neither necessary nor the only way of providing nutritional benefits essential to human health; there are alternatives. Unfortunately, lack of vision and desire for quick and easy profits is preventing serious investment and interest in these alternatives. If money, time and brainpower can be spent researching ways of “safely” perpetuating the needless slaughter of pigs, then it can certainly be spent on the research and development of satisfying, reasonably priced, plant-based foods with which to feed the world. What is missing is the political will and moral courage necessary to make this latter option a reality. Carol-Mary Fraser Norwich, UK Big data background So glad I retained Carole Cadwalladr’s article Did big data tip it for Brexit? (19 May 2017) and her follow-up Bound together in an unholy alliance (3 November 2017). They deserve a close re-read and add greatly to understanding the latest revelations about the Facebook/Cambridge Analytica connection. Christopher Griffin Perth, Western Australia Home is where the heart is Gaby Hinsliff (Don’t fall for the hype about empty nest syndrome, 16 March) reflects on young adults who – for a variety of reasons – return to their parents’ home, causing stress. Hinsliff says: “As the old saying has it, home is still the place where when you have to go there, they have to take you in.” That “old saying” actually comes from Robert Frost’s poem The Death of the Hired Man. A farm hand has returned to his employers: old, ill and contrite, and the husband sourly remarks, “Home is the place where, when you have to go there, / They have to take you in.” The more compassionate wife replies, “I should have called it / Something you somehow haven’t to deserve.” The one-fourth of young British adults who now live with their parents shouldn’t have to suffer insecure work or unaffordable housing, as Hinsliff rightly points out, but needn’t have to deserve their parents’ love. Three cheers for the parents. Norbert Hirschhorn London, UK Lesson from the Romans Reading about the attraction of New Zealand as an Armageddon bolthole (9 March), I was struck by the parallel with late antiquity sub-Roman Britain. Roman oligarchs shaken by civil war and insurrection in third-century Gaul sought a safe haven across the channel for their latifundia lifestyle. Buying up sheep station acreage across an ocean seems to be the 21st-century equivalent. As these third-century archetype venture survivalists reclined smugly in their heated villas, they probably congratulated themselves on their cleverness. Of course, the illusion of a guaranteed, sanitised, safe haven doesn’t actually save anyone in the long run, as subsequent Anglo-Saxon immigration from the continent proved. History might instruct these cocksure capitalists. Bard Stebbins Baltimore, Maryland, US Briefly • Giving birth may add 11 years to a woman’s biological age (9 March).

Abloh, whose own label, Off White, is one of fashion’s most talked-about breakout brands, is the first designer of colour to hold such a high-profile position. Louis Vuitton is the world’s biggest luxury brand, worth £20.30bn in May 2017. The only other designer of colour at a major brand is Olivier Rousteing, who is creative director of Balmain. Abloh, 37, preempted the official announcement by posting an image of a Louis Vuitton trunk to his 1.6 million Instagram followers on Monday morning. Shortly after, Louis Vuitton released a statement confirming the news. Michael Burke, Louis Vuitton’s chairman and CEO, praised how Abloh’s “innate creativity and disruptive approach have made him so relevant, not just in the world of fashion but in popular culture today”. Abloh said of Louis Vuitton: “I find the heritage and creative integrity of the house are key inspirations and will look to reference them both while drawing parallels to modern times.” Born in Rockford, Illinois, Abloh studied engineering and architecture. After he met Kanye West while working as DJ, he designed the rapper’s merchandise. During his time with West, he interned at Fendi in 2006, where he met Burke. Off White began in 2013, with womenswear launched two years later. It swiftly won accolades including the Urban Luxe Brand at London’s Fashion awards in 2017. “Virgil is one of the few designers who truly marries street culture with high fashion – and the first black designer to be given such a position in the gilded halls of LVMH. His appointment is a step in the right direction for diversity.” Edward Enninful, the editor-in-chief at British Vogue, said on the magazine’s website. “This appointment is incredibly exciting,” Dylan Jones, the editor-in-chief of GQ, told the Guardian. “In one respect, it’s the meeting of two different worlds, and in another it’s completely understandable. In the world of fashion, that makes it a perfect fit, as it is potentially transformative.” Sebastian Manes, the buying and merchandising director at Selfridges, was one of the first to partner with Off White, and says the brand’s success comes from reading the times. “Contemporary designer customers are less engaged with the traditional fashion seasons,” he says. “They now look to retailers for exclusives – something Off White adopted very early on.” Manes describes Off White and Virgil Abloh as “two of the most recognisable names in fashion today.” LVMH, Louis Vuitton’s parent company, will be hoping Abloh brings his significant fanbase to the brand. The designercreated several sellout items with his streetwear-to-the-catwalk brand, Off White. His Ten trainers for Nike last year prompted large queues at stores when they were released; a pair is for sale on eBay for nearly £1,500. His upcoming collection for Ikea is expected to prompt similar hysteria. While Abloh has been reticent about discussing race in fashion, he did broach the subject on Monday. Speaking to the New York Times, he said his appointment could “show a younger generation that there is no one way anyone in this kind of position has to look”. He has discussed politics in his work; his menswear show in June last year, a collaboration with artist Jenny Holzer, focused on immigration. American-born Abloh is the child of Ghanaian parents. Abloh’s appointment represents a new wave in fashion and demonstrates that the industry is now taking streetwear seriously. According to a report by Bain &amp; Company, streetwear provided a 5% boost to luxury goods in 2017. Off White’s aesthetic hits the sweet spot between streetwear and high fashion. It shows in Paris with models including Bella Hadid and Naomi Campbell, but it is principally known for hoodies and T-shirts with a signature diagonal stripe. Abloh’s reference points plug into that of a millennial customer whose primary source of pop culture is their Instagram feed. Arguably, his appointment continues where Jones left off – the British designer masterminded the sellout collaboration between Louis Vuitton and streetwear powerhouse Supreme last year. Abloh will continue with Off White after taking up his position at Louis Vuitton. While his own brand creates men’s and women’s collections, Abloh will solely design menswear for the house. His first collection will be in June. With Jones now installed at fellow LVMH brand Dior Homme, the conglomerate will dominate the menswear season, with two high-profile debut shows within days of each other."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"environment/bike-blog/2018/mar/26/what-to-do-if-you-hit-a-pothole-while-cycling","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-26T10:28:21Z","webTitle":"What to do if you hit a pothole while cycling","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/bike-blog/2018/mar/26/what-to-do-if-you-hit-a-pothole-while-cycling","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/bike-blog/2018/mar/26/what-to-do-if-you-hit-a-pothole-while-cycling","fields":{"headline":"What to do if you hit a pothole while cycling","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The UK’s pothole problem is bad and getting worse, with a recent report by Alarm revealing 24,000 miles of road will need essential maintenance in the next year. While hitting one in a car may mean a trip to the garage, if you are cycling the outcome can be far worse. A BBC 5 Live questionnaire found half of almost 5,000 cyclists had suffered a pothole-related accident, with 1,516 injured as a result, 207 of those seriously. More than 10% of respondents said they missed work because of a pothole crash, and 31% were put off cycling. This survey was backed up by a mass freedom of information report from Cycling UK, which revealed cycling pothole crash compensation claims to councils in England and Wales are 10 times higher than motoring claims because of the higher risk of personal injury. Although the government announced a £100m boost to its pothole fund on Monday, the work will no doubt take a while to complete. If you are unlucky enough to hit one, there are things you can do to ensure you and your bike are safe, and gather the evidence to make a claim, if necessary. The first thing to do is check you are OK, and get out of the road to safety. Before you leave the scene, if you can, photograph the hole. Afterwards, you can report the defect on Cycling UK’s Fill that Hole website, which alerts the relevant roads authority. They are then duty bound to fix it. Cycling UK’s senior campaigns officer, Sam Jones, says photographic evidence from the time of the incident, or as close to it as possible, is crucial if you are to make a compensation claim – using a recognisable object for size. “We’ve heard in the past of people reporting a hole to the highway authority and then going back to take a picture for evidence and then finding it filled,” he said. “Having looked at loads of pothole pictures, you could be forgiven for wondering what the fuss is about as they don’t always look that bad. Add in something to give perspective – a coin, tyre lever etc – and the depth of the problem becomes apparent.” Making sure your bike is safe to ride After a pothole collision it’s advisable to get your bike checked by your local bike shop in case there’s damage you can’t see, such as within the headset. Claire Beaumont of Condor Cycles advises a few roadside checks before riding off. “The first thing to do is inspect your front wheel and fork,” she says. “Those are the two components that will take the brunt of the impact.” “Get off the bike, lift the front up, and spin the front wheel. If the rim is wobbling against the brake block you need to get it trued, or possibly replace it.” Wonky wheels can rub on the brakes, wearing down the wheel rim; what’s more, the wheel could be cracked from the collision, and unexpectedly collapse. “If the wheel is sitting closer to the frame than before, the fork has been pushed back from the impact.” In this case, she says, the bike shouldn’t be ridden. “On carbon forks damage is most likely where the fork meets the wheel – the narrowest point. If you see that, stop riding the bike immediately,” she says. “Look for cracks or chips, and run your hand across the area. If it is spongy or soft the bike is not safe to ride.” Check your mudguards, because once cracked or loose they can stick in the wheel without warning, or throw up stones. The worse the crash, the more extensive the damage to your bike is likely to be, and if you’ve come off, remember to check the frame carefully. Damaged steel frame tubes can be replaced, but with aluminium it’s often cheaper to replace the whole frame. You can have any undamaged parts moved over from your old bike to save money. If you wear a helmet and hit your head, the general advice is to replace the helmet, even if it doesn’t look damaged. Getting compensation for damage and injury If you decide to claim for damages to yourself or your bike you will need a solicitor. Membership of cycling organisations like Cycling UK, the London Cycling Campaign and British Cycling include free legal advice – but be warned, successful claims are rare. Michael Hardacre, a personal injury solicitor at Slater and Gordon, says, “Of 10 cases I take on two or three, and I might win one or two. “The seriousness of the injury bears no relevance to whether the council is liable; the issue is the defect itself and whether reasonable steps have been taken to maintain the road.” Whoever owns or occupies the land, usually a council, is responsible for maintaining its highway. This doesn’t mean eliminating all potholes, it means regular inspections, often every six or even 12 months. As council funds are squeezed, an issue judges are sympathetic to, the “intervention criteria” – how severe a hole needs to be to be repaired, have been stretched to mean bigger and bigger holes in our roads. Hardacre explains: “If it is a residential side street, 12 months can be considered reasonable for inspection frequency, but saying that, roads can turn into a mess in a few weeks in the winter.” The key to a successful claim is firstly having photographic evidence of the defect, and proving it was there prior to the council’s last inspection, or that it was reported to the roads authority in the meantime. A resident might be able to confirm how long it has been there, as can Google Earth, whose imagery sometimes goes back years."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2018/mar/29/pollutionwatch-petrol-not-diesel-is-less-polluting-in-the-short-term","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-29T20:30:01Z","webTitle":"Pollutionwatch: petrol, not diesel, is less polluting in the short term","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/mar/29/pollutionwatch-petrol-not-diesel-is-less-polluting-in-the-short-term","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/mar/29/pollutionwatch-petrol-not-diesel-is-less-polluting-in-the-short-term","fields":{"headline":"Pollutionwatch: petrol, not diesel, is less polluting in the short term","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The UK Society of Motor Manufacturers blamed February’s rise in the average new-car CO2 emissions on an “anti-diesel agenda [that] has set back progress on climate change”. Petrol v diesel cars is often presented as a trade-off between health-harming air pollution and climate-harmful CO2. Diesel cars do more miles to the litre than petrol, but this exaggerates the difference in CO2 emissions since one litre of diesel contains more energy and more carbon than one litre of petrol. If fuel were taxed on energy and carbon, rather than volume, then the tax on diesel would be 10 to 14% greater than that on petrol. The International Council on Clean Transportation points out that petrol engines and petrol-hybrids have improved faster than diesel and will continue to do so. They conclude that a decline in diesel cars from around 56% to 15% would not jeopardise EU CO2 targets. Instead, it would make the targets cheaper to achieve since petrol engines cost less to make and have simpler exhaust clean-up. The future might be electric cars (or better yet for public health: cycling, walking and public transport), but in the short term new petrol cars, instead of diesel, might help both climate change and air pollution."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2018/mar/26/scouts-pay-42000-over-claim-from-boy-aged-11-with-autism","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-26T10:22:42Z","webTitle":"Scouts pay £42,000 over claim from boy with autism","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/mar/26/scouts-pay-42000-over-claim-from-boy-aged-11-with-autism","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/mar/26/scouts-pay-42000-over-claim-from-boy-aged-11-with-autism","fields":{"headline":"Scouts pay £42,000 over claim from boy with autism","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"An 11-year-old boy with autism has received £42,000 in compensation after his family accused a cub scout group of discriminating against him. Ben Gleeson joined the 10th Harpenden scout group in January 2015 but was later told he could not go to camps or take part in athletics without supervision, the BBC reported. Pack leaders are said to have imposed restrictions, which his parents – both lawyers – said amounted to a ban, after Ben had a short episode at a camp in March 2016. His parents sued the Hertfordshire group and the case was eventually settled out of court. Ben’s mother, Beverly Gleeson, told the BBC: “Pretty much every event had to be supervised on a one-to-one basis, which I felt wasn’t inclusive. “I felt he didn’t need it. He didn’t have this level of supervision at school. He’d made one mistake and then that was it; they wanted to make the rules and regulations. It was supposed to be a dialogue.” Gleeson described the measures as a “complete overreaction”. The restrictions placed on Ben included not being able to travel with his fellow cub scouts on a bus to events or participate in athletics, his family said. His parents also said they were told he had to have one-to-one supervision at other events. Ben said he was upset at being separated from his friends, adding: “I don’t like the idea of someone following me all the time.” According to the BBC, 10th Harpenden scout group disputed some of the claims. However, the Scout Association apologised and said it had launched an investigation. A spokesman said: “The handling of Ben’s case was completely unacceptable. We are very sorry that Ben and his family were not supported as they should have been by their Cub Scout Pack, and we have made a personal apology to them. “While cases like this are very unusual, we know that action must be taken. We have established an inquiry to investigate what went wrong in this case.” He said that the National Autistic Society had agreed to be part of the inquiry and Ben’s parents had also been approached to see if they would be willing to take part. The association is looking at plans for mandatory training for all volunteers on how to make reasonable adjustments for young people with developmental disabilities, he added."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2018/mar/26/land-degradation-is-undermining-human-wellbeing-un-report-warns","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-26T13:30:26Z","webTitle":"Land degradation threatens human wellbeing, major report warns","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/mar/26/land-degradation-is-undermining-human-wellbeing-un-report-warns","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/mar/26/land-degradation-is-undermining-human-wellbeing-un-report-warns","fields":{"headline":"Land degradation threatens human wellbeing, major report warns","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Land degradation is undermining the wellbeing of two-fifths of humanity, raising the risks of migration and conflict, according to the most comprehensive global assessment of the problem to date. The UN-backed report underscores the urgent need for consumers, companies and governments to rein in excessive consumption – particularly of beef – and for farmers to draw back from conversions of forests and wetlands, according to the authors. With more than 3.2 billion people affected, this is already one of the world’s biggest environmental problems and it will worsen without rapid remedial action, according to Robert Scholes, co-chair of the assessment by the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES). “As the land base decreases and populations rise, this problem will get greater and harder to solve,” he said. The IPBES study, launched in Medellín on Monday after approval by 129 national governments and three years of work by more than 100 scientists, aims to provide a global knowledge base about a threat that is less well-known than climate change and biodiversity loss, but closely connected to both and already having a major economic and social impact. The growing sense of alarm was apparent last year when scientists warned fertile soil was being lost at the rate of 24bn tonnes a year, largely due to unsustainable agricultural practices. The new assessment goes further by looking at vegetation loss, forest clearance, wetland drainage, grassland conversion, urban sprawl and pollution, as well as how these changes affect human health, wealth and happiness. Drawing on more than 3,000 scientific, government, indigenous and local knowledge sources, the authors estimate land degradation costs more than 10% of annual global GDP in lost ecosystem services such as carbon sequestration and agricultural productivity. They say it can raise the risks of flooding, landslides and diseases such as Ebola and the Marburg virus. There are also geopolitical implications. The authors cite evidence of a strong association between land degradation, migration and instability. In dryland regions, years of extremely low rainfall have been associated with an up to 45% rise in violent conflict. Depending on the actions taken by governments to address climate change and the decline in soil quality, the authors estimate between 50 to 700 million people could be driven from their homes by 2050. The worst affected areas are likely to be the dry fringes of southern Iraq, Afghanistan, sub-Saharan Africa and southern Asia. To counter this, the authors call for coordination among ministries to encourage sustainable production and for the elimination of agricultural subsidies that promote land degradation. They urge consumers to reduce waste and be more thoughtful about what they eat. Vegetables have a much lower impact on land than beef. Farmers are encouraged to raise productivity rather than clear more land. Companies and governments are advised to accelerate efforts to rehabilitate land. There have been several successful projects on China’s Loess plateau, in the Sahel and in South Africa. The economic case for land restoration is strong, according to the report, which says benefits (such as jobs and business spending) are 10 times higher than costs, and up to three times higher than price of inaction. But in most regions, remedial work is overdue. National governments are not living up to a global commitment to neutral land degradation by 2030. Participants compared the rundown of land to the 2008 financial crisis. “Back then, people borrowed more money than they could repay. Now we are borrowing from nature at a rate that is many times higher than the world can sustain. The day of reckoning will come,” said Christian Steel, director of Sabima, a Norwegian biodiversity NGO. In Europe, he said, the industrialisation of forest and agriculture is degrading the land. “We are also importing more food and, by doing so, displacing the impact of our consumption. We are fooling ourselves. Disaster doesn’t hit suddenly like in a Hollywood movie. It is already happening gradually.” Action has been held back by a lack of awareness of the problem and the often wide gulf between consumers and producers. The report notes that many of those who benefit from over-exploitation of natural resources are among the least affected by the direct negative impacts of land degradation and therefore have the least incentive to take action. “This is extremely urgent,” said another of the co-chairs, Luca Montanarella. “If we don’t change lifestyles, consumption habits and the way we use land, then sooner or later we are going to destroy this planet. Looking for another one is not an option.” The land degradation assessment is the latest in a recent suite of global studies that highlight the deterioration of humanity’s home. In 2016, IPBES highlighted the demise of the planet’s pollinators, which are vital for agricultural production. On Friday, it released a global biodiversity study that warned human destruction of nature is rapidly eroding provision of food, water and security to billions of people. Separately, the United Nations last week released a global water study that forecast more than half of the human population could struggle to secure supplies for drinking, cooking and sanitation for at least one month a year by 2050 as a result of pollution, climate change and rising demand."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/mar/26/mock-meats-are-nicotene-gum-of-veganism-your-best-comments-today","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-26T13:36:05Z","webTitle":"'Mock meats are nicotine gum of veganism': your best comments today","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/mar/26/mock-meats-are-nicotene-gum-of-veganism-your-best-comments-today","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/mar/26/mock-meats-are-nicotene-gum-of-veganism-your-best-comments-today","fields":{"headline":"'Mock meats are nicotine gum of veganism': your best comments today","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Stories provoking interest around the site include a column on non-meat “meat” for non-vegetarians, the “best decade for films” according to one critic and some tear-jerking TV readers are looking forward to on Monday. To join in the conversation you can click on the links in the comments below to expand and add your thoughts. We’ll continue to highlight more comments worth reading as the day goes on. I’m obsessed with mock meat and I’m not even a vegetarian Readers have been enjoying Rhik Samadder’s column on meatless but “bleeding” burgers and “chickenless tenders”. Here are some of your thoughts: ‘Mock meats are just a nicotine gum of veganism’ I’ve been long long time veg and then vegan, and from my own experience the mock meats are just a nicotine gum of veganism. They serve a purpose to ween people off the meat, and as such they do a great service to veganism. But they are not the end solution. They are guilty of prolonging one’s meat dependency, by faking the perception of taste and texture thus fooling the mind into believing it’s meat. So that meat perception is kept alive. As they say, “it’s all in the head”, give up your meat desire, and you don’t have to fool anybody of anything. Sukkha ‘What is the point of infusing some fungus with beetroot juice?’ I suppose that is better than being mocked by obsessed meat. But making things that appear to be meat, but aren’t, rather misses the point. You would have to probe deeper and ask: why do you want a “bloody” burger? What is the point of infusing some fungus with beetroot juice just to give the impression of something that it is not. If it is merely to trigger some long-lost memory, then I doubt if an entirely bogus substitute will do the job. If it is to kid yourself that you are still a carnivore: blood and guts and gore all over, ripping still-warm flesh of a twitching prey, then I know a good trick cyclist. graun From Hidden to In the Mood for Love: why the 2000s are my favourite film decade The Guardian’s Peter Bradshaw tells us why the decade’s films resonated so much. You’ve been adding your thoughts. ‘It will be remembered for Michael Bay and Marvel’ Yes, the decade that gave us the endless franchise. The decade that gave us the 140 minute film as standard where nothing happens. There are some good films on that list, but ultimately the 2000s will be remembered for Michael Bay and Marvel. cairnofmediocrity ‘There were so many classics in the 90s’ The 90s was my favourite. So many classics: Shawshank Redemption, Pulp Fiction, Forest Gump, Seven, Usual Suspects, the Matrix, Saving Private Ryan, Silence of the Lambs, Fight Club, Ghost in the Shell 1995, I could on. 2000s was good also though, though I disagree about Hurt Locker, that was hollow pretentious jingoistic claptrap. aeris2001 ‘The 40s for me!’ The 40s for me! Spent a most enjoyable couple of hours last night watching Mildred Pierce for the umpteenth time. It’s been great to be able to collect films I watched for the first time on the BBC years ago. I’ve finally got hold of Beyond The Forest, the film which drove Bette Davis to finally break with Warner Bros. eileanmor Mum broke our hearts. Will sitcom’s odd couple bow out with a kiss? You have been paying tribute to the acting and writing on this series, which has moved many to tears. ‘I’ve never had a film or TV show make my feel that way’ So many incredibly moving moments in this series, all due to the superb writing and acting across the board. But the one that really broke my heart was episode 4 of this season. I’ve never had a film or TV show make my feel that way – I literally felt my chest tightening; it’s happening again just thinking about it. Peter Mullan is a remarkable actor. PurpleSinger ‘Its flaw is the over reliance on the hideousness of her brother’s partner’ I think the central relationships are great, and love the programme, but its flaw is the over reliance on the hideousness of her brother’s partner ( who by now in ‘real life’ should have just been taken down several pegs), and the inability for mum to find any real space...I’m aware that these things are needed to bring it all together though. A similar device was used in Him and Her, where the visiting sister was equally vile and generally accommodated.

Across five posts on Instagram (three of which he has since deleted), the 45-year-old directly attacked the survivors of the Parkland school shooting in Florida and shared rightwing memes. In one of the remaining posts, Hughes shared an illustration of a woman telling a man, “I turned in my gun to do my part in ending violence,” to which he replies, “I chopped off my own dick to stop rape.” In a caption beneath the post, Hughes questions the efficacy of passing new legislation as a way of “[combating] chronic abusers and disregarders of the law (like the law against Murder)” and accuses the Parkland survivors of “exploiting the death of 16 of our fellow students for a few Facebook likes and some media attention”. The Guardian has approached Hughes’s representatives for comment. The musician continued: “The Whitney Houston song about letting the children lead the way wasn’t actually had [sic] operating paradigm for life.....And when the truth don’t line up with your bullshit narrative just hold your breath and stamp your feet and refused [sic] to except [sic] it.... then take multiple days off of school playing hooky at the expense of 16 [sic] of your classmates blood....!.... it might be funny if it wasn’t so pathetic and disgusting......” Hughes drew on his own experiences at the Bataclan: “As the survivor of a mass shooting I can tell you from first-hand experience that all of you protesting and taking days off from school insult the memory of those who were killed and abuse and insult me and every other lover of liberty by your every action.....Long Live Rock’n’Roll..... and may everyone [sic] of these disgusting vile abusers of the dead live as long as possible so they can have the maximum amount of time to endure their shame....and be Cursed....” In a deleted post, he shared a Photoshopped image of student protester Emma González supposedly ripping a copy of the US Constitution in half. The original photo, from a Teen Vogue photoshoot, pictures González tearing a gun range target in two. Hughes described González as: “the Awful Face Of Treason.....survivor of Nothing....Lover of Treason.....enjoy your little moment.....it’s about to End…… #stupidity #hatersofliberty #loversofsatan #borntolose #2ndamendment”. A third, deleted post, contained multiple images: an illustration of a bottle of pills labelled “Hard to Swallow”, followed by an image of a hand holding three pills, each bearing a caption: “Our guns aren’t going anywhere”; “There are only 2 genders”; and “Donald Trump will be your president for 7 more years”. In Hughes’s caption, he promised “moronic dingdong headed losers” that he would report any threats made against him to the FBI. In a fourth, deleted, post, Hughes shared a photograph of a pro-second amendment patch, with the caption: “I can tell you right now that the actions of these misguided youth and evil communists is making me feel terrified… with every broadcast of a willing and complicit press I feel the wall of security that the Constitution provides being taken down bit by bit…..” A fifth post, apparently made after deleting the previous three, contained an image of a ceramic eagle. In the caption, Hughes wrote, “I’ve always believed in the motto I may not agree with what you’re saying but I’ll die for your right to say it. Saddens me to see so many not have this motto for the same.....” He said he would start a second Instagram account for his political beliefs, and preserve the fatherbadass account for “Rock’n’Roll”. After 89 people were killed by terrorists while attending an Eagles of Death Metal concert in Paris in November 2015, Hughes suggested that France’s strict gun control laws did nothing to mitigate the bloodshed of the night. “Did your French gun control stop a single person from dying at the Bataclan? If anyone can answer yes, I’d like to hear it, because I don’t think so,” he said. In March 2016, he suggested that the attacks may have been an inside job, comments for which he later apologised. When the venue reopened in November 2016, Hughes was allegedly refused entry. The Californian hard-rock band were on stage at the Bataclan when three terrorists entered the venue and began shooting with assault rifles and throwing hand grenades. It was one of a series of attacks in Paris that night that left 130 people dead. Islamic State claimed responsibility for the murders."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/mar/26/nt-police-investigate-alleged-sexual-assault-of-four-year-old-boy-near-tennant-creek","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-26T09:19:47Z","webTitle":"NT police investigate alleged sexual assault of four-year-old boy near Tennant Creek","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/mar/26/nt-police-investigate-alleged-sexual-assault-of-four-year-old-boy-near-tennant-creek","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/mar/26/nt-police-investigate-alleged-sexual-assault-of-four-year-old-boy-near-tennant-creek","fields":{"headline":"NT police investigate alleged sexual assault of four-year-old boy near Tennant Creek","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Northern Territory police are investigating the alleged sexual assault of another young child in an outback community, just weeks after the alleged rape of a two-year-old prompted emergency measures to bring alcohol-fuelled violence under control. Officers from the child abuse taskforce are investigating the alleged incident in a Barkly region remote community, and have a youth in custody. NT police said no one else was being sought in relation to the matter. It is understood the child is four years old and the perpetrator is a teenager. NT chief minister Michael Gunner said additional Territory Families staff had been deployed to the community and the incident would also be referred to the children’s commissioner. “This is an extremely disturbing incident,” he told the ABC. “Every child, no matter where they live, deserves to be in a safe environment.” The opposition leader, Gary Higgins, called for immediate measures to be implemented as soon as possible as well as continuing work by territory and federal governments to address Indigenous disadvantage in the NT. “This is a complex set of problems that cannot be solved overnight, but what sort of society do we live in if we cannot commit to addressing this crisis with a sense of urgency.” The alleged attack occurred just over a month after a 24-year-old man allegedly raped a two-year-old girl in Tennant Creek, the main town in the Barkly. The family of the young girl accused welfare services under the NT government’s Territory Families department of ignoring their concerns about the safety of the girl. A damning internal review of child protection services, launched in response to the incident, found multiple failings and breakdowns in the system. However it also said there was no evidence to suggest that if department staff had taken any different action in the months before the alleged assault that they would have prevented it. There were more than 20 notifications made about the girl’s family and the house in which she lived were made to Territory Families but none prompted intervention. Territory Families staff had been working with the mother, the department said. The review said in future the department “must ensure that assessments and interventions are not incident based and look at the needs of families as a whole.” Among the issues identified by the review was a lack of oversight and the potential desensitisation of staff to “the constant flow of notifications of children who have suffered harm”. “The central intake team does not have a dedicated position to assess the quality of assessment and decision-making and ensure consistency in the services delivered at the ‘front door’ of the agency,” it said. The children’s commission is also investigating that incident. Severe alcohol restrictions have been placed over the town of Tennant Creek in an effort to curb alcohol-related violence. In the weeks following the incident several community leaders and residents criticised the government for ignoring their pleas for help for months before the assault."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/apr/01/toast-of-tuscany-red-wine-great-chiantu-italy-david-williams","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-01T04:59:09Z","webTitle":"The toast of Tuscany | David Williams","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/apr/01/toast-of-tuscany-red-wine-great-chiantu-italy-david-williams","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/apr/01/toast-of-tuscany-red-wine-great-chiantu-italy-david-williams","fields":{"headline":"The toast of Tuscany","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Poggiotondo Cerro del Masso Chianti, Italy 2015 (£7.99, Waitrose) Like Bordeaux, Tuscany’s chianti lends its name both to some of the finest and some of the least inspiring red wines in the world. For makers of the former, the existence of the latter is a bit of a problem: generic trattoria chianti, even if it’s no longer offered up in the traditional straw-covered, lampshade-ready fiasco bottle, is maddeningly, sourly inconsistent, and memories of its rustic rasp can be enough to stop some drinkers seeking out the good stuff for life. The sangiovese grape, which is the beating heart of all chianti blends, will always bring a certain tang of cherry or tomato acidity. But when it’s properly grown and handled, that makes for wines that are compelling partners for tomato-based cooking, pasta sauces and pizza being the most obvious examples. Waitrose’s authentically tangy, succulent rosso, made from organic fruit, does this job splendidly. Monte Bernardi Retromarcia Chianti Classico, Italy 2015 (from £16.95, Twelve Green Bottles; Virgin Wines; Vin Cognito) The best chianti is made in the seven specific subzones within its vast production area, with the most famous being the historic heart of chianti classico in the rolling, olive grove, cypress and vine-covered hills of prime Chiantishire tourist country between Florence and Siena. Although the black rooster logo that appears on every bottle is not always a guarantee of quality, almost all the finest chiantis are sourced from the zone’s 10,000-odd hectares of vines. For value, it’s hard to beat the graceful oregano-scented cherry of the Co-op’s Bibbiano Chianti Classico 2014 (£10.99) and The Wine Society’s fragrant Exhibition Chianti Classico 2014 (£12.50) by the fastidious Poggiopiano. A little more brings you the exquisitely polished Querciabella Chianti Classico 2014 (£23.99, Noble Grape), the sensuously deep Fontodi Chianti Classico 2015 (£23.95, Noel Young Wines) and the classically styled red-fruited savouriness of Monte Bernardi Retromarcia. Fuligni Ginestreto Rosso di Montalcino, Italy 2015 (£22.95, Lea &amp; Sandeman) Tuscany is by no means just chianti. Arguably its most famous wine of all, Tenuto San Guido Sassicaia, is made not with the traditional sangiovese but with Bordeaux’s cabernet sauvignon and cabernet franc in coastal Bolgheri. First produced commercially in 1968, Sassicaia’s price has crept up with its justifiably high reputation (Italian specialist Tannico.co.uk has the latest 2015 vintage for £156.99). But the same producer’s Le Difese, Bolgheri 2015 (£18.50, Armit Wines) has some of its glamorous sibling’s polished elegance and contained black-fruited wildness for a fraction of the price. For lovers of serious sangiovese, chianti’s biggest rival comes from around the hill town of Montalcino to the south of Siena, where the great Tuscan grape is responsible for the magnificently brooding but balanced Fuligni Brunello di Montalcino 2012 (£55.99) and the same producer’s more humanely priced, but deliciously supple, savoury baby brother Ginestreto Rosso.

The 202-year-old company, which made the Bushmaster AR-15-style rifle used in the Sandy Hook shooting in Connecticut that left 20 first-graders and six teachers dead, filed for chapter 11 protection in Delaware bankruptcy court on Sunday. The official filing came during a weekend of March For Our Lives protests across the US of children calling for greater gun control laws after 17 deaths in a school shooting in Parkland, Florida. Remington, which is owned by the Cerberus Capital Management hedge fund, said it had debts of between $100m-$500m (£70m-£352m) and estimated that its assets were worth about the same amount. The company plans to reduce its debts by transferring control of the firm to its creditors. Gunmakers have suffered since the election of Donald Trump, who describes himself as a “true friend” of the industry, because gun enthusiasts typically buy more firearms when they fear that politicians might be about to bring in tighter controls. In the first nine months of Trump’s presidency, Remington’s sales declined by 27.5%. “They call it the Trump slump,” said Robert Spitzer, a professor at the State University of New York and expert on the economics of guns. “Gun sales have become politicised to a great degree. Gun purchases recently have been made not just because someone wants a new product but to make a statement; not just because of fears that there might be tighter regulation, but also to make a statement against Obama.” Cerberus Capital Management’s billionaire chief executive, Stephen Feinberg, is a major Trump supporter and donated nearly $1.5m to pro-Trump political action committees in the run-up to the 2016 presidential election. Remington is being sued by the parents of the Sandy Hook victims in the Connecticut supreme court. Attorneys representing Sandy Hook families in the lawsuit said they did not expect the gunmaker’s bankruptcy to affect their case. After the shooting, Cerberus came under pressure from its investors to sell Remington. But the hedge fund struggled to find a buyer and settled for letting investors sell their shares in the company. The bankruptcy will allow Cerberus to sever ties with Remington, which is based in North Carolina and has been making handguns, rifles and shotguns since 1816. US businesses have moved into the gun control debate while there has been little political progress on the issue. Last week, the banking firm Citigroup said it would not allow any of its business customers to sell guns to anyone under the age of 21 or who had not completed a background check. The bank will also prevent its business customers from selling bump stocks, which allow semi-automatic weapons to fire like machine guns, or high-capacity magazines. Citigroup’s chief executive, Michael Corbat, who owns guns, told the New York Times: “Banks serve a societal purpose – we believe our investors want us to do this and be responsible corporate citizens. “We don’t pretend that these answers are perfect, but as we looked at the things we thought we could influence, we felt that, working with our clients, we could make a difference.” Two of the leading gunsellers in the US, Walmart and Dick’s Sporting Goods, have taken measures to limit their sales of guns. Walmart raised its age restriction to 21, while Dick’s ended sales of all assault-style rifles and also raised its age restriction to over-21s. The US has the highest rate of gun ownership in the world, with 88 for every 100 people. Just 3% of the population owns an average of 17 guns each, with an estimated 7.7 million “super-owners” in possession of between eight and 140 guns apiece."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2018/mar/27/macbeth-review-verdi-phyllida-lloyd-royal-opera-house","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-27T12:29:58Z","webTitle":"Macbeth review – musically formidable revival of Verdi's opera","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/mar/27/macbeth-review-verdi-phyllida-lloyd-royal-opera-house","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/mar/27/macbeth-review-verdi-phyllida-lloyd-royal-opera-house","fields":{"headline":"Macbeth review – musically formidable revival of Verdi's opera","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Macbeth, in one form or another, seems almost ubiquitous at present, and the Covent Garden revival of Phyllida Lloyd’s 2002 production of Verdi’s opera comes hard on the heels of new stagings of Shakespeare’s play by the National Theatre and the Royal Shakespeare Company. Though Lloyd’s take on the work has more than its fair share of irritations, the revival, conducted by Antonio Pappano and wonderfully well cast, is, for the most part, musically formidable. The Macbeths are played by Željko Lučić and Anna Netrebko, both giving interpretations of considerable power and insight. Lučić doesn’t quite convince as the military man at the start, but his performance gains in stature as ambition and conscience gradually corrode Macbeth’s mind and integrity. The introspective lyricism of his singing in the first two acts contrasts with Netrebko’s ferocity. Her voice has darkened and gained in amplitude of late without losing its agility, and her vaunting, thrilling coloratura is at once the expression of her own steely fixity of will and the weapon with which she incites her husband to murder. The turning point comes after the appearance of Banquo’s ghost. When Lučić launches Sangue a Me, a touch of metal creeps into his tone precisely at the point when the steel begins to drain from Netrebko’s voice. He keeps us just the right side of empathy as he descends into authoritarianism: Pietà, Rispetto, Amore is really moving as an expression of the last vestiges of his humanity as the final catastrophe approaches. Netrebko, meanwhile, gives us a remarkable Sleepwalking Scene, in which singing and acting fuse in a genuinely harrowing depiction of mental disintegration. There are tremendous things elsewhere, too. After a low-key start, Pappano slowly ratchets up the tension to near breaking point, and the baleful orchestral sound, all implacable brass and slithery woodwind, really gets under your skin. The Royal Opera Chorus are on tremendous form at the moment: the refugees’ scene at the start of Act Four really hits home as one of the great passages in the score. Yusif Eyvazov, meanwhile, makes an excellent Macduff with his dark tone and intense way with words. Bass-baritone Ildebrando D’Arcangelo is the handsome-sounding Banquo, though the role lies fractionally low for him. It’s a shame, however, that Lloyd’s staging sometimes gets in the way. The witches control the action throughout as impersonal agents of a malign destiny. In addition to their prophetic function, they take Macbeth’s letter to his wife, form Duncan’s entourage on his arrival in Dunsinane and engineer Fleance’s escape from the assassins, before finally homing in on Konu Kim’s Malcolm as their next victim, all of which muddies the examination of the relationship between fate and free will that informs the opera as it does the play. Elsewhere, the symbolism is heavy-handed. Returning from the battlefield, Lučić, in a chilling moment of prescience, washes his hands at a faucet, which remains on stage throughout, and later sloshes water, at times noisily, whenever anyone does something incriminating. Political power, meanwhile, is represented by a gilded cage that effectively imprisons those who wield it. It’s all a bit clunky. You need to hear it, since much of this production is astonishing, but you also need to make allowances, at times, for what you see. • At Royal Opera House, London, until 10 April.

I’m not surprised that people saw [the story] and went: ‘Oh, that’s a bit odd.’ But I know that Matt feels the same that I do, that it’s odd to find yourself at the centre [of a story] that you didn’t particularly ask for.” Foy’s comments follow an apology from Left Bank, the show’s production company, which came after the series’ producers – Suzanne Mackie and Andy Harries – acknowledged Smith was paid more than Foy despite being in a supporting role. “Going forward, no one gets paid more than the Queen,” Mackie told an audience during a panel event in Jerusalem. Left Bank’s apology came after a petition was started that urged Netflix and Smith to “make up for this sexist pay gap by donating the difference in their paycheques to the Time’s Up legal defence fund for sexual harassment and abuse victims.” The production company responded with an apology and a pledge to work with gender equality advocacy group ERA 50:50, and added they would start discussions with Time’s Up UK. In a statement, the company saidL “The actors are not aware of who gets what, and cannot be held personally responsible for the pay of their colleagues.” While Foy didn’t offer comment on the pay gap disparity itself, her co-star Jared Harris who played King George VI did, telling Digital Spy that the dispute was an “embarrassment” for Left Bank. He added that the company should go further than offering an apology. “I understand they made an apology but, you know, an apology and a check would be more welcome,” he said. “She worked longer hours. Her performance is a huge reason why this thing is going to have a season three, four, five and six. Send her a paycheck and – in retrospect – bring her pay up to parity.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"environment/2018/mar/28/extreme-fossil-fuel-investments-have-surged-under-donald-trump-report-reveals","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-28T04:00:12Z","webTitle":"'Extreme' fossil fuel investments have surged under Donald Trump, report reveals","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/mar/28/extreme-fossil-fuel-investments-have-surged-under-donald-trump-report-reveals","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/mar/28/extreme-fossil-fuel-investments-have-surged-under-donald-trump-report-reveals","fields":{"headline":"'Extreme' fossil fuel investments have surged under Donald Trump, report reveals","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Bank holdings in “extreme” fossil fuels skyrocketed globally to $115bn during Donald Trump’s first year as US president, with holdings in tar sands oil more than doubling, a new report has found. A sharp flight from fossil fuels investments after the Paris agreement was reversed last year with a return to energy sources dubbed “extreme” because of their contribution to global emissions. This included an 11% hike in funding for carbon-heavy tar sands, as well as Arctic and ultra-deepwater oil and coal. US and Canadian banks led a race back into the unconventional energy sector following Trump’s promise to withdraw from Paris, with JPMorgan Chase increasing its coal funding by a factor of 21, and quadrupling its tar sands assets. Chase’s $5.6bn surge in tar sands holdings added to nearly $47bn of gains for the industry last year, according to the report by NGOs including BankTrack, the Sierra Club and Rainforest Action Network (RAN). RAN spokeswoman, Alison Kirsch, accused banks such as JPMorgan Chase of “moving backwards in lockstep with their wrongheaded political leaders”. “If we are to have any chance of halting catastrophic climate change, there must be an end of expansion and complete phase-out of these dangerous energy sources,” she said. “Banks need to be accountable and implement policies guarding against extreme fossil fuel funding.” JPMorgan Chase has asked the US securities and exchanges commission for support in its bid to block a shareholder resolution calling for a bank report on financial and climate risks associated with tar sands projects. Royal Bank of Canada and Toronto Dominion remain the biggest tar sands backers, with $38bn of holdings between them. Kelly Martin, a campaign director at Sierra Club, said: “Tar sands and other fossil fuel projects threaten our climate, public health, and communities, and until they stop supporting them financially, major banks … are complicit in this destruction.” The bulk of new “extreme” investments came in a doubling of loans and bonds to Canada’s government-backed tar sands industry, even though its success would be disastrous for climate mitigation efforts, according to the former Nasa chief James Hansen. Bank funding for tar sands production and pipelines more than doubled last year – compared to the 2015-16 period, when then-US president Barack Obama nixed the Keystone pipeline project, which Trump subsequently reapproved. Support for coal among the 36 banks surveyed was also up by 6% in 2017 after a 38% plunge in 2016. Large Chinese banks actually reduced these investments last year and in Europe, BNP Paribas and ING moved to limit their exposure to fossil fuel assets. However, 14 European banks collectively increased their coal financing by more than $2bn last year, with HSBC the worst performer by far. “Europe’s top banks have got to stop their coal-focused assault on the Paris agreement,” said Johan Frijns, the director of BankTrack. “It is now vital that they move to stamp out their financial support for companies developing new coal-fired power plants around the world.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2018/mar/26/the-opposite-of-confidential-by-claudine-toutoungi","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-26T09:30:21Z","webTitle":"Poem of the week: The Opposite of Confidential by Claudine Toutoungi","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/mar/26/the-opposite-of-confidential-by-claudine-toutoungi","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/mar/26/the-opposite-of-confidential-by-claudine-toutoungi","fields":{"headline":"Poem of the week: The Opposite of Confidential by Claudine Toutoungi","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The Opposite of Confidential Nobody questions the birds. Their trills are never subject to inspection or forced to satisfy requirements. Light-boned libertarians (the opposite of confidential), they cannot keep it in. You will not see them lining up in rows, reeling off content-approved medleys to a committee of creatures who know nothing of song, and who certainly don’t have wings. Claudine Toutoungi’s The Opposite of Confidential, taken from her first full-length collection Smoothie, appears to give birds a traditional poetic role; as “Light-boned libertarians”, they might even be cousins of Shelley’s skylark. The poem evokes their freedom with humour: they are exempt from questioning, “inspection”, “requirements” and confidentiality. The freely trilling and flying are not required to satisfy the demands of a “committee of creatures” who are songless and wingless, and they probably wouldn’t satisfy them on principle: “You will not see them lining up in rows,/ reeling off content-approved medleys…” But it is implied that you will see others subjected to such measures, and the speaker seems to ask: reader, are you one of them? The “creatures” whose judgements the birds are spared are unspecified, but we all recognise the species. It’s the sting in the tail which makes the poem more abrasive, and more metaphorical, than it might first appear. It prompts a return to the matter of the “Light-boned libertarians” and their nature. Are they birds or metaphor, and if they represent a group of people, which? Poets and playwrights – like Toutoungi herself – might be among them, or perhaps all humans, at least in an ideal state of prelapsarian freedom of expression. The lightness of rhythm is mimetic, casually conveying the cheery immunity of such free spirits to impositions. “Nobody questions the birds,” the speaker declares in confident dactyls. But there are words that enter with a heavier tread. The idea of questioning (rather than simply asking questions) is laden with negative associations, like “stop-and-search” and police interrogation. It can be the start of a process which is less concerned with fact-finding than with accusation and punishment. The ensuing passive constructions (“subject to” and, especially, “forced”) hint at sanctioned brutality. The “inspection” will inevitably be failed, the “requirements” unmet: the very vagueness of the demand adds to the sense of unease. The description of the birds as “the opposite of confidential” – also the poem’s title – is also concerning; the maintenance of confidentiality is generally virtuous in private encounters, but, when imposed by states and corporations, it can be malign. Whistleblowing readily comes to mind as a (birdlike) breach of confidentiality which might be justified as ultimately benevolent. The knowledge that people can’t “keep… in” may range from abuses of power to genuine criticism. The formality of “cannot”, rather than “can’t”, almost enacts an attempted muffling of simple speech. Under interrogation and torture, what can’t be contained might be as literal as our life-blood. A less negative reading would denote the power of the irrepressible and anarchic: laughter, exuberance, sexuality, wild humour, the opening of cages and borders through art. In poetry, too, there are committees “who know//nothing of song, and who/certainly don’t have wings.” The final couplet delineates the committee’s missing qualifications with a fine cutting edge, and even the stanza break after “know” shows us the blankness where the knowledge of song has failed to reach. I think at this point in the poem there’s also a glimpse of actual bird-like behaviour, which is at odds with the “poetic” view of unregimented, blithe spirits. Birds do line up in rows: their medleys are, in a sense, content-approved, being evolutionarily successful, and they are social and communal. Perhaps the poem is satirising bird-romanticists, reminding us that we committees of well-meaning humans have custody of the “natural world” without the requisite understanding and experience. But I prefer to think of Toutoungi’s birds as metaphorical. Birds are us – or, they are us at our Shelleyan best, pouring forth “profuse strains of unpremeditated art”. The committee, or board, or panel that fail to appreciate our originality deserves its exposure. And while those ignorant bureaucrats are meant to provoke knowledgeable grins as well as groans, this is one of Toutoungi’s typically playful-but-serious poems: we may grin, but we can still taste the bitter and ridiculous invincibility of certain kinds of power."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2018/mar/26/indian-it-minister-rubbishes-privacy-campaigners-fears","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-26T09:26:59Z","webTitle":"'Getting naked before the white man': Indian minister rubbishes privacy fears","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/26/indian-it-minister-rubbishes-privacy-campaigners-fears","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/mar/26/indian-it-minister-rubbishes-privacy-campaigners-fears","fields":{"headline":"'Getting naked before the white man': Indian minister rubbishes privacy fears","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"An Indian cabinet minister has questioned why privacy advocates in the country have no issue “getting body naked before the white man” to obtain a US visa but object to the government’s biometric database scheme. Revelations last week about Cambridge Analytica’s misuse of Facebook data have sparked a renewed debate in India about privacy in one of the world’s fastest-growing internet markets. Digital security researchers alleged at the weekend that the official app of the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, was sending user data to a third party without consent, and claimed the controversial Aadhaar biometric database, which contains details on more than a billion people, had suffered a new security breach. The Indian agency that administers Aadhaar said the breach claims were “baseless” and KJ Alphons, minister for information technology, said opponents of the programme cared only when it was “your own government” seeking data. He said US visa applications demanded pages of documents and biometric data from Indians, with which most complied. “We have absolutely no problem giving our fingerprints and getting body naked before the white man at all,” Alphons said on Sunday. “When your own government asks for your name and address, there is a massive revolution, saying it is an intrusion of privacy.” Registering with Aadhaar, which requires providing biometric details such as iris scans and fingerprints, is not mandatory, but is becoming increasingly necessary to access government services. Activists have succeeded in persuading the Indian supreme court to temporarily freeze a government order that bank accounts and mobile phone connections also require an Aadhaar record. The Modi administration says the Aadhaar program, launched in 2009 under the previous government, will streamline delivery of welfare services. Opponents say those claims are overblown and point to several reported breaches of Aadhaar data, though none yet of its biometric information. In the latest alleged breach, reported by the technology news outlet ZDNet, a leak in Aadhaar records maintained by Indane, a state-owned utility company, allowed anybody to access information that included people’s 12-digit Aadhaar numbers and some bank details. The Unique Identification Authority, which administers Aadhaar, said there had been “absolutely no breach” of its database and that the unique 12-digit number was not secret in any case. The Guardian could not independently verify the alleged breach. Also at the weekend, a French security researcher who uses the alias Elliot Alderson tweeted what they said was evidence the official Narendra Modi app, which has been downloaded about 5m times, was sending user data to a third-party company in the US. Alderson wrote on Sunday that in response to his tweets the app’s privacy policy had “quietly” been updated. Rahul Gandhi, the leader of the opposition Congress party, tweeted that Modi was giving users’ data to “friends” in US companies. Modi’s Bharatiya Janata party tweeted in response that the third-party company was only using the data to provide analytics “for offering users the most contextual content”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/mar/25/steven-reid-roy-hodgson-crystal-palace-first-team-coach-republic-of-ireland","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-25T16:08:12Z","webTitle":"Steven Reid: ‘Roy Hodgson is an inspiration – working with him fits perfectly’ | Ed Aarons","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/mar/25/steven-reid-roy-hodgson-crystal-palace-first-team-coach-republic-of-ireland","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/mar/25/steven-reid-roy-hodgson-crystal-palace-first-team-coach-republic-of-ireland","fields":{"headline":"Steven Reid: ‘Roy Hodgson is an inspiration – working with him fits perfectly’","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Steven Reid winces. “We had a staff game yesterday so I’m feeling the effects a little bit. I’ve probably played twice in the last six months when we’ve been short of players. Actually the gaffer has been quite complimentary – playing that game yesterday I was thinking: ‘Tell you what …’ But you wake up the next morning and you know that’s just wishful thinking.” A little more than 18 months after calling time on a career during which he underwent no fewer than 10 operations and racked up a more than a decade’s service in the Premier League as well as a World Cup finals appearance for Republic of Ireland, the former Millwall, Blackburn, West Brom and Burnley player has settled into the next phase of his career. Whereas most players hang up their boots without a plan about what to do next, it is no accident that Reid finds himself learning his new trade as Crystal Palace’s first-team coach under the tutelage of the former England manager Roy Hodgson. “The original plan was to join the coaching staff under Steve Clarke at West Brom but I went on to have another season at Burnley,” Reid says. “It wasn’t a career that had great moments all the way through – for about five years I was probably about 50% to 60% of what I was when I had that season at Blackburn under Mark Hughes when we finished sixth. Most family photos I look through now I’ve got an ice pack on my knee. When I suffered my cruciate injury, that was the moment that my career almost took another path. I knew I needed to make a plan and that’s when my coaching journey began.” The chronic pain caused by his injuries meant the all-action midfielder who had burst through Millwall’s youth setup under Billy Bonds was forced to adapt to a new position in defence in his latter years. But it was his conversations with Hodgson and then Clarke while at West Brom that convinced Reid to pursue a new goal. “In the last two or three years you almost become a coach on the pitch anyway as a senior player. Roy was an inspiration. It was a great time to be there. We have always had a very professional relationship.” When Hodgson called six weeks after Reid decided to leave his first coaching post, at Reading last summer, he had no hesitation in accepting. “Roy wanted a young coach alongside him and it all just seems to fit perfectly. We have chats about all sorts of things. A lot of what he says goes over my head because he’s reading books and watching films that I’ve never heard of. We had a discussion last week about the languages he can speak – he learned French at school and then picked up Swedish early on in his career. A bit of German, Italian … and he makes it sound so easy: ‘Three or four months and I’ve got it.’ “We have a good bit of banter because of my age and the gaffer’s age. We can give each other a bit of stick. Often the perception with people who have not worked with him is massively different to the man that he is: still the most enthusiastic person that I’ve met in the game.” That enthusiasm has certainly rubbed off on his apprentice. At 37 Reid is much closer in age to the majority of Palace’s players and often acts as a conduit between them and the manager, although he insists he is no pushover. “There comes a point where you have to be firm with the players and tell the truth,” he says. “At the moment there’s no time frame for the future – I know I’m lucky enough to be in this position now. If you look too far ahead you can come unstuck. You’re talking about 92 league clubs, so that means 92 assistants and probably half that for first-team coaches. It’s a difficult position to get into but I like to pride myself on doing things right, like I did when I was a player.” With Chris Hughton the only manager in the Premier League from a black, Asian or minority ethnic background, does Reid believe the adoption of the Rooney Rule by the Football Association and Football League is necessary? “Obviously there is a problem when you look at the number of black players compared to the number in coaching or administration, particularly at the top end. It doesn’t make sense. I think the Rooney Rule is a good thing but we also need the numbers to make it work. It can’t just be an interview for an interview’s sake. We need more and more numbers getting into top-flight positions – not just coaching, but administration and those that are making decisions – to take us to that next level.” Reid is halfway through his Uefa Pro-Licence course and pauses for a moment when asked whether he is the only BAME candidate. “There’s me, Jason Euell ... you’ve got me thinking now. So it’s a very small percentage of the group. Unfortunately most people who come out of the game can’t afford £6,000 for your A licence and another £8,500 for your Pro Licence. “There is funding for BAME candidates from the PFA so perhaps more needs to be done to make people more aware of that. But the bottom line is that there has to be a desire to do it because it is hard work. If I can in a small way influence some of the black players who play under me to think, ‘Actually, there’s a path forward for me in this coaching game’, then that’s got to be positive.” The only relegation of Reid’s career came in his final season with Burnley and he is confident Palace can avoid it this year. “We’ve shown that we can compete with the best in the league, so hopefully we can end the season in a good way.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/mar/26/may-must-consider-tax-rises-to-fund-nhs-and-social-care-say-mps","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-25T23:01:05Z","webTitle":"May must consider tax rises to fund NHS and social care, say MPs","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/mar/26/may-must-consider-tax-rises-to-fund-nhs-and-social-care-say-mps","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/mar/26/may-must-consider-tax-rises-to-fund-nhs-and-social-care-say-mps","fields":{"headline":"May must consider tax rises to fund NHS and social care, say MPs","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Theresa May is under mounting pressure to consider tax rises to fund Britain’s creaking health and social care system, as a group of high-powered MPs on Monday call for a new commission to recommend money-raising measures. Among the signatories to a letter to the prime minister are 21 select committee chairs who are urging May to set up a year-long “parliamentary commission”, echoing the approach taken after the banking bailouts. Sarah Wollaston, MP for Totnes and chair of the health and social care committee, said: “We call on the government to act with urgency and to take a whole system approach to the funding of the NHS, social care and public health. On behalf of all those who rely on services, we need to break down the political barriers and to agree a way forward.” The letter says the commission – effectively a special select committee – could examine witnesses and make recommendations by Easter 2019. Its 98 signatories warn that the NHS, public health and social care systems are “overstretched, poorly integrated and no longer able to keep pace with rising demand and the cost pressures of new drugs and technologies”. “Without action, patients will experience a serious further decline in services and the blame for that will be laid squarely at the door of politicians,” they add. As well as the select committee chairs – including Wollaston and Nicky Morgan – the letter has also been signed by former Treasury permanent secretary Nick Macpherson, and several former Conservative ministers including Nick Boles, Oliver Letwin and Anna Soubry. Labour signatories include business committee chair Rachel Reeves, Anna Turley and Ruth Smeeth. The government is already preparing a green paper on social care funding, expected to be published in the summer but the signatories say a broader approach is needed. Wollaston said: “We believe this is the best way to examine what funding is needed both now and into the long term and to seek a consensus on the options for sharing the costs.” May will be questioned about the proposal by the liaison committee of select committee chairs – which Wollaston heads – on Tuesday. Jeremy Hunt, the health secretary, has made a series of public comments in recent weeks spelling out the case for increased funding for the NHS – even if that means higher taxes. One option under consideration is an “NHS tax”, whose revenue would be earmarked for health. Speaking on ITV’s Peston on Sunday, Hunt said it was time to scrap what he had described as a feast or famine approach to funding the NHS. He called reports from the weekend that £4bn would be made available to the NHS in July “premature” but reiterated the need to consider higher taxes to make more cash available. “There’s no doubt that NHS staff right now are working unbelievably hard and they need to have some hope for the future,” he said. “But I think their real concern is this rather crazy way we have been funding the NHS over the last 20 years, which has really been feast or famine.” Asked about where extra resources could come from, he said: “We are a taxpayer-funded system, so in the end if we are going to get more resources into the NHS and social care system, it will have to come through the tax system and also through growth in the economy.” He underlined that he would like to see 10 year funding settlements for health, allowing longer-term planning, and upfront investment in technologies that could boost efficiency, such as new IT systems. A growing number of Conservative backbenchers have been raising the issue of the underfunding of healthcare. The foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, has been among those calling for an increase in NHS funding, raising it at cabinet level in a well-briefed intervention in January. Labour’s shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth expressed scepticism about the idea of a parliamentary commission. “A government could decide to make the tough decisions to fully fund the NHS if it had the political will to do so,” he said. “Gordon Brown more than trebled the NHS budget in cash terms when we had a Labour government. We didn’t need a parliamentary talking shop to come up with that.” The chancellor, Philip Hammond, has made the funding available for the NHS pay deal struck last week with nurses, midwives and other staff partly from Treasury reserves. But in his spring statement, he stressed he had already injected more cash into the NHS and social care. A comprehensive spending review, setting out plans across all departments three years ahead is due next summer, with the overall spending total likely to be announced in Hammond’s autumn budget."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/mar/28/which-football-clubs-or-stadiums-run-university-courses-the-knowledge","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-28T09:00:18Z","webTitle":"Which football clubs or stadiums run university courses? | The Knowledge","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/mar/28/which-football-clubs-or-stadiums-run-university-courses-the-knowledge","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/mar/28/which-football-clubs-or-stadiums-run-university-courses-the-knowledge","fields":{"headline":"Which football clubs or stadiums run university courses?","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"“I work in university admissions and noticed that the International University of Monaco is based in the principality’s Stade Louis II. Have any other football stadiums (or clubs) hosted, or even run, universities (excluding allowing universities to use their pitches),” asks Ruairí Cullen. Richard Jeffries has been studying hard to answer this question. “The obvious one that springs to mind is Bucks New University, which operates sports-related courses out of Wembley, Manchester City’s Etihad stadium and Burnley’s Turf Moor,” he writes. “In Wales, Cardiff Met university competes in the Welsh Premier League. While further afield, in South Africa’s Premier Soccer League, Bidvest Wits are another university-based club. And, slightly more tenuously, the Manchester United Class of 92 members are involved in a project to build a new university in Stretford.” Scott Leonard chips in with another. “I was a law student at Sheffield University and my exams took place (and so do the exams for many, if not all subjects) at Sheffield Wednesday’s Hillsborough twice a year. Before our exams, we would all have to wait on the concourse with adverts for chip butties and pints everywhere.” Ian Cade dons his cap and gown to take us to Central America. “The first team that sprang to mind was Club Universidad Nacional or the Pumas de la UNAM as they are more commonly known in Mexico, who are the team representing the National Autonomous University of Mexico. They have a pretty impressive heritage being seven-times league champions and three-times Concacaf Champions League winners, while Hugo Sánchez and Jorge Campos have turned out for them. And if that isn’t enough they play in the 1968 Olympic Stadium and the main campus is a Unesco world heritage site so they are pretty prestigious, and have a very dapper kit.” Onder Susam writes: “Fenerbahçe are opening Fenerbahçe University in the next academic year. I remember the project to be a sports-based college but it seems they are going to have a wide array of departments from engineering to finance along with sports science. There is also a Galatasaray University in İstanbul but it is not run by the club.” And we’re not done yet.

Free-kicks scored from way downtown “What is the longest distance from where a player has scored a direct free-kick?” asked John Sandy. Danny Michaux emailed in, although he was not alone, to remind us all of this wonderful effort – measured at 95 or 96 yards by most media outlets – from Paul Robinson in 2007 for Tottenham against Watford. He walloped a free-kick from deep inside his own half to then see it bounce over his former England colleague Ben Foster and into the net, much to his and the crowd’s surprise. Robinson felt only sympathy for his opposite number, but Spurs manager Martin Jol found it much more entertaining. “You can say now that we really are scoring from all angles at the moment,” he chuckled. The most managerial stints at the same club (part II) It is very hard to compete with Martin Allen’s five Barnet appointments on most levels … but Nedim Hasic points that Husref Musemic, who some might remember from a very short stint at Hearts in the late 1980s, is currently enjoying his fifth spell in charge of FK Sarajevo in the Bosnian Premier League, equalling the number of stints Allen has presided over in north London. Gustavo Bagattini then came along to put Allen to shame by bringing to our attention the former Brazil midfielder Givanildo de Oliveira who, since retiring from playing, can boast 47 separate appointments as a manager in 35 years. Two different clubs have named the manager on six occasions, as both Paysandu and Santa Cruz are surprisingly reliant on him to turn their fortunes around. At Paysandu, nicknamed “The Wolf”, he won five Campeonato Paraense titles over a period of 15 years. At Santa Cruz, however, he only has one trophy to his name. A little closer to home, Mark Stephenson draws our attention to Steve Coppell and his longevity at Selhurst Park, even though he has only been appointed Palace manager a comparatively pitiful four times. He writes: “Steve Coppell managed Crystal Palace on four separate occasions. While lower than Martin Allen, it would place him second as they were all permanent spells and he managed more than 550 league games, so well beyond Allen’s total. Also over that period he always replaced his permanent replacement. He was Palace manager every other time for 16 years.” Knowledge archive “I noticed that Stoke’s players have been using computer games to help with team bonding and communication,” noticed Liam Ellison in 2009. “Are there any other examples of teams using computer games to improve their chances?” We could point to one side who used computer games, but whether they truly boosted their chances is somewhat open to debate. The 1988 Soviet Union European Championship team was, as recounted in Simon Kuper’s excellent 1994 book Football Against the Enemy, selected on the back of players’ results in a number of computer games or tests created by Kyiv scientist Anatoly Zelentsov. “There were 40 candidates [for the squad],” said Zelentsov, “and with these tests we selected the first 20.” The games, also used to deduce prospective signings’ suitability for the Dynamo Kyiv side of the time, tested a range of attributes from nerve and endurance to reaction times and memory. “There are lots of ways of testing,” said Zelentsov. “But I prefer the computer.” More recently, in February 2009, Blackpool embraced a virtual reality game ostensibly to improve their players’ decision-making and technique. Call us cynical but perhaps generating some publicity that didn’t involve the subject of the club’s ownership was also a key intention.

His first piece, Transit, was four minutes long and it took four months to create. Now approaching 70, Alston has long graduated to a more prolific mode of production. Yet over the years, as dance has fashionably merged with theatre and performance art, he’s never lost his belief in the potency of pure, undiluted movement. In Mid Century Modern, the last item in his company’s current programme, Alston collates extracts from five decades of work, and it’s touching to see – even as his dance language and musical choices have grown progressively more expansive – how faithful he has remained to his purist creed. The earliest of the revivals, Nowhere Slowly, sees Alston occupying the compositional high ground still: every movement of this 1970 solo is etched strongly and sparely in space – precise circular runs that drill into tightly centred spins, leggy balances that drop into sudden, weighted stillness. A decade later, in his setting of Charles Amirkhanian’s sound poem Dutiful Ducks, Alston was widening his palette, floating long witty lines of dance that somehow managed to combine the hiccupping, anarchic rhythms of Amirkhanian’s text with a quasi-classical serenity. From there Alston’s language blossomed into the flamboyant, funky eclecticism of Gypsy Mix (2004), with its plundering of Indian, Latin and Balkan motifs, into the brightly resonating, choral architecture of Proverb (2006) and the gently farouche romanticism of Syrinx, his newly-created solo for Vidya Patel. If Alston always trusted in dance to speak for itself, he’s also had an acute and loving eye for dancers – Siobhan Davies, Michael Clark and Jonathan Goddard are among those indelibly imprinted on his past works – and for his latest piece he channels the talents of Liam Riddick, Nicholas Bodych and Elly Braund into a quietly profound portrait of the composer Robert Schumann. Some sections of Carnaval are pure expositions of the music (played live by pianist Jason Ridgway), yet Alston has rarely been more humane and more subtly observant than in the sections where he choreographs the two contrasted sides of Schumann’s temperament – the yearning lines of Bodyche’s solos reaching into darkly troubled spaces while Riddick, as his professionally assured alter ego, scatters the shadows with fast loquacious footwork. Braund as Clara Schumann is sweetly pitched in the middle – alternately flirtatious and uncertain – but the best of the work lies in the duets between the two men; the questioning quality of their touch, their glances of complicity and interrogation sensitively conveying the composer’s internal drama of creativity, self-doubt and self-examination. Opening the programme is the latest work from Martin Lawrance, formerly one of Alston’s favourite dancers and now his associate choreographer. I’ve always admired the “joinery” in Lawrance’s work, the fine, inventive detail with which he connects individual movements. Here, working with two frenetic scores by Michael Gordon and Damian LeGassick, Lawrance appears to double the heart rate of the music, creating duets of slicing, dicing complexity, and solos that kick and buck from the sheer compression of their energy. Cut and Run feels true to its title, a work constantly one step ahead of itself as it races towards its very satisfying finish."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/mar/25/jeremy-corbyn-regret-antisemitic-incidents-jews","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-25T16:54:56Z","webTitle":"Corbyn’s ‘regret’ over an antisemitic mural doesn’t go remotely far enough | Matthew d’Ancona\r\n","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/25/jeremy-corbyn-regret-antisemitic-incidents-jews","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/25/jeremy-corbyn-regret-antisemitic-incidents-jews","fields":{"headline":"Corbyn’s ‘regret’ over an antisemitic mural doesn’t go remotely far enough","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"If, as August Bebel, the 19th-century German leftist, warned, antisemitism is the “socialism of fools”, then it is becoming ever more pressing to ask whether the man who fancies himself our next prime minister might be rather foolish. Jeremy Corbyn’s gift for empathy does much to explain his remarkable electoral performance last June. But his wholly inadequate response to the Tower Hamlets mural controversy suggests that this gift may have clear – and alarming – limits. To recap: in 2012, a wall painting by the street artist Mear One in east London was designated for removal by the local authority. Using grotesquely antisemitic imagery, it depicted Jewish financiers playing a Monopoly-style board game on the backs of naked people. On the artist’s Facebook page, Corbyn posted the following response to this decision: “Why? You are in good company. Rockerfeller [sic] destroyed Diego Viera’s [Rivera’s] mural because it includes a picture of Lenin.” Last week, Luciana Berger, the Labour MP for Liverpool Wavertree, asked the leader’s office for an explanation. The initial statement read as follows: “In 2012, Jeremy was responding to concerns about the removal of public art on grounds of freedom of speech. However, the mural was offensive, used antisemitic imagery, which has no place in our society, and it is right that it was removed.” This made no sense, since the point of Corbyn’s original post was that the removal of the mural was unjustified. A second statement was issued, in which the Labour leader declared: “I sincerely regret that I did not look more closely at the image I was commenting on.” Again, this fell far short of what was required. “Regret” is the word politicians use when they wish to avoid apologising. And how “closely” did Corbyn have to look at the mural, which resembled a homage to the Nazi newspaper Der Stürmer, to spot its vicious hostility to Jews? At this stage of the argument, Corbyn’s supporters object in two ways. The first is to engage in furious “whataboutery”: what about racism on the right? What about Conservative prejudice? To which I reply: having spent 20 years calling out Tory xenophobia and (more recently) Brexiteer bigotry, I don’t need permission to question Labour’s attitude to antisemitism. Second, it is customary to dismiss questions about the leadership’s response to antisemitism as wilful distraction or even a means of sabotaging Corbyn’s position and plans. Last September, Len McCluskey, the general secretary of Unite, described previous allegations of antisemitism as “mood music that was created by people who were trying to undermine Jeremy Corbyn”. The film director Ken Loach put it no less pithily: “It’s funny these stories suddenly appeared when Jeremy Corbyn became leader, isn’t it?” The real question is otherwise: why does Corbyn – admirably proactive in tackling other forms of prejudice – seem to squirm and dither when confronted with allegations of antisemitism? As Richard Gold, a party member active in the anti-racist Engage campaign, put it in his submission to Shami Chakrabarti’s inquiry into Labour antisemitism: “[It is] as though being unpleasant to Jews … should be excused or minimised, treated merely as rudeness or bad manners, rather than racist behaviour.” In his recent book, Contemporary Left Antisemitism, David Hirsh argued that the problem was turbo-charged by three events in 2001: the collapse of the Middle East peace process, the anti-imperialist rhetoric that followed 9/11 and the UN conference in Durban at which “Zionism” was designated a form of white racism. This set the stage for, in Hirsh’s words, “an antisemitism which positions Jews themselves as ‘oppressors’ and … those who develop hostile narratives about Jews as ‘oppressed’.” In the great discourse of left identity politics, Jews were now definitively on the wrong side of the line: powerful, white, aligned with imperialism. According to this twisted logic, Mear One’s mural could not, axiomatically, be judged racist – any more than Ken Livingstone’s outbursts, the antisemitic content posted on social media by the Labour MP Naz Shah, or the alleged hostility to Jews at the Oxford University Labour Club. The leadership might be forced by media or political pressure to take action against such conduct. But it manifestly did so with an eye to optics rather than as a matter of principle. Antisemitism is on the rise all over the world. According to the Community Security Trust, a record number of antisemitic incidents were reported in the UK last year. Why does this bother Corbyn as little as it seems to? Does he believe in universal rights and equality of worth, or not? The fact that the Labour leader appears to regard allegations of antisemitism as an irritant rather than a fundamental issue says nothing good about him. In this respect, at least, the writing is upon the wall."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"books/2018/mar/25/philip-kerr-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-25T14:51:25Z","webTitle":"Philip Kerr obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/mar/25/philip-kerr-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/mar/25/philip-kerr-obituary","fields":{"headline":"Philip Kerr obituary","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Berlin held a great fascination for the author Philip Kerr, who has died aged 62 of cancer: it was a place where the impact of evil upon essentially decent people was felt especially keenly. His morally ambiguous fictional private detective Bernie Gunther first appeared in March Violets (1989), set in the city in 1936, after the Nazis’ rise to power, and the first of his Berlin Noir trilogy. Each book, he later admitted, was aimed at painting Gunther into a corner “so that he can’t cross the floor without getting paint on his shoes”. A German Requiem (1991) ended the trilogy by taking events to the end of the second world war and Vienna, but the lure of his protagonist and Berlin, which proves as much a character as its citizens, remained strong. The One from the Other (2006) was the first in a run of 10 more Berlin Noir novels. If the Dead Rise Not (2009) won the Ellis Peters Historic Crime award, and Greeks Bearing Gifts, set in 1957, is due to be published next month. In the intervening years, Kerr produced standalone books, starting with the ambitious A Philosophical Investigation (1992), which married cyber-punk crime with the philosophy of Ludwig Wittgenstein. A complex and demanding tale of a serial killer, it led to him being listed alongside Iain Banks and AL Kennedy as one of Granta’s Best Young British Novelists under 40. But critical acclaim was not matched by sales. His commercial breakthrough arrived only in 1995 with Gridiron, a Towering Inferno-style action story. Gunther was not Kerr’s only serial crime solver. In 2014 his love of football led him to embark on the first of three Scott Manson thrillers about a Premier League football coach and all-round fixer. Born in Edinburgh, Philip was the son of William Kerr, a building planner, and his wife, Ann (nee Brodie). His parents had converted from the Free Church of Scotland to the evangelical Baptist church, deeming it more “family-friendly”. It was not an easy fit for a boy with an aversion to water. “I could not swim or even bear to have my head under water and consequently the spectacle of full immersion baptism – and by extension, the very idea of washing away the sin that was required to make my peace with Jesus – was horrifying to me,” he later wrote. As a result, from an early age he knew that “Jesus and I were not going to get along.” The final break came after his father’s death. When he saw a white horse galloping across a field six months later, Philip, by now a trainee tax lawyer aged 22, realised he needed to rebel against the path chosen for him. He read widely, including “unsuitable” novels hidden by his parents. At the age of 12 he stole the key to a cupboard in which DH Lawrence’s Lady Chatterley’s Lover was hidden. This resulted in his first paid work as a writer. Aware his father would miss his copy of the book and that his friends wanted to read it, Kerr wrote his own version, The Duchess of the Daisies, which he rented out for “the edification of his schoolmates”. Resentment of the church became entwined with an uncomfortable relationship with his birthplace, of which he said: “If you want to scar a child for life then bring it up in the city of John Knox.” At the upmarket Melville college his dark complexion led to racist bullying by his sandy-haired contemporaries and masters. The experience reinforced his sense of exclusion and in later years he described himself as a “deracinated Scot”. When he was 15 the family moved to the Midlands. His time at Northamptonshire grammar proved happier, and he returned to it for speech days. Though he had wanted to study English at Birmingham University, Kerr bowed to paternal pressure and took up law. After a year in a kibbutz, Kerr returned to Birmingham for a postgraduate degree in jurisprudence. After he left law, work as an advertising copywriter included a spell at Saatchi and Saatchi – though he had a tendency to get fired. While colleagues enjoyed boozy lunches, he preferred to be in the London Library, where he worked on five unpublished “sub-Martin Amis” novels until turning to crime in March Violets. By the time Gridiron was published he was married to the journalist and author Jane Thynne, whom he had met while he was working as a gossip columnist on the London Evening Standard, and with whom he had three children, William, Charlie and Naomi. Though the film rights to Gridiron and other novels were sold, none made it further than development. Steven Spielberg optioned the fantasy series The Children of the Lamp (2004-11), written under the name PB Kerr. The author regarded his relationship with Hollywood with wry amusement and enjoyed recounting anecdotes about La La Land. While waiting for Tom Cruise in the actor’s trailer, he found himself fretting about being late for a further meeting that day, with Robert De Niro. His commitment to research led him into dangerous situations, sometimes in the seamier areas of Berlin, or as when travelling with the St Petersburg police for Dead Meat (1993), his thriller set among the Russian mafia. One particularly frightening day ended with the discovery of holes in the flak jacket he had been wearing. They marked where the previous wearer had been shot. Kerr’s non-fiction works ranged from a research guide to anthologies of feuds and lies. He continued working until recently, copyediting his last novel, due for publication next year. He is survived by Jane and his children. • Philip Ballantyne Kerr, writer, born 22 February 1956; died 23 March 2018"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"environment/2018/mar/27/specieswatch-spring-ice-has-made-life-hard-for-the-common-frog","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-27T20:30:02Z","webTitle":"Specieswatch: spring ice has made life hard for the common frog","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/mar/27/specieswatch-spring-ice-has-made-life-hard-for-the-common-frog","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/mar/27/specieswatch-spring-ice-has-made-life-hard-for-the-common-frog","fields":{"headline":"Specieswatch: spring ice has made life hard for the common frog","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The common frog Rana temporaria is having a difficult spring. The extreme cold at the beginning of March trapped many under ice. A lot continued to breathe through their skin, but after several days some died from lack of oxygen. The survivors then got breeding under way in many ponds, only for another three-day cold snap to halt proceedings. Some ponds still have no spawn, while in others the adults have already left piles of jelly to take their chance. After years of observation – at least in parts of central England – it appears frogs that breed in shallow ponds that often dry out in the summer are the first to lay their eggs. The tadpoles have the advantage that there are few predators in a seasonal pond, but to survive they may have to develop extremely quickly if the spring and early summer are unduly dry. It seems hardly credible that the adults sense this and breed early, but in many deeper ponds that are never allowed to dry out, particularly in gardens, the frogs habitually mate later. Both breeding strategies seem to work, but which is most successful is hard to tell. Perhaps it varies each year depending on the weather."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2018/mar/25/paul-mccartney-hails-john-lennon-stars-join-us-anti-gun-rallies","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-25T10:37:39Z","webTitle":"Paul McCartney hails John Lennon as stars join US anti-gun rallies","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/mar/25/paul-mccartney-hails-john-lennon-stars-join-us-anti-gun-rallies","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/mar/25/paul-mccartney-hails-john-lennon-stars-join-us-anti-gun-rallies","fields":{"headline":"Paul McCartney hails John Lennon as stars join US anti-gun rallies","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Paul McCartney has remembered his former Beatles bandmate John Lennon at a march against gun violence in New York. McCartney took part in the student-led March for Our Lives rally which started close to the Manhattan apartment building where Lennon was shot in 1980. “One of my best friends was killed in gun violence, right around here, so it’s important to me,” he told CNN. Asked what he hoped could be accomplished by the event on Saturday, McCartney opened his jacket to show the slogan emblazoned on his black T-shirt: “We can end gun violence.” Other celebrities who have personally been affected by gun violence also joined protests across the US. Jennifer Hudson, who performed The Times They Are a-Changin’ to cap a rally in Washington DC, alluded to the shooting deaths of her mother, brother and seven-year-old nephew in 2008. “We’ve all lost somebody ... We’ve all got a purpose. And we want what? We want change,” she said, encouraging the vast crowd to sing along with her. Hudson, appearing tearful as she concluded her performance, was backed by members of a Washington choir and survivors of last month’s high school shooting in Parkland, Florida. Students from the school led rallies attended by hundreds of thousands of people in the US capital and other cities around the country. Stars attending the Washington event included George and Amal Clooney and Kate Capshaw and Steven Spielberg, who helped fund the protests with a combined $1m (£710,000) donation. Kim Kardashian and Kanye West, Glenn Close, Cher, Jimmy Fallon and Dennis Rodman also attended. Common, Miley Cyrus, Andra Day, Vic Mensa, Demi Lovato, Lin-Manuel Miranda, Ben Platt and Ariana Grande performed in Washington, and Rita Ora took to the stage in Los Angeles. A concert by Grande in Manchester last year was bombed, killing 22 people. “This song is dedicated to Stephon Clark, Decynthia Clements and all the unarmed black men and women killed by police weapons,” Mensa said before performing Now We Could Be Free.Amy Schumer, the comedian and cousin of the Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer, spoke to Parkland survivors attending the Los Angeles rally, telling them the violence they endured had to stop."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/mar/25/australian-grand-prix-sebastian-vettel-wins-f1-2018-season-opener","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-25T07:19:34Z","webTitle":"Australian Grand Prix: Sebastian Vettel wins F1 opener with Lewis Hamilton second","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/mar/25/australian-grand-prix-sebastian-vettel-wins-f1-2018-season-opener","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/mar/25/australian-grand-prix-sebastian-vettel-wins-f1-2018-season-opener","fields":{"headline":"Australian Grand Prix: Sebastian Vettel wins F1 opener with Lewis Hamilton second","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Disconsolate and bewildered was certainly not how Lewis Hamilton will have expected to feel as the first race of the new Formula One season to come to a close. Dominant all weekend, buoyant and invigorated after a masterful qualifying, the defending champion looked quietly confident that his attempt to take a fifth title would be off to a winning start. It was optimism that was shattered in a matter of seconds as Ferrari’s Sebastian Vettel opened the year with a win, just as he did last season. Hamilton would doubtless have been less bemused had he been passed on track. However, after the British driver dominated from pole for 20 of the race’s 58 laps, Vettel took the lead by taking advantage of pitting under the virtual safety car and emerging in front. It was far from the most satisfying way to take the win but Vettel, who admitted Ferrari do not have the same pace as Mercedes, grasped it with both hands. Mercedes had pitted Hamilton on lap 20 to match the stop by Kimi Raikkonen, who was in second and finished in third place. At the time Hamilton had a comfortable lead of more than six seconds to Vettel. His car had looked strong and untroubled in the clean air at the front of the field. Ferrari kept Vettel out, however, and when Romain Grosjean’s retirement at the side of the track triggered the virtual safety car on lap 26, Ferrari pounced to take advantage of the cars on track being forced to drive to a slower lap time, enabling them to send the German out in the lead. “Even now I don’t understand what happened,” said Hamilton. “I did everything I believed I needed to. Disbelief was how I felt from that moment until the end.” The team had not given him any special instructions in order to cover the potential advantage that Ferrari would enjoy of pitting under the virtual safety car and ultimately the Mercedes team principal, Toto Wolff, admitted they had made a mistake. Wolff said the software they had used to calculate the gap Hamilton needed to establish to ensure he remained ahead had delivered an erroneous number. The team thought Hamilton had time in hand even with a virtual safety car and so had not advised him to push harder and extend the gap. “The software or system we have been using for five years just gave us the wrong number,” Wolff said. “He did nothing wrong. It was down to a software bug or an algorithm that was simply wrong.” Hamilton’s confusion after the race was understandable. He had led from pole and looked entirely in control for the opening stint. He opened a gap ahead of the two chasing Ferraris and at no point did either look as though they had the pace to close it, let alone attempt to pass. Overtaking is notoriously difficult at Albert Park and once Vettel had made it to the front, Hamilton could pressure him but do little else. Vettel admitted Ferrari had enjoyed some good fortune. “We got a bit lucky with the timing of the safety car,” he said. “If you are at the front you can control the race, we know overtaking is difficult. Lewis was probably the quickest of the three of us but that’s the way it goes.” Hamilton must be wondering quite what he must do to claim another win in Australia. He has two here but has failed four times in the past five years to convert pole to victory. In qualifying he had been dominant too – he was seven-tenths clear of Vettel in third. Mercedes’ confidence in their car has been justified but this will be a blow to the trust they had in their decision making processes. For Vettel it is the perfect start to a campaign that, should he ultimately win, would give him five titles, equalling Juan Manuel Fangio. He had been circumspect during testing and in the buildup to the race. Although outclassed by Hamilton in qualifying he had been confident that the Scuderia would show better pace in the race and he proved that they are again intent on doing everything possible to take the fight to their rivals, especially while not enjoying quite the same level of performance as the Mercedes. Hamilton had joked after qualifying that he had wanted “to wipe the smile off” Vettel’s face, which the German did not find amusing. Instead, he said he preferred to focus on the race and, where it mattered, he has come away with the points, leaving Mercedes to examine of how such form in qualifying and early race dominance left their title-defending driver scratching his head as to why he had not finished on the top step. Behind the leaders Red Bull’s Daniel Ricciardo made a spirited recovery to finish in fourth place from eighth on the grid and although his team-mate Max Verstappen could manage only sixth after an uncharacteristic spin, their car looked strong. McLaren enjoyed their best result since 2016 with Fernando Alonso making the most of their new Renault engine to claim fifth. Nico Hulkenberg’s Renault was in seventh in front of Valtteri Bottas who had recovered from 15th on the grid, with the second McLaren of Stoffel Vandoorne in ninth and the second Renault of Carlos Sainz in 10th."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/2018/mar/25/an-unashamed-disgrace-ball-tampering-cheats-australian-cricket-fans","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-25T02:47:35Z","webTitle":"An unashamed disgrace: ball tampering cheats Australian cricket fans | Kate O'Halloran","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/mar/25/an-unashamed-disgrace-ball-tampering-cheats-australian-cricket-fans","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/mar/25/an-unashamed-disgrace-ball-tampering-cheats-australian-cricket-fans","fields":{"headline":"An unashamed disgrace: ball tampering cheats Australian cricket fans","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"It could be the darkest day in Australian cricket history. The nation’s men’s team has been caught red-handed, ball-tampering in the third Test of the tour in South Africa. Worst of all, Steve Smith admitted in his press conference afterwards that he had conspired with the most junior member of the team, Cameron Bancroft, to do so, as a way to “get an advantage” against the Proteas. Extraordinary, unprecedented, and an unashamed disgrace. Whatever one thinks of cricket, integrity is written into the heart of this game. Australia has a history of coming down hard on nations perceived as, or caught, cheating, and its fans have every right to feel betrayed by its hypocritical national team. Make no mistake, this was, as former captain Michael Clarke was unafraid to say on live television, “pre-meditated, blatant cheating”. Cricket fans will not stand for that, and Cricket Australia must act in accordance. All players involved must be sacked, but recognition must also be given to the fact that it was the most inexperienced player in the team – at just eight Tests – who was instructed by the leadership team to cheat. James Sutherland fronted the cameras at the MCG this morning, a picture of raw emotion. He said he felt as all Australian fans would this morning, “extremely shocked and disappointed”. This was not just PR spin, he was visibly upset, his voice shaking towards the end of the grilling. This saga has cut him, and the integrity of Australian cricket, to the core, in clear breach as it is of what he described as not just the “laws, but spirit of the game”. Still, he was measured in the midst of the outrage he too was feeling. He insisted that CA have a responsibility to understand the issue more deeply before any action could be mooted or taken. On that note, he specified that Iain Roy, Australia’s head of integrity, was on a plane to South Africa, set to land in the next day. His brief, Sutherland clarified, would be to gather the relevant information and understand better the situation that has unfolded: namely, who was involved and how deep the corruption runs. The footage does Australia no favours. With Bancroft having been caught on television roughing the ball with tape, Darren Lehmann is depicted relaying a message to 12th man Peter Handscomb, who then enters the field to deliver a message to Bancroft. Subsequently, Bancroft is shown hiding the tape down his pants, before lying to on-field umpires that he was using only cloth. Panicked response or not, the Australians’ first instinct was to hide the evidence, and lie. The coach also either endorsed those actions, or has no control over a rogue team. Either is a disastrous outcome. Steve Smith has told assembled media that he deserves to continue to lead his team. “I need to take control of the ship,” he said. “But this is certainly something I’m not proud of and something that I can hopefully learn from and come back strong from.” Such arrogance shows that Smith has no comprehension of the betrayal he and his team have committed, a blatant act of cheating that brings the nation’s past and indeed future into disrepute. “I can promise you this is the first time it’s happened,” added Smith. But, by now, the words of this team mean little. Bancroft himself admitted that he knew hundreds of cameras were around, and that he was “nervous” as a result. That is both extraordinary stupidity, and a worrying indication of team priorities. When winning comes at any cost – sledging, aggression, even ball-tampering – then this team has definitively lost its way. It has also lost the Australian public’s respect, and trust, most likely permanently."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2018/mar/24/northern-ireland-south-korea-international-friendly-match-report","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-24T19:17:13Z","webTitle":"Northern Ireland’s Paul Smyth fires Michael O’Neill’s second coming","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/mar/24/northern-ireland-south-korea-international-friendly-match-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/mar/24/northern-ireland-south-korea-international-friendly-match-report","fields":{"headline":"Northern Ireland’s Paul Smyth fires Michael O’Neill’s second coming","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Wearing the away kit colours that reflected the blue skies above them, Paul Smyth sent the Northern Ireland faithful into seventh heaven on a sunny spring‑like afternoon in Belfast. Only four minutes after coming on, the 20-year-old Queens Park Rangers winger shook off his South Korean marker just inside the penalty area and fired home the winner on his international debut. He marked it with an acrobatic backwards flip as Windsor Park celebrated. Smyth’s dream start as a Northern Ireland player also marked an upbeat second coming for Michael O’Neill, who only a few months ago appeared to be taking over at Scotland instead. The manager said it should be remembered that Smyth played an under-21s game against Spain only 48 hours earlier. “I Just asked him had he got 10 minutes’ running in him because he played 90 minutes the other night. I told him to go and enjoy it. He’s played on that pitch many times so he’s probably better used to the surface than any of the other players. “He loved it, you could just see. His enthusiasm for the game is infectious, the boys love him,” O’Neill added. Smyth’s strike transformed what was heading to be a fair, evenly matched 1-1 draw between the hosts and World Cup-bound South Korea into a friendly victory that should give O’Neill and his squad a major boost. Initially, though, the South Koreans were a neat, tidy passing unit that appeared about to take Northern Ireland apart. Tottenham’s Son Heung-min created their seventh-minute opener by cleverly lifting the ball into the penalty area for Kwon Chang-hoon to shoot past Trevor Carson. The home goalkeeper then managed to stop Son himself making it 2-0 soon afterwards when the Motherwell goalkeeper blocked his shot. A minute later a Jamie Ward effort was ruled out for offside but Northern Ireland did not have to wait too long for an equaliser. In the 20th minute they crafted a clever free-kick about 25 yards out. Ward skipped over the ball but kept running down the right and Oliver Norwood played him in with a low pass for the winger to strike a hard and low cross into the box, which clipped off Kim Min-jae for an own goal. The quick recovery by O’Neill’s men created a more evenly fought contest up until half-time. But after the interval South Korea enjoyed two spells of sustained pressure. A Lee Jae-sung shot was deflected away for a corner, then Carson got down to his left to save Park Joo-ho’s deflected strike, which could easily have ended up in the net. Son, who was subject to booing throughout his time on the pitch, then cut in from the left but his shot was blocked by defender Conor McLaughlin. Shin Tae-yong’s players will have to be far more ruthless and clinical in front of goal when they face Germany, Sweden and Mexico in Group F in Russia this summer, and as with the first half, there was a Northern Ireland revival. The key substitution came in the 82nd minute when Smyth returned to the pitch where last season his performances on the wing helped Linfield win the Irish Premiership. Now the West Belfast-born player was on an international stage and he latched onto QPR team-mate Conor Washington’s header and showed strength and guile to score the winner with a low drive. Fittingly it was Smyth who enjoyed the very last kick of the game after he cut in from the wing and forced a save from Kim. The Northern Ireland fans sang “Paul Smyth’s on fire” – the tune they normally belt out in praise of Wigan’s Will Grigg. They have found a new striking hero."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"music/2018/mar/24/beatles-unseen-photographs-baltimore-washington-mike-mitchell-auction","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-24T17:59:34Z","webTitle":"Unseen photographs of Beatles in US fetch £253,200 at auction","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/mar/24/beatles-unseen-photographs-baltimore-washington-mike-mitchell-auction","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/mar/24/beatles-unseen-photographs-baltimore-washington-mike-mitchell-auction","fields":{"headline":"Unseen photographs of Beatles in US fetch £253,200 at auction","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"A teenage portfolio of more than 350 previously unseen photos of The Beatles’ early invasion of America has fetched £253,200 at auction on Merseyside.

Speaking at the start of this international break, Luigi Di Biagio likened the Azzurri’s friendlies against Argentina and England to a “mini-World Cup”. He was clutching at straws, yet few would fault him for doing so. As the caretaker manager of a football team still recovering from their first failure to qualify for the real tournament in six decades, Di Biagio needed, at a minimum, to bring a little fresh optimism to the role. Even after a 2-0 defeat against Argentina at the Etihad on Friday, he continued to see his glass half full. Di Biagio insisted Italy were unfortunate not to have taken the lead and pointed out that he had given several players their international debuts. “This is the start of a new era,” he asserted. Is it truly, though? Or is this nothing more than an awkward interlude? Di Biagio’s role has not been confirmed beyond these two games, with the Italian Football Federation openly courting more high-profile individuals. Any lasting impact of these friendlies was most likely to be felt by the interim manager himself. Promoted into this role after a combined seven years coaching the under-20s and then under-21s – whom he steered to the European Championship semi-finals last year – Di Biagio has been granted the briefest of windows to prove himself in his first coaching role with a senior team. His desire to grasp that opportunity was apparent from his team selection against Argentina. If his experience with the youth teams left him well-positioned to introduce fresh faces, then in practice Di Biagio still kept faith with much of the old guard: 18 of the players called up to his first squad had featured in the two-leg defeat against Sweden. Debuts were granted to Federico Chiesa and Patrick Cutrone, along with second caps for Bryan Cristante and Lorenzo Pellegrini, but only the first of those made it into the starting XI. Meanwhile, Di Biagio called Gigi Buffon out of international retirement. He spoke about the positive influence such a player could have on a young team but also acknowledged that he wanted to field his strongest side possible. Perhaps we will see a more experimental lineup against England. Despite warm reviews from within the football federation, it was always a long shot that Di Biagio would make this job his own. The likes of Carlo Ancelotti, Roberto Mancini, Claudio Ranieri and, reportedly, Antonio Conte are being sounded out for the role. Whoever it is, the need for rejuvenation will remain. Buffon’s return will be short-lived, with a friendly against the Netherlands in Turin this June expected to serve as his farewell party. At the other end of the pitch, a jolt is required to restore attacking potency to a side who have scored only three goals in the past seven games. Italy can boast potential in abundance up front but that is not the same thing as proven talent. Chiesa, son of the much-loved Parma and Sampdoria forward Enrico, is a versatile and technically gifted player who has started 26 Serie A games for Fiorentina this season despite only turning 20 in October. But he is not yet a prolific scorer and still has other flaws to his game, including a tendency to dribble with his head down. Cutrone, three months younger, has likewise outstripped expectations by earning a regular spot in Milan’s first XI. His self‑belief and knack for finding space in crowded penalty areas were in evidence even during that brief cameo against Argentina. Yet he struggles to hold the ball up and, as such, can go missing in games – as he did in the first leg of Milan’s Europa League defeat against Arsenal. Such imperfections are natural in young players. The key for Italy will be to find a coaching staff that can highlight the strengths and minimise the flaws of this next generation. There is certainly plenty to work with. Beyond those already mentioned, we should not forget that Gianluigi Donnarumma has already won four caps in goal at 19 years old. Daniele Rugani is maturing into a more consistent centre‑back at Juventus, where he will be joined this summer by the impressive Mattia Caldara from Atalanta. Both players are 23, as is Alessio Romagnoli, a regular for three seasons at Milan in the same position. Whether Di Biagio gets to play a further role in their development remains to be seen. Although his prospects of retaining the top job look slim, it has been mooted that he could instead become part of his successor’s coaching staff. Alessandro Costacurta, the man who has the job of finding Italy’s next full-time manager, has promised a decision by 20 May. For now, the Azzurri have the final game of a very mini-World Cup to attend to."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"environment/2018/mar/25/how-can-we-save-the-countrys-birds","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-25T16:45:28Z","webTitle":"How can we save the country’s birds? | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/mar/25/how-can-we-save-the-countrys-birds","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/mar/25/how-can-we-save-the-countrys-birds","fields":{"headline":"How can we save the country’s birds?","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Thank you Jonathan Franzen (Why do birds matter?

Comments 204 entries, almost no mistakes. Of 18 clues mentioned, your favourite in a close race was ‘Accompanist maybe Bostridge used in track for Winterreise?’ (PIANISTE), one ahead of ‘I’ve got the Queen behind on tow? I’m only joking!’ (LEG-PULLER). A number of you said you’d been unable to find SINGULT in Chambers. It’s one of a group of ‘unusual‘ words the publishers rather pointlessly highlighted in the 12th edition, disgracefully omitted by mistake in the 13th and then quietly restored in the 14th. I’m afraid I simply can’t mention it whenever I use one of these in a puzzle. All I can suggest is that you acquire each new edition as it appears, an expensive business I admit. PENNY-A-LINER clearly found favour as the clue word, even though, in practice, the number of possible ways of treating it proved limited. Its first three letters, and the possibilities offered by ‘hack’ as an anagram indicator, were both obvious incentives to producing ‘&amp; lit.’ clues. I don’t recall a competition in which so many of the quoted clues were of this type. I have no objection to these at all. Well handled (the key) they can be extremely neat and clever, and knowing this some of you strive to produce an ‘&amp; lit.’ almost every month. For some reason this time that old bugbear the noun anagram indicator turned up quite a lot. I simply cannot accept, as some setters do, that, for example, ‘perennial problem’ can indicate an anagram of ‘perennial’. Another practice that has me reaching for my red pen is the failure to distinguish transitive from intransitive usage. This came up quite often with the intransitive active ‘scribbling’ being used adjectivally but unjustifiably to mean ‘scribbled’ (transitive passive). Please be warned. Overall, though, the quality of clues submitted was very high, making the judging process quite tough. In conclusion, I might mention that many years ago I saw a rejoneador (name forgotten) performing in the famous bullring at Ronda (with Antonio Ordóñez on the same bill). He entered the arena splendidly accoutred and riding a magnificent horse, in marked contrast to the wretched old nags, heavily padded, on which the picadors were mounted. I am no fan of the corrida but it was an undeniably impressive spectacle."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/mar/26/facebook-data-misuse-cambridge-analytica","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-26T10:00:22Z","webTitle":"Facebook told me it would act swiftly on data misuse – in 2015 | Harry Davies","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/26/facebook-data-misuse-cambridge-analytica","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/26/facebook-data-misuse-cambridge-analytica","fields":{"headline":"Facebook told me it would act swiftly on data misuse – in 2015","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Shortly after the US midterm elections in 2014 – and back when Donald Trump was busy launching the seventh series of Celebrity Apprentice – I received a tip about a little-known British company known as Strategic Communication Laboratories, or SCL. At the time I was working on the Guardian’s investigations desk, and I heard the company’s “election management” consultancy was branching out into US voter targeting with a curious new product and corporate identity. This, I would later discover, was Cambridge Analytica. After that tip came a small cache of documents. And in December 2014, I wrote to SCL asking about its commercial relationship with a Cambridge University academic, Aleksandr Kogan, and its apparent acquisition of a vast database of personal information harvested from tens of millions of Facebook users by Kogan’s company, Global Science Research (GSR). At this stage I didn’t know whose political campaign it was working on in the US. It seemed to have acquired the data, but how was it using it? I now regret putting the story on the back burner, but when SCL repeatedly refused to engage, that’s what happened. Back then, few had heard of this company. Fast forward to autumn 2015 and a source pointed me in the direction of a Politico article that made a connection between SCL and Cambridge Analytica. By then it was offering psychological methods for targeting voters to the Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz. So I returned to my investigation and in December 2015 reported that SCL had paid GSR to harvest Facebook users’ data via online questionnaires. GSR boasted it owned “a massive data pool of 40+ million individuals across the United States – for each of whom we have generated detailed characteristic and trait profiles.” Last week, Facebook’s CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, was forced to acknowledge the privacy breach and apologise for the company’s mistakes, embarking on an uncharacteristic media blitz. Yet when I first asked Facebook about the way this data had been siphoned from the social network, the company had little to say. Apparently, it didn’t anticipate the significance the dataset would take on. But then nor did I. Before we published that story in 2015, I had approached Facebook’s public relations representatives in London to inform them of the allegations. I asked them a series of questions, including: “Is Facebook concerned that highly personal data about a large set of its users is now being exploited for experimental political campaigning purposes?” They didn’t answer. After declining to comment on the record, they emailed a few lines on background: “Facebook has a clear data use policy that makes it clear how the information people choose to add to Facebook is used.” Their repetition of the word “clear” only made this feel more doubtful. Hours after the story was published, Facebook’s PRs got in touch seeking more information, and later that evening I heard from the mothership itself when a senior, California-based employee emailed a statement. “We are carefully investigating this situation,” it read, “misleading people or misusing their information is a direct violation of our policies and we will take swift action against companies that do.” In time, we would come to understand just what Facebook – one of the world’s most powerful companies – meant by “swift action”. In early 2016, I continued to investigate Cambridge Analytica, pursuing leads about its parent company, SCL, and talking to former employees and clients. I interviewed Alexander Nix, Cambridge Analytica’s then CEO and a director of SCL. He refused to say whether he was or wasn’t working in the UK on the leave campaign. (Little did I know SCL had deep ties to the digital firm AggregateIQ, as the Observer reported on Sunday, to which Vote Leave would funnel 40% of its spending.) “We’ve been talking to all sorts of political parties about different matters in the UK,” he told me. In the US, Nix said that “hundreds of thousands of people across America” had taken Cambridge Analytica’s online questionnaires, but claimed respondents’ Facebook accounts were not accessed. He was dismissive of the privacy concerns posed by political campaigns hoovering up voters’ personal data: “If the individuals wish to remain more private then they shouldn’t consent to give up their information.” As I read through Nix’s comments in my notes two years later, I am struck by the similarity between his logic and that of Facebook. In rejecting the media’s characterisation of this large-scale privacy violation as a “data breach”, Facebook claims “everyone involved” in the 2014 data-siphoning exercise had given their consent. “People knowingly provided their information,” the company claimed. As with its interpretation of the word “clear”, Facebook seems to have a skewed understanding of what “knowingly” really means. Facebook’s senior executives may now be feeling apologetic, “outraged” even. But in January 2016, as Trump surged in the polls, Facebook’s COO, Sheryl Sandberg, told investors the 2016 election was “a big deal in terms of ad spend”. In other words, a major commercial opportunity. The ability to target voters, she said, was key: “Using Facebook and Instagram ads you can target by congressional district, you can target by interest, you can target by demographics or any combination of those,” she boasted. “And we’re seeing politicians at all levels really take advantage of that targeting.” It’s perhaps worth remembering, then, that until recently Facebook was encouraging political operatives to take full advantage of its garden of surveillance. And while aspects of the Cambridge Analytica affair may be surprising, and offer a disturbing glimpse into the shadows, the routine exploitation of information about our lives – about who we are – is what’s powering Facebook. It’s the behemoth’s lifeblood. • Harry Davies is a former Guardian researcher"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"politics/2018/mar/25/labour-wants-to-amend-brexit-bill-to-give-parliament-more-say","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-25T21:30:12Z","webTitle":"Labour wants to amend Brexit bill to give parliament more say","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/mar/25/labour-wants-to-amend-brexit-bill-to-give-parliament-more-say","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/mar/25/labour-wants-to-amend-brexit-bill-to-give-parliament-more-say","fields":{"headline":"Labour wants to amend Brexit bill to give parliament more say","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Labour will table amendments to the government’s EU withdrawal bill aimed at preventing the UK from crashing out of Europe without a deal if parliament rejects the outcome of the Brexit talks, Keir Starmer will say on Monday. In a speech in Birmingham, the shadow Brexit secretary will pledge to work with colleagues from other parties to try to amend the government’s key piece of Brexit legislation in an attempt to strengthen parliament’s say. Labour is keen to regain the initiative on Brexit after Jeremy Corbyn sacked Owen Smith as shadow Northern Ireland secretary on Friday for breaking with the shadow cabinet line by calling for a public poll on the final deal. The Brexit secretary, David Davis, has repeatedly promised to put the withdrawal agreement to a “meaningful vote” in both houses of parliament, but ministers have suggested the only option if the government loses will be to leave the EU without a deal in place. Starmer will say: “The government’s own Brexit minister Lord Callanan said just last week that if the deal is voted down it would be ‘an instruction to move ahead without a deal’. “That is totally unacceptable. If parliament rejects the prime minister’s deal, that cannot give licence to her – or the extreme Brexiteers in her party – to allow the UK to crash out without an agreement. That would be the worst of all possible worlds. “That is why in the coming days – and working with others in the Lords and the Commons – Labour will ensure that an amendment is tabled to the EU withdrawal bill to strengthen the terms of parliament’s meaningful vote.” Labour would like the bill to say that if the Brexit deal is rejected, MPs should pass a motion setting out the government’s next steps, which Starmer would like to include going back to the negotiating table in Brussels. “This would provide a safety valve in the Brexit process to safeguard jobs and the economy. It would remove the possibility of a no vote leading to a no deal. It would bring back control to parliament,” he will say. On Monday, Tony Blair will continue his crusade against Brexit, urging parliament not to allow the government to “fudge” the question of Britain’s future relationship with the EU until after March next year. “As time goes on, it will become crystal clear that the government’s original negotiating position was built on sand. They will realise that they are in mortal danger of putting a proposition to parliament which will not pass … so the government will turn to fudge,” the former prime minister is expected to warn. “It is this strategy that parliament has a duty to foil. It has demanded a meaningful vote. The vote is only meaningful if it is on a proposition which allows us to know with precision what our future path looks like before we take it.” The EU withdrawal bill is currently making its way through the House of Lords, with the report stage – at which amendments are likely to be made – due after Easter. The legislation then passes back to the Commons, and Labour hopes that if key amendments pass with strong majorities in the Lords, including support from crossbench and Tory peers, pro-remain Tory MPs could be encouraged to rebel against May. Smith, who was sacked after setting out his views in a Guardian article, has said he will continue to speak out from the backbenches about the need for Labour to continue asking whether Brexit is the right thing for Britain, and to offer voters the chance to accept or reject the final deal at the ballot box. Theresa May will update the House of Commons on Monday on last week’s European council meeting in Brussels. At the two-day meeting, the EU27 formally signed off on the transition agreement with the UK, allowing discussions to move forward on the future relationship. The prime minister also persuaded fellow leaders to back her claim that there was “no other plausible explanation” for the Salisbury poison attack than Russian state involvement. On Thursday May will make a whistle-stop round-Britain tour to mark a year until Brexit day in March 2019. Kicking off in Scotland, she will visit all of the home nations, meeting parents, workers, farmers and EU citizens to explain the government’s approach and hear their views."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/mar/25/lewis-hamilton-mercedes-error-australian-grand-prix-formula-onef1","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-25T17:00:00Z","webTitle":"Lewis Hamilton rues Mercedes error that cost Australian Grand Prix win","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/mar/25/lewis-hamilton-mercedes-error-australian-grand-prix-formula-onef1","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/mar/25/lewis-hamilton-mercedes-error-australian-grand-prix-formula-onef1","fields":{"headline":"Lewis Hamilton rues Mercedes error that cost Australian Grand Prix win","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Lewis Hamilton said he would prefer to trust his racer’s instinct rather than instruction from his Mercedes team after they admitted it was likely a software error cost him victory in the opening grand prix of the season in Australia. Hamilton was passed by Ferrari’s Sebastian Vettel when the German took a pit stop after the virtual safety car had been deployed. Mercedes had not advised Hamilton to open up a greater lead since their data said the gap he held was sufficient. But that information proved incorrect. “Definitely,” was Hamilton’s reply when asked if he would prefer to use his intuition over computer analysis. “Today it is such a team effort but when you are relying on so much data, so much technology to come out with the strategy or whatever, I wish it was more in my hands. I feel like I was driving as good as ever today.” The four-times world champion was adamant that had he known a greater advantage was needed to ensure Vettel could not pass him during a stop under the VSC, he could have achieved it. “In the race I had extra tools. I could have been further ahead by the first pit stop. There were so many things we could have done. But if you think you are doing it by the book and the limits, then there is nothing you can do.” Hamilton pushed hard to catch Vettel in the second half of the race but with passing exceptionally hard at Albert Park he could do little and ultimately chose to accept second place to conserve his engine. The teams are allowed to use only three before incurring grid penalties and Hamilton criticised the restraints this places on the drivers. “That goes against my spirt of racing. I want to race right down to the line. I am fit enough, I felt good. But the way the sport is set up with three engines you have to think about that and back off. So it’s probably not exciting for the fans.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/2018/mar/25/australia-captain-steve-smith-stands-down-rest-third-test-cheating-row-south-africa-ball-tampering","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-25T12:46:42Z","webTitle":"Australia captain Steve Smith gets one-match ban for role in ball tampering row","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/mar/25/australia-captain-steve-smith-stands-down-rest-third-test-cheating-row-south-africa-ball-tampering","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/mar/25/australia-captain-steve-smith-stands-down-rest-third-test-cheating-row-south-africa-ball-tampering","fields":{"headline":"Australia captain Steve Smith gets one-match ban for role in ball tampering row","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Steve Smith has been has been handed a one-match ban, fined 100% of his match fee by the ICC and has stood down as Australia captain for the remainder of the third Test against South Africa after admitting his team deliberately tampered with the ball. The vice captain David Warner has also stood down while Cameron Bancroft has been fined 75% of his match fee and handed three demerit points. Smith accepted the ICC charge of serious conduct that is contrary to the spirit of the game and the ban. Bancroft pleaded guilty to the breaching level two of the ICC code of conduct. The ICC’s chief executive, David Richardson, said: “The decision made by the leadership group of the Australian team to act in this way is clearly contrary to the spirit of the game, risks causing significant damage to the integrity of the match, the players and the sport itself and is therefore ‘serious’ in nature. As captain, Steve Smith must take full responsibility for the actions of his players and it is appropriate that he be suspended. “The game needs to have a hard look at itself. In recent weeks we have seen incidents of ugly sledging, send-offs, dissent against umpires’ decisions, a walk-off, ball tampering and some ordinary off-field behaviour.” Smith, Warner and Bancroft will continue to play in the rest of the third Test, but wicketkeeper Tim Paine will act as captain for the remaining two days of play. “This Test match needs to proceed, and in the interim we will continue to investigate this matter with the urgency that it demands,” Cricket Australia’s CEO James Sutherland said on Sunday. “As I said earlier today, Cricket Australia and Australian cricket fans expect certain standards of conduct from cricketers representing our country, and on this occasion these standards have not been met. All Australians, like us, want answers and we will keep you updated on our findings, as a matter of priority.” Cricket Australia’s head of integrity, Iain Roy, was rushed onto a plane to South Africa to gather more information on the incident before any more permanent sanctions are imposed. For some though, with two days of play remaining, it was a weak gesture and Smith should have already paid a heftier price. Politicians, including the prime minister Malcolm Turnbull, former cricketers and other sportspeople all weighed in on Australia’s day of shame. News bulletins led with the revelation, commentators were hastily assembled in front of cameras and social media went into meltdown. Many demanded Smith’s head be served up on a platter. Turnbull stopped short of endorsing those calls, but said he was “shocked and disappointed” at the captain’s behaviour. The Australian Sports Commission – the government body that oversees and funds the nation’s sporting organisations –backed the immediate removal of Smith and any other members of the leadership group or coaching staff who had prior awareness of the plan. The former Australia skipper, Michael Clarke, said his successor’s actions were “disgraceful” and “premeditated … blatant” cheating. The veteran broadcaster Jim Maxwell was close to tears on air as he labelled the incident “so blatant and so stupid, immature, naive ... it was hugely disappointing”. Former Test player Simon Katich said Smith and coach Darren Lehmann had no option but to resign or be sacked, and Adam Gilchrist was “sad, shocked, stunned” at the news. Condemnation was not restricted to disappointed Australians either; the former England captain, Michael Vaughan, said Smith’s position was now untenable while Kevin Pietersen called for the leadership group, along with Lehmann, to go. Bill Peever, CA’s chairman, said the board fully supported the impending investigation into events in Cape Town. “We regard this as a matter of the utmost seriousness and urgency. We will ensure we have all information available to make the right decisions for Australian Cricket,” Peever said. The former Australia wicketkeeper Adam Gilchrist called the side the “laughing stock” of world cricket and has called Smith’s long term future into question. “I’m really sad, shocked, stunned – I’m not trying to over-dramatise it but [I’m] really emotional about this,” Gilchrist said on Network Ten. “Australian cricket now and the integrity of Australian cricket is the laughing stock of world sport. “This clearly is against the laws of the game and we’ve just had our national captain and our national team admit that they sat down, premeditated and pre-planned a way to cheat. I’m not sure he [Smith] can remain captain. “I think it’s a pretty tough position to hold after you’ve admitted to what you’ve admitted to, [to be able to] carry on with any faith from anyone watching.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2018/mar/26/football-transfer-rumours-paul-pogba-to-join-real-madrid-or-psg","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-26T07:14:17Z","webTitle":"Football transfer rumours: Paul Pogba to join Real Madrid or PSG?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/mar/26/football-transfer-rumours-paul-pogba-to-join-real-madrid-or-psg","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/mar/26/football-transfer-rumours-paul-pogba-to-join-real-madrid-or-psg","fields":{"headline":"Football transfer rumours: Paul Pogba to join Real Madrid or PSG?","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"José Mourinho hasn’t upset anyone for the past 48 hours so he plans to put this right by attaching Paul Pogba to a rod and dangling him in front of some of Europe’s biggest fish, in the hope they will gobble up the France midfielder and offer Manchester United some tasty treats in exchange. Apparently, the club have had enough of Pogba appearing to be more enthusiastic about posting pictures of his hair on Instagram than he is about tracking back and are targeting a host of players to rebuild the squad if they can recoup a chunk of the £89m they gave Juventus for him. Toni Kroos and Raphaël Varane are key targets if Real Madrid bite, and pocket-sized Italian trickster Marco Veratti and Brazilian defender Marquinhos would be offered the chance to join Mourinho’s Manchester Fun House if PSG took Pogba back to France. United would also have a nibble at Neymar if the Brazilian is allowed to leave by the club’s Qatari owners. But it says here that Real Madrid’s preferred United player would be Marcus Rashford. Juventus, too, would be offered the chance to take Pogba back to Turin as long as they part with full-back Alex Sandro, who is valued at around £40m. Oh, and the word is that the chances of Gareth Bale going to Old Trafford have been harmed by Mourinho’s very public bashing of Luke Shaw’s delicate ego. Over at Manchester City, Pep Guardiola wants a reunion with Jérôme Boateng, whom he managed at Bayern Munich. The defender played for City in 2010-11 but was so underwhelming that he is best remembered for aggravating a knee injury in a collision with an aeroplane drinks trolley. Reports in Germany suggest that Thomas Tuchel has told Bayern Munich he doesn’t want to just press the play button and win the title at the Allianz Arena. No, because he is a glutton for punishment, he would much rather try to rebuild what’s left of Arsène Wenger’s shattered empire at the Emirates. And the word is he’s already in talks with Arsenal but Chelsea would like the German to replace Antonio Conte, who will be offered £10m a season to make PSG as good as their owners think they should be. Liverpool are preparing to slap a £200,000-a-week contract and fancy pen in front of Mo Salah in an attempt to ward off a bid from Real Madrid for the goal-guzzling Egyptian. They’re not planning to do the same for Emre Can, though, which is why he’ll sign for Juventus on a free in the summer. West Ham are hoping Jamaal Lascelles is enthused at the idea of playing in a post-apocalyptic environment every other week as they ready a £15m offer for the commanding Newcastle defender. And 21-year-old Cagliari playmaker Nicolo Barella is expected to do his tricks and flicks at Internazionale next season instead of Liverpool, who had viewed him as a possible long-term replacement for Philippe Coutinho. The Serie A club will have to pay £45m for his services, though."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/2018/mar/25/australia-ball-tampering-prompts-angry-calls-for-steve-smith-to-resign","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-25T06:00:15Z","webTitle":"Steve Smith faces ball-tampering inquiry as Cricket Australia resists calls for immediate sacking","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/mar/25/australia-ball-tampering-prompts-angry-calls-for-steve-smith-to-resign","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/mar/25/australia-ball-tampering-prompts-angry-calls-for-steve-smith-to-resign","fields":{"headline":"Steve Smith faces ball-tampering inquiry as Cricket Australia resists calls for immediate sacking","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Cricket Australia has resisted widespread calls for the immediate sacking of Steve Smith after the Australian captain admitted overseeing ball-tampering during the third Test in South Africa. Malcolm Turnbull, the Australian prime minister, added his voice to the criticism after Smith admitted that he and batsman Cameron Bancroft conspired to “get an advantage” in Cape Town by applying tape to the ball on day three. Smith told media that he would not step down, saying he was still “the right person for the job”. “I’m not proud of what’s happened [and] it’s not within the spirit of the game,” Smith said. “My integrity, the team’s integrity, the leadership group’s integrity has come into question and rightfully so.” The Australian Sports Commission (ASC), the governing body of sport, called for the immediate standing down of Smith and anyone else in the team or entourage who knew about the conspiracy. Earlier the chief executive of Cricket Australia, James Sutherland, said Smith would not be sacked or suspended until an investigation was completed by Cricket Australia’s head of integrity, Iain Roy. “We’re in the middle of a game right now and that game needs to conclude,” he told reporters on Sunday. “We certainly don’t have all the evidence at hand. We need someone to go over there and talk to the relevant people involved. “I have asked our head of integrity Iain Roy to travel to South Africa today … Iain’s brief will be to gather the relevant information to address this matter and to understand it better. “Once Iain submits his report, we will make further comment.” In an emotional press conference Sutherland said he was “shocked and disappointed” by Smith’s admission of cheating and said cricket fans would be right to feel aggrieved. “It’s a very sad day for the game of cricket,” he said. Smith’s retention of the role defied calls for his immediate removal from politicians, sportspeople and former cricketers. Commentators in Australia and across the world have called for him to go, with some saying the team should forfeit the Test and fly home. On Sunday afternoon the ASC – the government body that oversees and funds the nation’s sporting organisations – called for Smith’s immediate removal. “The ASC calls for [Smith] to be stood down immediately by Cricket Australia, along with any other members of the team leadership group or coaching staff who had prior awareness,” said the chair, John Wylie, and the CEO, Kate Palmer. They insisted Smith’s sacking could occur while Cricket Australia undertook the integrity review. “The ASC condemns cheating of any form in sport … The Australian cricket team are iconic representatives of our country. The example they set matters a great deal to Australia.” The former England captain Michael Vaughan said Smith’s position was now “untenable”. “Steve Smith, his team and all the management will have to accept that whatever happens in their careers they will all be known for trying to cheat the game,” he tweeted. Turnbull, the Australian prime minister, addressed the scandal on Sunday and stopped short of saying Smith should go, but branded his behaviour “beyond belief”. “It’s wrong and I look forward to Cricket Australia taking decisive action soon,” he said. “I think I speak for all Australians in saying how shocked and disappointed we all are.” Former Australian captain Michael Clarke labelled Smith’s actions “disgraceful” and “blatant cheating”, without calling for his sacking. “I can’t believe the leadership group has made a decision to do this,” he said. “As a leader, you can’t ask somebody to do something you’re not willing to do yourself. “It’s premeditated cheating, it is blatant cheating, it is disgraceful and it is not accepted by anyone.” The former Australian test cricketer Simon Katich told Australian radio that Smith, vice-captain David Warner and head coach Darren Lehmann had “no option” but to resign or be sacked. Shane Warne, speaking before Smith’s press conference where he admitted to ball-tampering, also tweeted that he was “very disappointed” with the footage broadcast last night, where Bancroft was seen to drop the tape into his underpants to hide it from the umpires. Australian politicians including the Liberal senator Richard Colbeck, the National party MP Darren Chester and the Labor MP Andrew Giles called for Smith and the Australian team to be brought home. “Bring them all home, don’t want them representing my country! Tour over,” Colbeck tweeted. Olympic skier David Morris said Smith’s actions had made “all Aussie athletes look bad”. The Monty Python comedian John Cleese was among other well-known figures to weigh in: “I see Steve Smith, the Aussie cricket captain, in admitting ‘ball-tampering’, explained that the team leaders thought it was ‘a way of gaining an advantage’. Another way of ‘gaining an advantage’ is to cheat.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/mar/26/accc-says-corporate-fines-too-low-and-it-will-pursue-penalties-in-the-hundreds-of-millions","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-25T17:01:01Z","webTitle":"ACCC says corporate fines too low and it will pursue penalties in the 'hundreds of millions'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/mar/26/accc-says-corporate-fines-too-low-and-it-will-pursue-penalties-in-the-hundreds-of-millions","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/mar/26/accc-says-corporate-fines-too-low-and-it-will-pursue-penalties-in-the-hundreds-of-millions","fields":{"headline":"ACCC says corporate fines too low and it will pursue penalties in the 'hundreds of millions'","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Billion-dollar Australian companies must be fined more for breaching the law, the head of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission has said, after a new report found Australian fines are 12 times lower than other developed countries. An OECD report, released on Monday, found the average Australian fine for uncompetitive or cartel behaviour was $25.4m, while the average fine across similar developed nations was $320.4m. Rod Sims, the chairman of the ACCC, said Australia’s low penalties were clearly failing as a deterrent. “We see continuing breaches of the act by companies that have been caught before,” he said. “We see that there is really no effect on share prices. “The finance writers have immediately declared it inconsequential, saying ‘Let’s just move on, no issue here’.” The OECD report compared Australia to the European Union, the UK, the United States, Germany, Japan and South Korea. While the those countries calculate penalties based on the size of the company and its turnover, Australian courts look at “an ‘instinctive synthesis’ of various factors”. Australia “does not follow a structured methodology” for determining the size of fines, the report found. Current Australian law allows for a maximum fine of 10% of turnover but Sims said this was never enforced on the largest companies. A 2014 federal court ruling against Flight Centre imposed a penalty of $11m – 1.4% of the company’s annual turnover of $766m in 2009. A 2016 penalty against ANZ bank, for 10 incidents of collusion, totalled $9m, while the company made profits of $8bn in 2012. In comparison, last year EU imposed a record €2.4 billion penalty against Alphabet, the parent company of Google, and the United States fined Citicorp $925m for foreign currency manipulation. Sims said the ACCC would now begin pursuing penalties in the hundreds of millions, closer to Australia’s maximum of 10% turnover. “When you have a company with a turnover of $10bn, that would be a maximum penalty of up to $1bn, so we’d be looking at penalties of hundreds of millions, and we haven’t had that yet,” he said. Under Australian law, penalties are set by the courts but the ACCC submits claims for penalties in their submissions. Sims also said the ACCC would become less willing to settle, as it seeks to change the norm regarding higher penalties. “It’s up to the courts to set penalties but we have a role in our submissions to the court and we need to change what we do,” he said. “We’ll have to be a little less likely to settle cases unless we get appropriate penalties. “That’s the mindset change that needs to occur ... There needs to be a broader debate within the community.” Australia’s competition laws prevent cartel behaviour, price fixing and other agreements between companies that substantially lessen competition. The ACCC is the primary enforcer of these laws, which are contained in part four of the Competition and Consumer Act 2010. Before 2007, penalties for uncompetitive behaviour were capped at a maximum of $10m. For individuals, cartel behaviour can also attract criminal penalties up to 10 years jail time."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/mar/24/luton-town-barnet-league-two-football-match-report","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-24T19:17:14Z","webTitle":"Martin Allen starts fifth stint at Barnet with ominous defeat at Luton Town","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/mar/24/luton-town-barnet-league-two-football-match-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/mar/24/luton-town-barnet-league-two-football-match-report","fields":{"headline":"Martin Allen starts fifth stint at Barnet with ominous defeat at Luton Town","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"It spoke volubly for the atmosphere Nathan Jones has built around Luton that, 20 minutes after his team had returned to the top of League Two, several hundred supporters remained in place simply to watch him run down the touchline. Jones absorbed the acclaim, thumped his chest and then disappeared down the tunnel to rapturous applause; it was some way to make an exit, but he had spent the previous two hours battling with a man who could write the manual on refusing to fade into the night. The odds stand firmly against Martin Allen on this occasion, however. He tends to stay at Barnet for a good time rather than a long time but, even if there is little expectation that his fifth spell in charge will extend beyond eight games in any case, he faces a colossal task to go out with his customary bang. They were not outplayed on his latest debut and held their own with a first-half performance that, for its robustness and aggression, came straight from their new manager’s playbook; goals from Danny Hylton and James Collins underlined an obvious gulf in quality, though, and Allen was left to build up a run-in that requires his team to bridge a deficit of at least seven points if they are to stay up. “When I found out we were playing these I’d already said yes to the chairman and I thought: ‘Oh my god, Luton away,’” he said. “We prepared to give it our best shot but privately I thought: ‘If we got a point it would brilliant but then the next seven games are where it’s really going to count.’” Crewe can be beaten on Friday but that will require improvement. Barnet rattled a Luton side whose promotion bid had been wobbling, limiting their first-half chances and coming close themselves through John Akinde, who looked somewhere near the 26-goal threat he posed last season. Akinde almost provided an equaliser for Alex Nicholls after Hylton, ripping Allen’s half-time team-talk to shreds, nodded the simplest of openers within two minutes of the interval; Barnet’s use of the ball was agricultural throughout, all the same, and it will take a blissful marriage of invention and intensity to prevent relegation to the National League. Allen was not helped by an error from his goalkeeper, Craig Ross, who let Collins’ shot slip through his hands to confirm the result. Ross made some spectacular saves, though, during a second half in which Luton rediscovered the verve that has made them a thrilling proposition at times. It left Allen to move on from his free hit and wind Barnet up for the kind of season finale he loves. “I’ve got to convince the players we’ll get some points on the board and it’s going to start getting scary for the clubs above, because they’ll be looking over their shoulder and checking Teletext,” he said. “There’s 21 points available. Twenty-one points. My win ratio at Barnet is something like 53%.” A smile crept across his face but it will take a gargantuan effort over the next six weeks. If Barnet do succeed then Allen may make Jones’s touchline dash look modest to a fault."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"us-news/2018/mar/24/washington-march-gun-control-trump","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-24T19:28:18Z","webTitle":"White House 'applauds' historic gun control march but no word from Trump","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/mar/24/washington-march-gun-control-trump","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/mar/24/washington-march-gun-control-trump","fields":{"headline":"White House 'applauds' historic gun control march but no word from Trump","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The White House said it “applauded” pro-gun control demonstrators at the March for Our Lives on Saturday without directly addressing their calls for stricter gun regulation, although Donald Trump did not weigh in on Twitter, as he is prone to do. “We applaud the many courageous young Americans exercising their first amendment rights today,” said a White House spokeswoman, Lindsay Walters. She added: “Keeping our children safe is a top priority of the president’s, which is why he urged Congress to pass the Fix Nics and Stop School Violence Acts, and signed them into law. Additionally, on Friday, the Department of Justice issued the rule to ban bump stocks following through on the president’s commitment to ban devices that turn legal weapons into illegal machine guns.” Trump spent much of the morning at the Trump International golf club in West Palm Beach, Florida. The White House did not respond to questions about his activities there. The Fix Nics 2017 Act would tighten the country’s background checks system. Nics stands for the National Instant Background Checks System. The legislation provides federal agencies with a few more incentives to submit records to the background check system – something they are already required by law to do. The Stop School Violence Act would authorize $50m in grant funding for campus safety improvements, including training for local law enforcement and faculty and the development of an anonymous reporting system to identify early warning signs of potential threats. Both pieces of legislation were part of the omnibus government bill that Trump signed on Friday. Other politicians from both sides of the partisan divide weighed in as well. The Florida senator Marco Rubio said in a statement: “I commend those who today are peacefully exercising their first amendment rights to march in favor of a gun ban.” Rubio, who came under criticism from survivors of the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas high school in a televised town hall on CNN, added: “While I do not agree with all of the solutions they propose, I respect their views and recognize that many Americans support certain gun bans. However, many other Americans do not support a gun ban. They too want to prevent mass shootings, but view banning guns as an infringement on the second amendment rights of law abiding citizens that ultimately will not prevent these tragedies.” In contrast, a number of Democrats actively participated in marches held across the country.Senators Brian Schatz of Hawaii and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota were among those who marched in Washington. Senator Sherrod Brown attended an event in Columbus and Senator Elizabeth Warren attended an event in Boston. Barack Obama also expressed his support on Twitter, saying: “Michelle and I are so inspired by all the young people who made today’s marches happen. Keep at it. You’re leading us forward. Nothing can stand in the way of millions of voices calling for change.” Trump, who ran as a strong supporter of gun rights, has taken several different positions on new legislation in the aftermath of the Florida shooting. Most recently, he proposed arming teachers while backing away from earlier statements about raising the legal age to purchase a semi-automatic weapon to 21. On Friday, the US justice department proposed rule changes that would effectively ban bump stocks, devices that allow semi-automatic weapons to fire like a machine gun. Bump stocks were used by Las Vegas gunman Stephen Paddock to kill 58 people in the deadliest mass shooting in recent US history. Trump heralded the DoJ’s move on Twitter by saying: “We will BAN all devices that turn legal weapons into illegal machine guns.” Trump has also proposed extreme risk protection orders, which would provide law enforcement officers and family members with a legal way to petition a court to temporarily remove an unstable person’s guns, and block them from buying new ones."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"news/2018/mar/25/gender-pay-gaps-in-academy-school-chains-among-the-worst-in-uk","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-25T15:37:37Z","webTitle":"Gender pay gaps in academy school chains among the worst in UK","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/mar/25/gender-pay-gaps-in-academy-school-chains-among-the-worst-in-uk","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/2018/mar/25/gender-pay-gaps-in-academy-school-chains-among-the-worst-in-uk","fields":{"headline":"Gender pay gaps in academy school chains among the worst in UK","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Women working in academy school chains suffer some of the worst gender pay gaps in the UK, according to the Guardian’s analysis of data received through the government’s national survey of gender and pay. The figures reveal a string of multi-academy trusts in England where women face median hourly pay deficits of more than 50%. Of the 50 organisations with the largest gender pay gaps published to date, almost half – 24 – are multi-academy trusts, which are charities encouraged by the government to take over the running of thousands of state schools. The gender pay figures raise fears that academy chains have been funnelling higher pay to a sliver of male-dominated senior posts, at rates of pay far above those in schools run by local authorities. Among the worst offenders is Schoolsworks Academy Trust, a West Sussex chain of six schools where the median hourly pay gap in favour of men is 62% – meaning that a woman is paid 38 pence for every £1 earned by a man. The Wakefield City Academies Trust, which collapsed late last year while managing 21 schools, was shown to have a gender pay gap of 52%, also according to median hourly pay. Angela Rayner, Labour’s shadow education secretary, said the gender pay data for academy trusts was “deeply alarming”. “These figures are extremely disappointing. Pay in some multi-academy trusts is out of control, skewed to benefit a few at the top and now proven to reward men far higher than women. The government is entrenching inequality in the education system,” she said. Labour said it had proposed legislation to make academies subject to the same accountability rules as local authorities, but had been rebuffed by the Conservatives. The Guardian’s analysis of the 3,500 companies and public bodies that had reported their gender pay figures by the end of last week shows that schools are among the worst places for pay equality, despite the fact that teaching is the UK’s most popular career for degree-educated women. The Department for Education did not respond to a request for comment. Kevin Courtney, joint general secretary of the National Education Union (NEU), said the multi-academy trust figures highlighted a problem seen across the schools sector, including in those maintained by local authorities. “Women teachers are less likely to be promoted and are more likely to be subject to other pay disadvantages, while women support staff are more likely to be in the lowest paid jobs,” he said. Jo Swinson, the deputy leader of the Liberal Democrats and a former equalities minister, said: “Well-qualified, professional women are the driving force in our schools and colleges, yet we still see shocking levels of gender inequality, with the senior levels of some education trusts overwhelmingly dominated by men.” About 70% of the more than 200 multi-academy trusts that reported their data by the end of last week had a median hourly pay gap worse than the 18.4% recorded by the Office for National Statistics as the UK average. The Schoolsworks trust said it was “confident that the gender pay gap reported is not an equal pay issue, our pay policy which we follow ensures decisions are gender neutral and that decisions about staff pay are open, transparent and fair”. Women made up more than 70% of employees in the trust’s top pay quartile, while men made up just one in 20 of staff in the bottom 50% of earnings. Not far behind was the Peninsula Learning Trust, which runs seven primaries and one secondary in Cornwall, with a median hourly pay gap of 60%. Among the national chains, the Academies Enterprise Trust (AET) – one of the largest chains in England running 64 schools – had a gender pay gap of 35%, while Greenwood Academies Trust with 32 schools had a gap of 38%. AET’s chief executive Julian Drinkall is one of the UK’s highest-paid academy chain heads on £225,000, while his predecessor at AET, Ian Comfort, earned £236,000. Faith-based academy chains fared no better: the staff working at the 24 schools in the Kent Catholic Schools Partnership face a gender pay gap of almost 50%. Clive Spencer, the partnership’s chief executive, earns £154,000 a year. But some multi-academy trusts show pay can be awarded equitably. The Equals Trust, a chain of eight primary schools in Nottingham, reported a 0.1% median pay advantage in favour of women.

Speaking to supporters of the farmers outside Queensland’s parliament in Brisbane on Sunday, the former One Nation senator, now an independent, said of the situation in South Africa: “This is the start of a genocide as far as I’m concerned, and it’s only going to get worse because the genocide has just started.” Without referring to any specific case, Anning said: “Anyone who would boil a child in a bath, rape his mother and slaughter people the way they are slaughtering them now are subhuman.” In a Facebook video of the speech (beginning at 27 minutes), Anning cast doubt on the ability of black South Africans to work the land. “These people, when they do take over the farms, as we’ve seen in Rhodesia [Zimbabwe], the farms will run into ruin. “Within a few more years they’ll be asking, demanding our support, and you can be sure that the United Nations will be demanding that we support these people with foreign aid.” Anning supported Peter Dutton’s proposal to grant the farmers refugee status. He disparaged migrants from other destinations, saying South Africans were “industrious, they’re hardworking, they have the same Christian values, as opposed to some of the other people we’ve been bringing into the country”, who, he said, were “intent on tearing our country apart”. Independent analysis has found it is all but impossible to accurately estimate the number of white farmers who have been murdered or attacked in South Africa in recent years, but figures suggest the murder rate for young black men in urban areas is considerably higher. Police statistics publicised by a South African MP, Pieter Groenewald, of the Freedom Front Plus party, show there were 638 attacks on farms and 74 murders in 2016-17, a rise on the previous year, but fewer than in many years during the past two decades. The figures are not broken down by race. In earlier remarks at the Brisbane event, the Liberal MP Andrew Laming said attacks on white farmers in South Africa were sending them the message to “effectively, get out of our country”. Laming said he had learned about the issue from a widely shared Facebook post purporting to show an elderly farmer who had been beaten, which he reposted on Sunday night. He praised his “great colleague Peter Dutton”, saying “he could have ignored [farmers] completely, and hid behind PC departments, who continue to say the murder rate here is no different from the murder rate down the road”. Laming cast doubt on the South African government’s willingness to tell the truth about attacks on farmers. “We need a South African government that starts counting the toll,” he said. “We need a South African government that doesn’t paper over reality.” He emphasised the kinship between Australia and South Africa, saying: “We have two great frontier countries, with a great history.” The speeches were cheered by hundreds of people who had earlier marched down Roma Street chanting slogans including “Save our farmers”, and “Thank you Mr Dutton”. The march was organised by Brisbane’s South African community in support of proposals floated by Dutton to grant a special immigration status to white South African farmers. The foreign affairs minister, Julie Bishop, rejected Dutton’s comments last week, saying Australia had no plans to make special visa considerations for white South Africans. The South African government criticised his comments as “sad” and “regrettable”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/live/2018/mar/27/england-v-italy-international-football-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-27T21:00:44Z","webTitle":"England 1-1 Italy: international football – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2018/mar/27/england-v-italy-international-football-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/live/2018/mar/27/england-v-italy-international-football-live","fields":{"headline":"England 1-1 Italy: international football – as it happened","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"And that’s that! England will feel disappointed right now, having come so close to victory, only to be denied late on by James Tarkowski’s clumsy clip on Federico Chiesa and Lorenzo Insigne’s calm penalty. But they’ve won in Holland and now held Italy. They’d have surely taken those results, both of which will give them confidence going into the World Cup. Speaking of which, it’s not going to be quite the same without Italy in the summer, is it? Missing them already. 90 min +4: Italy spend the best part of a minute slowly stroking short passes upfield. Suddenly Chiesa is free down the right. He loops a dangerous cross into the England area, but nobody in blue has taken a chance. 90 min +3: Did I say assured?! He nearly dribbles himself into trouble, with Sterling closing him down. But he scoops the ball away from danger at the last second. 90 min +2: The set piece is worked to Cook on the left. His cross is plucked from the sky by the assured Donnarumma. 90 min: There will be five added minutes! Plenty of time for one of these sides to find a winner. And both look up for searching for it. Sterling races down the left and very nearly frees Rashford with a flick inside. 89 min: Chiesa goes chasing a long ball down the middle. For a second it looks as though he’s got the better of Walker, but the England defender’s power and pace wins the day. And the flag goes up for offside anyway. There’s a long pause as Walker finds himself in the middle of a big argument. Then finally Insigne steps up, and whips hard into the bottom left. Butland guessed right, yet had no chance to save a superbly struck penalty kick. England finally concede, after going five matches without letting one in! 86 min: ... then performs the international mime for TV, and points at the spot! VAR has its knockers, but that’s the correct decision. 85 min: VAR decision. Chiesa dribbles at speed down the left, and into the England box. He goes over screaming. Has Tarkowski stepped on his right boot? If so, this could potentially be problematic for England. The ref has a gander at the screen ... 83 min: Young is booked for a glorious act of cynicism. He slips as he slides into a tackle by the left touchline, hurting his knee as he clanks off the pitch. Then to stop Italy taking a quick throw, he rolls back onto the pitch, demanding treatment. Which he gets, along with a yellow card and a lecture from the referee. Looks like he’ll be OK, which is the main thing. 82 min: Sterling bustles down the left yet again. He slips Cook away on the overlap. Cook’s cross so nearly drops for Rashford, who is leaping and pulling his neck back in the centre. But Rugani eyebrows it away from danger. 80 min: Gagliardini comes on for Pellegrini. Bonucci sends a long ball down the middle for Belotti, who very nearly takes it down spectacularly on the edge of the box. Not quite, but Italy are proving a threat all of a sudden. 79 min: Italy put together their best move of the match. Insigne lays off to Jorginho, then races off down the inside-left channel. Jorginho chips over the England back line. Insigne meets the dropping ball and nearly sends a dipping, screeching volley across Butland and into the bottom right. What a goal that would have been! 77 min: Italy are seeing more of the ball now - they’re not getting pushed back as they once were in this second half - but they’re not doing a great deal with it. 75 min: Rashford is quickly into the thick of things, advancing on the Italian box. He’s got Sterling on the left, but opts to go it alone, and in doing so is crowded out and can’t get a meaningful shot away. 73 min: Before the free kick can be taken, Henderson replaces Stones, who remains dizzy after being blootered in the face. Dier will drop back into the defence. Insigne looks to bend the free kick into the top right, but gets it all wrong. 72 min: Pellegrini turns on a sixpence, baffling Walker into a shirt tug that concedes a free kick just to the left of the England D - and earns the England defender a booking. 70 min: Stones takes a Zappacosta cross flush in the coupon. Ooyah, oof. That’s gotta hurt. While he gets some treatment, England swap Vardy and Lingard for Rashford and Cook. 68 min: Pellegrini dribbles with purpose and determination down the middle. The ball rebounds to Belotti, who nearly breaks through a weak Young challenge. Not quite. But there’s a little more desire in the Italian attack. 67 min: England play a series of one-twos down the inside-left channel, Lallana, Lingard and Sterling the entertainers. Sterling enters the box, leans back and, in looking for the top right corner, makes a rugby conversion. A poor finish to a very crisp move. 65 min: Rose hooks the free kick into the Italian box. Belotti heads it clear. Dier comes sliding through Chiesa, a heavy challenge that’s not appreciated. But neither does it result in a free kick. Chiesa shrugs in an expressive manner, half-amused rather than irritated. 64 min: Italy are struggling to get out of their half right now. De Sciglio is betrayed by his frustration as he hangs out a leg and upends Lallana down the right. A free kick, and a chance for England to load the box. But first Immobile is replaced by Belotti. 62 min: Sterling has a crack from distance on the left, but there’s no force behind it and that’s easy meat for Donnarumma. 61 min: Young and Vardy combine well down the right to earn a corner for England. From the set piece, Lallana tries to Le Tissier a gentle volley into the top corner, but that was never as easy as the Southampton legend used to make it look. 60 min: ... while Rose replaces Trippier. He’ll be the left wing-back while Young moves to the right. 59 min: Sterling’s incessant pressing forces Donnarumma into hacking out of play under pressure. That allows England to make a double change. Lallana comes on for the impressive Oxlade-Chamberlain ... 57 min: Sterling buzzes again down the left, causing Italy no end of heartache. He really is a marvellous player. The best England have got? There’s a case for it. He slips a pass inside for Oxlade-Chamberlain, who checks back to the left before sending a shot straight down Donnarumma’s throat. 56 min: Candreva is replaced by Chiesa, whose first act is to take a speculative shot from the right-hand corner of the Italian box. It’s blocked at source. 54 min: Sterling battles hard down the left to win the ball off Rugani. He had no right to snatch possession there, but that showed superb determination. He flicks the ball inside for Young, who sways into the box, a lovely slalom. He works a nanosecond’s worth of space to shoot from a tight angle, and does so, but his effort’s blocked by a sliding Bonucci. 53 min: ... nothing in particular occurs. 52 min: England continue to play it patient. Trippier slides a pass down the right for Vardy, who earns a corner. From which ... 50 min: Walker strokes a glorious crossfield pass towards Young, who sets off down the left and nearly releases Lingard into the area. Not quite. 48 min: Walker plays a loose ball down the England right. It’s intercepted by Insigne, who chips forward first time for Immobile. There’s a little too much on the pass, and Butland snaffles. But once again, England have been slack at the back. On another day, they’d have been punished severely for this nonsense. 47 min: England spend the first minute of the half stroking the ball about the back in the aesthetically pleasant style. Then suddenly Lingard bursts down the left. Pellegrini knocks him to the ground, fairly, to put a stop to his gallop. And we’re off again! England get the party re-started. There have been no half-time changes. Half-time reading: A decent half of football from England, who lead thanks to the quick wit of Jesse Lingard. A sharper striker than Ciro Immobile might have had a hat-trick, of course, but let’s not start pulling at threads. 44 min: Sterling clips a cute pass down the inside-left channel for Young, who can’t quite bring the ball under control and break into the box. After a bad start, England look impressive in attack, causing Italy all sorts of problems, coming at them from many angles. 42 min: The free kick is no good. “I don’t know if I am OK,” reports Giulio Ongaro. “I hate to be proven right in this case.” 41 min: And now Young goes flying in on Zappacosta near the England right-hand corner flag. It’s a wild challenge, and though it’s a free kick, he’s very lucky not to join Oxlade-Chamberlain in the book. 40 min: Oxlade-Chamberlain tussles with Bonucci down the right. He’s flagged for a garden-variety shirt tug. But he doesn’t like the decision - he’d have been free in acres otherwise - and so boots the ball away in frustration. A silly yellow card. 39 min: Italy are once again caught short at the back as Sterling drives with purpose at the visiting defence. He feeds Young outside on the left. Young opens his body and tries a sidefoot across Donnarumma and into the bottom right. The ball clips off Zappacosta and is taken around the right-hand post. The corner’s no good. 37 min: Nothing much happens from that. “Dare I say it, but the kind of quick witted opportunism that Lingard just exhibited is exactly the kind of thing that England have been naively hopeless at in tournaments passim,” writes Phil Sawyer. “If you want me I’ll be hammering planks over the windows to try to keep that pesky beggar Hope out.” 36 min: From the set piece, Tarkowski finds the ball at his feet on the right-hand corner of the six-yard box. He can’t quite sort himself out to shoot. No matter, because England are soon coming back at Italy again. Sterling races down the right, reaches the byline, and earns another corner off Bonucci. 35 min: A lovely move starts with Young cutting in from the left. Lingard and Sterling take turns to advance on the Italian box. Then Oxlade-Chamberlain chips a cross into the mixer from the right. Bonucci is forced to knock the ball out for a corner. 33 min: More space for Oxlade-Chamberlain, who romps down the right and tries to pull the ball back for Vardy in the centre. Not quite, but after a very slow start, England are looking busy and threatening in attack. 31 min: Immobile goes dribbling in from the right and very nearly curls a low shot into the bottom left. There’s a deflection, and so that’s a corner. The ball’s worked back to Parolo, who very nearly Pirlos a pearler into the top left from distance. It’s inches over the bar. Had it been on target, I’m not sure Butland was getting to it. 29 min: For a second, it looked as though the referee was going to spend an age over the quick free kick on the VAR. But he’s quickly pointing to the centre spot. That was such smart thinking by Lingard. A fine finish by Vardy, too, but that goal was all down to the midfielder. This is wonderful quick thinking. Lingard robs Pellegrini in the midfield and slips a pass forward for Sterling, who is upended by the same clumsy Italian. Free kick. Italy stop, waiting for a big fuss to be made over the setting up of the free kick. But Lingard stoops amid the fuss, puts his hand on the ball, and takes a super-fast free kick, flicking the ball to the right for Vardy, who steps into the area and smashes into the top right! 26 min: Dier rises highest to meet the corner, and heads down towards the bottom right. But Donnarumma is behind it all the way. Never mind, though, because ... 25 min: And this is a really good period for England, as Oxlade-Chamberlain is nearly teed up for a shot 20 yards from goal, but De Sciglio hassles him out of it. Then Oxlade-Chamberlain goes on another run to earn a corner on the right. 24 min: Sterling makes good down the middle and slides a pass down the inside right for Vardy, who strides into the area and shoots low. Donnarumma hacks clear with his feet. 23 min: A free kick for England out on the right. Trippier whips it to the near post, where Dier competes but comes off second best to Donnarumma. 22 min: Trippier releases Oxlade-Chamberlain down the right. It’s a powerful run, and he makes it to the edge of the area. Then he tries to nip in between Pellegrini and Bonucci, and falls to the ground. The crowd want a penalty but nobody in an England shirt claims seriously. 20 min: Bonucci, quarterbacking from deep, sends a long pass down the inside-right channel and nearly releases Parolo. There’s too much on the pass, and that’s a goal kick, but England looked ragged again at the back. 18 min: A free kick for England out on the left, and a chance to load the box. It’s hoicked into the mixer, but Tarkowski gets hands-on with Bonucci and that’s the pressure on Italy relieved in a single shove. 16 min: Immobile misses a sitter. Candreva whips a glorious cross to the far post from a deep position on the right wing. Immobile meets it, eight yards out, free. He flashes his header over the bar. Butland should have had no chance. Immobile should already have a hat-trick. He bashes the ground in frustration, after spurning a third fine opportunity to open the scoring. I hope Giulio Ongaro is OK. 15 min: The corner leads to nothing. Italy have quietened Wembley a little with all their possession, though. 14 min: Italy are stroking it around the back, hogging the ball. For a side down on their luck at the moment, they exude confidence on the ball. Some lovely triangulation down the right, involving Immobile, Zappacosta and Jorginho earns a corner. 12 min: On another day, this could have been 0-1, 0-2, 1-0, 2-0, 1-1 or 2-2. But here we are. 10 min: Tarkowski, deep on the left, slips a fine pass inside for Lingard. It sends England on a fast attack. Lingard shuttles the ball down the middle for Vardy, who has his leg cocked ready to shoot, just inside the area. But De Sciglio slides in brilliantly to toe-poke the ball back to Donnarumma. What a saving tackle, just as though England looked like taking the lead. 8 min: Italy knock the ball around in the midfield for a while, but go nowhere special. That’s the first period of calm play in this game so far. It’s been an interesting start. 6 min: Suggestions on the slow-mo that Stones pulled Immobile back after being stripped of the ball. Meanwhile England go up the other end and win a corner down the right. The set piece is sent long, and Tarkowski is able to win a header on the left-hand corner of the six-yard box. He’s got time to think about it - not sure what the Italian defence is doing - but can only send a looper over the bar. He should have done better. Donnarumma nearly runs into the post while tracking back after it. 4 min: The set piece comes to nothing. Stones has already put in two goal-saving blocks, yet he still needs to have a little think about what he’s done. His positioning for the very early chance wasn’t all that. 3 min: Immobile is preposterously ponderous. Stones tries to take him on, just outside the England area. Immobile strips the ball off him, and he’s again striding clear into the box! But once again he faffs around instead of getting a quick shot away, and Stones is able to redeem the situation at the cost of a corner. And we’re off! Italy get the ball rolling. And within 30 seconds, Immobile is sent clear down the inside-right channel! Wembley waits for the flag to go up, but Jorginho’s chip down the channel has released the striker legally into the area! Luckily for England, Immobile pauses and lets the ball clank between his feet instead of shooting. That allows Stones to come over and block. What a start that could have been for Italy. Before kick-off, a moment in memory of three English and Italian heroes. Jimmy Armfield, Cyrille Regis and Davide Astori have all passed away since the last time England have played at Wembley. They’re remembered with some warm and generous applause. It’s a beautiful, bittersweet moment. The teams are out! It’s an 84,000 sell-out at Wembley, and there’s an atmosphere to match the occasion. The 1966 World Cup winners are in their famous while shirts; the 1934, 1938, 1982 and 2006 world champions wear their equally storied blue. We’ll be off in a minute! But before we get going, time for a quick pipe-clearing blast of steam. “GRRRRR!!!” bellows Giulio Ongaro. “Why still have Immobile and Insigne who actually have not lived up to their form in international play? I want to see Verdi, Cutrone, Cristante. Let’s give them a chance. But I am happy Buffon is not playing. Sorry, Gigi. You need to give some experience to the other goalies.” Incidentally, VAR’s in operation tonight, so that may or may not be the last GRRRRR of the evening. But let’s all keep an open mind. Gareth Southgate talks to Independent Television! “We’ve picked the team we have because we want to keep some stability. We made some good progress the other night. Obviously we need to look at some other players as well, but tonight is a really good test for us. James Tarkowski has done really well with us and his club, and he fits the way we want to play. We’ve also got to look at options at centre-back: we’re very happy with the players who have played there up until now, but we need to see other guys who could come in. Jack Butland knew he was playing at the end of last week: most of his caps have come away so it’s nice for him to play here. Jesse Lingard and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain were excellent the other day: they can break forward and score goals. Dele Alli’s not been able to train fully, but of course he’s a very important player for us. We need a little bit more composure with the final ball, but we’ll create chances and we have the guys who can finish them. We want to finish this week on a high.” Burnley defender James Tarkowski does indeed make his England debut. He’ll line up on the left of Gareth Southgate’s fancy new back three, replacing Joe Gomez / Harry Maguire. Meanwhile Jack Butland takes his turn in goal; Ashley Young takes the place of Danny Rose at left wing-back; Eric Dier comes in for Jordan Henderson; and Jamie Vardy replaces Marcus Rashford up front. Dominic Fifield saw you right. Italy make four changes to the side that lost to Argentina on Friday night. Davide Zappacosta of Chelsea takes the place of Roma’s Alessandro Florenzi at right back. PSG midfielder Marco Verratti makes way for young Lorenzo Pellegrini of Roma. Inter winger Antonio Candreva replaces Fiorentina’s Federico Chiesa. And the big one: Juve keeper Gianluigi Buffon, 40 years old with 176 caps, makes way for 19-year-old, four-cap Milan sensation Gianluigi Donnarumma. England: Butland, Walker, Stones, Tarkowski, Dier, Trippier, Oxlade-Chamberlain, Lingard, Young, Vardy, Sterling. Subs: Hart, Pickford, Pope, Rose, Henderson, Maguire, Mawson, Livermore, Lallana, Cook, Alli, Rashford, Welbeck. Italy: Donnarumma, Zappacosta, Rugani, Bonucci, De Sciglio, Pellegrini, Jorginho, Parolo, Candreva, Immobile, Insigne. Subs: Buffon, Perin, Ferrari, Darmian, Ogbonna, Bonaventura, Verratti, Belotti, Spinazzola, Verdi, Gagliardini, Cutrone, Cristante, Florenzi. Referee: Deniz Aytekin (Germany). And here’s some early breaking team news from our man Dominic Fifield: Dele Alli is expected to be among the England substitutes against Italy with Gareth Southgate set to start this evening’s friendly with the same forward-thinking midfield combination of Jesse Lingard and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain. The England coach had indicated on Monday that he intended to sleep on the precise makeup of his side as he sought “a balance between building upon what we did against the Netherlands and looking at a couple of things”. To that end, Burnley’s James Tarkowski is likely to make his international debut as the left-sided of the three centre-halves with Eric Dier anchoring midfield and Ashley Young drafted in at left wing-back. Jamie Vardy, coming in for Marcus Rashford, will partner Raheem Sterling up front. Yet Alli, who played the last 22 minutes in Amsterdam last Friday, may have to wait for his chance to impress, albeit it seems inconceivable that the 21-year-old would miss out on selection for the World Cup squad. The Tottenham Hotspur midfielder has scored only once in his last 19 internationals and had been hoping to impose himself in the absence of the injured Harry Kane in these two friendly fixtures. Instead, Southgate will cast Lingard and Oxlade-Chamberlain in as progressive No8s, pushing on ahead of Dier, as England seek to replicate the slick approach play which saw them ease past the Dutch last week. England welcome the fathers of catenaccio to Wembley tonight. Italy enter a bizarro world, in which the other team have the stellar defence: England haven’t conceded a goal in 537 minutes of play, since Stanislav Lobotka scored early on for Slovakia in a World Cup qualifier last September that Gareth Southgate’s side went on to win anyway. That run’s subsequently featured draws with world champions Germany and five-time World Cup winners Brazil, plus a first victory in the Netherlands since 1969. England are in a good mental space right now. Italy ... well, not so much. Having failed to qualify for the World Cup finals for only the second time in their history, it’s a struggle to get going right now. In their first match since failing to get past Sweden in the qualification play-offs, they went down meekly in Manchester last Friday, 2-0 against an Argentina side who didn’t need to call on Lionel Messi. They’ve also had to deal with the devastating loss of defender Davide Astori, the poor young man having passed away three weeks ago. Everything in proportion, of course, but the Azzurri could do with a little something to smile about again. Italy’s recent record in England will give them succour. On their last visit to Wembley, in 1997, Gianfraco Zola gave them a 1-0 win in the qualifiers for France 98. Their last performance on English soil was in 2002, though: a 2-1 victory at Elland Road, a match in which tonight’s coaches Gareth Southgate and Luigi di Biagio both played. Italy are looking to emerge from a dark period; England are running the rule over a few contenders for their World Cup squad. For wildly different reasons, both teams will be searching for a spirit-boosting result; hopefully we’ll get a show as a result. It’s a big night at Wembley as two erstwhile World Cup winners go head to head. It’s on! Kick off: 8pm BST."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"books/2018/mar/25/joanna-skelt-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-25T17:23:20Z","webTitle":"Joanna Skelt obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/mar/25/joanna-skelt-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/mar/25/joanna-skelt-obituary","fields":{"headline":"Joanna Skelt obituary","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"My friend Joanna Skelt, who has died of cancer aged 49, explored writing as an expression of conflict and identity. As Birmingham’s poet laureate in 2013-14, she found inspiration in the city’s diversity and restless energy. She brought the electric excitement of the Blackpool illuminations to a live-poetry Christmas lights switch-on in Stirchley, ran writing workshops that linked schools from Freetown, Sierra Leone, with the city, and worked with musicians from Symphony Hall. In Connected Journeys, the title poem of her 2014 collection, she wrote of Birmingham: The city a kaleidoscope, a daring embroidery Spread out like spokes, a web, itself a giant wheel each of us carrying Wrapped inside ourselves Our own threads and journeys Each of us an infinitesimal part Such that every wrong, tear or break is ours too Stitched into the very tapestry of us. Born in Staffordshire, to Diana (nee Hankey) and Ralph Skelt, a science teacher, Jo spent her early childhood in Cornwall. They moved to Great Gransden, Cambridgeshire, for her father’s work and Jo went to Longsands college, St Neots (1979-84), then Cambridge College of Art and Technology (1984-86) before studying politics at Hull University. After graduation in 1990 she returned to Cambridge to work as a project officer for the International Extension College, which supported educational initiatives in developing countries. In 1997 she travelled to Freetown to research peace education following the civil war there, for her MA thesis at University of Kent the same year. She continued to work in this area, with projects in youth and community work, writing and training, both home and abroad. In 2003 she set up Arena for Change International, a small NGO to promote social participation as a means of preventing conflict. In 2014 she completed the PhD on the social function of writing in postwar Sierra Leone that she undertook at Birmingham University, and two years later returned to its department of African studies and anthropology as a teaching fellow. She also wrote social studies and citizenships books for schools in countries including Jamaica, Ethopia, Ghana and Sierra Leone for Macmillan Education. She was poet-in-residence in eight schools in Freetown and in Birmingham (2009-10). While in Sierra Leone, she also established a writers’ network and, as an amateur saxophonist, played jazz with local musicians. A solo parent with a young daughter, Jo had a gift for gathering friends. She bought a caravan she named Dotty, for weekends out of the city and found community with the Unitarians. Jo was treated for breast cancer in 2015. When it returned in November 2017, she began a blog, describing writing as a form of agency, “re-tessellating pain … into something which contains beauty (if only in broken shards)”. Jo is survived by her daughter, her parents, and her brother."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/mar/25/the-guardian-view-on-elections-in-egypt-two-candidates-no-real-choice","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-25T17:17:18Z","webTitle":"The Guardian view on elections in Egypt: two candidates, no real choice | Editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/25/the-guardian-view-on-elections-in-egypt-two-candidates-no-real-choice","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/25/the-guardian-view-on-elections-in-egypt-two-candidates-no-real-choice","fields":{"headline":"The Guardian view on elections in Egypt: two candidates, no real choice","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"On Monday the polls will open in Egypt so that voters can elect their president. The results are not in doubt: barring some truly staggering development, President Abdel Fatah al-Sisi will begin his second term. That too should have a certain outcome, ending in his departure from office under the constitution’s two-term limit. Will it? This is a meaningful election in the same way that the 2013 power seizure that brought Mr Sisi to the top was not a coup. The truth is obvious; the question is whether it is more convenient for some to ignore it. As in the 2014 election, he faces a single opponent – in the loosest sense. Mousa Mostafa Mousa, a vocal supporter of Mr Sisi until his abrupt decision to stand, told one interviewer that he was “not here to challenge the president”. Most assume, despite his denials, that he is running solely to lend a veneer of credibility to events. Five other candidates have been jailed or otherwise taken out of contention. Rights organisations have denounced the contest as farcical, warning that Egypt is in the grips of the worst human rights crisis in decades. Mr Sisi’s recent claim that he wished he faced more challengers suggests only a hitherto undiscovered sense of humour. But there is nothing funny about the ruthless crushing of dissent since the army overthrew the elected Muslim Brotherhood president, Mohamed Morsi (now in jail), and massacred hundreds of his supporters. The new order has proved more repressive than even Hosni Mubarak’s hated regime, forced out by Arab spring protests after three decades. That permitted a certain level of discussion because it believed it safer to let people vent frustrations; the new order appears to have concluded that tolerating any opposition is dangerous. There are tens of thousands of political prisoners and executions have risen sharply. A growing media crackdown has seen journalists detained and jailed; this weekend it emerged that a British reporter had been arrested and expelled. While there is still popular support for Mr Sisi’s strongman rule, albeit perhaps reflecting the desire for stability after turbulence, the election will tell us little about the Egyptian people’s will. It has, however, exposed tensions in the military and security establishment, including via the failed attempts of the former senior military officers Ahmed Shafik and Sami Anan to stand. One complaint is the concentration of power. Since October, the regime has replaced the military chief of staff, the head of national security and the intelligence chief. Opponents have been beaten down. Mr Sisi’s path has been smoothed by the political course of his international patrons, notably the US, UAE and Saudi Arabia. Egypt’s size and location have long been an advantage; now too it is regarded as essential to the fight against Islamic State – despite the grave concerns about the rising toll of violence in northern Sinai, which has been under emergency law since 2014 – and European leaders see it as vital to curbing migration. In a new report, Transparency International warns that western states and arms companies have contributed to the Egyptian military’s consolidation of power through aid and security assistance with minimal conditions. The real question now is how long Mr Sisi stays in power. Supporters have called for the lifting of term limits (as happened last month in China); others have suggested extending the four-year terms. There might well be internal disquiet at such a shift. It might, too, galvanise broader opposition in Egypt. Could it be enough to prompt compliant western governments to push back? It should be."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/2018/mar/25/freedom-of-speech-or-freedom-to-life","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-25T16:48:39Z","webTitle":"Freedom of speech or freedom to life? | Brief letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/25/freedom-of-speech-or-freedom-to-life","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/mar/25/freedom-of-speech-or-freedom-to-life","fields":{"headline":"Freedom of speech or freedom to life?","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Those taking issue with Nesrine Malik’s fears about far-right propaganda (Letters, 24 March) are not those at the butt end of far-right violence.

After a series of violent incidents in which Nelani struck out at classmates and teachers, the school had made a decision: she could no longer attend classes. Struggling with a combination of mental illness and drug addiction, her parents struggled to process what they were being told. “It’s like we were there but we weren’t there,” Katherine, Nelani’s mother, tells the Guardian. “We were just, vacant, because we didn’t understand really where they were coming from. All we heard was that our daughter was getting thrown out of the school. It was just like, ‘Wow, she’s six years old, this is so unfair.’” That meeting could have been a life sentence for Nelani – the beginning of a cycle of conflict and distrust with an education system unable or unwilling to address the barely hidden trauma at the heart of her behaviour. “It set this precedent of what school was going to be like,” says her father, David. “She didn’t want to go back to school after that. It completely destroyed any trust she had. For us too, actually. There was a perception that if we got it from one school we’ll get it wherever we go.” Except they didn’t. Two years later, Nelani, now eight, is spoken about in glowing terms by the teachers, doctors and social workers who poured hundreds of hours of resources into helping bring her and her family back from what they call their “fog”. Nelani’s new school, Wilmot Road primary, is on the south side of Shepparton, a town of about 63,000 people, two hours north of Melbourne. Statistically among the most disadvantaged schools in Victoria, it is set in a neighbourhood dominated by 1970s-era public housing properties inhabited by disadvantaged families and, increasingly, a booming refugee population. The Guardian spent a week inside Wilmot and its secondary neighbour, McGuire College, talking to teachers, parents and students to get a close look at the challenges facing Australia’s unequal public school system. A question emerged: how much does it cost to give a disadvantaged child the tools to benefit from an education? And do Australia’s schools have those resources? “It can feel like fighting a boxing match with both arms tied behind your back, at times,” one teacher told the Guardian. But despite the built-in inequities, there are victories, such as the case of Nelani. How far has she come? Katherine illustrates this with two gift-wrapped parcels. Beneath a coffee table in their weatherboard home , the presents have been bought and carefully wrapped for two of Nelani’s classmates whose birthday parties she is due to attend. “Little miss social butterfly,” Katherine calls her. “Once upon a time she didn’t know what a friend was.” Nelani is bubbly and precocious. One recent afternoon she climbed on her older brother Michael’s shoulders in their front yard as Katherine and Dave tried to explain the change in her in those two years, and the impact Wilmot Road has had on her life. “Wilmot saved us,” Katherine explains. “Not just Nelani, but our whole family. Without that school I honestly don’t know what would have happened to us.” Troubling social stratification Remember the Gonski report? In 2011 the businessman David Gonski released a report on Australia’s education system, which proposed a revolutionary overhaul of the way schools were funded. Sector-blind and needs-based, Gonski’s proposal – adopted by the then Gillard government in title, if not deed, was for funding to be allocated on the basis of a per-student benchmark, which included loadings based on disadvantage. The plan was supposed to help address inequity in the system so that, in Gonski’s words, “differences in educational outcomes are not the result of differences in wealth, income, power or possessions”. But, it hasn’t. Thanks in part to the continuation of several special funding deals with individual states and sectors – which the education minister, Simon Birmingham, is seeking to unwind against fierce resistance from the Catholic education system and, lately, the Labor party – most of the problems that Gonski identified six years ago are the same or worse. Student outcomes measured against benchmarks such as Naplan have flatlined, Australia’s position in international education rankings has gone backwards and, most damningly, researchers such as Chris Bonner from the Centre for Policy Development continually point to a troubling social stratification within and between school sectors. It’s a problem Shepparton knows all too well. The Guardian sat in on a staff meeting of high school maths teachers resigned to a lack of working calculators. A week earlier, the prestigious Trinity Grammar School in Melbourne had recruited a former federal court judge to lead an investigation into the sacking of a deputy headmaster who gave a student a haircut. Shepparton is a city of contrasts. Drive in any direction outside town and you’ll soon hit the orchards and farms that account for about 25% of Victoria’s agricultural production. But the town has long battled entrenched disadvantage, highlighted by high youth unemployment, welfare dependency and one of Victoria’s worst high school completion rates. Teachers at Wilmot and McGuire told the Guardian it was common for students to enter school several years behind developmentally. Dr Peter Eastaugh, a respected paediatrician who has practised in the town for 40 years, says Shepparton is “a tale of two cities”. “We have a massive growth and development in one part of Shepparton and then there are pockets of significant disadvantage in other parts,” he says. “And it’s very easy for the man in his Mercedes to drive past the drunk in the gutter without the two ever meeting.” On the north side of Shepparton, new suburbs made up of McMansions with Toyota Klugers in the driveway sit uncomfortably alongside streets of public housing properties, where children ride Razor scooters and blast Migos and Tupac out of their mobile phones. For the past five years, Eastaugh, the former head of paediatrics at Goulburn Valley Health, has been at the centre of a program trying to break the cycle of disadvantage in Shepparton by going directly into schools such as Wilmot. Through the Neighbourhood Schools Program, he runs health clinics for children identified as being at risk in five of Shepparton’s primary schools. Since starting the program, he has worked with 360 children between the ages of six and 12, who he has diagnosed with foetal alcohol syndrome disorder, learning, behavioural or speech disorders, and, in a small number of cases, addiction. But Eastaugh tells the Guardian he quickly recognised that an “overwhelming” number of the children he saw – 25% – suffered from some sort of environmental trauma, a product of the drug addiction, domestic violence and poverty he says is “endemic” in some parts of Shepparton. Environmental trauma comes up a lot in Shepparton. And it’s not just a result of family violence or poverty. Since the 1990s, the town has been a beacon for migrants seeking work picking fruit in orchards alongside European backpackers. It’s a diversity that Shepparton’s residents take pride in. Half a dozen people pointed out to the Guardian that in 2015, when a proposed mosque in Bendigo led to a series of ugly anti-Islam demonstrations, Shepparton was quietly building its fourth. But the influx of migrants has meant particular challenges for schools. In 2017 70% of Wilmot’s enrolments came from a non-English speaking background. About 40% of the school’s enrolments come from Afghan families. They are exclusively Hazara, an ethnic minority persecuted by the Taliban. It means that while the school’s administrators struggle to build trust with parents who might have had little or no exposure to a formal education setting, classroom teachers deal with students coming from a trauma background that few of them can comprehend. “A lot of our families have [a] very low education because they’ve always been pushed back from education,” says Zahra Khademi, Wilmot’s Afghani family liaison officer. “Because of the background, these people are not tending to go to complain or find out what’s going on. If they think their children are not OK or are in trouble at school they’re going to just keep them back at home.” So Wilmot decided to do something about it. Using some of the $3.2m in extra money that the Victorian state government has pumped into the school in the past three years as part of an equity funding program, it has sought to turn itself into more than just a school. In doing so it has become a case study for what can happen when a school has the funding it requires. Wilmot now employs speech and play therapists, as well as family liaison officers for the school’s Arabic and Afghan students. It also runs a scholarship program, linking students with members of Shepparton’s professional community. Paul Greenwood, the school’s community relationships coordinator, says the goal was to turn Wilmot into something closer to a community hub. “It’s just not enough to sit a kid down in a class and say ‘learn this’ when those same kids may not have had breakfast that morning, when they’re dealing with things at home that make that impossible,” he says. “One thing I’ve learnt in my time here is that these kids are just as smart, just as capable, as kids at private schools, but they need support.” Schools as community hubs The idea of schools becoming community hubs is not new, and there are programs in most states that seek to make schools the centre of their communities. It’s not without its challenges though. Since 2012, New South Wales has been running the Connected Communities program, which has pumped $60m into 15 of the state’s most disadvantaged schools with the goal of turning them into “service hubs”. The program has had some success, improving attendance rates and student behaviour at some schools. There is also evidence of increased parent engagement. But an interim report released in 2016 found that some of the issues faced by disadvantaged communities were “beyond the abilities of schools to address alone”. It also found that schools involved in the program had not improved academic performance. Jennifer Buckingham, an education researcher from the Centre for Independent Studies, says schools have only a certain number of hours a day, and their core business still needs to be educating. “It comes down to, schools have a job, which is to educate students, and for every intervention outside of the classroom that’s less time that they have teaching children to read and write,” she says. But at Wilmot, there is a sense that the school has to do something. Laura West, the school’s play therapist, says bringing therapy services into the schoolremoves one barrier for children to get access to the help they need. “Parents have to bring their kid to school anyway, so the kid comes to their paediatric appointment,” she says. “They don’t have to drag them to or from therapy, and they don’t have to pay for it because I pull them out of class for 45 minutes and give them their session. “So the attendance in therapy is far higher than in any other environment because they’re already in school.” And, at least in some cases, they are seeing success. The school’s latest Naplan results place it substantially above other schools with a similar advantage profile in writing, spelling, grammar and numeracy. But perhaps more importantly, staff at the school believe they are helping address some of the issues at the heart of the area’s disadvantage. When Katherine first brought Nelani to Wilmot, her family was in a prolonged state of personal crisis. Katherine was struggling with severe mental illness and caught in the grips of an ice and cannabis addiction. A 2012 house fire in which the family lost all their possessions had left them traumatised. But Greenwood says the school and other service providers, including the Rumbalara Aboriginal Cooperative, “wrapped Nelani and her family up”. “When we first came to the school, she was breaking down in tears, not even wanting to come in,” Katherine says. “Now, she’s a normal, happy little girl.” From his office in Shepparton, Eastaugh, the paediatrician, estimates that “hundreds of hours” and countless resources had been invested into helping the family get on its feet. “But look at that little girl,” he says. “How can that not be worth it?”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/mar/27/mohameds-life-story-is-a-tragedy-but-its-typical-for-fathers-held-on-manus","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-26T23:12:32Z","webTitle":"Mohamed's life story is a tragedy.

But it's typical for fathers held on Manus","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Approximately five years ago Mohamed, a Sudanese refugee, was exiled to Manus Island by the Australian government. The blow was sudden and significant – this man’s life was completely transformed. He had left behind a pregnant wife and two-year-old daughter in Dafur, Sudan. Mohamed’s life story is a real tragedy. He is young, he is a handsome man with broad, penetrating eyes. But as he stares ahead one senses an intense depression deep down in his soul; the lines running across his face flow with intense sorrow. A few months after Mohamed was exiled to Manus his second daughter came into the world. He was overjoyed in the way all fathers are upon the arrival of their newborn child. That was at a time when the refugees were suffering – they were being brutally punished in an effort to force them to return to their countries. For Mohamed, however, refoulement meant the ultimate end; returning to Sudan meant death. News spread through the prison a few months after the birth of his daughter: “They killed Mohamed’s wife.” Losing a partner is absolutely shocking for any person, and Mohamed was deeply in love with his wife. The story was like this: a group of armed men sprayed her with bullets as she stood out on an empty farm. This incident elicited a wave of emotional support from the other men – men who were themselves struggling with feelings of hopelessness. It has been five years since that loss and Mohamed’s daughters have turned seven and five years old. And Mohamed remains a captive here on Manus Island. Suddenly, he stares ahead once again, gazes up into the sky and says: “At the moment they are with my elderly mother living in one of the villages in Darfur. My mother is looking after them. But for some time I’ve been thinking to myself that my eldest daughter should have started school by now. However, our village doesn’t have any schools.” No doubt, Mohamed has dreams for his daughters. Throughout all these years their father has only ever been like a shadow in their lives; they feel his presence, but only in spirit. He has many dreams for his daughters, but one of the most fundamental among them is that they go to school. Mohamed expresses a bitter smile: “They have been the only thing that has given me hope throughout all these harsh years. They are the only reason I’m alive. Over these years I’ve been trying my hardest to communicate this feeling to them, I want them to know they have a father, I want them to know that one day their father will hold them in his arms.” There is also Kaveh, who I know well. He is a man with bushy eyebrows and a broad, chiselled face. A visage full of a kind of vibrancy for life – the joys of childhood clearly radiating from his face. His son Taha was born while he was still in Indonesia. He has never laid eyes on his boy. Taha has started speaking now. Taha has started to walk. He calls his father bābā over the phone. Kaveh is extremely compassionate and a genuine family man. I am sure his situation was extraordinarily difficult that he was forced to leave his pregnant wife and flee Iran. I ask Kaveh if he has ever thought about returning during these last years. He wraps his hands around the crown of his head, he pauses for a moment in reflection, the question evokes feelings of shame, the question humiliates him. He replies: “Is there any man in this world who wouldn’t want to be with his boy and his partner? If I could return I wouldn’t put up with this agony for a second, let alone have to live with the pain for five years.” Kaveh’s story doesn’t end with the separation from his wife and child. It had only been a few months since being exiled to Manus prison when he received news that his father had died. Having to mourn the loss of loved ones is part of the reality of being locked up in Manus prison. There is no choice but to confront this reality – it is an integral part of life in this place. But for Kaveh this incident was incredibly difficult. He is still trying to come to terms with the death after all these years. He sighs with grief and tells me: “I knew my father was sick. Talking to him over the phone at that time was really tough. We weren’t permitted to talk for more than a few minutes every week, calls were restricted. One day, no matter how much I tried to convince them to let me call, the authorities wouldn’t allow me to use the phone. They told me I had to wait a few days. When I called after a few days I found out he had died. After all these years I still think if I had had the opportunity to speak to my father what would he have said. They showed no mercy when they prohibited me from speaking to my father. The whole thing was horrific.” Kaveh’s is the story of a father who lost his own father. And there is Aryobarzan, a 45-year-old man from Iran with two daughters aged five and seven. He puts up their photos on the wall in his room. When he looks at the pictures he describes the sweet manner in which they speak to him over the phone, and he begins to laugh. He says that his youngest daughter’s personality takes after him. Remembering this aspect of her character makes him happy for a moment, he laughs again. I have known Aryobarzan for years. He resided over in the bed opposite me for a whole year. A man with curly hair, a strong man with a broad physique. A kind-hearted human who has respect among all the refugees; everyone can count on his him because of his wealth of life experiences. His personality is such that many of the younger guys look up to him like a big brother. But on many occasions, in the middle of the night, I used to notice he would descend into the depths of sorrow thinking about his little girls. When I ask him what is the most painful thing he has had to experience in this prison, he just continues smoking and says: “You know, I love my wife and daughters. The thing that causes me the most suffering is being away from them. But there’s another pain within this suffering; that is, Australia didn’t let me take pleasure in seeing my kids grow up during the sweetest period of their lives. And this causes me enormous distress.” But he also speaks of something really beautiful, as well. He recounts: “Some time ago it was my daughter’s birthday. She said to me ‘Daddy, I want a kangaroo soft toy.’ And through one of my Australian friends I was able to post a toy kangaroo to her.” Moments later he showed me the photo. I can only describe the image in one way: a little girl, dark eyes, hugging a kangaroo, and her thick lips kissing the toy. These are some short snippets from the stories of the fathers held in Manus. They are just a few examples of dozens of men who have been battling the pain of being separated from their partners and children for years and years. It is not completely clear how many of the refugees in Manus are married. But what is obvious is that the suffering that these fathers undergo is profound, the suffering is compounded with all the other anguish one feels on this island. It is important to point out that the other refugees totally identify with their pain and sympathise with them. This is nothing other than the realisation that the fathers are suffering in ways over and above what every prisoner already goes through. These stories are exclusive insights, a window into the lives of men who are experiencing a profound loneliness, the unbearable feeling that they are nothing more than forgotten people. Men killed between the cogs of a political machine. However, it is their humanity that helps them endure this system. Many people try to construct an accurate picture of the situation for refugees on Manus Island and Nauru using statistics: such as “five years in detention” or “2,000 individuals”. I must say that applying this statistical approach cannot penetrate the depth of the issue. The central concern is the opportunity to live life well. Only through a profound engagement with the lived experiences of refugees can one realise the extent of the human disaster, only by listening to the life stories of the prisoners can one understand the torture they have had to endure. The core problem is that one cannot arrive at an accurate picture of the lives of these men by searching between the layers upon layers of newspapers, or within the arguments made by politicians and human rights activists. Perhaps this is the reason that until now Australian politicians have avoided coming to this island, perhaps this is the reason why they do not want to see these men up close. Perhaps this is the reason why they do not want to hear their life stories. They are afraid to look into the eyes of these refugees. This is the standpoint of the political authorities and leading public figures in Australia, they all see the prisoners as nothing but 2,000 refugees. The only result in this way of thinking is to reduce the character, identity and humanity of these people to a basic category: “refugee”. They want to simplify them to a one-dimensional being, a one-dimensional construct. They want to render them an object without any capacity to think intelligently, an object without feelings, an object without family. For me, who has been incarcerated in Manus Prison for five years, this question plagues me: if I was in a situation like these fathers, where I had a little son or a daughter who I could not hold in my arms, could I have withstood the hardship for this many years? I must confess, in all honesty, that when I think about this question I not only cannot find an answer but I also experience a mix of agony and terror. They are truly inspiring men. Without a doubt, this suffering is being felt thousands of kilometres away. This suffering is real in the lives of children, in the world inhabited by those little girls who hold their dolls tight in the dead of night. This suffering engulfs the dreams of children. This suffering isolates and afflicts women who have to carry all the burdens of life that weigh down on them. These women have to endure the misery of separation. The affliction continues to travel far and wide. Without a doubt, this affliction is reproduced in faraway lands and distant places, in remote towns and villages. These families suffer together. This is another side of the world we inhabit. Australia is not only holding 2,000 individuals hostage – Australia is holding many thousands more people hostage around the world.

The Scottish striker’s goal made it 2-2 in the quarter-final, and she then went on to score another in extra-time before Ella Toone completed the 4-2 victory which booked a semi-final against the Women’s Super League leaders Chelsea. Victoria Williams put Sunderland on their way to a potential shock in the 32nd minute when a Lucy Staniforth free-kick was flicked into her path, allowing her to direct the ball under the City goalkeeper. The hosts held the lead for 40 minutes until the England international Demi Stokes found herself in the right place to divert a pull back from the substitute Nadia Nadim into the back of the net. Despite the blow, Sunderland fought back to retake the lead soon after as Staniforth sent an unstoppable shot into the top corner from distance. It was a goal deserving of a win but it was not to be for Sunderland. In the final minute of normal time Ross was the first to react to a rebound, leaving City joyous and Sunderland broken heading into the additional 30 minutes. It was the City striker who would make the difference in extra‑time as she made the most of good work from Toone on the wing before sending it to Ross to complete the move. Toone then scored to confirm the victory with six minutes left on the clock, dashing any hope of a comeback from Sunderland. Everton also made it through to the last four by breezing past Durham 6-1 with Courtney Sweetman-Kirk scoring a hat-trick. They will face Arsenal in the semi-finals after the north London side hammered Charlton 5-0. City’s involvement in the Women’s FA Cup gave Chelsea the opportunity to pull further clear of Nick Cushing’s second-placed side in the league at home against Reading but they took only partial advantage, drawing 2-2. Chelsea went behind as Brooke Chaplen converted a penalty midway through the first half. Things did not get better for the hosts after the break as Fara Williams doubled the advantage. Eventually Chelsea rallied as Fran Kirby reduced the deficit when she fired home against her former club. With 12 minutes remaining Kirby crossed for Jonna Andersson who smashed the ball in off the bar to earn a draw that leaves them two points above Manchester City having played a game more. Liverpool were thrashed 4-0 at Birmingham, who picked up their fourth win in five games thanks to goals from Rachel Williams, Paige Williams, Jess Carter and Ellen White."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/blog/2018/mar/26/rugby-union-talking-points-from-the-weekend-premiership-action","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-26T09:00:20Z","webTitle":"Rugby union: talking points from the weekend’s Premiership action","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2018/mar/26/rugby-union-talking-points-from-the-weekend-premiership-action","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/blog/2018/mar/26/rugby-union-talking-points-from-the-weekend-premiership-action","fields":{"headline":"Rugby union: talking points from the weekend’s Premiership action","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"1) Bath on the brink of disaster Another home defeat in the Premiership for Bath, whose season is now in grave danger of unravelling. It may have taken a late Joe Simmonds penalty for Exeter but after a bright start to the campaign Bath’s inconsistency has been their downfall and they occupy eighth place in the table. They will most likely have to win all four of their remaining matches to reach the play-offs and failure to qualify for the Champions Cup would be an unmitigated disaster. Bath have not been helped by injuries but there have been times this season when Todd Blackadder’s frustration at his players’ inability to take on board his instructions has been palpable. Supporters can but hope a trip to Twickenham next month – when they host Leicester – will bring out their best. Gerard Meagher • Match report: Bath 18-20 Exeter 2) England can take heart from Genge’s return It was not a positive afternoon for England on the injury front at Welford Road but there was certainly a bright note with the return of Ellis Genge for his first appearance since December following a shoulder injury. He made an immediate impact at the scrum – highlighted by Dai Young as a key reason why his side could not pull clear of Leicester in the second half – and he is always a menace in the loose. When Eddie Jones talks about resting some of his British &amp; Irish Lions, Mako Vunipola must be close to the front of the queue for a breather and facing the Springboks would represent an excellent opportunity for Genge to continue his development. Scrummaging has always been the concern but it was certainly a strength against Wasps. GM • Match report: Leicester Tigers 16-15 Wasps 3) McNally’s comeback brings a bit of perspective London Irish may be staring at a return to the Championship, just as the Premiership contemplates closing the door, but such considerations were put into perspective by the recent experience of Josh McNally, who returned to the side after a stroke in October, scored the game’s first try and acted generally as a reminder that playing remains a privilege, however difficult times may get. The lock-cum-flanker has undergone surgery to close a hole in his heart, a relatively common condition but one dangerous to anyone who pushes themselves as hard as professional athletes. The hole allowed a clot to escape after Irish’s defeat against Saracens, precipitating a minor stroke. “I’m lucky it wasn’t worse,” he said, grateful for more than just Irish’s man-of-the-match award. Michael Aylwin • Match report: London Irish 29-33 Gloucester 4) Falcons’ bumper crowd hints at bright future Newcastle’s victory was not the most aesthetically pleasing but its value cannot be underestimated. Playing at St James’ Park in front of a bumper crowd of 30,174 – almost three times their previous best home attendance – Dean Richards’s team again showed that winning has become a habit. This latest success strengthened the Falcons’ play-off prospects and should also help to grow their fanbase. They have a three-year agreement to play an annual match at Newcastle United’s stadium and Toby Flood, a former St James’ Park ball-boy who kicked 20 points against an ill-disciplined Saints, said: “I’ve been lucky enough to play at some pretty awesome venues during my career but that was a huge tick in the box and after that final whistle the buzz was just incredible.” Ross Heppenstall • Match report: Newcastle 25-22 Northampton 5) Cloud on Sale’s sunny horizon There may be disciplinary proceedings this week after the Worcester fly-half Jamie Shillcock was picked up on the microphone complaining that a Sale player had twice made a homophobic remark. The two directors of rugby said afterwards that they knew nothing about it. Meanwhile Sale go into the final four rounds of the Premiership six points off a play-off position. The Sharks have assembled one of the most potent back divisions in the league, starting with Faf de Klerk at scrum-half and finishing with a back three of Mike Haley, Denny Solomona and a rejuvenated Marland Yarde. If Champions Cup qualification is their main goal, the play-offs are more than a distant dream, although one of their remaining fixtures is at Exeter. Their final match at home to Leicester is likely to have something on it for both sides. Paul Rees • Match score: Sale 58-25 Worcester 6) Quins mix sublime and ridiculous Harlequins have as many strands to their personality as there are colours on their traditional jersey (on the rare occasions it seems to be worn in these commercial times). They went toe-to-toe with Saracens for the most part and saw more of the ball, but for every standout moment – and Joe Marchant had a few in the centre as did Marcus Smith when he came on at fly-half – there were a couple of horrendous ones, usually involving weak tackling which contributed to the two tries they conceded. They had more players returning from England duty than Saracens but, while their rivals are collectively strong, Quins are a largely individual side. Their director of rugby, John Kingston, said it was the strongest squad he had known; his task is to make it gel as the Challenge Cup beckons.

It kicked off with Balagué lobbing up a soft one, asking England’s manager what album he would choose to keep if he could listen to only one. Rather than just doing the decent thing and saying, yeah, I listen to Drake in the car, Southgate went on to talk – for absolutely ages – about how lucky he was to have been in so many dressing rooms, to have been exposed to different kinds of music, different genres and cultures. “Yes OK, but what album?” Guillem cut in, not giving it up. “Well,” Gareth mused, dwelling a bit more on his recent experience of new music through the younger generation, how varied the cultural palate is, how diverse and multilayered, before concluding, “I guess I’d have to say The Joshua Tree by U2.” As moments of endearingly David Brent-style comedy go, this made for a good start to an interesting interview. But it also seemed to chime with the wider sense in Southgate-era England of a lot of carefully managed chatter, a place of DNA and cultures and multifaceted whatnot, all set against the same rather careful stadium-rock football. Or perhaps not. Gareth and The Joshua Tree also came to mind, briefly, as the team for Friday night’s friendly against the Netherlands was announced. The current England squad is a mixed affair, with plenty of outsiders, form horses, and many who have reached this level via the road less travelled. Could it be that England really are about to set off for a major tournament with a team made up of left-field cuts and indie favourites? In the event the opposite happened in Amsterdam. This was instead a Joshua Tree of a team, compromised entirely of mainstream, platinum-selling parts. All 10 outfield players were drawn from clubs in the last 16 of the Champions League. Every player had spent some part of his youth at a Premier League-or-equivalent academy. Only two Englishman over the age of 27 touched the ball all night. There has been an understandable urge to play down the import of a 1-0 win away to a poor Dutch team, who had only three Champions League players of their own on the pitch. Two years ago England beat the world champions and the current European champions as part of their preparations for being humiliated by Iceland at the European Championship. But there are also times when credit is due for the methodology as much as the endgame. This was in its own way a process realised, a case of Peak Gareth. Win or lose, this team puts to the test the structures and tactics incubated at St George’s Park, via Premier League academies and Southgate’s own under-21 group. There were plenty of coherent elements. It was striking to hear Ronald Koeman, who knows a bit about elite winning teams, say that England had been more comfortable on the ball. It is a significant cultural shift, and a genuine departure after decades spent watching England teams for whom the ball has so often appeared to be square. Southgate has instead dropped established international players he feels lack the necessary technical ease to enact his plan of attritional possession from back to front. It would have been easier not to do this, easier not to put Kyle Walker, a player more used to having the ball at his feet, in his back three. But Southgate stuck to the blueprint, and his team’s comfort in possession as they reined in the Dutch was his reward. England managers have a history of encouraging selections in friendlies, before reverting to the staid old celebrity parts when the tournament pressures arrive. It is to be hoped Southgate will buck this trend. For all the lack of real starriness there were no weak links here, no hobbling A-listers. Every player in the team was fit and full of running. Some have lamented the absence of Jack Wilshere, pointing to a preference for athleticism over invention. But Wilshere would have been the odd man out in other ways, too, lacking pace, mobility and power. Plus, of course, football has changed a great deal quite quickly. It is a high-pressure team game now. Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain may lack Wilshere’s artistry, may not caress the ball so lovingly or suggest deeper playmaking gears but in between his sprints and hustle he has also scored and made more goals this season. Similarly, the attacking three had balance, with no sense of hierarchy or duties too rigidly defined. Marcus Rashford, Jesse Lingard and Raheem Sterling all made runs across the frontline and dropped deep at times. It is often assumed in English football that a tall, muscular centre-forward is the definition of a “plan B”. But interchanging, making different runs, tugging away at the stitches: this is how the best teams vary the point of attack rather than simply tearing up the plan and taking to the skies. None of which is to say England are suddenly a top-10 team or that this studied planning is going to hold through the extreme stress of tournament football. But after the DNA, the talk about culture and repeating tactical patterns, this was the closest we have come to an example of Total Gareth. England kept the ball and attacked as a mobile unit. Even the goalkeeper seemed grooved to fit the plan, Jordan Pickford’s control and distribution is well suited if England really do intend to continue this way. No doubt someone will expose the weak points in this set of players. The defence will be pressed by stronger teams. The lack of high-grade passing in midfield may be a problem. But it is to be hoped the selection and tactics against Italy at Wembley can keep to the same course, if only for the fascination of seeing a plan, so often talked up, finally start to bite."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"books/2018/mar/25/bob-biderman-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-25T16:29:39Z","webTitle":"Bob Biderman obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/mar/25/bob-biderman-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/mar/25/bob-biderman-obituary","fields":{"headline":"Bob Biderman obituary","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"My father, Bob Biderman, who has died aged 77, was a writer, publisher and activist. He was one of the first Americans to refuse to fight in Vietnam, an experience that became the basis for his first novel, Letters to Nanette (1982). After moving to the UK he wrote mysteries and thrillers, one of which, The Genesis Files, was listed as one of the top 10 crime novels of 1988 by the Guardian. The main character, Joseph Radkin, would feature in five books. Born to Jewish communist parents, Fannie (nee Kuller), an artist, and Abraham (Ed) Biderman, a union organiser, Bob’s early youth was spent in Cincinnati, Ohio, where he went to Walnut Hills high school. As the McCarthy era escalated, Ed was forced underground and Fannie and the children resettled in Los Angeles for a few years, where Bob attended Fairfax high school. The family was eventually reunited, and Bob subsequently fictionalised these events in his book Red Dreams (2004). He went to UC Berkeley in 1960 to study medicine, but dropped out after two years to travel around Europe. While there, he was drafted into the US military. He spent nearly two years as an army medic before refusing to go to Vietnam in 1965. He joined the antiwar movement, and went to San Francisco State University to study English literature, where he met fellow student Joy Magezis. In 1968 they participated in the longest-running student strike in US history. Bob graduated in 1969 and the following year he and Joy married. During the mid-1970s they performed political puppet shows across the US and founded the magazine Puppetry in Education News, which they ran until 1980. After Letters to Nanette gained a wider readership in the UK, Bob and Joy moved to Cambridge. Bob wrote full-time for most of the 80s, then taught English for Speakers of Other Languages (ESOL) at the College of North West London (1990–2005), and ran ESOL magazine (1995-2003), publishing stories and poetry he had inspired his students to write. Out of a love of cafes and their history as places that, as Bob said, “fired the flames of dissent”, he started the website Café Magazine in 1994. This culminated in the book A People’s History of Coffee and Cafes (2013). In 1996 Bob had started Black Apollo Press with two friends, David Kelley and David Cutting.

Police said they were attacked by drug gangsters. The bloody operation in the Rocinha favela, located near postcard beaches like Leblon, came six months after the army briefly occupied the favela following a week of gun battles between rival drug gangs, and five weeks after President Michel Temer put the military in charge of Rio security. The incident came 11 days after the assassination of Rio councillor Marielle Franco, who had denounced recent killings of favela residents blamed on the city’s notoriously lethal police. In 2017, according to official figures, 1,115 people were killed as a result of “opposition to police intervention” in Rio state. Residents said one of the victims of Saturday’s operation, Matheus de Oliveira, 19, had no involvement with the drug trade. He was in a group that did waltz presentations dressed in replica navy uniforms. On Friday night, he and 11 others performed at a 15th birthday party nearby, said Alexander Izaias, 38, who lives in Rocinha and has run the project for 15 years. “Drug traffickers don’t dance waltz,” Izaias said. After the performance, De Oliveira and one of the other dancers went to an all-night baile funk party in a sports court near the favela’s entrance, he said. When police arrived shooting around 5.30am, the two men ran in different directions – but De Oliveira was shot in the back and died. “What most revolts me is the way he was killed,” said Izaias, describing a happy, fun-loving, normal young man. “It is an enormous loss.” Relatives of another victim, Júlio de Lima, 23, told Rio’s Extra newspaper site that he was going to work at a steakhouse when he was shot and killed. The former girlfriend of one of the victims, speaking anonymously for fear of reprisals, said he was a drug gang member and was shot in the head while sleeping near a drug sales point. Another resident said the death toll could be higher. “There are still wounded people in the alleys, it’s estimated that there are around 11-14 deaths and not eight as the police said,” the resident said, talking on condition of anonymity. In a statement, police said armed criminals opened fire on them as they patrolled the community. Six people had been killed and an AK-47 rifle, six pistols and three grenades were seized. All the dead were gang members, they said. “Unfortunately criminals from Rocinha insist in wanting to confront the police,” Maj Ivan Blaz, a police spokesman, told TV Globo, adding that 100 gang members had been arrested and 48 killed there since last September. TV Globo reported that homicide detectives had interviewed officers involved and said four of the dead men had criminal records, three did not and one was yet to be identified. Photographs circulating on WhatsApp showed bloodied bodies slumped in alleyways and on the back of a pickup. Some showed signs of apparent execution with bullet wounds in the back of the head. Some residents believe Saturday’s operation was a revenge mission after a police officer was killed in Rocinha on Wednesday, which Maj Blaz denied. According to Rio’s Igarapé Institute, a policy thinktank, 134 police officers were killed in Rio state in 2017. César Muñoz, a senior researcher at Human Rights Watch in Brazil, said he was concerned that tweets from police saying they took injured criminals to hospital left it unclear whether they were dead on arrival or died later. “We have documented many cases in the last decade in Rio de Janeiro in which officers delivered corpses to the hospital as a means of destroying crime scene evidence and hampering the investigation,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/mar/25/stuart-broad-australia-south-africa-darren-lehmann","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-25T15:27:20Z","webTitle":"‘Australia start fights and moan when someone comes back’ says Stuart Broad","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/mar/25/stuart-broad-australia-south-africa-darren-lehmann","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/mar/25/stuart-broad-australia-south-africa-darren-lehmann","fields":{"headline":"‘Australia start fights and moan when someone comes back’ says Stuart Broad","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Stuart Broad did not fall back on the Wenger defence in Auckland and no one expected that he would. Yes, he had seen the press conference of Steve Smith and Cameron Bancroft in Cape Town and he was clearly well versed in the minutiae of the saga. But he displayed a determination to be statesmanlike; there were no cheap jibes. Yet somehow when listening to him it was possible to intuit that he might be enjoying all this. “It’s a real shame,” he said. “It’s bringing cricket into the news in a way that cricket players and fans don’t want.” Broad has always received a hostile reception in Australia and has often given the impression that he quite relishes this. However, he was happy to own up to some bewilderment. “I don’t really understand Darren Lehmann coming out and saying the South African crowd has been out of order. Any England player, even media, who have toured Australia can laugh at those comments because some of the things we hear on the pitch from Australian supporters, known as ‘banter’, I know is worse than in South Africa.” Broad was asked whether he felt that Lehmann was being hypocritical. “That’s your word, not mine. But I would agree with you. You look at the quotes from that 2013 interview where he basically asks a country to send an opposition player [Broad, as it happens] home crying. I didn’t do that. We lost the series but they didn’t make me cry. I then can’t understand why you’d come out and moan about a different country and what’s been said to their players. Just from the outside it looks like Australia have started a lot of fights and then are moaning when someone comes back.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/mar/25/beast-of-wombwell-peter-pickering-dies-days-after-new-conviction","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-25T16:21:16Z","webTitle":"'Beast of Wombwell' Peter Pickering dies days after new conviction","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/mar/25/beast-of-wombwell-peter-pickering-dies-days-after-new-conviction","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/mar/25/beast-of-wombwell-peter-pickering-dies-days-after-new-conviction","fields":{"headline":"'Beast of Wombwell' Peter Pickering dies days after new conviction","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"A notorious killer found guilty last week of raping a teenager weeks before he took the life of another has died. Announcing the death of Peter Pickering, police said they had hoped to charge him with the murder of a third teenage girl. Pickering, who was nicknamed the Beast of Wombwell after he admitted the manslaughter of 14-year-old Shirley Boldy in 1972, died on Saturday night after being taken ill in secure psychiatric accommodation in Berkshire, police said. He was 80 and his death is not being treated as suspicious. Last week he was found guilty of the rape and false imprisonment of an 18-year-old woman in South Yorkshire three or four weeks before he killed Shirley. On Sunday, West Yorkshire police said they “strongly suspected” Pickering was also responsible for the killing of Elsie Frost, 14, who was stabbed to death in a tunnel beneath a railway line in Wakefield in 1965. Officers had interviewed him recently about the crime and expected he would soon be charged with her murder, the force said. It was while reinvestigating Frost’s killing that police found a secure lockup facility in Sheffield that Pickering had kept since he was incarcerated in 1972. Police believe he had somehow been paying rent on the storage unit over the decades, preserving exercise books, documents, letters and diaries, as well as a pair of handcuffs. The material suggested he had a long-held desire to commit violent offences against young girls. One letter, written by Pickering to his mother, suggested he had raped an 18-year-old woman weeks before killing Boldy in 1972. Detectives went to interview the victim, now a woman in her 60s. She told them she had thought she was going to be killed when she was violently raped by Pickering in his minivan near Stocksbridge, a town north of Sheffield on the edge of the Peak District. West Yorkshire police said of the Elsie Frost case: “We strongly suspected that Peter Pickering was responsible for her murder. We had been liaising with the Crown Prosecution Service and it was our expectation that Pickering would be charged in due course. “His unexpected death clearly means that will no longer happen. We have informed all those involved in the case of this development and we will be liaising with the West Yorkshire coroner as to what proceedings are now necessary.” Interest in the case was reignited in 2015 when Radio 4 ran a series, Who Killed Elsie Frost?, prompted by a plea by Elsie’s older sister, Ann Cleave, for the crime to be solved."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/live/2018/mar/26/australia-cricket-crisis-ball-tampering-steve-smith-england-ashes-updates-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-26T15:44:45Z","webTitle":"Australian cricket crisis: players await ball-tampering fate – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2018/mar/26/australia-cricket-crisis-ball-tampering-steve-smith-england-ashes-updates-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/live/2018/mar/26/australia-cricket-crisis-ball-tampering-steve-smith-england-ashes-updates-live","fields":{"headline":"Australian cricket crisis: players await ball-tampering fate – as it happened","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Steve Smith is set to lose the Australia captaincy for good, and faces a year-long ban. Read Ali Martin’s news story. We will be shutting down this liveblog now. Later on the site, Barney Ronay and Matthew Engel will share their thoughts on the ball-tampering scandal. The Australia cricket team’s major sponsors are reconsidering their relationship with the national side Cricket Australia’s CEO has flown to South Africa to join integrity chief, Iain Roy, and high performance head, Pat Howard in their investigation of the ball-tampering scandal An announcement as to the outcome of that investigation is expected from South Africa on Wednesday England captain Joe Root said he was not aware of ball-tampering during the Ashes, despite recent reports in the UK media Steve Smith has stood down as the captain of IPL side Rajasthan Royals Australian media are reporting that Smith and David Warner could face one-year bans Reports in the Australian press suggest bowlers including Mitch Starc, Josh Hazlewood and Nathan Lyon are distancing themselves from any “leadership group” in the dressing room Kim Hughes has joined the ranks of former Australia cricketers calling for Smith’s head. Asked whether Smith should captain the side again, he said: “No, not on your nelly, God, no. There have only been 43 or 44 men that have done it and you can’t accept someone with those standards.” Speaking to TalkSport, he said: “Cricket is our national game, the Baggy Green is an icon and the spirit that Australians stand for, the last thing you would want to be called is a cheat. That is what we were. It was absolutely disgraceful.” There has been happier news for an Australia XI today after Megan Schutt created history as the first Australian woman to bowl a hat-trick in a T20 International earlier. Schutt took the wickets of India’s Smirti Mandhana and Mithali Raj in consecutive balls to end the second over of during the home side’s chase in Australia’s tri-series match in Mumbai . She then had to wait for her hat-trick ball as the Australian captain Meg Lanning brought on Delissa Kimmince. Schutt was brought back on for the fifth over of the match and with her first delivery – the hat-trick ball – had Deepti Sharma, caught slogging at mid-off. “I didn’t even know I was on a hat-trick,” Schutt said. “Everyone keeps slamming Meg here but I wasn’t even aware, so it was probably a good thing.” Australia posted 187-5 and won the match by 36 runs after India reached 144-5 from their 20 overs. The victory takes them through to the tri-series final, where they’ll face England. The former England fast bowler John Lever, who was memorably caught up in a ball-tampering row on England’s tour of India in 1976-77, is surprised Australia captain Steve Smith thought he could get away with blatant ball-tampering. Lever said: “It was a bit silly. There are so many cameras around the grounds these days you are not going to get away with anything. If you’ve got something in your hand or in your pocket that you’re using to get an unfair advantage the powers that be must step in and do something about it. You do wonder why you’d open yourselves up to that sort of accusation when they’ve got good enough bowlers.” The Guardian’s former cricket correspondent, Mike Selvey, remembered the Lever incident in 2008: John Wylie, the Australian Sports Commission chairman, has reiterated his calls for a “strong and decisive” reaction from Cricket Australia following Steve Smith’s one-match ban from the ICC and has urged them to send the captain back to Australia to face his board. He added that, had a similar situation occurred at the Olympics, the person involved would have immediately been sent him. He said: “There have been penalties handed down by the International Cricket Council but we think Australia expects a stronger and more decisive response from Cricket Australia – a broader response because this really is all about the leadership and the example the Australian cricket team sets for Australian sport. “If an Olympic athlete was caught bringing the country or Olympic team into disrepute, they would be put on the first plane home. That’s an analogy that we think is quite appropriate in these circumstances. “We think it is quite possible not just for people to be stood down from the role of captain but to not play and to come home and face their board.” The ASC is Australia’s primary national sports administration agency, and is in charge of development and operation of the Australian sports system. Cameron Bancroft might have got away with his effort to alter the state of the ball had he not shoved the evidence down his pants, according to the man in charge of production at the broadcaster who caught him. The Australia cricketer was caught on camera placing what appeared to be yellow sticky tape, which he is thought to have used to collect rough granules from pitch in order to scuff the ball, into his underpants. It was only when he did that, the broadcaster thought something was up. “We initially just saw that he had something in his hand and he put it in his pocket, but we didn’t know what it was,” Alvin Naicker, head of production at SuperSport told Reuters. “It was only when he later panicked and put it in his underpants that we got sight of the yellow tape.” After the broadcaster showed the images of Bancroft’s actions on the big screen at the ground, umpires Nigel Llong and Richard Illingworth called the player over. He produced a black piece of cloth used to clean sunglasses from his pocket and the umpires were, at the time, satisfied. Naicker believes that had Bancroft kept the piece of yellow tape in his pocket and still produced the black cloth for the umpires, giving him the opportunity to dispose of the tape later, nobody would be the wiser. “The moment he tried to dispose of it in his pants, we knew that this was a major incident. Until then, we were not sure what we were looking at.” Naicker says they broadcast the footage of him rubbing the ball with the then unknown object almost immediately after the incident. “He [Bancroft] probably saw it two minutes after it happened and very smartly our cameraman focused on the coaching staff and we saw the coach [Darren Lehmann] get on the walkie-talkie to the player down on the field [Peter Handscomb], who ran on to speak with Bancroft. It was then he panicked.” “They haven’t murdered anyone” – comments from Chris Lynn, who has played 10 T20 internationals and one ODI for Australia may not help his or his side’s cause as they attempt to shrug off accusations of arrogance and hypocrisy. I reckon every cricketer has probably done it throughout their career in grade cricket or whatever level to an extent,” he said. “The cricket has been interesting of late. It’s keeping Test cricket on the map, isn’t it? It’s been interesting. Not exactly positive, but what’s happened has happened and the guys are going to do what they’re going to do. “As a part of the Australian cricket team, I can’t really say too much. The ICC have sanctioned the boys already and obviously Cricket Australia will have their say. But they haven’t murdered anyone. They’ll deal with it and move on. Hopefully we can win this last Test because at the end of the day, they’re there to play cricket. Besides the spotlight being on other things, they’re there to win a Test series which is the most important thing.” Somerset’s director of cricket Adam Hurry has updated his statement on Cameron Bancroft, who is due to join the county side this season: “I will be talking to Cricket Australia and Cameron in due course as it is important for us to collate all the relevant information before considering our next steps. “We appreciate there is a lot of emotion, disappointment and media surrounding the on field incidents during last Saturday’s Third Test Match in Cape Town and it is imperative we follow our appropriate processes that will enable us to make the right decision for us as a Club in due course. Therefore we will be awaiting the outcome of the Cricket Australia internal investigation before making any further comment”. Reports in Australia suggest that if Darren Lehmann loses his job as Australia coach then the former opener Justin Langer is in pole position to take over. And while Joe Root has said he was not aware of any ball-tampering during the Ashes, on Sunday Stuart Broad was more forthright: “Look at the Ashes series we’ve just played, look through all of those Test matches and they reverse swing the ball sometimes in conditions you wouldn’t expect the ball to reverse,” he said. “So I don’t understand why they’ve changed their method for this one game? “Steve [Smith] has said it’s the first time they’ve tried it so he’s saying they have [changed their methods]. And there was no evidence they were doing this in the Ashes series from what I’ve seen.” Certainly Smith was asked about ball-tampering during the limited overs series that followed the Ashes, but he denied the suggestion that he was applying an illegal substance to the ball after wiping his lip. “It was all spit,” the 28-year-old said. “It’s the way I get spit from the side of my mouth and on the ball. People said something about lip balm. If you look at my lips, they’re pretty dry!” The Australia team is on the way to Johannesburg for the fourth Test but Smith is understood to be staying in Cape Town where Cricket Australia’s inquiry will start. It will be interesting to learn what Somerset make of the Bancroft situation. They signed him as an overseas player for the County Championship during the Ashes. “He has come very highly recommended and will fit seamlessly into our environment,” they said at the time. “Cameron has the appetite and the temperament for scoring big hundreds. He really values the price of his wicket, is mentally tough and highly driven to succeed.” The club struck a slightly different tone on Sunday. “We need to have all the facts and any supporting information before commenting further,” said Somerset’s director of Cricket Andy Hurry. “It will be important to reflect on that information and at that point, I will comment further” “Not only were they exposed as cheats, but they also looked stupid” – Vic Marks, who has seen it all over the years, wrote on ball-tampering on Sunday. In the Canberra Times, Chris Barrett reports that David Warner will not be allowed to play in Australia’s fourth Test against South Africa in Johannesburg on Friday. Steve Smith has already been suspended from the match by the ICC. Away from Australia, England have a bit of soul searching to do too after adding another ‘L’ to their dismal Test record away from home. They face the final match in the two-Test series against New Zealand in Christchurch on Friday. “We need to be much better in Christchurch‚” said Root. “We did not adapt quickly enough in that first innings. We are used to the ball seaming and swinging in England but there were no partnerships. It was important to show character but there must be some soul searching in time for the game in Christchurch.” Read the full story from Vic Marks here: The MCC has strongly condemned the behaviour of both South Africa and Australia cricketers in the Test series, saying their actions have “fallen well below the standard required” and have called for “a major shift in attitude”. “We welcome the swift action by the match officials, ICC and Cricket Australia in response to the admission of ball tampering by senior Australia players,” said John Stephenson, the MCC’s assistant secretary. “The behaviour of some of the players in the current South Africa/Australia series, and other incidents in recent times in the game we all cherish, has fallen well below the standard required to inspire future generations of cricket-loving families. “The time has come for a major shift in attitude and culture of all those with responsibility for leadership within the game, to give young players the kind of role models who will uphold standards, preserve cricket and, vitally, the Spirit of Cricket for future generations.” Steve Smith and David Warner could face one-year bans from Cricket Australia, and their participation in the 2019 World Cup and the Ashes series in England will also be discussed, according to multiple reports in the Australian press. Many of the reports cite insiders who are calling for Smith and Warner to be banned for at least six months and for up to a year. The World Cup start in May in the UK with the Ashes following straight afterwards in July. Some of those same sources cited by the Australian media, also believe Darren Lehmann’s position as head coach is untenable. The Cricket Australia chief executive James Sutherland has flown to South Africa to join Iain Roy and Pat Howard, who are investigating the ball-tampering scandal, and is set to announce any penalties on Wednesday. Bowlers including Mitch Starc, Josh Hazlewood and Nathan Lyon are said to have attempted to distance themselves from involvement in the scandal after Smith said decisions to tamper with the ball were made by a “leadership group” within the dressing room. “So sportsmen cheat. Big deal” – read Simon Jenkins on ball-tampering. For a more historical take, in 2006 the former chairman of selectors Ray Illingworth recalled in the Guardian the day the ex-England captain Mike Atherton was accused of ball-tampering in 1994. Some of the front pages in Australia are starting to come out. Trevor Chappell, famous for that underarm bowling incident in 1981, has a slightly different take on the ball-tampering scandal than some. Cameron Bancroft has family in Derbyshire and has played for Denby Cricket Club in Ripley. His great uncle Brian Bancroft told local newspaper Belper News that he believes the player has had to take the blame for ball-tampering unfairly. “I think Cameron has been a scapegoat,” said Brian Bancroft. “I know it must be hard, as he’s only 25, to say to your own gaffer – no I’m not doing that. “He’s only just more or less got into the side. It’s a pity he wasn’t strong enough to say ‘bugger off, I’m not going to do it’. It’s easy to condemn people. You’re not as big as your gaffer when you’re out there so you do as you are told.” Read the full story on Belper News. Graeme Smith, the former South Africa captain, has criticised the one-match ban Steve Smith has been given, saying the ICC has missed the chance to “lead the game”. The Australia batsman will miss the final game of the four Test series against South Africa after accepting the ICC charge of serious conduct that is contrary to the spirit of the game. He could yet face further sanctions from Cricket Australia. But the ex-South Africa captain said the ICC ban was not long enough. “I think the ICC missed an opportunity to really handle this properly and lead our game,” he said. “They haven’t done that. You have had two players, who have admitted guilt for cheating. I think that’s huge. “I can’t remember ever seeing a foreign object [on the field] to change the ball. The pictures are damning. I mean it shouldn’t be that Cricket Australia are setting the example. The ICC should be setting the example. I don’t know what the right ban is, but it shouldn’t be just one Test match.” Cameron Bancroft, the player who was shown to be attempting to hide a yellow object down his trousers on the field of play, has been fined 75% of his match fee and was given three demerit points - the same punishment initially given to the South Africa bowler Kagiso Rabada for brushing Steve Smith’s shoulder in the second Test in Port Elizabeth. It would have led to a two-match ban for Rabada had it stood. That offence was subsequently downgraded to a Lever 1 offence after an appeal. “I have no idea who is setting these standards,” said Graeme Smith. “Who within the ICC is deciding what mistake is worse than the other? I cannot believe that someone using a foreign object, admitting pre-mediated guilt to cheating, gets less of a ban than a brush of a shoulder. “[The ICC] need to review their match referees and how those decisions are handled and the processes.” There’s no escape for Steve Smith - the Australia captain has been photographed wandering around the team’s hotel in Cape Town. Vic Marks is in New Zealand with the England Test side, who have just been beaten by an innings and 49 runs. After the match, the England captain Joe Root was asked about reports that his side suspected Australia of ball-tampering during the Ashes. “This is disappointing for Test cricket and for cricket in general,” said Root. Read Vic’s story. Steve Smith is no longer the captain of Rajasthan Royals. The IPL franchise had named the Australian captain in February, but in the wake of the ball-tampering crisis, have announced that Ajinkya Rahane will now lead the side. The side says that Smith stepped down from the role. Zubin Bharucha, the Royals’ head of cricket, said, “The incident in Cape Town has certainly disturbed the cricket world. We have been in constant touch with the BCCI and taken their counsel. Furthermore we have been in regular contact with Steve.” According to the franchise, Smith believes “it’s in the best interest of the Rajasthan Royals that he steps down as captain so the team can get ready for the start of the IPL without the ongoing distractions.” Fanie de Villiers, former South Africa fast bowler and now a commentator for South Africa’s SuperSport television channel, says the station asked their cameramen to look for evidence of ball-tampering as he was suspicious of the reverse swing Australia were getting during the Test series. “I said that if they could get reverse swing in the 26th, 27th, 28th over then they’re doing something different from what everyone else does,” he said. “We actually said to our cameramen … go out [and] have a look, boys. They’re using something. [The cameramen] searched for an hour and a half until they saw something and then they started following [Cameron] Bancroft and they actually caught him out at the end. “It’s impossible for the ball to get altered like that on cricket wickets where we knew there was grass on, not a Pakistani wicket where there’s cracks every centimetre. We’re talking about [a] grass-covered wicket where you have to do something else to alter the shape, the roughness of the ball on the one side. You have to get the one side wetter, heavier than the other side.” The former Australian fast-bowler Jeff Thomson has called for Steve Smith, Cameron Bancroft and everyone involved in the ball-tampering scandal to be banned for life. “They should not get a match penalty they should just get flicked. I don’t care who they are, they should be just see ya later,” Thomson told the Australian 9News programme A Current Affair. “It’s a slur on everyone who’s ever played cricket.” Thomson also criticised the culture in the team, saying the Australia players were “spoilt brats”. “If it doesn’t go their way, they spit the dummy, whinge about it, carry on stupidly,” he said. Greg Matthews, the former Australia and New South Wales cricketer who is now a TV commentator, was the player who handed Smith his first cap for the Sheffield Shield side. He says ball-tampering revelations will haunt Smith for the rest of his life. “Clearly the greatest punishment Smith will face is that for the rest of his life, this will haunt him,” he said. “Australian cricket is in the doldrums now. One of lowest efforts ever, lowest moments ever. As far as worse things go, it’s certainly in the grand final.” Catch up on some overnight reading: “Australia has never shied away from questioning the honour of its rivals,” argues Kate O’Halloran. “No longer, however, can its citizens stomach the piousness of a group of hypocrites” Adam Collins is in Cape Town, and filed at the close of the third Test, which South Africa won comfortably. It was, he wrote, “a day from which this generation of players may never completely recover, at the end of a weekend that will be talked about for decades.” The fiercest criticism came in the media, and particularly the Australian media: Nasser Hussain has called into question the future of the Australia coach Darren Lehmann, who Steve Smith has said was unaware of the players’ plan. It doesn’t look good on Lehmann either way, really. If he did know then he’s in a whole heap of trouble and will not be able to hold his job down if he is condoning cheating and scratching of a cricket ball,” Hussain told Sky Sports. “If he didn’t know, then questions will be asked as to why senior players are going round not telling the coach exactly what is going on. “In the dressing rooms I’ve played in, it is inconceivable that the coach wouldn’t know something like this was being dreamt up. “The silence has been deafening actually, not just from Lehmann and [David] Saker, the bowling coach, but also from David Warner. “David Warner seems to have a lot to say on a cricket field; in the last 48 hours the silence from David Warner has been deafening.” Joe Root says he was not aware of any ball-tampering during the Ashes but says the Australia ball-tampering scandal is “disappointing for Test cricket”. Reports in the UK have claimed some unnamed England players were suspicious of Australia during the Ashes. However, asked after England’s innings defeat to New Zealand whether he had noticed any ball-tampering during the series against Australia, Root said: “Not to my knowledge. I was not aware of any ball tampering. I have enough to worry about ... but it’s disappointing for Test cricket and cricket in general”. The England captain did point out that international captains had to be responsible for his players, but that they should know the rules. He stopped short of speaking directly about Steve Smith. “As captain you’re responsible for how everyone else behaves. I have to look after my own group and make sure I’m happy with how they conduct themselves. As an international player you should know the rules. I should not have to back that up. Its as simple as that. “Every time you go out you always know that there are a load of cameras ... you are under the spotlight. It’s important that you give everything and you do everything to win but in the right way.” The commentator Jim Maxwell revealed his disappointment at the revelations on air and he is not the only person to have struggled with the Australia team’s actions. The former Test batsman Marcus North said the “stupidity and ignorance” of those involved has left him “emotional”. You get a bit emotional about it, and that’s not trying to sound over the top,” he told the BBC. “Cheating in sport, certainly in Australian culture, is an absolute no-no. For me, the stupidity and the ignorance of these guys not to think that ‘we’re doing the wrong thing, let’s cut this conversation straight away’ - they obviously haven’t thought about the consequences and the magnitude of what they’re doing. This incident, I think someone has said before, is one of the darkest days in Australian cricket.” Cricket Australia’s integrity chief, Iain Roy, and its high performance head, Pat Howard, have landed in Cape Town this morning to begin their inquiry into the ball-tampering scandal and the chief executive James Sutherland is expecting to land in Johannesburg on Tuesday morning, local time. “We know Australians want answers and we will keep you updated on our findings and next steps, as a matter of urgency,” he said. The scandal comes as Cricket Australia are attempting to renegotiate five-year broadcast rights with the country’s television networks. The long-term cricket broadcaster Nine Entertainment declined to comment about the issue Monday. Media analysts have said that the ball-tampering scandal could prove disastrous for Cricket Australia’s negotiating clout. “It could not have possibly come at a worse time,” said Peter Cox, an Australia media advisor. “The individual incident will eventually blow over but they will lose a segment of the viewing market because of this.” Good morning. Australia cricket’s major sponsors are reconsidering their relationship with the national side in the wake of the ball-tampering controversy that has escalated around the side. The Australia captain Steve Smith admitted to being part of a plan to alter the state of the ball in the third Test against South Africa on Saturday, after the opener Cameron Bancroft was caught by TV cameras using a yellow object while in the field. His actions have led to condemnation from around the cricketing world, with former Australia fast bowler Jason Gillespie writing in the Guardian that Smith must lose the captaincy permanently and that the situation is a “train wreck”. The team has been roasted in the Australian media too. Now, according to Reuters, almost all of Cricket Australia’s commercial partners are reviewing their sponsorship of the team. They report: Weetbix-maker Sanitarium, which counts Smith as a brand ambassador, said it was reviewing its sponsorship pending the outcome of an investigation by governing body Cricket Australia. “Certainly it’s under review as the actions taken by the team in South Africa don’t align with our own values. Sanitarium does not condone cheating in sport,” Sanitarium said in a statement. The airline Qantas, sportswear company Asics, Commonwealth Bank of Australia, the insurer Bupa, Specsavers, Toyota, and the brewer Lion, which owns beer sponsor XXXX, have mirrored those feelings. “Like the rest of Australia, we’re deeply concerned,” a Lion spokesman said. “This is not what you’d expect from anyone in sport at any level.” Cricket Australia has said it will present the findings of its inquiry into the scandal on Wednesday: “We understand that everyone wants answers, but we must follow our due diligence before any further decisions are made,” the Cricket Australia Chairman David Peever said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"business/2018/mar/26/gkn-tells-shareholders-to-choose-us-group-dana-over-melrose","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-26T11:29:10Z","webTitle":"GKN retracts claims of shareholder support against Melrose bid","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/mar/26/gkn-tells-shareholders-to-choose-us-group-dana-over-melrose","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/mar/26/gkn-tells-shareholders-to-choose-us-group-dana-over-melrose","fields":{"headline":"GKN retracts claims of shareholder support against Melrose bid","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The UK engineering company GKN has been forced to retract statements suggesting it has backing from shareholders to fend off a hostile £7.9bn takeover bid from the turnaround specialist Melrose. At the weekend, GKN executives gave bullish interviews in which they expressed confidence that investors would back the industrial group, including pointed references to long-term shareholders supporting its strategy. Short-term investors, including hedge funds, control about 25% of GKN. GKN rowed back on those interviews on Monday. In a statement to the London Stock Exchange, it said: “These statements of shareholder support in respect of GKN were not verified and are hereby retracted.” The Sunday Telegraph had quoted Anne Stevens, the GKN chief executive, as saying she was “convinced investors will back [GKN]”. The Sunday Times quoted Jos Sclater, the finance director, as saying that “long-only shareholders are mostly supportive of existing management, and understand that the Dana deal and becoming a pure play aerospace company has, longer term, significantly more value than the Melrose bid”. As the battle heated up, GKN on Monday sought to persuade shareholders to back an alternative deal with Dana by saying it would receive more cash from the US company and would return £700m to shareholders as soon as possible. GKN shares rose 0.4% to 430.6p in early trading, with the Melrose bid valuing GKN at 460.7p. Investors have to decide by 1pm on Thursday whether to support the offer from Melrose or the GKN management plan to spin off its automotive business and merge it with Dana, leaving GKN focused on aerospace. Shareholders are divided, with those officially backing Melrose accounting for nearly 10% of the shareholder base, compared with 9% for those supporting the GKN board. Elliott Advisors and Aviva Investors support the Melrose takeover, while Columbia Threadneedle and Jupiter Asset Management are backing GKN’s plan. GKN’s statement prompted Melrose to make a further appeal to shareholders. Christopher Miller, the Melrose chairman, urged GKN investors to accept its offer: “The alternative is the reckless dismemberment of a business and needless value destruction for all stakeholders. “Today’s tweak of terms on the sale of Driveline to Dana does not offset the 7% reduction in equity value since the announcement. The last-minute attempts of claiming shareholder support that then had to be retracted [are] a sign of desperation.” Melrose promised to more than double shareholders’ investment by creating additional value of more than £6.5bn, or 220p per GKN share. But Mike Turner, the GKN chairman, reiterated to investors that the company’s true value was more than £5 a share and that Melrose’s final offer “fundamentally undervalues your company and should be rejected”. GKN said on Monday that Dana had increased the amount of cash payable by $140m (£100m). GKN will now receive $1.77bn in cash after deducting $1bn for the transfer of the pension deficit to the Dana-GKN Driveline group. GKN shareholders will continue to own 47.25% of the combined company, which would be listed on the New York and London stock exchanges. GKN plans to return up to £700m of cash to shareholders “as soon as practicable” after the deal with Dana – the first instalment of the up to £2.5bn cash return programme was announced previously. Turner said: “GKN has reinvented itself numerous times in its 250-year history. We are confident that, following the Dana transaction and the non-core disposals, GKN will become a pure play aerospace company with a strong balance sheet, our pension challenges behind us and a clear plan for delivering leading margin performance.” Analysts at Numis said the Dana transaction was the right deal, but at the wrong price and the wrong time. “The combination of Dana and GKN Driveline to create a world leader in auto driveline has significant strategic merits. The issue we have is that the business is being sold too cheaply and too early.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/mar/26/peter-dutton-attacks-defamatory-story-and-says-he-did-not-benefit-from-au-pair-decision","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-26T06:51:35Z","webTitle":"Peter Dutton attacks 'defamatory' story and says he did not benefit from au pair decision","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/mar/26/peter-dutton-attacks-defamatory-story-and-says-he-did-not-benefit-from-au-pair-decision","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/mar/26/peter-dutton-attacks-defamatory-story-and-says-he-did-not-benefit-from-au-pair-decision","fields":{"headline":"Peter Dutton attacks 'defamatory' story and says he did not benefit from au pair decision","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Peter Dutton has said he intervened to allow two young tourists to stay in Australia because he thought it was “inappropriate” to deport them for owning up to their intention to work as babysitters. On Monday the home affairs minister labelled the AAP report that revealed he had intervened to help one au pair “defamatory”, and issued a statement rejecting supposed inferences he personally benefited from the decision. The AAP story – carried widely in various outlets including Guardian Australia – said a young woman had her visa cancelled and was detained at the Brisbane airport on 17 June 2015, before Dutton exercised his discretion to grant her a tourist visa. The story did not state the au pair had ever been employed by him, and contained Dutton’s denial that he had breached ministerial standards as well as his statement that he did not know the au pair personally nor had she worked for him or his family. In question time, Labor asked what prompted Dutton to intervene in the case, whether it was done on the advice of his department and for a briefing on it. Dutton replied that the report was “defamatory” and repeated denials contained in it that his family “does not employ an au pair”. “My wife takes very good care in my absence … of our three children,” he said. “We have never employed an au pair.” Dutton labelled the story “completely false” and warned “I won’t tolerate it being printed again”. “I won’t have false details about my wife and children printed and I won’t stand for it.” In a statement after question time, Dutton accused the AAP journalist, Lisa Martin, of seeking “to suggest that decisions I have made as minister have been to my personal or my family’s benefit (in particular in relation to employment of an au pair)”. “I categorically reject those inferences,” he said in the statement, claiming that the story “contains inferences of impropriety”. “For the wider record, I do not personally know the individuals concerned nor does my wife,” he said. “They have never been associated with us in any way. We have never employed an au pair.” Earlier, in question time, Dutton said he intervened in “hundreds of decisions each year”, including those brought to his attention by Labor members and offered to “release further details” about the cases in question. Dutton revealed there were two cases where “a young tourist has come in on a tourist visa, and has declared in an interview with the border force officers at the airport – as I was advised – that they were here on a tourist visa but they intended to perform baby-sitting duties while they were here”. “The decision that was taken – I was advised – was that the tourist visas would be cancelled, that those two young tourists would be detained and that they would be deported. “I looked into the circumstances of those two cases and I thought that inappropriate. “I thought if they gave an undertaking that they wouldn’t work while they were here I would grant the tourist visa, they would stay, which they did, they didn’t overstay, they returned back home.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/mar/26/australias-real-leadership-failures-are-in-politics-not-cricket","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-26T06:15:19Z","webTitle":"Australia’s real leadership failures are in politics, not cricket | Van Badham","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/26/australias-real-leadership-failures-are-in-politics-not-cricket","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/26/australias-real-leadership-failures-are-in-politics-not-cricket","fields":{"headline":"Australia’s real leadership failures are in politics, not cricket","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Australian cricketer Cameron Bancroft has been caught on video shoving some yellow sticky tape into his underpants. Fortunately – or unfortunately – there was a cricket match in play at the time. The image of him shoving sticky tape into his underpants was broadcast live to the crowd at the Newlands ground in South Africa, and they booed. “I panicked quite a lot,” said Bancroft. Understandably. While only Bancroft’s hands touched his underpants, he did not sticky tape alone. Indeed, a veritable sticky tape conspiracy has unspooled in South Africa, where Australia’s national cricket team are currently on tour. The tape was granulated with dirt, creating a sandpaper-like surface that a non-panicking person sensibly keeps far away from their underpants, but which an unscrupulous “win at all costs” team ethic guided towards the surface of a cricket ball held in Bancroft’s hand. Bancroft – known as “Bangers” – admits: “We had a discussion during the break ... I saw an opportunity ... to change the conditions of the ball.” The aim was to get “an unresponsive ball to swing” or to damage the ball to the point that it would have to be replaced. The team captain, Steve Smith, has confessed he was in on the plan, concocted to provide the Australians an advantage. Outrage has erupted. The Australian newspaper has described it as an act of “shameful ignominy”. Fairfax belted the hyperbole for six: “This is cricket’s #MeToo moment”, Malcolm Knox claimed, comparing Smith also to a drink-driver, a laughing stock, a pustulant infection and the Bjelke-Petersen era of Queensland policing. In the same piece, no less. Local book chain Dymocks has relocated Steve Smith’s autobiography to its “True Crime” section. The flag-waving contingent of Australian cricket fans who travel with the team greeted the first pitch appearance of the Australians after the scandal broke with silence and bare flagpoles. Now the prime minister’s involved. The Daily Telegraph reports that “Mr Turnbull said he had spoken to Cricket Australia chairman David Peever and hoped the sport’s governing body would take ‘decisive action’.” This is the same Malcolm Turnbull who just lost his 29th Newspoll in a row. You’d think that perhaps he’d have “decisive action” of his own to take? But, no. “I’ve expressed to (Cricket Australia) very clearly and unequivocally my disappointment and my concern about the events in South Africa,” Mr Turnbull, who is not a cricket industry professional, said. Meanwhile, in America, teenage children marched against gun violence. They shut down cities to protest the senseless murder of their schoolyard fellows. There are 33,000 Americans who are killed in shooting deaths every year. In Australia, we are having collective apoplexy about the surface texture of a cricket ball. Clearly, we must live in some kind of paradise. Or much of our commentariat do, given that they can so casually compare scuffing sports equipment with the experience of stigmatised, systemic sexual harassment, assault and abuse. Paradise is a relative experience, of course. “I’m sure you’re sometimes gobsmacked at what passes for news in this country,” the host of an Australian political discussion show, Barrie Cassidy, opined only this weekend. He then related the story of a 10-year-old boy who has lived in the significantly less paradisal circumstances of indefinite detention in Australia’s asylum seeker processing centre on Nauru for the last five years. As this publication has reported, the traumatised child has repeatedly attempted suicide. Human rights lawyers and doctors have campaigned to relocate him to Australia for acute psychiatric treatment. The Home Affairs department, the federal government, the minister Peter Dutton, fought the action in court. It took a judge deciding that the boy’s life was in immediate danger to overrule them. Surely a government minister actively denying care to a suicidal little boy is “shameful ignominy”? Shouldn’t a “leadership team” of Australia’s representatives who abandoned a small, terrified child to violent despair be the ones met with a bare flagpole and silence? Making comparisons between Peter Dutton to the worst era of Queensland policing isn’t out of line; it’s statement of fact. Cameron Bancroft shouldn’t have cheated. Smith shouldn’t have told him to. It isn’t leadership to assume that the moral rules somehow don’t apply to you. But let’s be very aware that decades of marketing hype and sponsorship deals and brand-association between cricketers and other national leaders has encouraged the veneration of the national team as a pantheon of heroes, and with that, especial moral licensing. Yet even broader moral licensing is seemingly afforded to all of us by what our real national leadership is doing in our name. Dutton claiming his critics are “dead to me” is not some offhand insult, as much as it’s a strategy to render his actions as a minister remote from us, unrecognisable and inscrutable – his activities occurring offscreen, unrelated to our lived experience. It stretches the spectrum of what we can morally tolerate. We can be horrified by what our cricketers have done because they look like us and sound like us and they were exposed as cheaters. But Australia’s biggest moral leadership failures are a lot more serious than sticky tape on a ball. They’re just performed in a way we don’t recognise, and taking place in darker and more distant corners than a video feed is prepared to let us see.

But is it game over for the Coalition? What do the polls really tell us? And can we rely on them? Here, we we take a look back at polling history to see what we can judge ... Does the 30th Newspoll result mean the Coalition will lose the next election? While the Coalition has been consistently behind in the polls, recent history suggests that Labor’s lead is not big enough to rule out the possibility of a Coalition recovery, with the lead not as large as in past elections. Labor has consistently led in the polls since the last election, mostly with a two-party-preferred figure between 52% and 55%. Labor’s lead has been relatively consistent, which could mean that many swing voters have locked in their vote. This is a strong position but it’s not strong enough to write off the government. Would a change of leader make any difference in the polls? Changing leaders has become a standard reaction of a party facing the prospect of an election defeat but these shifts can be illusory. In every case, support for the new leader gradually declined, sometimes back to an election-losing position. If there is a change of Liberal leader, we could expect a shift in the polling but this may be only temporary. It would take time before the impact of the change on the polls became clear. The Abbott-led Coalition government trailed Labor for most of 2014 and 2015 but the Coalition jumped back into the lead when Malcolm Turnbull succeeded Abbott in late 2015. Yet this lead did not prove stable. Labor gradually regained ground as the 2016 federal election inched closer, and the two parties were close to a tie by election day. Big shifts also occurred in the years before the 2004, 2007, 2010 and 2016 elections, generally after a change of leader by one of the major parties. Opposition parties gained ground after installing Mark Latham (2003), Kevin Rudd (2006) and Abbott (2009), while governments have recovered from poor polling under new leaders Julia Gillard (2010), Rudd (2013) and Turnbull (2015). Has any other government suffered such a sustained slump in the polls, but gone on to win? There’s no perfect comparison, but we have definitely seen governments come back and win after falling behind. The Howard government trailed the opposition in most of the year leading up to the 1998 and 2004 elections, but recovered and won in both years. Neither of these poll slumps lasted as long as the current government’s slump. Of course, the current government did recover following the change to Turnbull’s leadership, and we don’t know if the same trick could work a second time. How reliable are the polls? Australian polls have done a reasonably good job of predicting national results (although individual seat polling is much less reliable). Polling averages before the 2016 election accurately predicted a narrow win for the Coalition, and polls were similarly close in predicting the national result at every election since 2007. The last election where polling failed to predict the result was in 2004, when last-minute polling suggested a tight race, but the actual result was a comfortable win for the Coalition. Of course, current polling is not a prediction of the election outcome, and there is always room for error, but current national polls do a pretty good job of predicting the final national result as election day nears. What about ‘preferred prime minister’ – does that matter? Despite leading on the other standard question asked in national polling – “preferred prime minister” – the government can’t take much comfort from it. Turnbull continues to outperform Bill Shorten when voters are asked to name their preferred prime minister but this question does not do a good job of predicting election results. There is a substantial bias towards the incumbent, and opposition leaders in an election-winning position often remain behind on this question until they win power. Satisfaction questions also do not do a particularly good job of predicting an election, though they can be helpful in explaining a party’s polling position. Turnbull had a strong positive satisfaction rating when he became prime minister yet this crashed into negative territory in early 2016, and he has remained neck-and-neck with Shorten pretty much since the last election. Party leaders are often replaced at a point where they have poor satisfaction ratings. The current polling paints a clear picture: Labor has a longstanding solid lead, but it is not large enough for the government to give up hope. Personal satisfaction ratings for Turnbull are poor, which could encourage some within his party to consider an alternative leader. It’s worth comparing the latest polling with support for Tony Abbott and the Coalition in opposition before the 2013 election. Labor scraped back in to government as a minority at the 2010 election and, within months, the Coalition had taken the lead. The Coalition’s lead went up and down throughout 2011 and 2012 but the Abbott-led opposition tended to hold a bigger lead, with some polls putting the Coalition on more than 60% of the two-party-preferred vote. Its support dropped as the election neared, and the result was closer than the polls had predicted for most of the previous term. If there is a change of Liberal leader, we could expect a shift in the polling but this may be only temporary. It would take time before the impact of the change on the polls became clear."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/mar/27/i-know-our-criminal-justice-system-inside-out-and-it-is-being-misused","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-27T02:58:56Z","webTitle":"I know our criminal justice system inside out, and it is being misused | Shahleena Musk","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/27/i-know-our-criminal-justice-system-inside-out-and-it-is-being-misused","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/27/i-know-our-criminal-justice-system-inside-out-and-it-is-being-misused","fields":{"headline":"I know our criminal justice system inside out, and it is being misused","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"I have seen many families ripped apart, communities drained of men, women and children and lives turned upside down by criminal justice systems geared towards locking people up. These men, women and children are often the most vulnerable in our community and they are disproportionately Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. I have worked as both a crown prosecutor and criminal defence lawyer in some of the most remote areas of the Northern Territory and Western Australia. I have seen our criminal justice system inside out and from both sides of the bar table, and I know it is being grossly overused and misused. Don’t get me wrong – where the seriousness of the offending and risk to the public are significant, secure facilities are needed. But we desperately need to rethink a system that is funnelling people into harmful prisons as the default response. Prisons are over-crowded, understaffed, and lack culturally appropriate and responsive supports and services tailored to the needs of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. Soaring prison numbers are fuelled by unjust laws and policies – punitive bail laws, mandatory sentencing, and imprisonment for low level and poverty offences. The preventable and tragic death of Ms Dhu, who died in police custody after being arrested for unpaid fines, is a clear example of punitive laws and policing practices that are dangerous and compound inequality. Our criminal justice system must do better – particularly when it comes to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people comprise just 2% of the national population. Yet 28% of the population behind bars are Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander, and this national shame is only set to worsen. We all want our communities to be harmonious and healthy. For Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, an understanding and recognition of our cultural identity and place are essential to this. Rather than merely focussing on punishment, our criminal justice systems need to be geared to assisting people. Our governments need to make our justice systems more inclusive, adaptive and offer alternative responses that can ensure just and fair outcomes. A number of culturally safe and appropriate responses already exist. These are the Aboriginal-led solutions that our governments need to back. In my time as a youth lawyer, I was in awe of the amazing and tireless work of staff at BushMob, a substance misuse program for children and young people operating out of Alice Springs. They help foster internal worth and value and life-skills in the children they support. This organisation and their multi-disciplinary staff have been instrumental in assisting many children grappling with drug or alcohol issues to reclaim their lives and forge a path to a better future. In many Aboriginal communities, there are a number of community leaders and respected elders who play a role in resolving community disputes and breaches of the law. In my time as a criminal lawyer at the North Australian Aboriginal Justice Agency, I was heartened to see the reinvigoration of law and justice groups including the Kurdiji and Burnawarra in Lajamanu and Maningrida, and see them grow in capacity and influence to work alongside police and the courts. Their involvement has ensured the criminal justice system is more accessible, relevant and responsive for their people and within their communities. In turn the police and courts have been able to operate with a cultural focus that respects the law and authority of the Elders while also sharing responsibility for the individual with their community. In particular I have seen the elders building on the strength of their law and culture to reconnect offenders with family and community, to heal relationships and achieve fair outcomes. The most powerful example I saw was a community wide mediation to prevent an escalation of fighting between young men. In that instance, elders were able to calm emotions and bring all the families together to resolve these issues in a peaceful and respectful manner. I have also seen the value of their involvement in formal court process to provide personal and cultural information. In doing so, the elders are able to contextualise offending and better inform sentencing, which ensures appropriate punishment and healing for all involved. There are examples of true justice being delivered in a way that includes and empowers Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. But these examples shouldn’t just exist on the margins. It’s time for governments to embrace these approaches across the board. Criminal justice systems geared towards locking up people upend the very foundations of justice – fairness and equality. They also fail to address the root causes of crime and do not help people learn from their mistakes. That’s why we need alternatives to prison that build on the strengths of individuals, families, elders and communities. If the solutions are led by, and are responsive to the very people they impact, they will be effective and we will have a far fairer Australia. • Guardian Australia is proud to partner with IndigenousX to showcase the diversity of Indigenous peoples and opinions from around the country. • Comments on this article have been pre-moderated to ensure the discussion is on the topics that have been written about in the article."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/mar/28/hungary-liberal-democracy-tactical-alliance-far-right","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-28T09:00:17Z","webTitle":"To save Hungary's liberal democracy, centrists must work with the far right | Cas Mudde","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/28/hungary-liberal-democracy-tactical-alliance-far-right","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/28/hungary-liberal-democracy-tactical-alliance-far-right","fields":{"headline":"To save Hungary's liberal democracy, centrists must work with the far right","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Last Summer I gave a keynote lecture at a workshop on “Fighting Back: Liberal Democratic Responses to the Populist Challenge” at the Central European University (CEU) in Budapest, which has been the target of attacks by Victor Orbán and his Fidesz party since I worked there in the late 1990s. I laid out my usual argument, which is that the populist radical right represents the loud minority rather than the silent majority, and that we should focus on strengthening liberal democracy rather than weakening the populist radical right. Then I was asked what to do about Hungary, where the radical right is in power and liberal democracy has, by and large, been replaced by what Orbán officially refers to as an “illiberal state”. How can you strengthen liberal democracy in an illiberal state? Shouldn’t you first defeat the illiberal state before you can rebuild liberal democracy? I argued that in such a case, liberal democrats should do everything to break the illiberal democrats’ hold on power, which includes working with other illiberal democrats. In the case of Hungary, I suggested that the liberal democratic opposition, splintered into various personalized and small political parties, should form a tactical alliance with the illiberal democratic opposition, united in the populist radical right Movement for a Better Hungary or Jobbik. The air went out of the room as I saw many people in the audience violently shake their head. Working with Jobbik? Aren’t they worse then Orbán’s Fidesz? In theory yes, but in practice, no. Although Jobbik is currently campaigning on a less populist radical right platform then Fidesz, a Jobbik government will almost certainly be even worse for liberal democracy than the current Fidesz government. But the point is, they are not in power, and have little chance at coming to power by themselves. Fidesz, however, is in power. Fidesz has been consistently dismantling liberal democracy in Hungary since returning to power in 2010. He and his party have changed the constitution, appointed cronies to every new position, and have created an illiberal “Frankenstate”, as one of Orbán’s most astute critics, Kim-Lane Scheppele, has termed it. On top of that, Orbán has built a kleptocracy that has enriched a small group of his cronies, not in the least through EU subsidies and German investments, at the expense of the wider population. Knowing it must hold on to power to keep the corrupt system going, and keep Orbán’s oligarchs from facing prison sentences, the Fidesz government keeps manipulating the electoral process by bribing opposition politicians, creating bogus parties to further divide the opposition, and limiting the space for opposition campaigns. That is why the next parliamentary elections will probably be the last somewhat free and fair elections, in which the opposition has at least a theoretical chance to defeat Fidesz. That, and nothing else, is at stake on Sunday 8 April. And, for that higher cause, a tactical and temporary alliance with Jobbik is acceptable and necessary. Jobbik is the strongest opposition party in Hungary, mainly because liberals have been more concerned with ideological details and personal power than with saving liberal democracy. Without Jobbik, there is no chance at an electoral victory for the opposition. Some members in the Central European University audience openly opposed an alliance with Jobbik, because it would “legitimize” or “normalize” the radical right. Fidesz supporters like British Hungarian sociologist Frank Furedi have also jumped on it, claiming that this just shows that European liberals, like myself, are not really concerned about the far right in Hungary as long as it is “our far right”. Both miss the point. Liberal opposition parties shouldn’t collaborate with Jobbik because they accept, let alone legitimize, their populist radical right ideas. They should work together despite their populist radical right ideology! The only goal of the tactical alliance is to prevent Fidesz from putting the final nail in the coffin of Hungary’s liberal democracy. In this case, no government is better than a government. So, how would this tactical alliance look? Given that Fidesz has created an electoral system that caters exclusively to its strengths, there are few options left. The majority of the 199 seats in the single-chamber parliament are elected through a one-round plurality system, just like in the UK and US. It used to be a two-round majority system, like in France, but this could create runoffs between coalitions of parties, including an anti-Fidesz coalition, which is why the government abolished it. In the current system, coalitions should be built before the elections. For this purpose, a group of former politicians has recently created a website that lists all the candidates in the 106 FPTP districts and indicates which candidate of the “anti-Orbán camp” has the best chance to win the district. Opposition parties should sit together and create a mutually acceptable list of best-placed candidates and withdraw all other candidates. In that case, each district would only have one Fidesz candidate and one opposition candidate (contesting the elections under the banner of their own party) – leaving aside the various bogus parties Fidesz created to confuse the voter. This is the only way to break Orbán stranglehold on Hungary’s dying liberal democracy. Fidesz is polling around 50% among decided voters and, given the doctored electoral system, could regain a constitutional majority. Liberals have a choice between remaining pure and facing the certainty of an illiberal state or “dirtying their hands” and at least fight for a liberal democratic future.

It has also called on Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria to preserve a land corridor for a high-speed rail line to run from Brisbane to Coffs Harbour, Newcastle, Sydney, Canberra, Albury-Wodonga and Melbourne, saying high-speed rail should be a “high-priority initiative” for Australia. The independent body published its latest list of major infrastructure projects on Tuesday, which it said Australia needed to meet its rapidly growing population. It said that, in 30 years’ time, Australia’s population was projected to increase by 11.8 million people, the equivalent of adding two more cities the size of Melbourne or Sydney by 2048. “This is a challenge we can’t afford to manage passively – we must plan for growth,” the Infrastructure Australia chair, Julieanne Alroe, said. It has identified four high-priority projects in NSW, including the upgrade to the M4 motorway between Parramatta and Lapstone, the WestConnex motorway project, the construction of western Sydney airport and the Sydney metro rail connection from Chatswood to Bankstown. In Queensland, a high-priority project is the Brisbane metro line and in Victoria it is the M80 ring road upgrade. But it said Sydney’s infrastructure would have to be significantly upgraded to cater for an expected swelling of the population. To service the new western Sydney airport, it said a land corridor ought to be preserved so a dedicated fuel pipeline could be built between the airport and Port Botany, so B-double fuel tankers did not have to truck aviation fuel along busy arterial roads. “Western Sydney airport is projected to commence operation by 2025,” the priority list said. “The airline could potentially require 50-65 B-double fuel tankers deliveries per day, which would add to congestion on Sydney’s urban road network ... while a dedicated fuel pipeline is unlikely to be required [immediately], the identification and preservation of a corridor will ensure a route for the pipeline is available when required.” It said inland rail was a priority project and that governments ought to construct a freight line of roughly 1,700km between Melbourne and Brisbane, via inland Victoria, NSW and Queensland, to meet the future demand for freight transport. It predicted demand for freight between Melbourne and Brisbane would grow from roughly 4.9m tonnes in 2016 to about 13m tonnes, or 1.1m containers, by 2050. It said trains operating on the inland rail line would eventually be able to carry up to 485 containers each, when longer, double-stacked trains were introduced. It predicted the project would take between 10 and 15 years to build. It said an east coast high speed rail line is a high priority initiative, because by 2075, the combined population of Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane is projected to exceed 30 million people. “The future demand for efficient, high-capacity transport services between major centres on the east coast will likely exceed the capacity of existing and planned rail, road and aviation services,” the priority list stated. “Protecting a corridor would significantly increase options for future development of high speed rail infrastructure to meet future demand for inter-city and regional travel.” Modelling by Infrastructure Australia in 2017 estimated the net cost of protecting and acquiring the corridor would be $30.1bn. It said the corridor should be based on the one set out in the federal government’s High Speed Rail Study Phase 2. Some of the projects Infrastructure Australia has identified as priority initiatives are politically contentious. It said the former South Australian Labor government’s proposed reconstruction of Adelaide’s suburban tram network – dubbed AdeLINK – should be a priority, for example, but the new Liberal Marshall government has criticised the project and plans to proceed with its own upgrade."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/mar/26/tam-gam-and-trades-why-mls-is-the-worlds-most-overcomplicated-league","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-26T09:00:20Z","webTitle":"TAM, GAM and trades: why MLS is the world's most overcomplicated league","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/mar/26/tam-gam-and-trades-why-mls-is-the-worlds-most-overcomplicated-league","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/mar/26/tam-gam-and-trades-why-mls-is-the-worlds-most-overcomplicated-league","fields":{"headline":"TAM, GAM and trades: why MLS is the world's most overcomplicated league","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"For the past four years, ESPN has conducted an anonymous survey of MLS players. There are always angles and headlines: this time around Giovani dos Santos was voted the most overrated player in the league by his peers. But in amongst the whimsy and trivia a more troublesome statement was served on how MLS is seen even by those on the league’s payroll. Players were asked whether they truly understand how General Allocation Money (GAM) and Targeted Allocation Money (TAM) works. Only 50% answered that they do. That is likely reflective of the wider (lack of) understanding of the trade rules, too. In fact, so convoluted are the regulations they have become a source of comedy over the years, although some fans fail to see the funny side when their team is overlooked in the allocation order, sending a big name signing to a more illustrious, glamorous franchise. Look at how Clint Dempsey ended up at Seattle despite Portland apparently holding the rights to have the first shot at signing the US international. Fairly or not, the impression is that MLS sometimes makes up the rules as they go along. It could be argued that MLS doesn’t do a good enough job of providing transparency on its own rules, that they have failed to sufficiently explain the process that results in the trading and signing of players. But one has sympathy for the corner they have forced themselves into. Even if they wanted to explain everything, how could they? This isn’t the only thing that makes MLS a more convoluted pursuit than it needs to be. If you’ve ever played as an MLS team in Football Manager, you’ll have experienced how the league tends to tie itself up in knots over certain things. Not just GAM, TAM and trade rules, but international breaks that aren’t really international breaks, the timing of Concacaf Champions League games and, of course, the splitting of the season into the regular season and the playoffs, too. So what can MLS do to untangle the web? Well, for starters, it could fully observe Fifa-recognised breaks. Last week, world soccer took a break for a round of international friendly fixtures, while MLS took a half-break of sorts, with six games played over the weekend. Some teams were without some of their best players. There were six players missing through international duty for Saturday evening’s game between the New York Red Bulls and Minnesota United. The LA Galaxy struggled for firepower against Vancouver 24 hours after Ola Kamara had netted a hat-trick for Norway. Playing league fixtures during Fifa-mandated international breaks compromises MLS’s integrity. It warps results and, ultimately, positions in the table. Furthermore, it puts players in a difficult position, sometimes forcing them to choose between club and country. This could, theoretically, place doubt in the mind of any prospective signing of international class weighing up a move to MLS. Particularly with more teams now targeting young talent from South America, MLS clubs are put in a position where they have to allay fears that a move to the US or Canada will hinder their international ambitions. Of course, it’s unlikely that MLS will ever adopt a winter calendar, and rightly so. Anyone who argues that MLS teams should play through Christmas and New Year rather than through the summer, like they do in Europe, has never been to Chicago or Toronto in January – and if they have, they never ventured outside. But a shuffling of the schedule to accommodate international breaks, real international breaks, would help. Then there’s the Concacaf Champions League, which demands that MLS teams hit top form before they have even started their domestic season. This, of course, is something MLS has no control over, leaving American and Canadian sides at an unavoidable disadvantage against Mexican and Central American teams midway through their season. But it’s another example of how MLS hasn’t quite got all its houses in order yet. Something is out of sync. MLS teams might never truly prioritise the Champions League until the scheduling gives them a better chance. Lobbying of other leagues and associations might be required to solve this issue in the long term. But the fact remains that MLS’s biggest problem in its complexity are the trade rules that see players bounce around the league without much understanding of how they are allowed to do so. While the salaries of every MLS player are published annually, there is a distinct lack of transparency over how those players sign their contracts. It’s a paradox. This isn’t to say that there is some grand conspiracy at work behind the scenes, but it certainly creates confusion where there need not be any. MLS’s distinctly American trade and transfer system could afford to get a little more European. A free market, albeit not entirely free, might be a good thing for the league at this point. The situation has improved somewhat in recent years. The farce surrounding Frank Lampard’s move to New York City FC and his loan (if it was even a loan) to parent club Manchester City proved to be a watershed in fans’ intolerance over the lack of transfer transparency, with the league now making more of an effort to explain and elaborate on the process. And yet the fact they have to explain at all is a problem. For over two decades, MLS has tried to strike a delicate balance between global soccer etiquette and North American sporting culture. That’s why games were once decided by shoot-out. It’s why there are play-offs. And trades. Some MLS teams are ‘football clubs,’ with others ‘soccer clubs.’ The league has always walked the line between one and the other, but with that comes extreme complexity. If the players themselves find certain aspects of MLS confusing, what chance do we have?"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/mar/26/labor-poised-to-exempt-pensioners-from-tax-policy-axing-investor-refunds","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-26T02:15:24Z","webTitle":"Labor poised to exempt pensioners from tax policy axing investor refunds","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/mar/26/labor-poised-to-exempt-pensioners-from-tax-policy-axing-investor-refunds","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/mar/26/labor-poised-to-exempt-pensioners-from-tax-policy-axing-investor-refunds","fields":{"headline":"Labor poised to exempt pensioners from tax policy axing investor refunds","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Labor appears poised to exempt both full and part pensioners from its plan to end cash rebates for excess imputation credits, with the shift expected to be considered by the shadow cabinet on Monday. Party sources have confirmed the full exemption is in play as the opposition seeks to shield its core supporters from the impact of a policy shift that will return more than $11bn to the budget over two years, and $59bn over the forward estimates, if the ALP wins the next federal election. With federal parliament resuming on Monday, Malcolm Turnbull jumped on reports of a shift, branding it “policy on the run”. Labor has indicated that 200,000 part pensioners and 14,000 full pensioners will be impacted by the change. The government has released figures indicating 237,952 pensioners will be hit. The ALP’s proposal would abolish franking credit cash rebates for retiree investors – a system introduced by the Howard government in 2000, which now costs the budget $6bn a year. The policy has been blasted by seniors groups and by the self-managed superannuation funds industry, but it has been defended by a number of economists on the basis that current arrangements are fiscally unsustainable. Independent economists including Saul Eslake and researchers from the Grattan Institute have branded the attacks on the policy by interest groups and the Turnbull government as deeply misleading. Brendan Coates and Danielle Wood from the Grattan Institute argued in an analysis published by Inside Story that some low-income retirees could be negatively affected by Labor’s proposal but they say the bulk of the impact will be felt by wealthier seniors. “The government claims that 54% of people affected by Labor’s policy – some 610,000 individuals – have taxable incomes of less than $18,200,” Coates and Wood say. “And it says that 86% of the value of all franking credits refunded are received by those with taxable incomes of less than $87,000 a year. “These claims are deeply misleading. Taxable income ignores the largest source of income for many wealthier retirees: tax-free superannuation.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/mar/26/former-liberal-minister-bruce-billson-faces-censure-for-failing-to-declare-lobbying-job","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-26T10:09:22Z","webTitle":"Former Liberal minister Bruce Billson faces censure for failure to declare lobbying job","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/mar/26/former-liberal-minister-bruce-billson-faces-censure-for-failing-to-declare-lobbying-job","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/mar/26/former-liberal-minister-bruce-billson-faces-censure-for-failing-to-declare-lobbying-job","fields":{"headline":"Former Liberal minister Bruce Billson faces censure for failure to declare lobbying job","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The former Liberal minister Bruce Billson should be censured for failing to declare he was employed and paid by a business lobby group before he quit parliament, the privileges committee has found. In a report tabled on Monday, the Coalition-controlled committee criticised the former small business minister for ignoring “the primacy of the public interest” in taking and failing to disclose paid lobbying work because he “misunderstood” his obligations. Billson – who was dumped from cabinet in September 2015 – took a job at the Franchise Council of Australia (FCA) in March 2016 but did not leave parliament until 9 May. The committee found Billson failed to disclose to parliament’s register of interests that he had started drawing a $75,000-a-year salary as executive chairman and independent director of the FCA. Billson also revealed to the committee that he had provided services to the FCA through his company Agile Advisory. In October the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet cleared Billson of breaching ministerial guidelines and the lobbying code of conduct but the privileges committee found the jobs were registrable interests that he failed to declare. The report noted there was a “prima facie case that [Billson] is guilty of contempt” because he did not declare the interests within 28 days, including a $6,250 payment in April 2016. But the committee found he was not in contempt because his conduct did not show “any intention to interfere with the free exercise” of functions of the house and there was “no clear evidence” he had been improperly influenced. Billson submitted the failure was an “administrative error and oversight” and wrote to the Speaker apologising for the “discourtesy to the house this represents”. The committee found that Billson “misunderstood his obligations” but despite efforts of the committee to explain “the primacy of the public interest ... Billson is choosing to ignore the committee’s explanation of those obligations to him”. The deputy chairman of the privileges committee, the Labor MP Pat Conroy, told the lower house that Billson’s correspondence revealed he “still does not understand that beyond an actual conflict of interest ... there was most definitely a perception of a conflict of interest”. The report said it was of “considerable concern” that Billson “should so manifestly misunderstand the potential for concerns about appropriate conduct when accepting paid outside employment”. “The committee’s view is that it would have been more appropriate for Mr Billson not to accept paid employment with the FCA while he was a member of the house,” it said. “His decision to accept the role with FCA while he was a member falls below the standards expected of a member of the house.” The committee recommended that standing orders should include an express prohibition on a member “engaging in lobbying services for reward while still a member of the house”. Conroy told the lower house that “acceptance of payments for services to represent the FCA represented a conflict of interest with [Billson’s] duty as a member of parliament”. “It was very clear that he, Mr Billson, generated a perceived conflict of interest,” Conroy said. “It’s clear Mr Billson damaged the reputation of himself, sadly, and the parliament by not understanding at a minimum there was a perception of a conflict of interest.” An FCA spokeswoman welcomed the committee’s conclusion that no finding of contempt can be made. “The FCA and Mr Billson demonstrated that during the weeks when Mr Billson’s widely publicised appointment as a director and executive chair overlapped with the end of his term as a MP, there was no improper influence, advocacy, lobbying or impact on the free performance by Mr Billson of his parliamentary duties,” she said. Guardian Australia has contacted the leader of the house, Christopher Pyne, to determine if and when the government will act on the recommendation to censure Billson."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"games/2018/mar/26/far-cry-5-review-playstation-4-xbox-one-pc-ubisoft","type":"article","sectionId":"games","sectionName":"Games","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-26T10:00:21Z","webTitle":"Far Cry 5 review – cults, chaos and all-American silliness","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2018/mar/26/far-cry-5-review-playstation-4-xbox-one-pc-ubisoft","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/games/2018/mar/26/far-cry-5-review-playstation-4-xbox-one-pc-ubisoft","fields":{"headline":"Far Cry 5 review – cults, chaos and all-American silliness","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"In rural Hope County, Montana, an extreme Christian cult has been slowly eroding the power of the state. Its charismatic leader, his body inked with religious iconography and his hair pulled back in a man-bun, has amassed an armed following that feels he can do no wrong. Sent in as part of a team of US marshals to arrest Father Seed, you can feel the tension as you walk through crowds of his jeering followers and into his church; it’s as though everything is about to tip over the edge, and soon enough, it does. Before you can even get into the air with the handcuffed Seed, his followers have shot your helicopter down in flames and dragged your screaming teammates away. After a doomed car chase through the night as you try to escape the county, you’re rescued by a crotchety old survivalist, handed a gun, and told that you are now part of the resistance. The opening is a high point for Far Cry 5. It introduces a great villain, the rather timely premise of saving forgotten America from the brink of disaster, and the kind of seat-of-your-pants action that video games are made for. Afterwards, the sense of purpose quickly dissipates in a meandering journey to liberate the county’s three regions from gun-toting cultists, and the game soon reveals that it is very tonally confused. The story missions, centring around Seed and his siblings, are disquieting and extremely violent, with pretty graphic scenes of torture, indoctrination and religious frenzy; after a while, it gets wearing. Meanwhile, when you’re roaming free in Hope County, you’re clinking beers with hillbillies, tearing down a mountain on a quad bike accompanied by blaring hair-metal and fireworks, hunting down crazed moose or collecting ingredients for a food festival called the Testy Festy (no prizes for guessing the featured dish). It’s emotionally confusing to be buffeted constantly between tense sadism and tongue-in-cheek tomfoolery. Far Cry 5 doesn’t succeed in reconciling these two sides of its personality, but then it doesn’t really try. This is a game in which you will be listening to lurid descriptions of cannibalism and torture on one mission, then tearing down a highway in a monster truck with mounted machine guns the next. To enjoy it, you have to inoculate yourself against these sudden changes in mood. Far Cry 5 is most enjoyable when it embraces the chaos that ensues when a player is left on an island full of hostile cultists with enough guns to embarrass John McClane. Blowing up cultist shrines, liberating farms and factories from their grasp and generally making yourself a flamethrower-toting nuisance is great fun. The characters you can recruit are entertaining caricatures of small-town USA. Planes, boats and road vehicles are all easy and enjoyable to drive and blow up. It’s jarring to be wrenched away from the open world and into a confrontation with one of the Seed siblings, which sometimes happens with no warning – like being briefly kidnapped into a different game entirely. Although beautiful – even breathtaking, especially at sunrise and from the air – rural Montana isn’t as fun to fool around in as Far Cry 3’s tropical island, or 4’s Himalayan mountains. You won’t be busting out a wingsuit and jumping off a mountain very often. This is a more militaristic interpretation of the series’ survival theme: instead of hunting bears and trying to tame the wilds, you’re constantly fighting off fanatics trying to kill or capture you. It’s also harder to sneak around with a bow, throwing knives than to run in all guns blazing, because the cult lieutenants send more and more lackeys after you until you can barely drive half a mile without being pursued by two carfuls of cultists and a fighter plane. Co-operative multiplayer adds another unpredictable element – with two players running around, things are even more likely to go awry and devolve into continually escalating shootouts. Sometimes this chaos is enjoyable; sometimes it’s confusing and frustrating. Occasionally the game forgets where you were and what you were doing before you died and plonks you somewhere random on the map. Other glitches and confusing moments happen when the game’s systems collide; upon approaching a man weeping over the body of what looked like his dead friend, he immediately straightened up, delivered a line of dialogue about some nearby side-mission, and walked off. Radio chatter from other characters sometimes has nothing whatsoever to do with what you’re doing. Story-based missions can completely lose the plot when something unexpected happens, leaving you standing in a field miles away while the action happens elsewhere. Far Cry 5 taps into the prevailing geopolitical sense of being right on the brink of disaster, but it stays well away from the real-world issues that clearly inspired its themes. There are numerous oblique references to Trump – one side-mission has you retrieving a certain infamous, compromising tape for a federal agent who keeps talking about golden showers – but it’s played for laughs rather than political commentary. The Eden’s Gate cultists might be extremists, but they’re emphatically not white supremacists. It comes close to trying to say something, but never actually does – and it’s far more comfortable when it’s being silly than serious, making you wish that it had committed wholeheartedly to playful satire rather than spreading its bets. There are great individual moments in Far Cry 5. The gunplay is excellent, its unpredictable world generates daring stories of accidental heroism, and when it leans into the whole red-blooded American patriotism schtick, it’s genuinely funny. It doesn’t always fit together as well as it should, sometimes forcing the player to work around the game rather than with it – but the wildly vacillating tone is the bigger issue. It’s at once disorienting and noncommittal. Paradoxically, this is an extreme satire of modern America that says pretty much nothing about it. Far Cry 5 is out Tuesday 27 March; £49.99."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"us-news/2018/mar/27/michael-cohen-who-is-trumps-pugnacious-and-loyal-lawyer-","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-10T14:37:08Z","webTitle":"Michael Cohen: who is Trump's legal 'pit bull' who was raided by the FBI?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/mar/27/michael-cohen-who-is-trumps-pugnacious-and-loyal-lawyer-","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/mar/27/michael-cohen-who-is-trumps-pugnacious-and-loyal-lawyer-","fields":{"headline":"Michael Cohen: who is Trump's legal 'pit bull' who was raided by the FBI?","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"He’s a pugnacious lawyer with a Long Island accent who says he grew up idolizing Donald Trump and soaking in the wisdom of the real estate tycoon’s bestseller, The Art of the Deal. But Michael Cohen’s devotion to Trump, his boss and mentor since 2006, may have drawn Cohen into legal jeopardy even as it has carried him near the pinnacles of American power. FBI agents raided Cohen’s office and home on Monday after a referral by special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating alleged collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. Agents reportedly seized material including correspondence with Trump and documents relating to a payment by Cohen to the porn star Stormy Daniels, who claims to have had a sexual relationship with Trump. Mueller’s team had previously obtained emails Cohen wrote during the campaign and presidential transition, and documentation of Cohen’s efforts to get a Trump real estate development off the ground in Moscow. Attempts by Cohen to silence Daniels, including with the threat of a $20m lawsuit, have so far only sharpened the public focus on her alleged affair with Trump and cast a new spotlight on Cohen’s more bareknuckle tactics. A lawyer for Daniels last month accused Cohen, 51, of “a history of thuggish behavior” and “using intimidation tactics in trying to step on little people” on behalf of Trump. “As it relates to my client, it’s going to come to an end,” Michael Avenatti told CBS News. “We’re going to show the American people exactly who Michael Cohen is.” Cohen is the son of a surgeon who escaped a Nazi concentration camp with his family . He attended American University in Washington DC and worked at a personal injury-malpractice law firm before becoming a partner at the Manhattan law firm Phillips Nizer. He met Trump after becoming treasurer of the board for Trump World Tower, where he and his family owned apartments. Every account of Cohen’s place in the Trump orbit includes the word “loyalty”. For a decade, Cohen has been known as Trump’s “pit bull”, for comments such as this one in a 2011 interview: “If somebody does something Mr Trump doesn’t like, I do everything in my power to resolve it to Mr Trump’s benefit. If you do something wrong, I’m going to come at you, grab you by the neck, and I’m not going to let you go until I’m finished.” That kind of tough talk might make for a passing PR headache for him, but more problematic for Cohen may be his decision to “facilitate” (his word) a $130,000 payment to Daniels a month before the 2016 presidential election. The watchdog group Common Cause has added to the flurry of lawsuits swirling around Trump and Stormy Daniels, which, although it is the stage name of Stephanie Clifford, is the moniker she says she prefers. Common Cause claims that the payment was in fact a campaign contribution and violated campaign finance laws, a view that Trevor Potter, a former chairman of the federal elections commission, supported in a CBS News interview last month. “The payment of the money just creates an enormous legal mess for, I think, Trump, for Cohen and anyone else who was involved in the campaign,” Potter said. Cohen has denied all wrongdoing and has said the payment was not related to the Trump campaign. The depth of Cohen’s potential legal jeopardy is not yet clear. Monday’s raids may have been carried out to obtain evidence in Mueller’s Russia investigation or in a parallel investigation of potential campaign finance violations or other alleged criminal activity. The former presidential candidate John Edwards was charged with campaign finance violations for secret payments made in 2007 in an attempt to conceal a pregnant mistress, but he was found not guilty on one charge and no verdict was reached on five others. The Cohen case could entail a more straightforward violation of campaign finance laws, legal analyst Rick Hasen and others have written, because Trump cannot plausibly claim the payments were made in defense of Trump’s personal reputation. “Given pre-candidate Trump’s reputation, it is not clear that the payment in this instance could be considered personal so as to not sully his already-sullied reputation,” Hasen wrote on his Election Law Blog. “Remember this comes after the ‘grab them by the pussy’ comments.” Cohen has insisted he “facilitated” the payment to Daniels as a favor to a friend and client and that the payment did not relate to the looming presidential election. Daniels, who sued Trump earlier this month in an attempt to exit a non-disclosure agreement, brought an additional lawsuit against Cohen for defamation, claiming he had painted her as a liar. Lawyers for Daniels and Cohen – have been locked in a battle over Daniels’ story of an alleged sexual affair with Trump, which she recounted in an interview with CBS’s 60 Minutes. In her interview, Daniels told a story about being approached in a Las Vegas parking lot in 2011 by an intimidating man, just as the celebrity magazine In Touch was preparing to publish her story about Trump. “And a guy walked up on me and said to me, ‘Leave Trump alone. Forget the story,’” Daniels said. “And then he leaned around and looked at my daughter and said, ‘That’s a beautiful little girl. It’d be a shame if something happened to her mom.’ And then he was gone.” Two former employees of the magazine told CBS “the story never ran because after the magazine called Mr Trump seeking comment, his attorney Michael Cohen threatened to sue”, the network reported. Daniels did not blame Cohen directly for the parking lot showdown. His lawyers sent her a letter denying the incident all the same and, in the wider Trump machine’s unyielding attempts to undermine Daniels’ credibility, expressed doubt that the man in the Las Vegas parking lot even existed."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/commentisfree/2018/mar/26/clowns-to-the-left-jokers-to-the-right-and-labour-centrists-stuck-in-the-middle","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-26T20:12:51Z","webTitle":"Clowns to the left, jokers to the right and Labour centrists stuck in the middle","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/commentisfree/2018/mar/26/clowns-to-the-left-jokers-to-the-right-and-labour-centrists-stuck-in-the-middle","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/commentisfree/2018/mar/26/clowns-to-the-left-jokers-to-the-right-and-labour-centrists-stuck-in-the-middle","fields":{"headline":"Clowns to the left, jokers to the right and Labour centrists stuck in the middle","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Outside in Parliament Square, more than 500 protesters – including a handful of MPs – demonstrated against Labour’s reluctance to take antisemitism within the party seriously. Inside the Commons, Labour gave the impression of a party that had all but given up on itself. A party so at odds with itself and its leadership over many of the key issues that all that many of its MPs can do to express their support is to say nothing. The private grief of the opposition benches had never felt more passive aggressive. Jeremy Corbyn was heard in near silence as he replied to the prime minister’s statement on last week’s European council meeting. Here was the Labour leader’s big chance to unite his MPs. To point out that Theresa May had just made the case for Britain remaining in the EU in her gratitude for the support she had received for her strong stance over Russia. To observe that almost all her Brexit red lines had long since turned green and yet still she was no nearer finding a solution to the Northern Ireland border. To make fun of her assertion that the British people were coming back together. Instead, he seemed as if he was going through the motions. Distracted and lacklustre. More animated by the non-story of British passports than anything else. “Who will lead the negotiations?” he asked at one point. “Not you,” a Tory yelled. Normally such a boorish intervention would rouse the Labour benches to anger. Now, nothing. No one could be bothered to say a word in their leader’s defence. As the session progressed, a few Labour MPs did rouse themselves. Yvette Cooper called out the prime minister for having no fallback position if a security treaty with the EU could not be reached. Chris Leslie admired the absurdity of having an implementation period in which there was no deal to implement. But it didn’t sound as if their hearts were really in it. The prime minister was given a harder time by the Eurosceptics in her own party than she was by Labour. And even they were falling over themselves to give her the benefit of the doubt over her negotiating skills. On days like this, May might even begin to believe she has supernatural powers of survival. While all this was going on, Corbyn kept his head down. More absorbed in the texts popping up on his mobile than in the proceedings. Hoping that his latest apology for antisemitism in the Labour party wouldn’t be seen as too little, too late. Moments later, the Labour leader had a chance to make partial amends. If not for the antisemitism – that would take actions, not words – then at least for being wrong-footed over Russia. And at first it seemed as if he was going to take it. In a debate on Russia, he took a far tougher line than he had previously done. He accepted that British intelligence on the use of a Russian nerve agent in the attack on the Skripals had been accurate. He denounced the Russians for being less than open and said they had a clear case to answer. But when push came to shove, he couldn’t quite bring himself to point the finger at the Kremlin. There was still a chance some rogue agent had got hold of the novichok. The sound of clutching straws. The few remaining Labour MPs in the house held their heads in despair. The Tories couldn’t believe their luck. Three times, Conservative MPs asked Corbyn to clarify if he believed the Russian state was behind the attacks and three times he declined. In desperation, Labour’s Ben Bradshaw stood up to say he had quite clearly heard Corbyn blame the Russian state. Corbyn thanked him for his intervention without confirming anything of the sort. “I have been criticising Russia for 20 years,” Corbyn continued. This was too much for Labour’s John Woodcock who interrupted to say this just wasn’t true. This sounded close to an open declaration of war by the centrists. Enough was enough. Clowns to the left, jokers to the right and they were stuck in the middle with him. The Tories could only retire to count their blessings as Labour ate itself."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/mar/26/eden-hazard-world-cup-chelsea-contract-talks","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-26T20:04:05Z","webTitle":"Eden Hazard to prioritise Belgium’s World Cup over Chelsea contract talks","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/mar/26/eden-hazard-world-cup-chelsea-contract-talks","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/mar/26/eden-hazard-world-cup-chelsea-contract-talks","fields":{"headline":"Eden Hazard to prioritise Belgium’s World Cup over Chelsea contract talks","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Eden Hazard has said he will not think about signing a contract extension with Chelsea until the World Cup has finished. Hazard, who is contracted until 2020, indicated that he did not expect a swift resolution over his future when asked about it before Belgium’s friendly against Saudi Arabia on Tuesday night. Chelsea have no intention of losing the forward but there have been suggestions that he wants to see whether Real Madrid will prioritise his signing this summer. He may also want clarity on whether Chelsea have qualified for the Champions League. “Look, I’m going to finish the season first, then play the World Cup and then I’ll leave on holiday,” Hazard said. “We’ll see what happens next. I haven’t thought about it yet; I have another two years’ contract with Chelsea. I am very happy. I just think about the end of the season and the World Cup.” Chelsea have made an underwhelming defence of their Premier League title and Hazard did not hide his frustration when Antonio Conte used him as a false No 9 in the meek defeat by Manchester City this month. But he answered diplomatically when asked on Monday where he preferred to play. “I just want to be on the pitch,” Hazard said. “No 9 or No 10. I can play left-back if the manager wants me to, no problem.” Hazard was bullish when his thoughts turned to Belgium’s prospects in Russia. “Four years ago it was the first World Cup for most of the players. Now we have experience. We know what to do to be ready. We have one target, which is to reach the final.” Belgium are England’s final opponents in Group G but their talented group of players have still not fulfilled their potential in a major tournament. They were disappointing at the last World Cup and at Euro 2016, exiting both in the last eight. “We are preparing for a World Cup,” Roberto Martínez, Belgium’s coach, said. “World Cups don’t respect generations. They respect talent. We don’t look any further than working very hard and finding the best combination. We are a team that have the mentality to want to be as good as we can.” Martínez, the former Everton and Wigan Athletic manager, said Tuesday night’s game would help his team develop greater cohesion. “I don’t think tomorrow is about making a statement,” the Spaniard said. “We are not working now to make statements. Making statements in March is a bit of a risk. We are looking to see what player can be useful to the team. “In terms of positions we are clear on what the squad needs. To play seven games you have to prepare for that, so the balance of the squad is clear. There are some who can play different positions so that may affect it a little bit. They have an advantage but they need to end the season well.” Martínez has been criticised in Belgium for using Atlético Madrid’s Yannick Carrasco at left wing-back. He suggested that he might stiffen his team’s defensive resolve by using Tottenham’s Jan Vertonghen in that role instead of Carrasco against Saudi Arabia. “He did that very well with Spurs against Real Madrid at the Bernabéu. He is a versatile player.” Martinez anticipates a difficult test against Saudi Arabia, who drew 1-1 with Ukraine last Friday. They are managed by Antonio Pizzi, who led Chile to Copa América glory in 2016, and face Russia in the World Cup’s opening game. “I have been very impressed with Saudi Arabia,” Martínez said. “Antonio Pizzi knows exactly what he wants. He made Chile champions of a very difficult competition and this is a dynamic group of players. They are not going to sit back. They will push us really hard and try to win the ball.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"us-news/2018/mar/26/emma-gonzalez-david-hogg-attacks-rightwing-constitutions-hoaxes","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-26T19:54:59Z","webTitle":"How rightwingers have attacked Parkland students with lies, hoaxes and smears","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/mar/26/emma-gonzalez-david-hogg-attacks-rightwing-constitutions-hoaxes","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/mar/26/emma-gonzalez-david-hogg-attacks-rightwing-constitutions-hoaxes","fields":{"headline":"How rightwingers have attacked Parkland students with lies, hoaxes and smears","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"No issue unites the American right more than their opposition to gun control. The spectacle of hundreds of thousands participating in the #marchforourlives, led by young people, was always going to draw a full-spectrum response. And as of this weekend, this group of idealistic young people have officially become the right’s leading hate figures. The first and most repugnant strategy was to directly attack high-profile campaigners, especially students David Hogg and Emma Gonzalez. Running short of reasoned arguments, many attempted to push conservative buttons with high impact visuals. Alt-right social media company Gab was one of many that disseminated a doctored animation of Gonzalez in which she falsely appeared to be tearing up the US constitution. Cartoonist and Trump sycophant Ben Garrison depicted Hogg as an assault rifle, wielded by CNN, and loaded with Marxism. Breitbart re-published a round of tweets accusing Hogg of throwing a Nazi salute. On Front Page – an outlet led by David Horowitz, whose main stock in trade is virulent Islamophobia – Bruce Thornton decried Hogg’s “profanity laced tantrums” and reduced him and his fellow students to political “shock troops” being manipulated by a progressive “ideology of melodrama and moral exhibitionism”. Alex Jones thought it wise to continue his dispute with Hogg over whether chemical additives in water really turn frogs gay. The website WND simply called him “Vile Hogg”. Along with Hogg and Gonzalez, the right found some new targets among the Parkland survivors. The one who got the most scrutiny was Marjory Stoneman Douglas student Delaney Tarr, who spoke at the Washington rally. In her speech, she suggested that bump stock bans could be expanded into further gun control. Many rightwing outlets drew the inference that the movement would not stop at an assault weapons ban, but would try to ban firearms altogether. Would-be rightwing media monitors, Accuracy in Media, said that she was given a pass by mainstream outlets, and that the movement wanted to “eventually take law-abiding citizens’ lawfully purchased firearms and rifles”. Breitbart also used her comments to buttress a version of the right’s familiar scare story about creeping regulation and “gun-grabbing”. Infowars’s Paul Joseph Watson featured Tarr’s speech in a piece which also used some protester placards to make the case that the movement was not just after assault weapons, but all guns. Others broadened their focus, looking to discredit the movement as a whole. At Gateway Pundit, Jim Hoft, affectionately known as “the dumbest man on the Internet”, was one of many who griped about the fact that a large protest led to some rubbish being left in the street, under the headline “little hoggs”. Infowars signal-boosted videos from Campus Reform and independent live streamers that tried a variation on “gunsplaining”, screening interviews with protesters whose understanding of assault weapons was less encyclopedic than that of the average conservative media consumer. (This, it seems, somehow counts against their expressed desire to not be shot by one). The Federalist was one of many outlets who ran stories about a candidate in the hitherto low-profile sheriff’s election in Buncombe county, North Carolina. R Daryl Fisher’s badly judged joke about being OK with prying guns “from the cold dead hands” of their owners was cited as evidence of a dark and murderous undercurrent in the gun control movement. The Federalist thought this was important enough to merit signal boosting a tweet on the issue from alt-right news site, Red Elephants. Finally, some chose to quibble about numbers. It was difficult to argue with the scale of the crowds depicted in aerial photographs of the Washington march. But the Daily Caller tried to make a fist of things by saying that the crowd was lower than some early estimates, and ripped some commentary from MSNBC suggesting that only 10% of the marchers were children. And while other conservatives were training their barrels on Stormy Daniels, who last night did an interview about her alleged affair with the president, others found a porn star they could like. Jenna Jameson, who entered adult film in the 1990s, was celebrated by over-caffeinated conservative snark site Twitchy, among others, for tweets attacking the Parkland students, and supporting the Second Amendment. Reeling from a mass mobilization on gun control, pro-gun conservatives will take any help they can get, no matter how surprising the source."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"science/2018/mar/27/argonauts-the-astronauts-of-the-sea","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-27T10:00:17Z","webTitle":"Argonauts: the Astronauts of the Sea","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/mar/27/argonauts-the-astronauts-of-the-sea","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2018/mar/27/argonauts-the-astronauts-of-the-sea","fields":{"headline":"Argonauts: the Astronauts of the Sea","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Cephalopod molluscs, the group of animals that includes octopuses, nautiluses, bobtail squid and cuttlefish amongst its living members, is a small but highly diverse group of animals. The group boasts ocean giants, colour and shape changing octopuses, luminous ink squirters, transparent deep sea squid, aquarium escape artists, animals that mimic other animals, giant eyed vampire squid and they’ve even conquered the air in species that fly, yes fly (Muramatsu et al. 2013). In short, it’s really hard to stand out at a cephalopod party without doing something really spectacular and yet there’s one group of octopods, the argonauts, which have a remarkable evolution on a par with the evolution of flight in vertebrates or the many groups like whales and dolphins which evolved from terrestrial ancestors to return to the ocean. Argonauts, several species in the genus Argonauta, are a group of octopod cephalopods, the group that contains all the eight armed, soft bodied cephalopods. Collectively they’re known as octopuses but perhaps confusingly there’s a large number of species in the genus Octopus and many other genera of non-Octopus octopuses too such as Argonauta. Argonauts get their name from the sailors of the Argo from “Jason and the Argonauts” fame. Nautilus also means sailor and it’s hypothesised that this was because argonauts were thought to sail on the wind using their webbed modified arms. I’ve not been able to substantiate if this was the case or if this is an apocryphal nineteenth-century re-imagining of an origin story. There’s some debate about how many living species of argonauts there are, there’s a general consensus around four species but as many as 53 have been described (Sweeney and Young 2004). Argonauts have extreme sexual dimorphism, the males, for the species in which males have even been observed, can be as little as 4% the full length size of females and 1/600th the weight (Finn 2009). They carry their detachable sperm delivering arm in a sac under their left eye. This alone makes argonauts somewhat remarkable amongst the cephalopods but what they are best known for is the calcite shell they make, which gives them the common name paper nautilus (although they aren’t closely related to true nautiluses which grow a hard outer shell). The delicate shell or case of argonauts have been washing up on shorelines for centuries puzzling naturalists as to who made them and how. Depictions of argonaut shells have been found in Minoan ceramics as far back as 3000 BC (Hughes-Brock 1999, Finn 2013). Initially it was thought that these were just the remnants of a shelled creature. When shells were found with cephalopods living inside them which weren’t attached to the shells, it was speculated that crafty octopuses had borrowed them from another creature much like hermit crabs appropriate gastropod shells to live in. It wasn’t until the nineteenth century, however, that Jeanne Villepreux-Power showed once and for all that argonauts create their own shells but not like other shelled molluscs. Females secrete the shells from modified arms and aren’t attached to the shells. They can be removed from the cases they make and they can patch up holes although experimentally they die when removed from the cases for prolonged periods of time. Males do not make these thin calcite shells although sometimes males are found loitering in the egg cases. Female argonauts form comedic awkwardly bobbing chains at the surface of the ocean and some species feed by spreading their modified web arms across the surface of their shells snatching food particl es that come into contact with them. They have also been found attached to jellyfish, chewing through the top of the bell to steal food from inside (Heeger et al. 1992). If you’re lucky enough to find an argonaut shell not too damaged on the shore you’re looking at a form of octopus architecture. What makes argonaut shells amazing is that the shells are a flotation device which have allowed argonauts to return to the open ocean. It’s the cephalopod equivalent of humanity’s endeavour to venture into space and explore the stars. I’ve mentioned previously that we don’t know a lot about octopuses from their limited fossil record but one ‘just so’ story about their evolution is that octopuses as a group lost their tentacles as an adaptation to living on the ocean floor (octopuses don’t have tentacles, the ten-armed squid, cuttlefish and bobtail squid do). Many octopuses are ranging foragers and ambush hunters adapted to navigating the sea floor in search of food, mates or a cosy den or two. By contrast the free swimming squid and cuttlefish rely on their lightning fast tentacles to ensnare fish, crabs and other invertebrates. If this simple hypothesis is correct then we can imagine ancient argonaut ancestors, sick of etching out a living on the ocean floor with a constant threat of predation from above looking to their squiddy cousins zipping about carefree in the open water and deciding to do something about it*. So what does the fossil record tell us? Remarkably, there are fossil argonaut shells even though the odds are stacked against floating paper thin fragile shells preserving in the first place. Just over a dozen fossil species have been described. Two Obinautilus species are known from the Oligocene, 33-23 million years ago, and Miocene, 11-5 million years ago of Japan. Three other genera are known from the Miocene including two species of Mizuhobaris from North America, Kapal batavis from Sumatra and three species of Izumonauta from Japan and New Zealand. Several other species of Argonauta, the same genus as today’s living species are known from the fossil record. Two species we still have today, Argonauta hians and Argonauta argo are known from fossils from the Pliocene and Pleistocene respectively (Tomida et al. 2006). Frustratingly, as is often the case with the fossil record, fossil argonaut shells strongly resemble the argonaut shells of today with the same pattern of ribs, nobs and tubercules offering little insight into how the argonauts evolved to float in the water column again. Looking at the close living relatives of argonauts - blanket octopuses, seven-arm octopuses (not the Pixar kind) and football octopuses (not the psychic kind) - there are some shared ecologies and behaviours but not the distinctive shells of the argonauts. Blanket octopuses (Tremoctopus spp.), football octopuses (Ocythoe tuberculata) and seven-arm octopuses (Haliphron atlanticus) are all pelagic (they live in the open ocean), have some degree of sexual dimorphism and all feed or interact with jellyfish and other gelatinous zooplankton. Blanket octopuses appear to be immune or resistant to Portugese man ‘o’ war stings and have even been observed wielding the stinging tentacles they’ve detached as a weapon. In addition blanket octopuses get their name from the long webs between their arms, perhaps a parallel evolution to the argonauts modified shell secreting arm? So it may be that argonauts were already pelagic octopuses before they evolved their characteristic shells. Amazingly, it wasn’t until 2010 that scientists experimentally understood how argonauts use their shell constructions to float in the water column and control buoyancy. From observations of female argonauts released into water, argonauts jet to the water surface and bob their shells to gulp a pocket of air. Using their second pair of arms they trap the air in the top of the shell and dive releasing enough air to maintain the desired buoyancy (Finn and Norman 2010). There are still so many questions that need answering when it comes to living argonauts. How do males find females? Why is it only the females that make and use shells? How and when did the argonauts evolve their remarkable shells and the complex behaviour that goes alongside maintaining the desired buoyancy? Sometimes the fossil record comes up short and it would be a pretty remarkable fossil discovery that would give us a concrete answer to all of these questions especially considering the low preservation potential of soft bodied animals and the presumably paper thin shell or proto shell we might hope to find. But then it’s questions like these that drive the work of scientists in the field and lab, perhaps more so than the answers we occasionally find. *This is absolutely not how evolution works but it is a nice story.

Since moving to a big city for university and, hopefully, work, I feel conscious of my class. People make fun of my accent, mimicking me and laughing. The jibing has been pretty constant, to the point where I’ve changed the way I speak. People make comments about my “chavvy” appearance as I have red hair, wear fake tan and a full face of makeup to pop to the shops. I always knew I would have to work harder to get to university but I thought that once I got in, the students would be on an even keel. Now I worry about how my class may impact the way I’m perceived in interviews and in the workplace. I’ve begun to assume people who went to grammar or private schools are cleverer than me and it makes me feel inferior. I try to remind myself that the type of school you go to doesn’t equate to ability, but I also worry that in many ways how you are perceived is what gets you through the door. I don’t know whether to change myself to be more like my new community, or whether I should be true to who I am. Thank you for your heartfelt question, and I’m sorry you’re feeling this way. It’s easy in these situations to encourage people to be themselves, but it is also worth mentioning that you shouldn’t berate yourself for wanting to fit in, either. We are all a mixture of our past, present and future selves. Having said that, you’re not choosing to be someone new by choice, and that is hard. I spoke to lots of people who had been through the same thing and no two of them had the same answer. But all had come out the other side. One confided that she found it easier to change herself to fit in; another spoke about weaponising what she felt others saw as a threat – the fact that she was different. Stick to those who make you feel good about yourself. And use this as an opportunity to build friends you can be honest with. Your anxiety about being judged for who you are is painful to listen to. I want to tell you not to worry, but we both know that’s not so easy. There is plenty of research to show that the jibing and judging you’re going through is common in the workplace and at university, and that perfectly able working-class students are blocked from opportunities at the expense of their middle-class peers. But you are right to remind yourself that you have worked just as hard to be who you are. I hope that by sticking at it, you might learn who is worth staying friends with, too. One person had a great piece of advice: “Know that defiance, not deference, is the rational response to a system where the odds are stacked against you.” He’s right. Impostor syndrome never goes away, but it does fade. It would be a shame if you made yourself smaller to fit in, in the meantime. For now, just hold your chip on your shoulder lightly enough that it will help to overcome your self-doubt; you got your grades, you’re doing well, and the young woman who wears a full makeup just to pop to the shops deserves to be in the big city just as much as anyone else. • What do you think?

Indeed, for British Pakistani musician Iqbal, perhaps the only one that rings true is having parents who worry about their children getting what she laughingly describes as a “proper job”. The eldest of six siblings, Iqbal grew up in Regent’s Park, London. It was later, while working in human rights law, having passed her bar exams, that she developed various musical projects. Of these the most significant was her work under the moniker Throwing Shade (slang for a subtle insult), through which she established herself as a DJ and presenter on radio station NTS, where, 100 shows after her debut, she is noted for her selection of global sounds. “I don’t think my parents were OK with me making the transition from law to music to begin with,” she says, sipping a hot chocolate to fend off the cold, “but they slowly came around to it. I played at Tate Modern last year with Wolfgang Tillmans, and I think for my mum that was affirmation that ‘OK, she’s doing something people are into’.” The worry of “people being into it” must, at this point, be a dwindling concern for the woman who has a black belt in karate and a degree in ethnomusicology and history from the Soas University of London. The week before our interview, Iqbal played her first headline show, a sold-out performance at east London’s Archspace, where her set of tender dreampop included a magical cover of the Cure’s A Forest. Iqbal is a warm presence on stage. Dressed in a tailored tartan suit and zebra print brogues, her bouffant hair tucked beneath a black beret, she wields her guitar with a subtle power. “Someone came up to me at the end of a show saying it was really good to see me,” she says with a smile, “because it was the first time they’d seen a brown female on the stage playing guitar music.” This is a hot topic for Iqbal. While her handful of EPs as Throwing Shade were electronically driven and suited to nightclubs, last year’s debut album, Weighing of the Heart – released under her real name – boasted far more live instrumentation. “Your first album is a culmination of the whole life’s experience that’s gone before so you can really indulge it,” she says. It is heavily influenced by the music of her teenage years – everything from Michael Jackson to Britpop to the ska-punk bands she would go to see perform in north London’s Camden “every weekend”. Meanwhile, on the synth-laden tracks, such as the sparse but emotional Slowly and the swirling Saw U Twice, Iqbal invites comparisons with the likes of New Order and Pet Shop Boys. Her decision to drop the Throwing Shade moniker was, she has said, because she wanted to embrace her British Asian heritage. This led to one particularly jarring review (since taken down) on music site XLR8R, which commented on how “white” her album sounded, prompting Iqbal to take issue on social media with its presumptive and patronising racial bias and to write a piece for Dazed magazine headlined: “My name is Nabihah Iqbal, and I make guitar music”. “Why do I come under fire for having passions and inspirations that aren’t overtly linked to people’s stereotypical views of ‘being Asian’?” she asked. Standing up to injustice is important to Iqbal. When she returned from a recording session with Damon Albarn’s Africa Express project in South Africa earlier this year, she joined the Cape Town-raised artist Petite Noir in criticising what they regarded as unfair contracts. The pair were concerned that the agreement asked the acts involved to sign off the rights to the music created in exchange for a £1 fee. But doesn’t she find it risky, talking back to publications and established artists? “People always ask me questions like, ‘What does it feel like to be a female producer or a female DJ?’” she says. “And, yeah, there are obstacles. But the fact that I’m doing it proves something, right? At the same time, what’s the point of being me – what’s the point of being an Asian female British artist doing what I’m doing, occupying this space [if I’m] staying quiet when I see stuff like that happening? I could have easily ignored [the review], but I feel that if our generation doesn’t start speaking up about these things, when is it actually going to change?” While event promoters have become more open to booking women, Iqbal believes that ethnic minority women are still often sidelined into niche spaces – be it “urban” music stages, Bollywood-themed nights, or a spot as the solitary woman of colour in a line-up. Iqbal, then, is a trailblazer, one of only a handful of women of colour in the history of British guitar music (X-Ray Spex’s Poly Styrene, the Selecter’s Pauline Black and Skunk Anansie’s Skin are others who spring to mind). Performing under her real name and making music that has no clear link with her heritage shouldn’t feel radical, but it is. None of this is to say she has no interest in south Asian music. While studying ethnomusicology, Iqbal learned how to play the sitar, which has informed how she thinks about music in general. “In western culture we listen to music as purely entertainment,” she says, “but as soon as you look at what music means to people in cultures and communities across the world you realise it takes on a much more malleable, significant role – whether it’s a Native American healing song or devotional Sufi music. “The sitar is so intricate and profound: it makes you think about music in a different way… The way that it filters through in my work was that with this record I wanted to make music that would evoke an emotional response in the listener – whatever that is. You can’t really define that or demand what it should be, but I just didn’t want it to be background music.” Background music it is not. On stage at her recent east London show, Iqbal recalled receiving a number of messages from fans who reacted to her album by crying. “In a cathartic way... hopefully,” she laughs. “Not like, ‘Oh my God, I’m completely depressed.’ It just feels really surreal and overwhelming to think that music I made is having that effect on people. It’s cool.” It’s not just the music that resonates: Iqbal places great emphasis on the importance of words, choosing two poets as her support acts at Archspace, her brother Haseeb Iqbal and Sana A Rashid. “I asked them to write a new work specifically based on the same kind of inspirations that I was looking at for my music,” she says. “I sent both of them excerpts from books or poetry I was reading while I was writing the album.” The themes the two poets consider – notably the fleeting nature of life and love – can be heard throughout Weighing of the Heart. In Saw U Twice, Iqbal ruminates on a classic romantic conceit (“Saw you on the train/ Will I see you again?”), while standout track Zone 1 to 6000 is a striking exploration of people young and old adapting to the numbing life of the capital. The album sounds like an ode to Iqbal’s home town, and that track in particular – with its spoken-word refrain of “it’s always work and never love” – was inspired by William Blake’s poem London. Allusions to history crop up elsewhere, too – in fact, the title, Weighing of the Heart, refers to the ceremony ancient Egyptians believed took place immediately after death. But Iqbal’s interest in older cultures doesn’t mean she’s not forward-thinking. “Our parents’ generation sometimes say that we should be grateful to be here – but there’s a difference, I think, between being grateful for what you have, but also standing up for yourself. I am so happy to be from here, so happy to be able to focus on what I love the most – but at the same time, I’m not going to go along with injustices that really stand out to me. It’s just not who I am.” Nabihah Iqbal performs in Bristol, Thursday; Leeds, 13 April; Manchester, 14 April"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2018/mar/26/greece-ex-minister-yanis-varoufakis-launches-political-party","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-26T17:17:15Z","webTitle":"Greek ex-minister Yanis Varoufakis launches political party","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/26/greece-ex-minister-yanis-varoufakis-launches-political-party","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/mar/26/greece-ex-minister-yanis-varoufakis-launches-political-party","fields":{"headline":"Greek ex-minister Yanis Varoufakis launches political party","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Greece’s former finance minister, Yanis Varoufakis, acting on his promise to take mainstream politicians to task, has announced the formation of his own party. Varoufakis, 57, said the grassroots party would seek to “bring realistic hope” to the debt-ridden country. It will be known as MeRA 25 and has the overarching aim of releasing Greece from “debt bondage”. “We will not mince our words,” he announced at the party’s launch event in a theatre hall in Athens. “[Our alliance] will be people of the left and liberalism, greens and feminists.” The initiative extends the DiEM25 (Democracy in Europe Movement 2025) that Varoufakis co-founded in February 2016 with a view to contesting EU elections. Present in seven European countries, DiEM25 has urged members to engage in “responsible disobedience” while advocating a new deal for a continent still grappling with the fallout from the 2008 global crash. Varoufakis, an economist who was the Greek finance minister between January and June 2015, at the height of the eurozone debt drama when the leftist Syriza party first assumed power, has emerged as one of the EU’s fiercest critics. Exploiting his six-month stint at the high table of European economic decision-making, he has lobbed verbal salvos at Brussels repeatedly denouncing its lack of “genuine democratic processes”. He argues the bloc is ripe for crisis because its economic architecture is woefully inadequate. Insisting that successive bailouts – and the brutal austerity cuts attached to them – had been a failed recipe for Greece’s economic recovery, Varoufakis said the country was living as a “debtors’ colony”. “Our young people have to learn to live on €400 a month or look to emigrate. We will not repatriate them with debt relief alone as [the creditors] are promising us,” said Varoufakis, who has returned to his teaching post at Athens University. “Once your human capital has left, you are bereft.” The Greek government’s current narrative of a “clean exit” from bailout supervision – when Athens’ third EU and IMF-sponsored rescue programme ends this summer – would never happen, he claimed. By resorting to the solution of extending repayment timetables, it had condemned itself to decades of more austerity. In such circumstances, investors and growth had almost zero chance of success, said Varoufakis. Greece has the highest debt to GDP ratio in the eurozone, at 180% of GDP. MeRA 25’s first proposal is to drastically restructure the debt mountain. Although Varoufakis has a following worthy of a rock star in Europe, he is a controversial figure in Greece, where many blame his bungled handling of negotiations with the EU for the severe price the country has had to pay for its third, €86bn bailout. However, his call for citizens to re-engage in active politics may appeal to many Greeks disaffected by the prime minister, Alexis Tsipas, and the about-turn his once fiercely anti-austerity party has made in office. Varoufakis won a record number of votes when he first ran as MP in 2015."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/mar/27/dissident-mps-westminster-blairites-tories","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-27T05:00:06Z","webTitle":"Moderate MPs feel isolated by Corbyn - but can't imagine a future outside Labour | Rafael Behr","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/27/dissident-mps-westminster-blairites-tories","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/27/dissident-mps-westminster-blairites-tories","fields":{"headline":"Moderate MPs feel isolated by Corbyn - but can't imagine a future outside Labour","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Only a small minority of the people who support a party become members. An even smaller number then turn into members who don’t actually support their party. Logically, there should be none, yet I meet them these days with surprising frequency. Some are liberal-minded Tories who feel that Brexit has tilted their party’s centre of gravity towards intolerant nationalism. But their distress pales beside the anguish of Labour people who cannot stomach Jeremy Corbyn’s control of the party. Tory rebels are unhappy with Theresa May, but can envisage worse: their nightmare is a leader – Jacob Rees-Mogg, perhaps – whose beliefs would make them want to tear the rosette from their lapels. That nightmare is the day job for some Labour MPs. There is nothing new about friction between the pro-Corbyn movement and its malcontents. The dissenters tried to unseat their leader once and failed. Their confidence that contact with the sharp end of an election would burst Corbyn’s bubble then proved misplaced. And so, after last June, Labour’s demoralised and disoriented dissidents burrowed into the soft mulch of tribal loyalty and hibernated. Yet in the past few weeks they have been stirred awake. The cause is a sequence of positions Corbyn has taken – or failed to take – in three areas: Russia, Brexit and antisemitism. When May blamed the Kremlin for the attempted murder of a former spy in Salisbury, the Labour leader invited her to reconsider. He suggested that Russian authorities be asked to verify the provenance of a nerve agent known only to have been developed in Russian laboratories. Here was the opposition leader apparently straining to exonerate a regime plausibly charged with a chemical weapon attack on British soil. Meanwhile, Corbyn has firmed up his credentials as a Brexit true believer. In a speech in Dundee this month, the Labour leader made it clear that his reasons for wanting to break away from the EU single market were every bit as ideological as those of his Tory leaver counterparts – symmetrically positioned as far to the left as they stand on the right. When, last week, Owen Smith, shadow Northern Ireland secretary, backed the idea of a public vote on Brexit terms, he was fired from the front bench. That news broke on the day that a row erupted over a Facebook comment posted by Corbyn in 2012, expressing support for an artist whose mural was due to be erased from a wall in east London. The work showed caricatured Jews playing Monopoly on the backs of emaciated bodies. Corbyn’s encouraging comment began with the word “why?” The answer should have been obvious. And just a brief interrogation might have exposed the artist’s own explanation: “Some of the older white Jewish folk in the local community had an issue with me portraying their beloved #Rothschild or #Warburg etc as the demons they are.” It was hardly the first time Corbyn had come face-to-face with blatant antisemitism and somehow failed to see it. When offending items are brought to his attention, he regrets that offence was caused. But he also has a history of casual solidarity with the offenders. He condemns “pockets of antisemitism” in Labour but he can’t acknowledge that those pockets are sewn into his movement. The darker recesses of anti-capitalism, where “Zionist” cabals are believed to be the epicentre of evil, are fringes to a banner that is embroidered with Corbyn’s name. While no item in the Russia-Brexit-antisemitism sequence surprises Corbyn’s critics, the unfolded triptych should be revelatory to those MPs who were numbly traipsing along in his shadow, hoping that something might turn up. It won’t. He is their leader. If they stand for election, they should want him to be prime minister. If they believe, as many on the left do, that any Labour government is unquestionably better than any other kind, they must be honest about the price of that choice. If they think vital skills in a prime minister include recognising antisemitism at first sight, trusting UK security services over Vladimir Putin, and fearing that a hard Brexit is bad for Britain, they might be in the wrong party. Inevitably there is chatter about alternatives. Imaginary parties crop up wherever beaten Blairites rub shoulders with disconsolate Cameroon Tories. And the conversation always stumbles against the same obstacles: no leader; no clarity about what the “centre ground” means, beyond an assertion that May and Corbyn have abandoned it. Dislike of Brexit is a common grudge, but not a long-term programme. It is a sentiment that covers a wide spectrum of political opinion in parliament and beyond – Welsh and Scottish nationalists, fiscal conservatives and anti-austerity social democrats. Contempt for the way May has handled the Brexit negotiations is a sentiment that might animate George Osborne in his chair as editor of the Evening Standard, and Caroline Lucas, the Green MP for Brighton. That doesn’t mean they are natural allies in a putative coalition of remain-spirited, metropolitan social liberals. Besides, there is already an anti-Brexit party – the Lib Dems – who look like a tired nostalgic tribute band to an era of politics that isn’t coming back. The 37th anniversary of the founding of the Social Democratic party went unmarked yesterday, because the SDP’s main legacy is as a cautionary tale to schismatic Labour MPs. It might be very hard to convert a Corbynised party into something else, but that doesn’t mean it would be any easier starting again from scratch. Meanwhile, Brexit-sceptic Tories are exercised by different calculations. First, their horror at the idea of Corbyn in Downing Street easily matches their dislike of Brexit, so they flinch at any course of action that might precipitate an election. And second, while they don’t like May’s habit of yielding to pressure from dogmatic anti-EU backbenchers, they also recognise that, as long as she is in office, the fanatics do not control the whole government. While Labour’s moderate faction is already in psychological exile, its Tory counterparts still feel some kind of political investment in their current leader. But the biggest challenge, for both Labour and Tory dissidents, is knowing what the alternative vehicle they crave even looks like. This is a catch-22 problem: there is no platform without leaders willing to stand on it, and none step forward without a platform to hold them up. Meanwhile, there is a certain comfort in sticking within existing tribal reservations, doing doctrinal battle with internal enemies. There is a sense of righteous solidarity, being part of a heroic resistance. But that feeling is also a trap. Internal party warriors are good at knowing what they are fighting against. But in politics that is the easy bit. The hard part is telling the rest of the country what it is you are fighting for. • Rafael Behr is a Guardian columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"football/2018/mar/26/england-italy-gareth-southgate-cutting-edge","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-26T21:30:01Z","webTitle":"Gareth Southgate looking to add edge to England’s impressive defensive work","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/mar/26/england-italy-gareth-southgate-cutting-edge","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/mar/26/england-italy-gareth-southgate-cutting-edge","fields":{"headline":"Gareth Southgate looking to add edge to England’s impressive defensive work","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Gareth Southgate believes England will find their cutting edge as they grow more accustomed to the fluid style of play being encouraged by the coaching staff, with the manager eager to use the friendly against Italy as a gauge of his team’s development. There will be a handful of England changes from the win in the Netherlands on Friday but Southgate, who was still contemplating the makeup of his side on Monday night, has suggested the formation and approach will not differ. The side will undertake further shape work on Tuesday morning, with Italy, who will be absent from the World Cup and are under the temporary stewardship of the Under-21s coach Luigi Di Biagio, expected to press more aggressively and test their hosts’ new-found comfort on the ball. England have kept five successive clean sheets but have managed only two goals in that run, with Raheem Sterling having failed to score for 18 matches and Dele Alli scoring only once in 19 caps despite both being relatively prolific at club level. “There’s two parts to that attacking record, and one is that the level of defending is often better,” said Southgate, who is likely to start with Jamie Vardy up front alongside Sterling in the absence of the injured Harry Kane. “A lot of the teams that we’ve played – Brazil, Germany – you’re playing world-class players. So there’s that element. “Secondly, the most difficult thing is to score and put the fluidity in the top end of the pitch. What we did on Friday, we started to get more numbers higher up the field: four, five, six in and around the penalty area. We then need to be a little bit more patient in that area of the pitch, wait for that right moment to make the pass, rather than try and force things or force crosses that are going to get cut out. But that will come, again, the more guys play together and they get that understanding of the runs each other make. Then we will create more chances. And if we create chances, we’ve got guys who will finish them.” Southgate was impressed with Jordan Pickford’s contribution in the Netherlands but will grant Jack Butland 90 minutes against Italy, with Ashley Young expected to come in at left wing-back and Eric Dier drafted in to midfield. Harry Maguire may not be risked after suffering tightness in a hamstring late on against the Netherlands, and there remains scope for the likes of Alfie Mawson, Lewis Cook or James Tarkowski to make their debut. Kyle Walker is set to remain as the right-sided of the three centre-backs. “There is a benefit to building on what we did, and Kyle has all the qualities to play there,” Southgate said. “If you are playing on the side of a three, the ability to defend in wide areas and use the ball as comfortably as he could, he is in areas that he is used to. Add to that his athleticism not only to defend big spaces and cover the rest of the defence but also his ability to drive out. “I don’t think Italy will sit back but, if we play teams that do sit back, then those outside centre-backs especially need to be able to drive forward. We’re still learning the nuts and bolts of this system and improving with this system, so it’s important all the players know their roles. “But we want to build on the performance in Holland. We’ve only played the system a few times but this is a really good test because against the 4-3-3 of Brazil, we didn’t play out of pressure so well. We’ve got to cope with that, got to have the confidence to play and to find the solutions to play through them. We’ve got to try to be more effective in the final third of the field. And also we want to look at a couple of different players and a couple of different options, as we did on Friday. So there’s lots of things you’re trying to get from the game. “The week up to now has been a real success in terms of the attitude, the approach and the way we’ve trained. We’ve advanced a lot.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/blog/2018/mar/26/anthony-joshua-boxing","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-26T21:30:01Z","webTitle":"Humble Anthony Joshua has his sights on top of the boxing tree","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2018/mar/26/anthony-joshua-boxing","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/blog/2018/mar/26/anthony-joshua-boxing","fields":{"headline":"Humble Anthony Joshua has his sights on top of the boxing tree","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"For the first century of boxing’s rule as the dirtiest yet most glamorous branch of the sports entertainment industry, the undisputed heavyweight champion was the king of sport – from Jack Dempsey, then Joe Louis, Rocky Marciano and Muhammad Ali through to Mike Tyson. While it is not a crown that has balanced easily on the head of any champion since the reign of Lennox Lewis at the turn of the millennium – mainly because the Klitschko brothers then split the kingdom – Anthony Joshua is building a case that might soon become irresistible for one man to rule alone again. Eddie Hearn’s assertion that his champion is destined to become one of the biggest names in sport invariably has invited cynical chuckles among writers and commentators, given boxing’s struggle to regain its old supremacy in an era of digital distractions and football mania. However, the handsome young millionaire from Watford – who aims to add to his growing collection of honours in his third consecutive stadium fight on Saturday night – is not laughing. He wants it all and his supporters, in their rapidly expanding thousands, want it for him too. Joshua is a modern sporting phenomenon, a cash cow on a huge scale whose ultimate fortune could elevate him to stand comparison with Andy Murray, Lewis Hamilton, Rory McIlroy and even some of our overpaid footballers. At the Principality Stadium in Cardiff on Saturday night it is estimated that Joshua’s unification fight for three of the four recognised titles against the unbeaten and undemonstrative New Zealander Joseph Parker will attract close to 80,000 fans – with Sky hoping good numbers will also pay for the privilege at home. Henry Cooper cemented his place in the affections of the nation in two fights in the 1960s that have grown in the memory to the point where myth and reality will collide forever. Against Cassius Clay at Wembley Stadium in 1963, and then for his title at Highbury in 1966 when the great man had morphed into Muhammad Ali, Cooper persuaded 35,000 and then 46,000 fans to cheer on his doomed assignments. There are quantifiable metrics to measure the drawing power of the three biggest names in British heavyweight boxing since Cooper. Frank Bruno and Lewis convinced the British public they were worthy of their unqualified support as athletes and individuals but none posted the numbers that Joshua is doing now. He just about matched Cooper’s memorable double in one night at Wembley last year, when he got off the floor to knock Wladimir Klitschko into retirement after a decade as the world’s best heavyweight. When the estimable but little-known Carlos Takam stepped in at short notice to challenge Joshua at the Principality Stadium six months later the gate touched 78,000. When Bruno challenged Lewis for his world heavyweight title at the National Stadium in Cardiff on a miserably wet night in 1993 both were near the peak of their celebrity but they drew only 25,000 fans, partly because it was live on terrestrial television. What is it, then, about Joshua? As Hearn said again recently, “AJ hasn’t changed one bit. He can’t go out much but he is the same person as when I first met him years ago. That’s pretty amazing.” In all his dealings with the media, Joshua is never less than polite and accommodating, however busy. He asks questions and is genuinely interested in the answers. He does not give ill-considered replies, and corrects misinterpretations. He remembers names and faces and, if he has ever turned down an autograph, he must have been in a terrible hurry. As with Parker, family matters hugely to him. Throughout his rise he has lived at home with his mother, Yeta, in north London (as well as buying property abroad) and respects the traditions and beliefs of their Nigerian heritage. As for his oft-mentioned legacy, he asks rhetorically, “Do people remember Lennox and [Evander] Holyfield’s fight [which unified the titles]? All the people watching this fight now? I think it is what it is – and then people will forget about it in another 20 years. Scrap all that. I’ve fought in the Boston Arms [a north London pub venue] in front of 100 people and I’ve fought in front of 100,000 people. “It’s about self. I’ve always said it’s not about the belts, even though they are great. Even Mike Tyson said, ‘What are these? They don’t mean nothing any more.’ I’m not doing it for them. It’s about where can I take myself? Because, if it’s for the belts, certain people have won them and then derailed because they set out to become heavyweight champion of the world; they did it and then there was nothing because that’s all they set out to do. “I’m challenging myself. The unifications and undisputed [recognition] are just titles on the shelf. This is an everlasting battle and bigger than any unification.” So, does he want to emulate Tyson as “the baddest man on the planet”? Joshua laughs and replies: “No, no. I want to be the smartest fighter on the planet. Look at [unbeaten and semi-retired Floyd] Mayweather: he’s not so much the baddest, he’s known as the smartest – wise, knows his way around the ring. He’s got a boxing IQ.” Yet, for all his pay-per-view records, Mayweather never had what Joshua already has established: empathy with his fans. His is a new audience. Not all are hardcore boxing people. Many come for the occasion, to be witnesses to something memorable. It was much the same for Dempsey, Louis, Marciano, Ali and Tyson. They transcended their sport. “When you watch the evolution of my career,” Joshua says, “I detach myself from it and just focus on me. I don’t get caught up in the evolution of my career. It’s just business. I worry about myself, and challenge myself. “I don’t get caught up in anything. Do you see me out anywhere? Do you hear anything [bad] about me? You don’t hear anything like that. But do I deal with people differently? Yeah. My time is limited. I’ve got goals now. Everything has been a rush. The amateurs was rushed, pros has been quick. I thought, woah, this is great. But now this is it. This is focused.” He has some way to go yet. He is a young 28 and might box into his mid-30s. There are plenty of opportunities for mishap. All but Marciano of the above quintet of 20th-century greats were punished for going on too long. But, as Joshua said in a quiet moment before he dethroned Klitschko, “The difference is, champions get up. I’ll get up. Always.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"business/2018/mar/26/house-of-fraser-owner-high-street-sales-costs","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-26T17:44:43Z","webTitle":"House of Fraser owner to inject funding amid fears for chain's future","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/mar/26/house-of-fraser-owner-high-street-sales-costs","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/mar/26/house-of-fraser-owner-high-street-sales-costs","fields":{"headline":"House of Fraser owner to inject funding amid fears for chain's future","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The Chinese company behind House of Fraser will inject about £15m into the department store chain this week as part of a plan to allay concerns about the 169-year-old firm’s financial health. The retailer, which employs 6,000, has been under the spotlight over fears it could become the next victim of torrid trading conditions for the UK retail sector that have already claimed well-known high street names such as Toys R Us and Maplin this year. It is trying to slash the floorspace of its 59-strong store chain by 30% and reduce its rent bill after dismal Christmas trading figures, while its bank lenders have hired accountancy EY to review the firm’s finances. The chain has also held talks with Alteri – a turnaround firm that specialises in struggling retailers – fuelling speculation that is looking to refinance its £400m debts. House of Fraser has since protested that it only agreed to a meeting at Alteri’s request and could not have sought fresh finance in any case, given the terms of its existing loans. The picture has been further complicated by suggestions that China’s Sanpower, which owns 89% of the company, is seeking to offload the majority of its stake to fellow Chinese leisure firm Wuji Wenhua. But the Guardian understands that Sanpower, which bought House of Fraser in 2014 in a deal worth £450m, will reaffirm its commitment to the business, starting with an expected £15m cash injection as soon as this week. The Sanpower chairman, Yuan Yafei, reassured the trade minister, Liam Fox, that he wants to own House of Fraser for the long term, in a discussion last Friday at Hong Kong’s Great Festival of Innovation. The entrepreneur, who started his business in 1993 with $2,000 (£1,415) and is now worth an estimated $12bn, is thought to have promised further investment, coupled with a wider overhaul and modernisation of the company and House of Fraser brand. A spokesperson for Sanpower confirmed that Yafei will inject more money into House of Fraser via Nanjing Cenbest, Sanpower’s Shanghai-listed subsidiary. “We at Sanpower continue to support House of Fraser as it embarks on a year of significant transformation in 2018,” he said. “Sanpower, through the listed company, has invested £45m in House of Fraser and plans to inject further capital.” With the money on its way, the chief executive, Alex Williamson, wrote to House of Fraser’s suppliers on Monday to say that the company was continuing with business as usual. The long-term puzzle for Sanpower is that business as usual is not exactly a high bar, at least not lately. After buying House of Fraser four years ago, Yafei laid out ambitious plans to create an international retailer with 50 Chinese stores. Today it has just two Chinese outlets, while its main UK operation is feeling the pinch from flagging revenues and cripplingly high costs. “They’ve got too much space, inflexible leases, upward-only rent reviews and are also facing pressure from the national living wage,” said Richard Lim, the chief executive of Retail Economics. “It’s all putting significant cost pressures on operating their stores, so operating costs are up 3% year on year, which outstrips the sales rise.” Lim said rising costs had been accompanied by weak consumer spending as real wages have stagnated or fallen, due to the rise in inflation sparked by the fall in the value of the pound after the Brexit vote. “One of the biggest issues around inflation is that it’s mainly coming from food, transport and housing costs,” he said. “If you take those three components, that takes up about 50% of the least affluent households’ expenditure and it’s non-discretionary. “People are worried about Brexit, about personal finances, about job security, so they’re holding back on purchasing non-essential items.” One way retailers have stripped out costs is to migrate sales to the web, where overheads are far lower. But House of Fraser has struggled to wean itself off traditional bricks-and-mortar stores, largely because it is saddled with expensive and lengthy leases signed decades ago, when it seemed large retailers could never have too much floorspace. The business is now asking its landlords for help to reduce its £140m-a-year rent bill. David Fox, the head of retail agency at real estate group Colliers, said: “When you have surplus space that still costs you money it’s just a drain on resources. “I’m guessing they’ll be exploring options to release space and come up with an economic answer.” He said House of Fraser could look to bring in other businesses to help share the cost of floorspace, pointing to steps taken by struggling rival Debenhams, which has rented space to gyms and a hot-desking firm. But Fox warned that if landlords could not find tenants willing to match the generous rents House of Fraser is paying, the chain will have to make up the difference. Lim pointed to House of Fraser’s difficulties in relaunching its website as another factor in its recent poor performance. He said the issues were behind poor Christmas sales figures, when store sales were down 2.9% but online revenues plunged 7.5%. “We estimate online is about 18% of total retail spending and they’ve had quite a lot of difficulty in implementing a new online platform last year. They invested a lot of money but it didn’t go very well and there were lots of problems with it.” House of Fraser’s website woes are thought to have been ironed out now but pressure on margins remains, prompting the company to sell £30m of brands, identify £16m in cost savings and invest £10m in more up-to-date warehouse technology. From Scotland to Chinese ownership The department store group dates back to 1849, when Hugh Fraser and James Arthur opened a drapery shop, called Arthur &amp; Fraser, on the corner of Argyle Street and Buchanan Street in Glasgow. In 1909 the company, now Fraser &amp; Sons, started using the stag’s head logo. The firm went on to acquire more than 70 companies, including Harrods and shoe retailer Kurt Geiger. Renamed House of Fraser, the firm made its first appearance on the London Stock Exchange in 1948. A takeover bid by Tiny Rowland’s conglomerate Lonrho was blocked by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission in 1981. HoF was bought by the Al-Fayed family for £615m in 1985, and its stag’s head logo was replaced by a stag leaping from a triangle. In 1994, it floated on the London Stock Exchange with a market value of £484m. A major store refurbishment and closure programme followed with the loss of 1,000 staff. HoF went on to launch its house brands including womenswear, menswear, and homeware by Linea. In 2006, the company was taken private again in a £351m deal by a consortium led by Icelandic investor Baugur, which collapsed three years later. Baugur’s stake passed to the administrators to failed Icelandic bank Landsbanki, with the HoF chairman, Don McCarthy owning a further 20%. In 2014, HoF was sold to Chinese conglomerate Sanpower for £480m, despite efforts by Sports Direct owner Mike Ashley, who had acquired a sizeable stake, to derail the deal.

On Tuesday night, as he sat in the stands at the Wanda Metropolitano in Madrid, watching on impotently as his international team-mates were humiliated 6-1 by fellow La Liga types, he could be forgiven for wondering why on earth he bothered. Would it have been so bad had Argentina missed out on the World Cup? The last time they did that, in 1970, the tournament ended up being pretty enjoyable anyway. Admittedly that might not be a commonly held view in Argentina itself, but we’re looking at the bigger picture here. Thing is, because of Messi’s outrageous heroics, Argentina are now committed to a summer in Russia, where there’s a chance they’ll run into the likes of Spain again. Or perhaps Brazil, who spanked them 3-0 in the qualifiers. And they’ll definitely have to play Nigeria, who stuck four past them in Russia only four months ago. It’s all a bit of a worry for Messi, who by the looks of things will have to bear quite a load on his shoulders come June. ‘Twas ever thus, The Fiver supposes, though this is as bad as things have ever got for the Albiceleste, equalling record five-goal defeats against Bolivia (2009), Colombia (1993), Uruguay (1959) and Czechoslovakia (1958, and that one at a World Cup won by Brazil, to boot). No wonder Messi was pictured at one point closing his eyes tight and drifting off to his safe space, where he trots around Camp Nou on a red-and-blue unicorn, repeatedly back-heeling balls into an unguarded net. But dreams have a habit of seamlessly segueing into nightmares, and Messi soon woke up with a start, and in a cold sweat. The unicorn had morphed into a three-legged blue-and-white donkey which sat down and refused to budge, unwilling to listen to reason, and so Messi was chased barefoot across Russia, over fields covered in hot coals, broken glass and bricks of Lego, by two twinkle-toed ghosts, Diego and Mario. There was a ticker-tape parade. To be fair, Argentina were also missing Angel Di María, Sergio Agüero and Paulo Dybala, so there were mitigating circumstances to the Spain debacle. But while the Isco-inspired Iberians made a convincing case for regaining the trophy they surrendered meekly in 2014, Argentina’s chances of a first shiny prize since the 1993 Copa America - and Messi’s hopes of joining Maradona and Kempes in the World Cup pantheon - seem slim. Those hoping for a first winner from South America since 2002 may require Brazil to take up the slack yet again. QUOTE OF THE WEEK “I think in a World Cup match he would have got a red card for kicking out at me like he did. In a friendly game sometimes referees can leave it. People might look at that and think he could be wound up – and in football you have to take advantage of everything. When you know the type of player someone is, you try to do things that might make them crazy and see their team lose them with a red card. England will see what happened and they will try to take advantage of it” – Costa Rica’s Kendall Waston reckons England should poke the bear that is Tunisia’s Wahbi Khazri at the World Cup.

Christopher Wylie, the former Cambridge Analytica employee turned whistleblower, has revealed that as well as playing a part in setting up the firm – which is now facing increasing scrutiny from investigators on both sides of the Atlantic over its role in harvesting Facebook data – he was also a central figure in setting up AIQ, which accounted for 40% of Vote Leave’s campaign budget. The Observer first disclosed connections between the firms a year ago when it published details of an intellectual property licence that linked AIQ and SCL Elections, the parent company of Cambridge Analytica. In public, the official Leave campaign and Nigel Farage’s Leave.EU campaign were quite separate and appeared hostile to each other. But the connections between the two data firms raise fresh questions about possible overlaps between the two campaigns. Wylie said that, in 2016, the relationship went far beyond that. Although AIQ and Cambridge Analytica appeared separate, the two were bound by a skein of threads so intimate that some Cambridge Analytica staff referred to the Canadian data firm as a “department” within the company. Wylie said that the two businesses shared the same underlying technology. “AIQ wouldn’t exist without me,” he said. “When I became research director for SCL [the parent company of Cambridge Analytica] we needed to rapidly expand our technical capacity and I reached out to a lot of people I had worked with in the past.” That included Jeff Silvester, his former boss, who lived in Wylie’s home town – Victoria, capital of the province of British Columbia. Wylie suggested Silvester should work for the firm in London. “But he had just had a family and wasn’t keen to go to London,” he said. The Observer has seen an email from 11 August 2013 that Wylie sent to Silvester about SCL. “We mostly do psychological warfare work for Nato,” he said. “But a lot of projects involve a socio-political element.” Silvester replied: “You need a Canadian office.” He then set up AIQ with his business partner, Zack Massingham, to work on SCL and later Cambridge Analytica projects. “Essentially it was set up as a Canadian entity for people who wanted to work on SCL projects who didn’t want to move to London. That’s how AIQ got started: originally to service SCL and Cambridge Analytica projects,” said Wylie. Last March, when the Observer started asking questions about the connection between Cambridge Analytica and AIQ, the former removed “SCL Canada” and Massingham’s phone number from its website and said that AIQ was a “former IT contractor”. Cambridge Analytica is already under scrutiny for its work for Farage’s Leave.EU campaign, and AIQ is also involved in an investigation by the Electoral Commission into Vote Leave. On Saturday the Information Commissioner, Elizabeth Denham said that “AggregateIQ has not been especially co-operative with our investigation. We are taking further steps in that matter.” The mystery of how Vote Leave even found AIQ, a firm with just 20 staff that operated 4,760 miles away out of a cramped office above an opticians in the Canadian city of Victoria, was raised by the Observer last May. Dom Cummings, the chief strategist for Vote Leave, told this newspaper that he found the firm “on the internet”. But cached searches show that AIQ had no internet presence at that time and a new source within Vote Leave has come forward to say that Cummings had full knowledge of the connections between the two firms. “The idea that Dom had no idea of AIQ’s connection to Cambridge Analytica is complete bullshit,” said the source. “It was a former Cambridge Analytica employee who made the introduction. He knew exactly how the two companies operated together. He knew they’d worked together on the [former candidate for the Republican nomination for president] Ted Cruz campaign and that they shared the same underlying technology,” said the source. But Cummings told this newspaper: “Vote Leave data never went anywhere near Cambridge Analytica and your repeated attempts to show that Vote Leave and Cambridge Analytica were somehow secretly coordinating is not just without foundation but the opposite of the truth.” Until 2016, AIQ had no clients other than Cambridge Analytica. The lack of a website, Wylie claims, was because at the time of the referendum it was operating almost as “an internal department of Cambridge Analytica. It didn’t have a website and no contact number. The only public contact number was SCL’s website.” However, AIQ says it has had a website since it was founded in 2013. Wylie said that AIQ managed Cambridge Analytica’s technology platform – Ripon – and its databases. “Because AIQ was operating internally, almost as a department of Cambridge Analytica, it didn’t have a website and no contact number. The only public contact number was SCL’s website,” said Wylie. He said AIQ also had its intellectual property owned by Cambridge Analytica. “AIQ often traded as SCL Canada for ages and although a technically separate company, the IP [intellectual property] was retained by Cambridge Analytica and SCL. “They were the ones that took a lot of data that Cambridge Analytica would acquire and the algorithms they build and translated that into the actual physical targeting online, they [AIQ] were the bit that actually disseminated stuff. AIQ managed the Ripon platform, which is Cambridge Analytica’s platform, and built a lot of the tech that would connect the algorithms to social and online advertising networks.” Wylie claims that the two entities, certainly during the time of the referendum campaign, were operating closely. “Among internal CA staff AIQ was referred to as ‘our Canadian office’. They were treated as a department within the company,” he said. Cummings would later say: “Without a doubt, the Vote Leave campaign owes a great deal of its success to the work of AggregateIQ. We couldn’t have done it without them.” His quote, emblazoned on the AIQ website for more than a year, disappeared on Thursday. Silvester said that Cambridge Analytica was not in contact with AIQ during the referendum campaign. “AIQ never worked or even communicated in any way with Cambridge Analytica or any other parties related to Cambridge Analytica with respect to the Brexit campaign. Any claim that we shared Vote Leave data with Cambridge Analytica or anyone else in any way is entirely false.” He added: “AggregateIQ has always been 100% Canadian owned and operated.” • This article was updated on 27 March 2018 to clarify which SCL Group company AIQ’s intellectual property was licensed to; and on 29 March to clarify that Victoria, on Vancouver Island, is the capital of the province of British Columbia and is 4,760 miles, not 2,300 miles, from London. • Addendum, 29 March 2018: we are happy to clarify that we did not intend to suggest that AggregateIQ is a direct part and/or the Canadian branch of Cambridge Analytica or that it has been involved in the exploitation of Facebook data or otherwise in any of the alleged wrongdoing made against Cambridge Analytica. Further we did not intend to suggest that AIQ secretly and unethically coordinated with Cambridge Analytica on the EU Referendum."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2018/mar/25/anne-marie-duff-talks-divorce-love-loss-desert-island-discs-james-mcavoy","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-25T00:01:37Z","webTitle":"​Anne-Marie Duff talks divorce, love and loss on Desert Island Discs","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/mar/25/anne-marie-duff-talks-divorce-love-loss-desert-island-discs-james-mcavoy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2018/mar/25/anne-marie-duff-talks-divorce-love-loss-desert-island-discs-james-mcavoy","fields":{"headline":"​Anne-Marie Duff talks divorce, love and loss on Desert Island Discs","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Anne-Marie Duff has spoken of the emotional impact of the end of her decade-long marriage to the Scottish actor James McAvoy in her appearance on Desert Island Discs. In the interview to be broadcast on Radio 4 on Sunday, the leading stage and screen actor admits she has “been through a lot, certainly, in the last few years” after the marriage ended in 2016. “I’m really interested in several things,” Duff said. “One is the fact that we as a species get our faces out of the dirt and try to feel the sun on them, and as a person I try to do that.” She goes on to tell presenter Kirsty Young: “I go, OK, this is awful, I feel like I may die. However, I won’t, because there is more of me than I ever imagined there could be ... What are you going to do? Get your face out of the dirt and try to feel the sun on it.” Duff, who shot to fame in the Channel 4 drama Shameless, declares that she refuses to believe “that there is a scarcity of love”, and picks a song called Love Letter, by Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds, as one of her stipulated eight tracks. She explains the song is “about that tipping point at which you fear you may lose love”. The closeness at the end of a relationship is unique, Duff believes. “This sounds ironic of course, but sometimes in a marriage you are never closer than the moment at which the two of you decide it’s time to finish. “There is such pure intimacy in that moment and honesty and truth and kindness in all its many versions. So I suppose I picked this song because it tells me, ‘Yeah, I can love and I can hurt. But I can love again.’” Duff also chooses Elvis Costello’s song Alison in memory of a late friend. “Grief is an interesting thing,” she says. “It comes when it wants. Gentle grieving of her is something I just carry with me.” Young asks the actor about the moment when, at the age of 25, she walked off the stage at the New Ambassadors Theatre in the middle of a performance as Nora in Ibsen’s play A Doll’s House. Her co-star, Paterson Joseph, had to persuade her back out in front of the audience. “I had proper stage fright,” Duff reveals. “I became very aware I was unhealthily pushing myself into the character’s noggin.” Duff chooses fine lingerie as her one sanctioned luxury for her desert island stay. • This article was amended on 10 March 2020 because an earlier version incorrectly referred to Duff’s performance in A Doll’s House at the National Theatre. That production was at the New Ambassadors’ Theatre."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/mar/25/joe-biden-violent-talk-ridiculous-donald-trump","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-25T06:00:47Z","webTitle":"Joe Biden is ridiculous in threatening to beat up people – even when it’s Donald Trump | Charlie Brinkhurst-Cuff","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/25/joe-biden-violent-talk-ridiculous-donald-trump","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/25/joe-biden-violent-talk-ridiculous-donald-trump","fields":{"headline":"Joe Biden is ridiculous in threatening to beat up people – even when it’s Donald Trump","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"The former US vice president Joe Biden, 75, has apologised for saying that he would have “beat the hell” out of Donald Trump in high school for disrespecting women. His words had prompted a furious response from the president, 71, who tweeted: “Crazy Joe Biden is trying to act like a tough guy. Actually, he is weak, both mentally and physically, and yet he threatens me, for the second time, with physical assault. He doesn’t know me, but he would go down fast and hard, crying all the way. Don’t threaten people Joe!” Trump has never been afraid to flaunt his supposed physical prowess. His first formal medical exam since taking office in January, reporting that the president was 6ft 3in tall and weighed 239lb, gained him immediate, unflattering comparisons with muscular athletes possessing the same statistics – whose six-packs were juxtaposed in pictures on social media next to Trump’s flabby stomach and ample booty. Still, his macho persona didn’t break. Just last year, he posted a video of himself wrestling the WWE star Vince McMahon with a CNN logo superimposed on to his head (taking on the “fake news” media). Even so, that it was Biden who initiated the aggression, even behind feminist reasoning, is a stark reminder that the chummiest of male politicians are concerned with power and dominance. Biden has been riding on his post-Obama “ultimate friendship goals” high for going on two years, and is also seen as a frontrunner for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination. His apology seems disingenuous considering it wasn’t the first time he has said that he would like to beat up Trump. Violent posturing is thankfully something usually absent from British politics, and if Biden wants to secure sensible voters (including feminists ), he’d do well to take a leaf out of our book and rein in the fighting talk. • Charlie Brinkhurst-Cuff is opinions editor at gal-dem.com"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/mar/25/we-cant-control-digital-giants-with-analogue-rules","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-25T06:06:44Z","webTitle":"Politicians can’t control the digital giants with rules drawn up for the analogue era | Andrew Rawnsley","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/25/we-cant-control-digital-giants-with-analogue-rules","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/25/we-cant-control-digital-giants-with-analogue-rules","fields":{"headline":"Politicians can’t control the digital giants with rules drawn up for the analogue era","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Matt Hancock, the ambitious minister with responsibility for digital, has won himself a few pixels of attention by saying that Facebook could be hit with a $1bn fine if it breaks the rules in future. That sounds like a big number to a British politician, but to a tech leviathan it is not even small change. Mark Zuckerberg will be more perturbed that $75bn has been wiped off the company’s market value since last Sunday. That was when the Observer published the latest instalment of Carole Cadwalladr’s outstanding investigation into Cambridge Analytica, which triggered the most reputationally damaging week for Facebook in its history. Yet even the punishment inflicted on the share price still leaves the market capitalisation of Mr Zuckerberg’s company north of $460bn. That buys you all of Coke and Pepsi with enough money to spare to have McDonald’s as well. Facebook is so richly priced because data has become the world’s most valuable resource. The “new oil”, one popular description, doesn’t do it justice. There are a lot of things in life that don’t require liquid hydrocarbon; fewer and fewer areas of human activity are not enmeshed in the data industry. This is also one of the world’s most concentrated resources with vast amounts of power in the maw of a small number of huge companies with a limitless appetite for continued expansion. Amazon is now into food distribution. Amazon and Apple have recently announced ambitions to get into healthcare as well. The political class has reacted to the stratospheric rise of the tech behemoths with the gawping stupefaction of a five-year-old strapped into the nose cone of a space rocket. Politicians have gnashed their teeth about the tech giants’ reluctance to pay tax, but flailed about trying to find a remedy. Politicians have wailed about extremist, harmful and illegal content on the internet, but hesitated to legislate and lamely implored the platforms to implement their own technical solution. The tech barons have largely been left to set their own rules. They have been allowed a degree of self-policing which society would never tolerate for car makers or drugs manufacturers. For the most part, I think this paralysis has been explained by sheer dazzlement – and, in some cases, infatuation – with the scale and reach of these companies. This has been combined with ignorance, among voters as well as their leaders, about how they actually work. Your average politician thought “getting digital” meant opening a Twitter account, not understanding the business models of those who exploit the surveillance economy. The furore surging around Facebook could be an inflection point. Retailers who are big spenders on online advertising are threatening to pull it and some of them might be serious. Surveys suggest that public trust in social media is plunging. Panting breathlessly as they try to catch up with technological change and evolving public opinion, the politicians are finally engaging with how these monopolistic companies mine and exploit our data to make their vast profits. In the United States, Republicans and Democrats alike are demanding that the platform bosses be brought to the Senate for interrogation. Let us hope that they will not be fobbed off with more of the vapid bromides about “doing better” that Mr Zuckerberg took four days to come up with when he finally emerged to say a few sorries. The European Union will shortly activate the General Data Protection Regulation. This will give users more power to opt out of being tracked online and to prevent their data being shared with third parties. That’s a start, but will likely prove inadequate. New rules will be only as effective as their enforcement. Invigilation is a particular weakness in Britain. Our parliament last passed substantial legislation on data protection 15 years ago. That is like trying to govern the airline industry with rules made for hot-air ballooning. Britain’s data protection regulator is the information commissioner. Her powers are so feeble that it took nearly a week to get her team through the front door of Cambridge Analytica. Let us just say that this is rather longer than it takes to press delete. The information commissioner and the electoral commission, both bodies set up for an entirely different technological landscape, are under-powered and under-resourced. There are rising and cross-party demands for a toughening up of the data protection bill now going through the Commons. One modest step would be to add criminal penalties for companies which fail to comply with disclosure orders. The knottiest problem with governing this space is what the internet is doing to democratic politics. It will be impossible to ever say definitively whether data manipulation tipped the results of the Brexit referendum and the American presidential election. What is easier to agree is that the internet has created a political ecosystem in which the extreme, the incendiary and the polarising tend to prevail over the considered, the rational and the consensus-seeking. The Massachusetts Institute of Technology recently published a study finding that falsehoods spread about six times faster than the truth on the internet and have a more lasting impact too. @realDonaldTrump is the first internet president. Christopher Wylie, the Cambridge Analytica whistleblower, told Cadwalladr how it harvested Facebook data on voters in order to “exploit what we knew about them and target their inner demons”. There are two issues here. The easier one concerns the use of data without consent. That simply shouldn’t be happening and the penalties ought to be severe. The harder issue concerns using data to micro-target voters and whether that ought to be permissible even if there is consent. Some say this is no more than the application of new methods to political communications. Hasn’t it always been the case that campaigns seek to identify who might support them and then press their buttons? At the 2015 British election, the Tories went after wobbly Lib Dem supporters by bombarding them with messages about the alleged perils of a hung parliament. At the 2017 election, Labour focused on younger voters with its offer to scrap tuition fees. Is the use of data mining to exploit the fears and hopes of individual voters with bespoke messaging just one step further along the spectrum? Or is this something qualitatively different? There is a persuasive case that this is a profound change to the political ecosystem with considerable potential to subvert the open debate which is critical to democracy. In the analogue political era, we could all read the promises a party put in its manifesto, we could all see the claims a party made on its roadside billboards, and we could all watch the attacks launched on an opponent in a TV broadcast. That made it possible to call out mendacities and expose contradictions and to hold those responsible to account. This didn’t prevent distortion and misinformation, but it was easier to spot and more risky to perpetrate. There is not the capacity to apply that invigilation if millions of individualised messages are being micro-targeted at voters on social media. Even less so when the propaganda is anonymised. Channel 4’s undercover filming of Cambridge Analytica executives exposed one of them boasting about how they could operate under the radar of the traditional rules of political accountability. “We just put information into the bloodstream of the internet and then watch it grow, give it a little push every now and again … And so this stuff infiltrates the online community and expands but with no branding – so it’s unattributable, untrackable.” What do we do about that? Politicians won’t agree to a blanket prohibition on campaigns collecting information about voters. The legislation going through parliament gives political parties special privileges to hold and process personal data. One thing that can be done is to demand that political propaganda declares its origins. The US Congress is discussing an Honest Ads Act. This would make it compulsory for online political advertisers to declare who paid for their output and how much they were spending. It wouldn’t stop lies being told, but it would force the liars to identify themselves. There is growing support for introducing something similar in Britain. Damian Collins, the Conservative chairman of theparliamentary select committee covering digital, tells me he’d back it. There are two responses to the vast power of big data and the abuses now being revealed. One is to bow before it on the grounds that these companies are too huge and the pace of change is too rapid for anything much to be done. That has been the fatalistic posture of too many politicians and citizens. The other responseis to stop cringeing and start making some robust rules. You don’t require an algorithm to make this choice for you. •Andrew Rawnsley is an Observer columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"us-news/2018/mar/24/washington-march-for-our-lives-gun-violence","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-25T08:48:06Z","webTitle":"March for Our Lives : thousands join anti-gun protests around the world","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/mar/24/washington-march-for-our-lives-gun-violence","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/mar/24/washington-march-for-our-lives-gun-violence","fields":{"headline":"March for Our Lives : thousands join anti-gun protests around the world","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Hundreds of thousands of students joined the pro-gun control March for Our Lives rallies across the US in one of the largest expressions of popular opposition in the modern era. Events have been taking place at more than 800 locations around the world – including London, Sydney, Tokyo, Mumbai, plus hundreds of places in the US. In Washington, as the number of young, diverse and impassioned protesters swelled along Pennsylvania Avenue, many carried signs reading “We are the change”, “No more silence” and “Keep NRA money out of politics”. Organizers said they hoped their protest would be one of the biggest in the capital since the Vietnam era, and it was clear they had been careful to create a diverse, inclusive group of speakers. Along with survivors from the attack in Parkland, Florida, who have galvanized the new push for gun reform, speakers included young victims of gun violence from around America. They sang, they chanted, and they challenged their parents’ generation to be effective in eliminating gun violence from society. Edna Chavez, 17, from Manual Arts high school in Los Angeles, took the stage with a raised fist and spoke powerfully about her brother, who was killed by gun violence. “I have learned to duck from bullets before I learned to read.” She led the crowd to chant his name, “Ricardo! Ricardo!” Trevon Bosley, a high school student from Chicago whose brother was killed, said: “I’m here to speak for those youth who fear they may be shot while going to the gas station, the movies, the bus stop, to church or even to and from school. I’m here to speak for those Chicago youth who feel their voices have been silenced for far too long.” Yolanda Renee King, granddaughter of Martin Luther King, told the crowd: “I have a dream that enough is enough. And that this should be a gun-free world, period.” She then asked the crowd to repeat back her words: “Spread the word, have you heard? All across the nation. We are going to be a great generation.” She led the chant three times, encouraging the crowd to repeat her words “so the whole world can hear”. Shortly before the end of the event, Parkland shooting survivor Emma Gonzalez – who had been a leading voice immediately after the attack on her school – took to the stage for six minutes and 20 seconds, much of that in silence. She said it was the amount of time it took a school shooter to kill 17 people at her school in Florida last month. As the students gathered, Donald Trump was whisked by motorcade to his West Palm Beach golf club. Trump later tweeted support for “the victims of the horrible attack in France yesterday” but did not mention the rallies on Twitter. A White House statement read: “We applaud the many courageous young Americans exercising their first amendment rights today. Keeping our children safe is a top priority of the president’s, which is why he urged Congress to pass the Fix NICS and STOP School Violence Acts, and signed them into law.” The administration also drew attention to some minor reforms the president has called for, including a move by the justice department on Friday to ban bump stocks, the accessory that allows rifles to mimic the rapid fire of automatic weapons. The NRA stayed silent on the student gatherings. But outside the FBI headquarters in Washington, about 30 gun-rights supporters staged a counter-demonstration in front of the FBI headquarters, standing quietly with signs such as “Armed victims live longer” and “Stop violating civil rights”. Veteran civil rights leader John Lewis said the protests reminded him of the early days of the civil rights era. “I think it’s amazing,” Lewis said. “They will be the leaders of the 21st century.” In one of the first speeches, the Marjory Stoneman Douglas senior Delaney Tarr told the crowd of the students’ demands, including background checks and a ban on assault weapons. “When you give us an inch, that bump stocks ban, we will take a mile,” she said. “We are not here for breadcrumbs, we are here to lead.” Earlier, the Guardian spoke to Cassie Pearce, 17, who had ridden in her school bus for 10 hours from Manchester, Vermont, with dozens of her classmates. Clutching a sign that read “I should be writing my college essay, not my will”, Pearce said: “I’m here because enough is enough. We have a right to be heard. We don’t want to be killed in school.” In a meeting with lawmakers in the aftermath of Parkland, the president had signalled support for stronger background checks on gun purchases and raising the minimum age for buying high-powered rifles. But the NRA staunchly opposed these measures and Trump appears to have abandoned the proposals. A group of student journalists from the Stoneman Douglas newspaper, the Eagle Eye, were invited to guest-edit the Guardian’s US website this weekend. Eleven students covered the rally in Washington, interviewing other survivors of gun violence from Stoneman Douglas and elsewhere. Parkland student Jordan Khayyami, 15, said: “I think that legislatures should be aware that the next generation of voters is right in front of them so if they don’t want to promote change then we will vote for change.” The scenes of thousands of students on the streets was overwhelming to many of the victims of gun violence who attended the Washington rally. “I did not expect this. I’m still astounded,” said Mark Barden, whose seven-year-old son Daniel was one of the 20 children murdered at Sandy Hook in 2012. “To me, it looks like our entire nation is finally on board.” Barden has spent five years pushing for stricter gun control laws, first with the support of Barack Obama’s White House, then continuing when gun control again dropped off the national agenda. While the day was focused on the youth, Sir Paul McCartney stood in solidarity with marchers in New York’s Central Park and referred to John Lennon’s fatal shooting outside his apartment building in 1980. “One of my best friends was killed by gun violence right around here, so it’s important to me not just to march today but to take action tomorrow and to have these people to have their voices heard,” he told CNN. There were, however, a number of counter-protests in some cities. AP reported that in Salt Lake City, Utah, about 500 pro-gun marchers walked to the state capitol building, though they were far outnumbered by an estimated 15,000 gun control marchers there. Thousands attend event at Parkland, Florida While classmates are rallying in Washington, thousands more Stoneman Douglas survivors, their families and supporters were among tens of thousands gathering in Parkland, Florida, the scene of last month’s shooting. More than 20,000 attended to listen to the speeches from the amphitheater at Pine Trails Park before walking the mile south to Stoneman Douglas high school. “Parkland is a family. And when our family is hurting, we all come together,” said Liam Kiernan, a 15-year-old Parkland 10th-grader. “We become stronger because we feel we’re all one person.” Max Schachter, the father of Alex, a 14-year-old Stoneman Douglas marching band musician, broke down in tears as he recalled how his son enjoyed playing basketball with his older brother and teaching his little sister “to become a better trombone player”. Schachter said that on 13 February he was like any other parent, wanting his children to be happy and get good grades. Then the Valentine’s Day shooting happened. “Since the day that changed my life, I will not stop fighting for change,” he said.

Lois Beckett spoke to some of those taking part. Sakeenah Dasti, 16, Amanah Dasti, 11 and Ruqaiyah Dasti, 17, from Gaithersburg, Maryland “We haven’t forgotten what happened in Sandy Hook and Columbine and Virginia Tech. Those things happened a long time ago, and people tried putting them in the back of their minds, but we’re showing here that we haven’t forgotten about any of that,” said Ruqaiyah. The shooting that first affected her directly was Sandy Hook, she said. “I was very young,” she said. “I was nervous, I didn’t really understand what it was about. I remember being afraid.” For Amanah, it was “when it happened here”. There was a school shooting nearby in Marylandlast week. Steve Craig, 64 and Maddie Craig, 21, New Castle, Pennsylvania The father and daughter came to Washington to show their support for the Parkland students, and to advocate for a ban on assault weapons. “I think the second amendment needs to be repealed and amended. I don’t think the right to own a gun should be unlimited,” Steve Craig said. Maddie Craig said she thought social media had changed the gun control debate, allowing students to speak directly to each other and share their experiences. “For Columbine, there wasn’t that social media presence.” Now, she said, “you can hear every student’s opinion. There’s a lot more awareness of what’s going on across America.” Alice Gambino, 42, Silver Spring, Maryland Gambino’s two sons, 15 and eight, were too afraid to come to the rally, worried that the large crowds would attract “gun crazies” and that there might be another act of violence. “You don’t have to go. I’ll go for you,” she told them. Gambino said this was her first protest for gun control. “I think I was waiting for someone else to do something,” she said. “Seeing that the kids in the last attack had to rally themselves, I felt very guilty. We the parents should have already been in the streets and we shouldn’t have left until we made the change for them.” Jasmine Meelock, 17, and Kaeleigh Wedin, 16, Great Mills, Maryland Meelock and Wedin came to the March for Our Lives just four days after a shooting at their high school in southern Maryland, which left one of their classmates killed, one injured, and a third, the shooter, dead after a confrontation with a school police officer. The two teenagers had hidden in their classrooms during the shooting, listening to the principal call over the loudspeaker to exit the halls. “It was a little bit scary at first when the police officers came into our classrooms. They had guns. It was really chaos. They kicked down the door. It was really loud. A lot of us hadn’t seen guns before,” Meelock said. “I was close to it,” said Wedin. “We went on lockdown, we were all waiting to know if we were going to be OK. If there was a threat to us. We were all planning what we were going to do if we had to get out the window.” The shooter had posted on social media and in private messages before the shooting that he was depressed and had guns, they said. Ayana Trottier, 17, Turtle Mountain reservation, North Dakota Trottier had traveled as part of a group from from the Turtle Mountain Indian reservation in North Dakota near the Canadian border. Her school’s student council had organized the trip to show their support for Parkland students, and in reaction to the series of threats their school and town had faced in recent weeks. It was the teenagers’ first march. Trottier and the other young women wore ceremonial ribbon skirts to show the importance of the march. “They’re very sacred,” she said. “We want our voices to be heard,” she said. “As minorities we understand feeling speechless or not being heard.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/blog/2018/mar/29/classic-youtube-ball-tampering-lee-dixon-and-easter-bunnies","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-29T09:00:10Z","webTitle":"Classic YouTube: Ball tampering, Lee Dixon and Easter bunnies","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2018/mar/29/classic-youtube-ball-tampering-lee-dixon-and-easter-bunnies","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/blog/2018/mar/29/classic-youtube-ball-tampering-lee-dixon-and-easter-bunnies","fields":{"headline":"Classic YouTube: Ball tampering, Lee Dixon and Easter bunnies","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"1) The Australians are not the first team to tamper with the ball; there is a long, rich history of it in cricket.

For me, the story of Cambridge Analytica and Facebook that has unfolded so spectacularly this past week began in a cafe in Holloway, north London, at the beginning of 2017. I was having a coffee with my colleague Carole Cadwalladr. She had recently written a series of articles that set out how certain Google search terms had been “hijacked by the alt-right”. In the course of that investigation she explained how she had come across another pattern of activity apparently linking the Trump and Leave.EU campaigns, one that appeared to involve the billionaire Robert Mercer, Steve Bannon – then of Breitbart – and a secretive British company called Cambridge Analytica. She laid out the elements of what she knew, and what she didn’t, testing her conviction that “there’s definitely something there”. In the year and more since, Carole has painstakingly pieced together that story from its disparate and determinedly obstructive elements. She has done this in the face of much scepticism, a series of legal challenges and several attempts at intimidation (last summer the Leave.EU campaign posted a photoshopped video of her being beaten up and circulated it for days). Last weekend, however, the “something there” that Carole had intuited about the story, and its full implications for our democracy, came into proper focus. The trajectory of what happened since is a case study in how complex truths stubbornly pieced together can eventually capture the wider imagination. The first act in this drama was a legal challenge by Facebook, an attempt to suppress Carole’s interview with the Cambridge Analytica whistleblower Christopher Wylie the day before it appeared. They must have known a little of what was coming. The Observer had made the decision to share the revelations with the New York Times and with Channel 4 News, to pool resources and broaden its reach. Even so, on Sunday morning some experienced commentators initially just shrugged. On his sofa, Andrew Marr felt he could pretty much ignore the story, dismissing it as “too complicated” to merit much attention. JK Rowling, meanwhile, suggested in a tweet that it was “surely the story of the year, if not the decade”. In the days that followed, the latter reaction has seemed closer to the mark. This was partly down to one of the more memorable pieces of journalistic theatre. Rarely, in real time, can hypocrisy have been exposed so pointedly as on Monday night’s Channel 4 News. That afternoon, Alexander Nix, the self-possessed Etonian chief executive of Cambridge Analytica, had been plaintively professing his company’s rectitude to the BBC, and suggesting that he was the victim of a co-ordinated smear campaign. That evening, he and his managing director, Mark Turnbull, were shown explaining to undercover Channel 4 reporters exactly how they had manipulated the voters of democracies across the globe, notably in the US, with unsourced propaganda that was not necessarily true; and boasting of sting operations and honey traps In a way, that was only the warm-up act of the story. Nix’s unwitting confessions were in marked contrast to the silence from Facebook’s chief executive Mark Zuckerberg. All anyone knew of Facebook’s response on Monday was that it had a swat team of data analysts working overnight at Cambridge Analytica’s offices – though that same data remained out of bounds for the government’s information commissioner, Elizabeth Denham, who was trying in vain to get a warrant to access files before they were potentially compromised. Zuckerberg declined to face his own employees at a meeting on Tuesday, while again a press statement from his PR team suggested that “the entire company is outraged we were deceived”. The continued silence seemed to tell another story, however, not least to Wall Street; in those two days nearly $60bn was wiped off the Facebook market capitalisation, and #whereszuck became a top-trending social media meme. As the silence persisted, a little of Zuckerberg’s public relations dilemma became clear. The original legal threat to the Observer was over the question of whether the 50 million profiles handed first to the Cambridge academic Aleksandr Kogan and then sold on to Cambridge Analytica constituted a data breach. Facebook insisted that it did not, but that insistence itself amounted to a public acknowledgement of a business model that appeared to allow the unauthorised sale of private data. When Zuckerberg did eventually come out to try to explain this, his crafted statement was another effort to make the exploitation of the 50 million profiles seem like a technical problem, a glitch. His tone was the default position of T-shirted Silicon Valley plutocrats who insist that they are on our side, while squirrelling away their billions. What had happened was not a data breach “but a breach of trust”, he suggested, a sentiment he repeats in a personal advertisement in today’s newspapers, including the Observer. This appeal to Facebook users’ faith in its better nature recalled an infamous recorded exchange from the early days of Facebook at Harvard, when Zuckerberg was in conversation with a friend. Zuck: “Yeah so if you ever need info about anyone at Harvard, just ask. I have over 4,000 emails, pictures, addresses, SNS.” Friend: “What? How’d you manage that one?” Zuck: “People just submitted it. I don’t know why. They ‘trust me’. Dumb fucks!” People closest to the beneficiaries of Cambridge Analytica’s work have been quickest to suggest that it was negligible. Though Cambridge Analytica’s own claims suggest that its tens of thousands of propaganda items were viewed billions of times, Steve Bannon suggested the effect was insignificant: people have minds of their own and are not swayed by what they see and hear on the internet, the argument goes. To counter this, you don’t really have to point out that we live in a world where a significant percentage of people now believe that the Sandy Hook massacre was a hoax perpetrated by actors, or that sharia law is about to take hold in the home counties, you just have to point to the history of advertising. Propaganda works best, as Cambridge Analytica’s Mark Turnbull helpfully pointed out to camera, when you do not know its source. He excitedly detailed the way in which extremist views and fake news could be “seeded” in the bloodstream of social media and then take hold. Facebook in particular has, in this respect, delivered what propagandists have always wanted, a complete blurring of the line – still sacrosanct in traditional media – between editorial and advertising, often delivered with the added reliability of having been “shared” by a “friend”. As David Kirkpatrick, Facebook’s authorised biographer, noted, one characteristic of the first eight years of the company was a tendency for Zuckerberg and his inner circle to sit around and try to establish exactly what business they were in. Early on, Zuckerberg liked to refer to his creation as “a directory of people” in these discussions; later he came to focus on “connectivity”. A more cynical response to that question has always been that they were in the advertising business, but as the writer John Lanchester pointed out, even that doesn’t really get to the truth. “Even more than it is in the advertising business, Facebook is in the surveillance business.” It is designed to watch our every move, our every like and dislike, and sell those findings to the highest bidder. For the majority of the 2.1 billion users of Facebook up until now, that has seemed like a price worth paying, in order to connect with friends and family. The wisdom promoted by the tech companies to their users is that privacy is only for those with something to hide. What the Cambridge Analytica story has begun to reveal about those companies’ use of our intimate history of likes and dislikes, of private messages and personal photos, is that they cannot only be used to target us with holidays and theatre tickets, but also to shape our news of the world, and our political ideas, in ways we don’t recognise. That understanding has, it seems, now reached something of a tipping point. Immediate ramifications of the exposé will see the prime movers in this story called to clarify previous statements to government committees on both sides of the Atlantic. Beyond that, last week may prove an important step in a long reckoning over whether monopolistic global corporations are best trusted with so much marketable personal data to exploit for personal gain. The great rupture of the industrial revolution led eventually to the growth of trade unions and a new balance of power between capital and producer. The sheer pace of change of the digital revolution in our century has meant that the equivalent rebalancing is critically overdue. Last week even the Economist was persuaded of the need for Facebook in particular to make radical changes to its data practices, or for governments to call time on its model. “If Facebook ends up as a regulated utility with its returns on capital capped, its earnings may drop by 80%. How would you like that, Mr Zuckerberg?” When faced with the often anonymised global entity of the internet, it has been easy to buy the argument that the forces at work in it are too opaque and complex to hold to account. What the Cambridge Analytica revelations bring to light – through old-fashioned journalistic persistence – is that those forces are, in fact, open to the same kinds of manipulation and corruption that any media needs protection from, but on a far greater scale. The story has given the growing unease about the unaccountable empire-building of Silicon Valley tech companies an all-too-human set of faces. It may not be a pretty sight, but it is not one that will be easily forgotten. The Observer’s story last week on the use of Facebook data by Cambridge Analytica sparked a worldwide response: “This is a serious moment for the web’s future. But I want us to remain hopeful.” Tim Berners-Lee, world wide web inventor “[Facebook] has been misleading in its evidence to a British parliamentarycommittee, arrogant in its instinct to shirk the responsibilities that come with power.” The Times “It is absolutely right the information commissioner is investigating … we expect all the organisations involved to cooperate…” Brian Acton, WhatsApp “We have a responsibility to protect your data, and if we can’t then we don’t deserve to serve you … We also made mistakes.” Mark Zuckerberg What is disturbing is that Facebook has not yet identified and alerted users whose profile information was vacuumed up New York Times There are a number of inconsistencies in your evidence...

They claim the order is “impossible” to fulfil because so many hospitals are struggling to fill medical rotas because of widespread shortages of doctors, which are as high as 25% in some places. The instruction came earlier this month in a letter to the chief executives and medical directors of hospitals in England from the regulators NHS England and NHS Improvement. It made clear that in a bid to cut the number of patients using beds unnecessarily, hospitals must “ensure every patient has a review at the start and end of the day by a senior clinician to facilitate discharge”. “This is totally ridiculous – another example of hospitals being asked to do the impossible by the unreasonable,” one NHS trust chief executive, who asked not to be named, told the Observer. Another warned that getting doctors to review all patients twice daily would leave them with too few medics to staff operations and lead to longer waits for non-urgent procedures. “It is not doable. It’s another pie in the sky. There just isn’t the clinical workforce to do this without affecting other services and pushing out waiting times which we are also required to meet. Just another request for the impossible,” the chief executive said. The letter, sent on 9 March, also tells hospitals to ensure that they “boost essential services such as diagnostics and pharmacy at the weekends to maximise non-elective patient flow”. Saffron Cordery, deputy chief executive of NHS Providers, which represents trusts, urged NHS chiefs to “not to pretend” that hospitals, which have come under unprecedented strain in recent weeks, could do everything they wanted to improve patient care. “There is simply not enough capacity to deliver optimum care all the time, particularly when demand is as high as it currently is. We should not pretend otherwise,” she said. “Requirements cannot be consistently delivered all the time, particularly when some trusts are running medical vacancy rates of 25%.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/mar/25/billie-jd-porter-vice-dark-side-sexual-harassment","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-25T06:00:47Z","webTitle":"Billie JD Porter revealed the dark side of cool and edgy workplaces | Charlie Brinkhurst-Cuff","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/25/billie-jd-porter-vice-dark-side-sexual-harassment","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/25/billie-jd-porter-vice-dark-side-sexual-harassment","fields":{"headline":"Billie JD Porter revealed the dark side of cool and edgy workplaces","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Vice, the culture magazine and media empire, made its name by publishing irreverent content on sex, drugs and subcultures that rarely made the mainstream press. It has continued that trend up until the present day, with other publishers scrambling to keep up. But since October, when #MeToo upset the patriarchal balance by careering through dozens of industries in a hurricane-like whirl, the Vice empire has also been under scrutiny, settling four claims of sexual harassment or defamation and receiving dozens more allegations – including from the documentary maker Billie JD Porter. For many years, JD Porter was a Vice star, a precocious, prodigious on and off-screen talent. But in an Instagram post in January she claimed she had been given drugs and alcohol in the Vice UK offices as a 16-year-old and asked to perform sex acts on one of her male bosses. Her Vice business cards even read “Lolita Life Ruiner”. In an interview last week with Channel 4 News, she made the point that for her, the aftermath of the incidents of inappropriate behaviour has actually been worse than the incidents themselves. “It’s been painful for both men and women to look back at their past and realise that certain situations were much darker than how they appeared at the time,” she said. The depths of her feelings were further revealed in an earlier article: “In saying out loud the multiple ways I was taken advantage of by men twice my age, who I trusted completely, the abuse has become a lot more real, and triggered a huge amount of stress and anxiety in me.” I’ve seen how the HR processes work (or do not work) at similarly edgy publications when something is amiss. (As I tweeted during the height of the #MeToo movement, I was once asked to do a topless photoshoot as an intern at a magazine, which I reported to HR on leaving and didn’t hear anything back on.) So I empathise with JD Porter when she sets out her allegations and distress about how she feels Vice has failed to handle its investigation with any tact. #MeToo has revealed how many women have been exposed to the insensitive way victims are treated. Although, as the #MeToo founder Tarana Burke said in an interview with the Guardian: “We need a shift in culture so that every single instance of sexual harassment is investigated and dealt with.” What’s more, across the board it seems that the processes in these investigations desperately need to change. Apart from anything else, a key consideration should be just how awful it can be to force yourself to recognise a situation in which you have been wronged. Meanwhile, we should no longer be surprised – if we ever were – that supposedly cool, edgy publications that publish feminist content might foster a heinous undergrowth of sexual harassment. • Charlie Brinkhurst-Cuff is opinions editor at gal-dem.com"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"technology/2018/mar/25/driverless-cars-autonomous-vehicles-science-technology-tapper","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-25T00:05:37Z","webTitle":"Being a driverless car passenger proves ‘unsettling and extraordinary’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/mar/25/driverless-cars-autonomous-vehicles-science-technology-tapper","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2018/mar/25/driverless-cars-autonomous-vehicles-science-technology-tapper","fields":{"headline":"Being a driverless car passenger proves ‘unsettling and extraordinary’","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"How many people does it take to drive a driverless car? Five: a safety driver behind the wheel, an operator to program the route, and three engineers monitoring it in another car behind. It is, to be fair, barely even a prototype. The autonomous car unveiled in Milton Keynes last week is bleeding-edge engineering, Britain’s entry in a global race to get the first driverless car on the road. The converted Range Rover Sport can steer itself, speed up and slow down, stop at red lights and move off when they turn green. It can even cope with roundabouts, a fundamental skill in Milton Keynes. The five operators are there to examine every nuance of the car’s reaction to the ever-changing road conditions – cyclists, pedestrians and other drivers, and the weather, to name a few. The public demonstration of the car by UK Autodrive, a consortium led by engineering company Arup, supported by Jaguar Land Rover, Ford and Tata Motors, should have been a celebratory milestone for British motor manufacturing. Yet growing excitement about self-driving cars was shattered by the death of Elaine Herzberg in Tempe, Arizona, last week. She was hit by an autonomous Uber that did not apparently detect the 49-year-old when she wheeled her bicycle across the road at night. “It’s dreadful,” says Tim Armitage, the project director for UK Autodrive. “It’s dreadful for the person involved – everyone involved. And it shows just how important it is to make sure that what we are demonstrating today is safe and that we don’t oversell the technology.” UK Autodrive’s engineering efforts are focused on safety, but that is not the only concern. The government has invested £250m into several major research projects, involving at least 1,000 people, Armitage estimates. By 2035 the Department for Transport expects the industry to be worth £50bn to the economy – about a third of all UK manufacturing, although the current motor industry contributes about £58bn. Still, there’s a lot riding on the success of self-driving cars. The government strategy for getting there is all about research. By dangling substantial grants, it has managed to corral car companies, universities and other interests into working together – a contrast to the US, for example, where Uber, Google’s Waymo and Toyota are entirely competitive. In the UK there are 15 government-sponsored projects led by four major consortiums like UK Autodrive which are coming at the problem from different angles – predicting the behaviour of other drivers, cyclists and pedestrians, understanding the needs of elderly or disabled drivers, and the challenges of motorways. All the research returns to the same theme: how to make roads safe while allowing people to travel where they need to. As with any technology, there are glitches. On the demonstration drive in Milton Keynes, we have a near-miss when the car lurches forward at a junction in the car park. The safety driver, Jim O’Donoghue, saves us from an impending collision with a parked car by grabbing the wheel. Afterwards he’s not quite sure if he realised the car was going wrong or if it warned him it couldn’t cope. “I’ve been driving it for several weeks, so I’m really tuned in to it,” he says, underlining the unconscious, near-visceral familiarity that people have with technology they use regularly. Driver behaviour and human-machine interaction are all important elements of the research. Being a passenger in this Range Rover is like being driven by a clumsy taxi driver. Acceleration feels aggressive – from the traffic lights, it’s foot-to-the-floor until we hit 30 miles per hour. Braking starts rather later than I would like. Once up to speed, it drives extraordinarily close to the kerb. The side sensors can judge the distance much more precisely than a human. It all adds up to an unsettling experience that feels entirely unlike riding any other vehicle. But the car, it must be emphasised, is still being built – sensors and controls are adjusted on a daily basis. These cars are the most eye-catching part of the research, with the aim to design a vehicle that can cope with any situation more safely than a human driver. The other, more immediate focus is on connected cars – using mobile phone technology to allow every vehicle on the road to talk to each other. Another demonstration shows how drivers in standard cars can be given information, such as whether cars in traffic ahead are braking sharply, or if an ambulance is approaching. Possibly the most compelling project is on finding parking spaces. Cars with visual sensors can detect parking spaces and share the information with a network of connected cars, and inform the driver where the closest spot is. “About 30% of traffic is people driving round looking for parking spaces,” Armitage says. “In the future we might need far less car parking. Imagine what you could do with the space.” The research invites questions that are much more fundamental than simply how to build a safe, self-driving car to replicate the UK’s fleet of driver-owned internal combustion vehicles. Instead of owning or leasing one vehicle for all your needs, people could access different types of vehicle for different journey. Another fundamental question is how much UK roads might change to enable self-driving cars to work more effectively. Cars could connect with each other, but also with road furniture like traffic lights, prompting drivers to slow down ahead of red lights. The growing infrastructure around electric cars shows how quickly this could happen. Arup laid electric cables and charging infrastructure in Milton Keynes when the council decided it would try to become the centre of electric cars in the UK. “When they first arrived, there were complaints from drivers of internal combustion engine cars that too many parking spaces were given over to charging points. Now they’re all full.” One of the projects closest to completion involves self-driving pods. The Gateway consortium in Greenwich peninsula, London, has been operating four driverless pods in pedestrian areas, examining how members of the public react. There are similar pods in Milton Keynes.“We’re hoping that will be ready before the end of the year,” Armitage says. “Singapore is very interested in what we’re doing., “They want autonomous buses because they can’t recruit enough drivers.” It’s a potential export opportunity that would establish the UK’s self-driving credentials on the world stage. So while this Range Rover may not be fit to drive unsupervised yet, we are likely to see more autonomous vehicles operating very soon."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2018/mar/24/beleave-cambridge-analytica-brexit-boris-gove","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-24T18:14:15Z","webTitle":"Why young, inexperienced BeLeavers were perfect for the Brexit campaign","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/mar/24/beleave-cambridge-analytica-brexit-boris-gove","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/mar/24/beleave-cambridge-analytica-brexit-boris-gove","fields":{"headline":"Why young, inexperienced BeLeavers were perfect for the Brexit campaign","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"The handful of teens and twenty-somethings who made up BeLeave seemed an unlikely group to attract the attention of Britain’s most powerful Brexiters, but long before they got a large, controversial donation from Vote Leave they had made their way to the heart of the official campaign. All politically inexperienced volunteers, they were welcomed into the team backed by Michael Gove and Boris Johnson, mostly because of the demographic they promised to reach. It was Darren Grimes, then a 23-year-old fashion student from County Durham, who set up the youth group. A Liberal Democrat member with a talent for graphic design and social media marketing, he had an approach that was rare among the groups campaigning for Brexit. BeLeave messages targeted a group generally inclined towards Remain – young, diverse and progressive voters – who the senior campaigners at the official Vote Leave campaign thought would be both hard to win over and critical to any victory. “Vote Leave understood that they couldn’t win the referendum if they specifically targeted angry Ukippers. They knew that they needed to target young liberals,” said the group’s treasurer turned whistleblower Shahmir Sanni. “They needed to target Green party members that didn’t like the EU’s environmental laws, or liberal Eurosceptics like me that did hold fiscally conservative values but were socially liberal and understood the EU didn’t support everyone, that it only benefited Europeans.” When Sanni joined the BeLeave team, it had already become extraordinarily successful in appealing to liberal and leftwing supporters on Facebook and other social media, using videos and other messaging that often appeared to be the exact opposite of the largest Vote Leave and LeaveEU campaigns. Instead of bleak scaremongering about immigration, most notoriously Nigel Farage’s “Breaking Point” poster, their adverts were pro-migration, feminist and witty. One campaign questioned why holders of EU passports could come freely to the UK while Commonwealth citizens could not. Others attacked the EU for policies it claimed “have driven African farmers into poverty”, and made it impossible for Britain to abolish the “tampon tax”. A fourth warned that EU penalties could make Netflix streaming more expensive. Their positions stood out, even amid the patchwork of pro-Brexit groups, and Vote Leave realised BeLeave could prove useful as it battled for designation as the official campaign against the Arron Banks- and Farage-backed Leave.EU. Needing to show a broad spectrum of support, it listed the youth group in its application, among a range of independent “outreach groups” claimed to be backing Vote Leave. Yet at the time BeLeave worked out of Vote Leave headquarters, under its guidance and support. Although it had its own website, it appears to have been co-ordinated and paid for by the Vote Leave head of outreach Cleo Watson. “You deserve a brilliant site and this is so annoying,” Watson, now a political adviser to the prime minister, wrote to Grimes when development of the group’s site hit a glitch. “Will troubleshoot this asap.” Watson said: “I absolutely deny the claims being levelled against me, including the allegation that I co-ordinated and paid for the BeLeave website”. She added: “To imply being supportive of their work was to have any kind of control over their activities is absolutely untrue and deliberately misleading.” But in the final weeks before the referendum, as Vote Leave neared its spending limit of £7m, senior directors suggested to BeLeave that, if they set up as a separate campaign, they would receive a donation to spend on their own advertisements. Preparing for meetings with prospective donors – and unaware that they were working beside the people who were planning to support them – the team drew up a pitch for funds. Even their highest hopes were well below the eventual donation. “On our proposal we wrote £10,000 would get you this much engagement on Facebook, and if you gave us £100,000 this is how much engagement we’d get,” Sanni said. “We were putting it there just in case.” They pointed out that their Facebook posts were engaging more people – to share, comment or like – than most paid advertisements by political campaigns. One video reached 41,000 people in one day without any paid promotion. “With funding, we could triple this amount,” their pitch said. Shortly afterwards Vote Leave drew up legal documents allowing BeLeave to create a bank account so that it could accept donations of its own. “Following our discussion I attach a typed-up first draft of the constitution,” Vote Leave’s legal director said in an email to Grimes in May, with Watson copied in. He told Sanni, BeLeave’s secretary and treasurer, to set up a bank account. Then Vote Leave revealed to the astonished young team that they would be getting a donation of more than £600,000. “To be at that age and to find out that my organisation, that the work that I’ve done, has received funding of almost £1m, I was elated,” Sanni said. “It was amazing.” The donation never made it into the bank account. The money would be passed directly to AggregateIQ – Vote Leave’s data analytics firm – in its name, without ever coming under even nominal control of BeLeave. “The first thing I said to Darren was, ‘Well, OK, can I get my train tickets paid for?’,” remembers Sanni. But Grimes made clear that he had no control over even small amounts. The BeLeave team were allegedly not warned of potential implications. “If I am being advised by ... a compliance lawyer for Vote Leave, I have no reason to think anything is wrong,” Sanni said. Vote Leave has denied any suggestion it co-ordinated with BeLeave. When the size of the donation drew scrutiny from the Electoral Commission, Grimes said he found AIQ on the internet and was so impressed he decided to blow his budget on its marketing. But cached data shows that, at the time, AIQ did not have a website. AIQ says it had a website since it was founded in 2013. Grimes knew about the firm because of its work with Vote Leave, whose director and other employees sat at desks near his own in the campaign HQ, where BeLeave’s work, whether in messaging or as a conduit for funds, was highly appreciated. “Everyone knew who Darren was,” Sanni says. “Everybody congratulated us and knew what role we’d played. He knew exactly how important we’d been. He’s a close friend of Dom Cummings [the Vote Leave strategist]. Of course he knew. Boris Johnson knew. Everybody knew.” Grimes denied to the Observer that there was any collaboration with Vote Leave on campaign material or spending."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2018/mar/24/trump-white-house-transgender-military","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-24T17:43:08Z","webTitle":"Rights groups vow to fight Trump's 'transphobia masquerading as policy'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/mar/24/trump-white-house-transgender-military","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/mar/24/trump-white-house-transgender-military","fields":{"headline":"Rights groups vow to fight Trump's 'transphobia masquerading as policy'","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"After Donald Trump’s order late on Friday supporting a ban on transgender troops except under “limited circumstances”, gender rights groups said they would “vigorously defend” existing legal injunctions on the implementation of the exclusionary measures. Jennifer Levi, the Glad transgender rights project director, told the Guardian: “It’s extremely disappointing to see these gross misstatements about transgender people’s ability to serve, particularly given the thousands of people who have been serving for decades, including in high positions of responsibility.” On Friday, the White House said retaining troops with a history or diagnosis of “gender dysphoria” – wanting to transition gender – “presents considerable risk to military effectiveness and lethality”. The ban, a modification of Trump’s full ban issued last summer in a tweet, disqualifies US troops who have had gender reassignment surgery. But it allows current transgender service members who have not undergone reassignment surgery to remain, as long as they have been medically stable for 36 consecutive months in their biological sex before joining the military and as long as they are able to deploy across the world. The defense secretary, Jim Mattis, also recommended that anyone diagnosed with gender dysphoria since the Obama administration ended the Pentagon’s longtime ban on transgender service in 2016 may continue to serve. However, enlisted men and women who have not already been approved to transition gender would still face exclusion. In a memo released on Friday, Mattis argued that “men and women who serve voluntarily accept limitations on their personal liberties – freedom of speech, political activity, freedom of movement – in order to provide the military lethality and readiness necessary to ensure American citizens enjoy their personal freedoms to the fullest extent.” At least four cases challenging the ban are working their way through the courts. Glad’s Levi said the Trump administration’s order would not affect the group’s legal strategy to block the ban through the courts from moving forward. She said: “We knew that this implementation plan was going to be announced, and we will continue to defend the cases. It’s the same ban we’ve been challenging and we will continue to challenge.” Other rights groups also condemned the policy, which reverses Obama’s 2016 order. “What the White House has released tonight is transphobia masquerading as policy. This policy is not based on an evaluation of new evidence,” Joshua Block, a senior staff attorney at the American Civil Liberties Union’s LGBT and HIV Project, said in a statement. “It is reverse-engineered for the sole purpose of carrying out Trump’s reckless and unconstitutional ban, undermining the ability of transgender service members to serve openly and military readiness as a whole.” Other groups, including the American Military Partner Association, also criticized the measures. “This administration chose to announce this policy late on a Friday night, under cover of darkness, because they are embarrassed by it, and they should be,” David Stacy, director of government affairs at the Human Rights Campaign, told the Military Times. “We have 15,000 or more transgender troops and their families who are going to wake up tomorrow with their lives in chaos.” Nancy Pelosi, the House Democratic leader, said: “This latest memorandum is the same cowardly, disgusting ban the president announced last summer. No one with the strength and bravery to serve in the US military should be turned away because of who they are.” Bu the policy changes have divided active-duty troops. According to a Military Times poll, 53% said they supported Trump’s comments last summer stating the military should not “accept or allow transgender individuals to serve in any capacity” because the services “cannot be burdened with the tremendous medical costs and disruption”. More than one in three troops surveyed – 38% – said they strongly approve of Trump’s stance. But 35% of troops surveyed disapproved of the comments, 24% strongly."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/mar/25/left-liberal-capitalism-globalisation-poverty","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-25T00:05:38Z","webTitle":"Global capitalism is the left’s problem | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/25/left-liberal-capitalism-globalisation-poverty","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/25/left-liberal-capitalism-globalisation-poverty","fields":{"headline":"Letters: global capitalism is the left’s problem","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Andrew Rawnsley is saddened by the decline of the “centre left” and the rise of the “nationalist right”, but suggests that the terms “left” and “right” may no longer be relevant (“Corbyn’s cross-eyed attitude to wards the Kremlin doesn’t inspire confidence”, Comment, 18 March). I agree that the traditional terms here are inappropriate. The term “left” now seems to imply support for the ideology of green, liberal, global capitalism. The term “right” now denotes nationalistic capitalism, with resistance to the global capitalist plans for free movement of commodities and labour. The qualifications “green” and “liberal” before the term “global capitalism”, may sound appealing. However, global capitalism, whatever the qualifications, still means an ideology dedicated to the insanity of perpetual growth in a finite world for the enrichment of ever fewer ultra-rich people. It also stands for a homogenisation of the world in the interest of maximising the wealth of a tiny global elite. However, in a homogenous world of open borders, the extreme poverty that used to be confined to the third world will come to haunt poorer people in richer countries. If this vision is labelled “left”, no wonder poorer people in richer countries are turning “right”. Rawnsley also states that “heavy-metal socialism of a super-statist society” is not appealing. Yet some version of socialism or eco-socialism might make “left” ideas appealing if things were not so confused by the misuse of the term “left” for globalism and its end destination of globalised poverty. David Kault Townsville, Australia As Andrew Rawnsley points out, Jeremy Corbyn’s history provides plenty of scope for cynicism regarding his posture towards Russia, the previous Soviet Union and Vladimir Putin. However, that is not to say that his reaction to the nerve agent attack in Britain was inevitably flawed. It may well be that evidence will emerge that the Russian state was responsible. If and when it does is the time for reprisal. The fact remains that when Theresa May made her accusation, no such evidence had been provided. In jumping to this conclusion, our government has given Moscow the opportunity to accuse it of a prejudice which Russia has been only too eager to condemn. Michael Benoy Cranleigh, Surrey I could not disagree more strongly with Andrew Rawnsley. Over recent decades, many of us have become thoroughly wearied by the frequency with which politicians and journalists employ pseudo-Churchillian, jingoistic bombast when faced with complex and difficult foreign policy and security issues. Thatcher with the Falklands, Blair with Iraq and Cameron with Libya all resorted to overblown rhetoric where measured diplomacy would surely have achieved more. The fatuousness of the language would matter less if it were not that such language is so often the prelude to suffering and death. John Harries Reading The power of yes I greatly enjoyed William Leith’s article on the power of “no” (The Observer Magazine, 18 March), but I couldn’t endorse his decision on the example he gave for the following reasons. There will come a point when Mr Leith’s friends are gone or he himself is too infirm to get out to see them. Then he will wish he had gone to parties when he still could. It’s a week-long party, for heaven’s sake. Surely he could write for three or four days, spurred on to greater focus and diligence by the prospect of going to the party for the last few days? The most important reason of all: Mick wants him – his friend, after all – to participate in celebrating a big birthday. Can he really bear to disappoint Mick when he doesn’t strictly need to? Go, go, go! Verity Ridgman London Old-school education I read with interest your article concerning the headmaster in Charles Dickens’s Nicholas Nickleby (“Suspect emerges as the model for Wackford Squeers”, News, 18 March). As Dickens states, Squeers was representative of his class, as even the small village of Bowes possessed four schools at the time of Dickens’s research, each with a Wackford Squeers headmaster. Nicholas Nickleby was a campaigning novel highlighting the brutality of these schools to an ignorant or compliant society, which ultimately resulted in the schools’ demise. Today, Dotheboys Hall is filled with children being children, innocent fun and mischief, blissfully ignorant of Dotheboys’ past. The parallels between Nicholas Nickleby and modern-day campaigning journalism should not be lost. Sean Webb Dotheboys Hall Bowes, Co Durham Co-operative Finns I was intrigued by your comment (“Finland’s story shows equality is a better route to happiness than rapid growth”, Business leader, 18 March): “All these areas of Finnish life exemplify a co-operative spirit.” Unfortunately, the article failed to elaborate on that and the fact that Finland, along with most other Nordic countries, has a very strong co-operative business sector. Over 20% of Finland’s GDP comes from co-operative enterprise. Business journalists rarely report on the enormous size and scale of global co-operative enterprise and the progressive influence of its values-based business model. As neo-liberalism becomes more and more discredited, co-operatives and mutuals are being increasingly seen as the way forward. The Observer should look a bit more closely at Finland and most other top 10 countries in the Happiness Index, and examine the real nature and impact of their “co-operative spirit”. Dr Iain Macdonald International co-operative consultant Cranleigh, Surrey Poor show from diners I read the cri de coeur from Jackson Boxer (“We restaurateurs are all hopeless optimists”, Focus, 18 March) and was astounded by the fact that 36% of people who had booked tables for Mother’s Day did not show up. I would suggest that deposits should be taken to offset the considerable expense laid out and this hopefully will deter such rude diners in the future. Judith Daniels Great Yarmouth No value from gambling Government estimates suggest that a reduction from £100 to £2 per spin at bookies’ fixed-odds betting terminals could lead to a £5.5bn loss in tax revenues over the next 10 years. The gambling business is basically an intermediary that passes money from the hapless punter to the taxman, extracting a large commission for itself. There is nothing in the process that creates additional value. It can be argued that the money has considerably less value after the bookies take their cut. There is never any worthwhile outcome for the gambler and their families (quite the reverse). Economists do not appear to understand that you cannot fund beneficial public services from the taxation of empty services.

The Met Office said a white Easter in Scotland and the east coast of England was increasingly likely, with cold air from Scandinavia expected to envelop the country from the middle of next week. However, strong sunshine and spring conditions were expected to temper the impact of the cold weather on roads, railways and airports. “The evolution of this system during the middle of next week is uncertain, but it does appear increasingly likely to herald the start of another colder spell for many parts of the UK,” said Laura Paterson, a Met Office forecaster. “Despite uncertainty regarding the timing and onset of this change, the signal that colder conditions will develop and last into the Easter weekend has remained consistent.” Overcast but mild weather is expected this weekend, with temperatures of about 10C and patchy showers across England. Unsettled weather conditions were forecast from Monday as an Atlantic front brought heavy rain and the potential for strong winds across the UK. The system was expected to give way to snow in northern, central and eastern parts of the UK from Wednesday, although major disruption was not likely. “We’re now a lot further into spring than at the beginning of March. The ground is warmer, the sun is stronger because it is higher in the sky and we have more hours of daylight at the end of March compared with the beginning of the month. All of these factors are likely to subdue the impact of any snowfall,” Paterson said. Analysts have said the extreme weather in February and March could hit UK economic growth for the first three months of the year because of disruption to transport networks and fewer people going shopping. At least 10 people died in the UK as a result of the freezing weather, which saw blizzard conditions, rural communities cut off and temperatures falling as low as -10C. Military personnel assisted emergency services in responding to callouts during the cold weather, and thousands of schools and workplaces closed."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2018/mar/24/owen-smith-corbyn-sacking-me-over-call-for-brexit-mistake-labour","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-24T10:34:30Z","webTitle":"Owen Smith: Corbyn made mistake sacking me over Brexit stance","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/mar/24/owen-smith-corbyn-sacking-me-over-call-for-brexit-mistake-labour","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/mar/24/owen-smith-corbyn-sacking-me-over-call-for-brexit-mistake-labour","fields":{"headline":"Owen Smith: Corbyn made mistake sacking me over Brexit stance","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Owen Smith has called Jeremy Corbyn’s decision to sack him from the shadow frontbench a mistake, and defended his choice to break with Labour party policy by calling for a referendum on the final Brexit deal. Smith was sacked as the shadow Northern Ireland secretary on Friday evening after writing an article in the Guardian on the issue. He said his decision to openly support a second Brexit vote was based on principle, and that the Labour party was in danger of “sleepwalking” towards adopting a Brexit position that would damage the British economy. It comes as Corbyn was entangled in another antisemitism row after the Labour leader said he had been wrong to support a graffiti artist in 2012 whose work in London’s East End contained apparently Jewish bankers playing a game of Monopoly, with their tabletop resting on the bowed naked backs of workers. Smith told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme on Saturday that it was clear Corbyn wanted to adopt a more Eurosceptic position on the Brexit process than he did, and said Labour needed to “show leadership on the issue”. “It’s the biggest economic crisis that our country will have faced for many, many generations, and I think there is a danger that we sleepwalk towards effectively supporting a soft Brexit outcome that we know is going to be damaging to our economy,” he said. “It’s the first instance I can think of in living memory when a government is pursuing a policy that they know is going to make our economy smaller and reduce people’s livelihoods and life chances, and I cannot understand why we in Labour would support that.” The shadow home secretary, Diane Abbott, backed the decision to sack Smith, and said the MP for Pontypridd could not sit on the Labour frontbench and advance a position that was not party policy. Smith said in response: “It’s interesting to have Diane Abbott defending the decision. She said something very similar just a couple of months ago and she hasn’t been sacked.“For Jeremy Corbyn in particular, who’s always understood the value of people standing by their principles. It’s the position that he’s often adopted, and it’s certainly a value in him that others have extolled and, in truth, I think that’s all I’ve done. I’ve stood by my principles on what I think is the most important economic and security issue facing our country for generations. Labour needs to shift its position and that’s what I was trying to achieve.” Smith’s sacking is likely to inflame tensions in the party over Brexit. On Friday, the former Northern Ireland secretary Peter Hain said Smith had been the victim of a “terrible Stalinist purge”. Smith refused to be drawn on Corbyn’s latest antisemitism row in the Today interview. In 2012, Corbyn had offered his support to the US street artist Mear One, whose mural had been scrubbed off a wall after a number of complaints over its antisemitic imagery. In response to a Mear One Facebook post about the mural after the artist learned it was going to be removed, Corbyn responded: “Why? You are in good company. Rockerfeller [sic] destroyed Diego Viera’s [sic] mural because it includes a picture of Lenin.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/mar/25/nt-urged-to-pass-laws-banning-routine-strip-searches-in-juvenile-detention","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-25T00:33:25Z","webTitle":"NT urged to pass laws banning routine strip searches in juvenile detention","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/mar/25/nt-urged-to-pass-laws-banning-routine-strip-searches-in-juvenile-detention","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/mar/25/nt-urged-to-pass-laws-banning-routine-strip-searches-in-juvenile-detention","fields":{"headline":"NT urged to pass laws banning routine strip searches in juvenile detention","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Proposed legislation in the Northern Territory to ban routine strip searches and solitary confinement in youth detention centres is a “landmark” move that would leapfrog it ahead of other Australian states, the Human Rights Law Centre has said. Last week the NT minister for Territory Families, Dale Wakefield, introduced an amendment to the youth justice act, limiting the use of force and restraints in the youth detention system. It formed part of the NT government’s pledge to reform youth justice following the damning findings of the royal commission into the protection and detention of children in the NT, including the “overt punitive culture that permeated our youth detention facilities”, Wakefield said. “The amendments in this bill are based on evidence that overly punitive measures in youth detention are counterproductive and, on the contrary, contribute to further, more serious offending.” The previous NT government had been criticised for its legislative approach to restraints, including broadening the definitions and increasing the discretion of superintendents to use them. Last week’s bill would remove much of the superintendent’s discretion to approve the use of force, by removing the “catch all” justification of “maintaining good order”. “A major lesson from Don Dale was that children are at great risk of mistreatment when governments give prisons too much discretion,” said Ruth Barson, director of legal advocacy at the Human Rights Law Centre. “We can see this happening right now in other states, where children are being harmed in solitary confinement or degraded through routine strip searches, simply because somebody has decided that this very subjective, catch-all threshold has been met.” If passed by the unicameral NT parliament, the new laws would stop the “traumatic” practise of routine strip searches of young people when they first enter detention or come back from court appearances, and only allow it if there was real suspicion a detainee had contraband. Barson said there were far less invasive and degrading searches that officers could do, rather than the “thousands” of strip searches that the NT royal commission found were conducted on children every year. The reforms to solitary confinement were “landmark in Australia”, Barson said, and the new clearer definitions and restrictions would ensure children were not isolated in damaging solitary conditions of more than 22 hours a day without meaningful human contact. “The way [the NT legislation] prohibited that practice – which we know risks causing irreparable harm – is saying young people can only be separated for a very limited amount of time and in that time they have to be provided with meaningful contact, with education, with substantial time outdoors, they have to be seen by a doctor, and there are no rolling orders.” Other states frequently held child detainees in solitary confinement but used broad definitions and “doublespeak” to claim they did not, she said. Banksia Hill juvenile detention has repeatedly rejected claims by Amnesty International and parents of detainees that they had been holding teenage boys in isolation for more than 300 days, in breach of international law. “The WA government has gone on the record and denied the existence of solitary confinement in youth justice facilities,” Barson said. “I’d say if that is the minister’s intention – that no child in WA is held in solitary confinement – then she should amend the laws to make sure that’s what’s happening in practise.” Barson said that once the NT bill was passed into law, the next step was ensuring it was translated into practise and accompanied by “cultural change” in the youth detention sector. “It’s about making sure what was once a really punitive and permissive environment shifts in a really profound way.” The NT government has accepted all but a few of the royal commission’s recommendations but has refused to guarantee funding of them. It has repeatedly called for the federal government to assist financially. “It’s fantastic to see the NT go from laggard to leader,” Barson said. “All children in prison, irrespective of what state or territory they are in, must be protected from this type of cruelty.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2018/mar/26/church-data-is-being-scrutinised-now-for-facebooks-files","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-26T17:09:45Z","webTitle":"Church data is being scrutinised.

As with the Lost Gardens of Heligan, Trewidden, in Penzance, is one of the 12 designated Great Gardens of Cornwall and despite March snowfall many of its magnolias and camellias are coming into bloom. There’s also a dedicated children’s trail. • Adult £7, under 16s free, trewiddengarden.co.uk Blickling Estate, Norfolk While the Jacobean hall and its history are intriguing – Anne Boleyn is said to have been born here – Blickling’s springtime gardens are a seasonal must.

It was by this lake on an April day in 1802 that William Wordsworth and his sister Dorothy happened upon a long belt of the spring blooms, no doubt inspiring the poet’s most famous work: I Wandered Lonely as a Cloud. From now until the end of April the flowers will be out in full force and for an on-the-water view there are kayaks, dinghies and boats for hire at Glenridding Sailing centre. • Kayaks £10 an hour, dinghies £25, traditional boats £35, glenriddingsailingcentre.co.uk Hever Castle, Kent The annual Tulip Celebrations (18-27 April) in the grounds of this moated castle (the childhood home of Anne Boleyn) feature 20,000 of the colourful bulbs.

It’s only open on set days (Easter Sunday and Monday midday-4pm and 28-29 May midday-5pm) but that makes it feel even more special. There is a formal rose garden, long double herbaceous borders, while wild flowers, such as cowslips and primroses, vie for space with spring bulbs on the banks of the two ponds. A trail leads to the ruined Norman motte and bailey castle. • Adults £5, 12-16 £2, under 12s free, beningtonlordship.co.uk ANIMAL ATTRACTIONS Skokholm, Pembrokeshire, Wales As with its slightly better known neighbour, Skomer, this tiny island is in the Irish Sea, just a couple of miles off the Welsh coast.

For budgets that don’t stretch to boat trips, it can be just as fruitful to find a patch of grass at Chanonry Point, Cromarty, lay out a picnic and wait. Patience is often rewarded with sightings as this is a popular feeding spot. Harbour seals can also be spotted on the mudbanks, while further out minke whales and the occasional killer whale are not unheard of. • moraydolphins.co.uk Port Lympne, Kent At this wildlife reserve near the south Kent coast, visitors can take a safari ride to see roaming giraffes, zebras and the largest herd of black rhino in the UK. For teenagers interested in conservation, there’s a chance to become a zoo keeper for the day, while younger kids can shadow staff on a behind-the-scenes tour. For short breaks, New Beach Holiday Park (from £129 for 3 nights) at nearby Dymchurch beach is an affordable choice, with an indoor pool, amusements and an adventure playground. • Online, adult £22.50, child £18.90, family £82, animal courses from £156, aspinallfoundation.org River Cam, Cambridgeshire From 11 May to 25 September, the Cambridgeshire Wildlife Trust will be hosting its annual bat safaris to hear these nocturnal mammals fully woken from their winter slumber.

Set along the river Wandle, there are 50 hectares to play in, with droopy willow trees to climb, streams to splash in and plenty of places to hide. From 30 March-2 April Easter egg hunts start outside the historic snuff mill. • £4 a child, nationaltrust.org.uk Cannon Hall Farm, Barnsley, Yorkshire In the foothills of the Pennines, this award-winning farm attraction is open year-round but spring is when it’s at its peak.

But then in professional terms she was a late developer. Although she was born with the eye of a photographer, it was only in her mid-40s that she was able to take up the practice seriously. She was less well known than her husband Charles, the business and social philosopher, but her life was just as remarkable. As a photographer her main concern was people and she quickly developed a reputation for acute and warm psychological observation as well as a willingness to experiment. These qualities shone out of her work, nowhere more than in her most recent project, which explored the relationship of identical twins in mid-life, a typically fresh and engaging concept. Latterly she worked with Charles on books that combined his words and her portraits, including Behind the View, a portrait of her village, a sequence of photographic studies including The New Alchemists and Reinvented Lives: Women at Sixty, and, later, a number of photo documentaries, with images by Elizabeth and commentary by Charles, for voluntary organisations. She met Charles in 1960 in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, where he was working; she had a job with the high commission in Singapore and had gone to KL for a party. They married in 1962, dividing their time between their homes in Norfolk and Putney, south-west London, and having two children, Kate and Scott. Liz had early on turned entrepreneur, running her interior design business, before training as a counsellor with Relate, a skill that served her well as a photographer. Later she combined photography with taking over as her husband’s agent and business manager. She was born Elizabeth Ann Hill in Farnham, Surrey, in 1940, the daughter of an army colonel, Rowland, and his wife, Olivette (nee Bailey). She attended a dozen different schools but, she said, luckily learned nothing to stop her restless curiosity. Finally, aged 50, she got an honours degree in photography from the University of Westminster. She and Charles made a formidable partnership. They travelled the world together, always taking time to meet people and understand their interests, which in turn became the source of some of their projects. In 2016 she was briskly telling a business audience how to be old: be useful, be curious, mentor and take energy from the young, do not wait for others to make things happen. “We’re having the time of our lives,” she concluded. Conscious of what he owed her, Charles would sometimes say he was lucky to be on his third marriage – but each time to the same woman, adjusting their relationship through the different stages of life. He survives her, along with Kate, Scott and four grandchildren."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"sport/2018/mar/26/harry-herbert-denies-al-shaqab-departure-linked-to-trainers-payment-failures-horse-racing","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-26T15:44:28Z","webTitle":"Harry Herbert denies Al Shaqab departure is linked to payment failures","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/mar/26/harry-herbert-denies-al-shaqab-departure-linked-to-trainers-payment-failures-horse-racing","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/mar/26/harry-herbert-denies-al-shaqab-departure-linked-to-trainers-payment-failures-horse-racing","fields":{"headline":"Harry Herbert denies Al Shaqab departure is linked to payment failures","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Harry Herbert said on Monday his decision to part from Al Shaqab was a natural consequence of the expansion of his own business and was unconnected to the news in January that some trainers were having trouble getting their bills paid by the Qatari operation. Herbert was appointed racing adviser to Sheikh Joaan at the end of 2013, a position he will quit at the end of next month. “My attention needs to be focused on the future growth plans that I have for my own business,” Herbert said, in reference to Highclere Thoroughbred Racing, which he set up in the early 90s. Highclere is expanding into Australia and is now buying yearlings there in addition to importing established racehorses from Europe. “Four years of doing both was hard work,” added Herbert, who noted also Al Shaqab’s focus continues to move away from England and towards France, where its European racing office is based. While it still has 50 horses in training in Britain, only a dozen of those are two-year-olds, an indication the total is likely to taper away over time. Herbert spoke of the pride he took in the achievements of Al Shaqab horses here, which included a treble at Royal Ascot in 2014 and a 2,000 Guineas triumph for Galileo Gold in 2016. However, he must have privately despaired over the middle-management failures, over which he had no control, that led to Al Shaqab owing a sum thought to be more than £1m to various trainers and service providers, some of whom were kept waiting half a year to be paid. It is believed funds have since started to flow more reliably and one of Al Shaqab’s trainers said yesterday he had “no complaints” on that score. However, the Racing Post reported Herbert had at one stage paid some of Al Shaqab’s bills from his own funds in order to help some of those who had been kept waiting. Meanwhile, it was announced that the last day of this jumps season will also be the last day in the racing career of Cue Card, who will have his final outing in Sandown’s Oaksey Chase. “We just thought it would suit him because it tends to be a small field for that race,” said his owner, Jean Bishop. All four previous runnings of the Oaksey Chase have been won by the now-retired Menorah, who raced against Cue Card several times, including when they were first and second in the Bula Hurdle of 2010."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"us-news/2018/mar/26/ben-carson-hud-staff-fired-latest","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-26T17:56:37Z","webTitle":"Three more lose jobs at Ben Carson’s housing department","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/mar/26/ben-carson-hud-staff-fired-latest","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/mar/26/ben-carson-hud-staff-fired-latest","fields":{"headline":"Three more lose jobs at Ben Carson’s housing department","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Three more people lost their jobs at Ben Carson’s Department of Housing and Urban Development (Hud) on Monday, amid a widening ethics controversy. The three people, one of them a former White House staffer, worked as aides in the office of Hud’s chief information officer, Johnson Joy, who was removed from his job last week over reports published by the Guardian. Two sources at Hud said the aides had their contracts terminated unexpectedly by Accel Corporation, a Maryland-based private employment agency that supplied Joy’s office with multiple staff. But Raffi Williams, a spokesman for Hud, said in an email: “The funds for the contract under which they worked have been fully expended. They were not terminated.” Accel’s arrangement with Hud is being examined by the department’s inspector general and the Office of Special Counsel (OSC), which oversees federal workers’ employment rights, according to sources familiar with the process who were not permitted to speak publicly. Accel denies any wrongdoing. Among those who left on Monday was Leah LeVell, a former official in the Trump White House who was Joy’s communications director. LeVell’s father, Bruce, is an adviser to Donald Trump’s re-election campaign. Two senior advisers, Sophia Edwards and Paul Fulcher, also departed. None is accused of wrongdoing. Stacye Loman, the owner of Accel Corporation, did not respond to a request for comment. LeVell, Fulcher and Edwards did not respond to messages seeking comment. Last week the Guardian disclosed that Joy’s executive assistant alleged to the inspector general and the OSC that she was removed after raising internal concerns about Accel. The assistant, Katrina Hubbard, said she was reassigned and then terminated earlier this year, after raising the alarm about apparent overpayments to the company. Some Accel subcontractors were falsely classed in higher pay grades, she said, while some billed for days and hours they had not worked. Naved Jafry, a friend of Joy’s and another Accel subcontractor, resigned last month after it emerged that he had exaggerated his biography and had been accused of fraud in several lawsuits. Sherrod Brown, a Democratic senator from Ohio, last week accused Carson of filling positions at Hud “based on patronage rather than competence”, following the Guardian’s reports. Carson denied that charge. Explaining why he removed Joy, Carson said: “I lost confidence in his ability to lead.” Carson said he acted as soon as he was made aware of problems in Joy’s office. Carson has also been under pressure over an order placed by his office for a $31,000 dining set. A senior official at Hud alleged to OSC in a separate complaint that she was demoted after refusing to break a $5,000 legal spending limit on decorating Carson’s office. Carson said he had moved to cancel the order. Reports last week suggested that Trump was close to removing Carson. But Newsmax chief executive Christopher Ruddy, a friend of the president, denied that in an interview on Sunday with ABC’s This Week. “I’m told that the president is happy with the job he’s doing, he will be staying,” Ruddy said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2018/mar/26/facebook-data-privacy-cambridge-analytica-investigation-ftc-latest","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-26T22:14:13Z","webTitle":"Facebook's privacy practices are under investigation, FTC confirms","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/mar/26/facebook-data-privacy-cambridge-analytica-investigation-ftc-latest","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2018/mar/26/facebook-data-privacy-cambridge-analytica-investigation-ftc-latest","fields":{"headline":"Facebook's privacy practices are under investigation, FTC confirms","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Facebook’s privacy practices are under investigation by the US Federal Trade Commission following a week of scandals and public outrage over the company’s failure to protect the personal information of tens of millions of users. “The FTC takes very seriously recent press reports raising substantial concerns about the privacy practices of Facebook,” said Tom Pahl, acting director of the FTC’s bureau of consumer protection in a statement on Monday noting that the investigation would include whether the company engaged in “unfair acts that cause substantial injury to consumers”. Facebook’s stock, which already took a big hit last week, slid as a result falling by as much as 6% at one point. “We remain strongly committed to protecting people’s information,” Facebook’s deputy chief privacy officer, Rob Sherman, said in a statement. “We appreciate the opportunity to answer questions the FTC may have.” Facebook’s privacy practices have come under fire after revelations in the Observer that Cambridge Analytica got data on Facebook users, including information on friends of people who had downloaded a psychological quiz app, even though those friends had not given explicit consent to sharing. The fact that the data obtained by Cambridge Analytica was harvested in 2014 has raised questions about whether Facebook violated a 2011 consent decree with the FTC. The consent decree included fines of up to $40,000 per violation, meaning that if Facebook were found in violation for all 50m users whose data was obtained by Cambridge Analytica, the penalty could conceivably be in the trillions of dollars. David Vladeck, a former FTC official who oversaw the 2011 investigation, told the Washington Post that he believed there was a “strong possibility” that Facebook had violated its agreements. Marc Rotenberg, executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, said he believed Facebook was in violation of the 2011 settlement in letting Cambridge Analytica harvest data on friends of Facebook users. “This is what Facebook was doing 10 years ago that people objected to, what the FTC should have stopped in 2011,” Rotenberg said. “It makes zero sense that when a person downloads their apps, they have the ability to transfer the data of their friends.” Although Zuckerberg talked about changes in 2014 that would have prevented this, Rotenberg said it should have been banned already under the 2011 consent decree. He said the FTC had dropped the ball in failing to enforce that. But Chris Hoofnagle, faculty director of the Berkeley Center for Law and Technology, said that legal language in the consent decree would make it difficult for the government to show that Facebook had violated the agreement, because it allows Facebook to give the information of a user’s friends to third-party developers. “The consent decree doesn’t give the FTC a lot of traction, but what’s going to happen is what happened in the first FTC case,” Hoofnagle said, referring to the investigation that resulted in the 2011 agreement. “The FTC went in investigating A, then discovered B, C, D, E, F and G. The same thing is going to happen here. They’re going to go in under the consent decree logic, and then they’re going to find other wrongdoing.” Facebook is also facing questions over reports that it collected years of contact names, telephone numbers, call lengths and information about text messages from Android users. Facebook said on Sunday that this information was uploaded to secure servers and came only from people who gave explicit consent to allow it. Officials said the data was not sold or shared with users’ friends or outside apps. They said the data was used “to improve people’s experience across Facebook” by helping to connect with others. But the company did not spell out exactly what it used the data for or why it needed it. Meanwhile, the chief law enforcement officers for 37 US states and territories are demanding to know when Facebook learned of the Cambridge Anaytica breach. The officers say in a letter to Zuckerberg that users’ trust in the social media platform is “broken”. The attorneys general are asking how Facebook monitored what these developers did with all the data they collected and whether Facebook had safeguards to prevent misuse. They also asked Zuckerberg for an update on how Facebook will allow users to more easily control the privacy of their accounts."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"cities/2018/jun/05/soccer-in-america-why-arent-more-black-kids-playing-the-worlds-game","type":"article","sectionId":"cities","sectionName":"Cities","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-05T12:00:44Z","webTitle":"Soccer in America: why aren't more black kids playing the world's game?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2018/jun/05/soccer-in-america-why-arent-more-black-kids-playing-the-worlds-game","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/cities/2018/jun/05/soccer-in-america-why-arent-more-black-kids-playing-the-worlds-game","fields":{"headline":"Soccer in America: why aren't more black kids playing the world's game?","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Soccer found Robert Russ when he was in the seventh grade – not that he was looking for it. Like most African American kids at his Washington middle school, he had no interest in the game. Soccer, everyone had told him, was either for white children in the suburbs or Latino immigrants, not kids like him. Then one afternoon someone waved him on to the playing field. By the end of the day, he was in love with a new sport. Soon came the taunts from his friends, telling him that he wasn’t playing a real sport. That what he was doing wasn’t really black. That he was wasting his time. “If you’re African American and you play soccer, you get picked on a lot,” Russ says. “People are going to say you’re trying to be Hispanic,” he says. He never cared about the teasing; he enjoyed the game too much. But now that he’s 20 and working with young inner city players, Russ notices how few look like him. He’s sure peer pressure has a lot to do with that. While soccer has boomed in the US, becoming a staple of suburban life, it has barely made a ripple in African American communities. As Russ talks, he watches a tournament played by children from Washington’s poorest neighbourhoods. Of the dozens of kids, most are Latino, and only a handful are African American. It’s hardly representative of a city that is 49% black. It’s a picture that’s repeated across the country. One of the world’s most democratic games, played on streets and in alleys around the globe, would seem a natural fit for America’s predominately black inner cities, where basketball thrives on playground courts. Instead, it’s almost non-existent. A failing national team For the first time in more than three decades, the US men’s team will not be competing at the World Cup. The national team has been unable to develop dynamic, creative players who can compete at an international level. Many see the roots of this failure in the expensive, well-organised network of pay-to-play suburban leagues. Some parents spend more than $10,000 (£7,420) a year on membership fees and out-of-town tournaments. Those competitions are often where college coaches find recruits and national scouts identify prospects. Children in poor neighbourhoods in places such as Washington are priced out. Even the select few who get scholarships struggle with the logistics of reaching training fields far from public transport routes. As a result, millions of children don’t ever try soccer – including some of the country’s best athletes. “To not be allowing non-white kids to develop shows why we aren’t in the World Cup,” says Amir Lowery, a former Major League Soccer player and executive director of Open Goal Project, a DC nonprofit working to provide minorities with more access to high level soccer opportunities, and level the playing field in youth soccer. “A kid playing basketball and American football can see a chance to play in college, they see a path through,” he says. “If you want to play soccer [beyond high school], there’s no path there. You don’t ever see college coaches at high school games. “Mentally, the kids aren’t even thinking soccer is accessible.” Lowery, who is black, grew up in a middle-class part of Washington’s well-to-do northwest quadrant, exposing him to an elite system. The players he coaches today aren’t so fortunate, and his attempts to recruit basketball or football players are declined. Mark Lewis came to the US from Jamaica as a teenager, and has always been perplexed at the lack of African American kids playing soccer. As a youth coach, he has spent much of his adult life trying to change perceptions of the game in predominately black DC neighbourhoods such as Anacostia. Several years ago, he became a coach at DC Scores, a non-profit group that mixes soccer with art at inner-city schools. He’d convince kids lingering near his practice sessions to join a team. He even placed soccer balls in his backyard, hoping to spark curiosity in those walking by. “I never see a kid in Anacostia carrying a soccer ball,” he says as he watches the same Washington tournament with Russ. “In the white neighbourhoods you see that every day.” Waiting for a black Messi It’s often said that the game simply needs to be introduced to black communities, either with the creation of new fields or the addition of school soccer programs. Nicole Hercules once tried to explain soccer to a group of African American kids in her hometown of Rochester, New York. One child gazed at her black skin and asked: Where are you from? “It was such a gut punch. I said: I’m from here, just like you!” Hercules recalls. “But until they see more people who look like them playing soccer, they don’t think they can do it.” What if a great black American soccer player suddenly emerged? “A LeBron James for soccer would change the game for African American kids,” says Russ. As a kid Russ could look up to Tim Howard, the black player who was the US goalkeeper through three World Cup cycles. But Russ, a keeper himself, knows the great American breakthrough star will have to be be a playmaker, someone dynamic. Someone like Lionel Messi. “I think in America we will develop a better Messi,” says Keith Tucker, a longtime soccer coach in Washington’s black neighbourhoods. And Tucker, who is African American, believes this “better Messi” will be black. The problem is just how long it might take. “It’s hard to start a league on this side of town,” he says. “You need professional coaches to start summer camps and bring quality coaching. You need to start kids young. And you need professionals who parents feel comfortable leaving their three-year-olds with. Then you need lots of volunteers to make a league work.” Churches, Tucker says, can provide the community, but not the coaching expertise. City leaders have not made soccer a priority for financially-strained recreation departments, and aside from DC Scores – with whom he coaches – there isn’t an emphasis on soccer in Washington’s schools. Many years ago, DC’s powerful black mayor Marion Barry ordered the recreation department to push youth soccer. For a brief time, it seemed the sport might catch on. Then Barry left office and the initiative died. Along with many others, Tucker blames the US Soccer Federation for not doing enough to develop and feature African American players. He wonders why US Soccer won’t come into black neighbourhoods in Washington and other big American cities to establish leagues, staffed with top-level coaches like those in the wealthy suburbs. A quality league with the hope of a direct path to the US national team would go a long way to creating interest within black communities, he says. Kids will believe they are part of a “family”, the way they do in established basketball leagues throughout African American neighbourhoods. Until that happens, the world’s most democratic sport will remain a novelty – something for the white and Latino kids to do in the suburbs.

It means there is a need for some new candidates to play in an unsettled England Test team. Moreover, it is not entirely reassuring when we do not know the identity of the selectors looking out for those new players. But that is where we are this April. For the rest of us the start of the championship is a happy reminder that spring is upon us. The anorak and the flask must be dusted down for those prepared to brave April’s winds and showers. There will be five early rounds of championship matches, the first beginning this Friday and the last finishing on 14 May. From 19 August until 27 September there will be six more rounds, which means that there are four rounds allocated to the middle of the summer. Enjoy them while you can. There is unlikely to be so much championship cricket in the middle of the season from 2020 onwards. For our cricketers there is plenty to play for this spring, which brings extra spice and a few dodgy newspaper intros as run scorers keep “sending memos” to the selectors, whoever they may be. Anyone who hits a stash of early season runs, especially in the eight‑team First Division, has a chance of being elevated to the Test team. Lancashire, who begin their campaign against Nottinghamshire at Old Trafford, can expect regular scrutiny since their lineup contains three batsmen who have been with the Lions throughout the winter. Keaton Jennings, once of Durham, is now a colleague of Haseeb Hameed and the new club captain, Liam Livingstone. By the same token the progress of Joe Clarke, Dan Lawrence and Nick Gubbins will be monitored closely but this season more unfamiliar names have the chance to “nudge” those selectors with a run of high scores. On the fast bowling front, anyone who has extra pace and/or propels the ball with his left hand will be of great interest if they start taking wickets regularly. But beyond the need to improve the Test team there are a surprising number of cricket fans who have a simpler passion for championship cricket. They are only really concerned about how their team are doing. Many will be following surreptitiously at work, startling colleagues with the odd seemingly unprovoked oath when they spot that Trescothick has gone early at Taunton or Collingwood has departed cheaply at Chester‑le‑Street (these are the much-beloved senior members left on the circuit). And a few of those fans will actually be there, renewing friendships of last September. Last summer Essex romped to the title with Chris Silverwood, now England’s bowling coach, in the Pep Guardiola role. It is unlikely to be so easy for them this time. The others are forewarned. By September last year every other side in the division was more concerned about avoiding the drop than winning the pennant that Essex had all but secured. In the end, Middlesex were relegated alongside Warwickshire. So this year in the top division there are three non-Test match counties – it’s such an ugly phrase it might be easier just to call them “the intruders”. Essex, Somerset and Worcestershire have the impertinence to challenge those clubs who have been given the opportunity and the potential financial dividend of hosting the new Twenty20 tournament in 2020. In the long-term the intruders will do well to survive against the increasing financial might of their opponents. The 10-team Second Division contains several sides whose ambition will not extend much beyond grabbing some one‑day glory. But Middlesex and Warwickshire will obviously have their sights set on an immediate return to Division One, with Sussex – now under the guidance of Jason Gillespie even though he is always being touted for an international post with Australia or England – a likely intruder. So let the sun shine on Friday. The English game always looks so stupid when the start of the season coincides with snow showers and that is the last thing that the England and Wales Cricket Board wants after a tricky winter. The board must be nervous about the state of the game, of which it is the guardian. There is some bewilderment out there as the ECB seems inclined to keep offering handouts to counties for not hosting Test cricket and for voting in favour of a T20 competition that is much more attractive to TV executives than the real fans. In the meantime it is prepared to underwrite the costs of the threatened libel suit of its chairman, Colin Graves, against Cricinfo, which is, perversely, one of the outlets seeking to give domestic cricket in England a high profile."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"}]}}
