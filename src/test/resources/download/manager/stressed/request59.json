Anything that the “team” that has stuck us in the verbal bog of “managed regulatory divergence” all agree on can never take us forward. Unify the country? Show us a united cabinet first. Her mood music struck up a more melodious tone, promising hard choices and compromises. Yet she spelled out few on her side, and many for the EU to swallow. But she can only edge forward slowly while she lets her cabinet Brexiteers control the brake. Brussels waited to hear if the vicar’s daughter has finally given up cake for Lent. But no. Here was a choice list of vital agencies it’s blindingly obvious we must pay any price to stay within – aviation, medicines, Euratom, maritime, rail – and plenty more. Losing access to those will cause life-changing injury, but so far Brussels says no to that pick-and-mix. Her pitch is for our sovereign parliament to decide on each and every regulation to align us with the EU. Her compromise is to suppose a wise Commons will always choose to stay aligned and keep the free trade flowing – sovereign but in practice obedient. The EU has already scorned this voluntary arrangement, at risk of U-turn by whim of parliament. Hard choices, she promised, but offered only the same conundrums, with no new answers. Magic no-friction on the Irish border, again, while free trading with the world. Her five tests were a wish list as contradictory as ever. We will have it all, control our borders, no free movement, no breaking our union. Her softer tone matters in these hardest of negotiations, but in the end content and compromise count most. “Is it worth it?” asked a wise German journalist. That’s what Britain must decide. Fear the worst when she reprised her dreadful threat: “No deal is still better than a bad deal.” Surely by now she knows no deal is the worst fate of all. • Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnist Katy Balls: In not upsetting either wing of her party, this was a success Ahead of Theresa May’s speech, a Conservative arch-Eurosceptic told me that the best way to judge its success was not to focus on whether the majority of MPs were happy but instead watch how his side and Anna Soubry’s side reacted. He said that should either group feel able to gloat then the prime minister would have a problem. In that vein, May’s speech could be classed as a success. She managed to dish out problems and compromises to both sides of her party. While she tried to strike an optimistic note – and paint a picture of a global Britain with strong ties to Europe – she was clear that there were trade-offs ahead. Remain MPs hoping for a climbdown on the government’s opposition to “a” customs union were left disappointed. The prime minister reiterated her opposition to joining “a” customs union and went further, making clear that she wants the UK to be able to set its own tariffs for goods not being moved straight on to the EU. That suggests not even a partial customs union is possible. What’s more, May was clear that this wouldn’t be a soft Brexit when it comes to the City. She said she accepted passporting for financial institutions would end but hoped that financial services could be part of a “special partnership” based on mutual recognition of standards. On the other side, the most difficult moment for the Brexiteers will have been May’s utterance of two words: “binding agreement”. At Thursday’s cabinet meeting, Brexit-backing ministers pushed back against the phrase, which David Davis and Boris Johnson felt went further than what was agreed at the Chequers awayday. The fact May said that the UK will make binding commitments for regulations to remain in step with EU ones in some areas shows that economics still trumps sovereignty in certain areas. The UK will also be a rule-taker in the various EU agencies that May says she wants the UK to remain part of even after Brexit. This is a speech that will have left neither the remain or Brexit side of her party particularly happy – but then again with such different demands, perhaps mutual dissatisfaction was the order of the day. • Katy Balls is the Spectator’s political correspondent Maya Goodfellow: May just showed she has no coherent plan Eleven months after article 50 was triggered, Theresa May’s speech offered a strong diagnosis of the problems in negotiations (which we already knew) and a softening of rhetoric. She angled for a mutually beneficial partnership with the EU; to the chagrin of Brexiter Tories, she essentially spelled out all the reasons a hard departure from the EU would be a disaster for the UK. Still, it was not a speech of crystal-clear clarity: she claimed Brexit would boost UK prosperity but bring with it significant problems – and we all know under the Tories it’s the poorest in society that those problems always seem to have most impact on. And still there was no agreed solution on the Irish border question. The deal “must be consistent with the kind of country we want to be as we leave: a modern, open, outward-looking, tolerant, European democracy,” she said, spelling out point four on her list of tests. If the UK is going to become that country under the Tories once we leave the EU, it would mean unprecedented political change for the former home secretary who created the “hostile environment” policy. As she talked about an “open” and “modern” country, thousands of homeless people, more or less abandoned by the government, are sleeping on the streets and 120 women, indefinitely detained in Yarl’s Wood, are currently on a hunger strike. May’s speech might be something of a shift in position but there remains a yawning gap between the government and the opposition. The week began with Jeremy Corbyn fleshing out the kind of deal Labour would like to strike with the EU, which would put workers’ rights first; it ended with the government, the actual negotiators at the table, unconvincingly claiming they would do the same. The Tories have no coherent plans: May started her speech by quoting the first one she made as prime minister, but all that served to show was how little she has done in office. No matter the “tests” May laid out today, this speech cannot change that. • Maya Goodfellow is a writer and researcher John Redwood: I hope the EU responds warmly to this generous vision The prime minister set out some noble aims and plenty of detail on how the new trading arrangements could work if the EU does wish to have a comprehensive free trade agreement and customs understanding with us. She spoke in words that should bring together many who voted remain and many who voted leave, concentrating on how we can have a good relationship with the rest of the EU once we have left. The UK has been most accommodating in the negotiations so far, offering money for a transitional period, offering a full free trade deal so their exporters do not face tariffs in future, and reassuring all those who have come here under EU law that they are most welcome to stay. I do hope the EU now responds positively and warmly to this speech, agreeing in principle to the prime minister’s vision of a wide-ranging free trade agreement. The offer is clearly well meant and the overall package the UK has in mind generous to the rest of the EU. Many leave voters just want to exit and get on with spending all the money we will save once properly out. I agree with them that we do need to spend more on the NHS, our education system and other public services, and the easiest way to pay for all that will be from the savings in EU contributions. I also look forward to the day, after a clean Brexit such as the one described by the prime minister, when the UK parliament can abolish VAT on feminine hygiene products, green products including heating controls and draught excluders, and on domestic energy where we could help anyone struggling with high fuel bills. • John Redwood is the Conservative MP for Wokingham and a leading Brexiter"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"environment/2018/mar/05/a-fifth-of-europes-wood-beetles-at-risk-of-extinction-as-ancient-trees-decline","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-05T06:30:08Z","webTitle":"One-fifth of Europe's wood beetles at risk of extinction as ancient trees decline","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/mar/05/a-fifth-of-europes-wood-beetles-at-risk-of-extinction-as-ancient-trees-decline","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/mar/05/a-fifth-of-europes-wood-beetles-at-risk-of-extinction-as-ancient-trees-decline","fields":{"headline":"One-fifth of Europe's wood beetles at risk of extinction as ancient trees decline","bodyText":"Almost one-fifth of Europe’s wood beetles are at risk of extinction due to a widespread decline in ancient trees, according to a new report which suggests their demise could have devastating knock-on effects for other species. The study says 18% of saproxylic beetles – which depend on dead and decaying wood for some of their lifecycle – now exist on a conservation plane between “vulnerable” and “critically endangered”. Another 13% of the insects are considered “near threatened” and their disappearance could have a disastrous impact on biodiversity and ecosystems, according to the new red list released by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Wood beetles are a key food source for small mammals, bats and for birds such as woodpeckers, nut hatchers and treecreepers. Some species are also pollinators. Dr Keith Alexander, an ecological consultant who contributed to the report, told the Guardian: “Saproxylic beetles are intimately tied to everything else in the places where they occur. If you start to erode the varieties of life, then the ecosystem heads towards collapse.” “In western Europe, there are already lots of intensively cultivated places where the fauna is incredibly poor compared to what it should be. We expect that things have started to unravel in these places, which have been simplified by people removing dead wood and changing the habitat’s whole structure.” Healthy and varied wood beetle populations need large volumes of dead and decaying wood. Some species will only lay their eggs in hollow cavities containing mould that takes hundreds of years to form. Logging and tree loss is “by far” the greatest menace to their way of life, the IUCN report says. But they also face a staggering array of threats, from urbanisation and tourism to arable farming, pollution and climate change. One of the most avoidable hazards confronting wood beetles is the rigidity of the EU’s common agricultural policy’s (CAP) payment system, according to Luc Bas, the IUCN’s Europe director. “It is critical for the CAP to promote the appropriate management of wood pasture habitats containing veteran trees across Europe,” he said. “Currently, management practices lead to the transformation of wood pastures into either woodland or grassland, destroying the essential vegetation mosaic many saproxylic beetles need.” The European commission funded the IUCN paper, which assessed 700 species of beetle, and was increasingly engaging with the effects of its CAP policies, Alexander said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2018/mar/01/brexit-ireland-and-what-leavers-might-learn-from-passport-to-pimlico","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-01T18:19:25Z","webTitle":"Brexit, Ireland and what leavers might learn from Passport to Pimlico | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/mar/01/brexit-ireland-and-what-leavers-might-learn-from-passport-to-pimlico","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/mar/01/brexit-ireland-and-what-leavers-might-learn-from-passport-to-pimlico","fields":{"headline":"Brexit, Ireland and what leavers might learn from Passport to Pimlico","bodyText":"The foreign secretary’s reference to the lack of borders between London boroughs (Johnson: task is to avoid harder border with Irish Republic, 28 February), like many of his comments, brings farce to the fore – this time in a reminder of the 1949 Ealing comedy Passport to Pimlico. In the film, a small part of London discovers an old document that shows it is not actually part of London or the UK at all (really Burgundian indeed!), and separates from the UK to avoid the restrictions and bureaucracy that membership of this larger unit places upon it. Pimlico, however, cannot manage on its own and, after a period of conflict between the exiter and the larger unit, a resolution is found. Reason and cooperation rule the day: Pimlico rejoins the UK and leaves behind the historic fantasy that started it all. Tony Cole London • It would appear that the way the government proposes to square the seemingly impossible circle of creating Brexit yet retaining an open border in Ireland, and no border in the Irish Sea, is via clever technology that recognises vehicle number plates. But, leaving to one side the seamless import or export of potatoes in large lorries, what we have not heard from anyone in government is how they will deal with people wishing to enter the UK from Ireland. Therefore, in the post-Brexit era, all that any person from an EU member state who wishes to move into England will need to do is fly to Dublin and, unimpeded by any border controls, catch the next train or bus to Belfast, and then travel from Belfast to London, where they will be able to remain as long as they wish. Ian Davis Wheatley, Oxfordshire • If a hard border between Northern Ireland and the rest of Great Britain is not acceptable, and a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland is not acceptable, and reneging on the 2016 referendum result is not acceptable, the obvious solution is surely for Ireland to rejoin the UK. I think our foreign secretary, alongside his trusty bus, is just the person to sell the idea to the Irish electorate. Mike Shearing London • The EU draft withdrawal agreement is not “a gambit in a negotiation that has barely started” as Anand Menon says (Opinion, 1 March). It is an attempt by the EU to state in comprehensive legal terms what was agreed in principle by both sides in December, some considerable time into the short period we have to process this wretched and complex business. Like Mrs May, Menon offers us no thought-out solution to the Irish border problem, but seems to blithely assume that one will appear by magic if May “faces down the EU” by “playing the long game”. This is surely exactly the failing approach that May has been pursuing since article 50 was triggered, and which she will be forced to abandon by the end of this month.

Here’s how to beat the winter chill","bodyText":"If you’ve been struggling to keep your home warm this week, you are far from alone. UK homes are some of the least well insulated in Europe. But experts say a few simple DIY changes can dramatically improve the internal temperature. The concept is simple: stop cold air coming in and prevent warm air from escaping. This will save you money on your utility bills as the existing heating system will need to work less hard. Here’s what you can do this weekend. Floorboard gaps The smallest cracks in floorboards will allow draughts of cold air up. Trendy, exposed, suspended floors – where the floorboards sit on joists – are the worst culprits, as they sit over cold basements or voids. There are a host of products that will let you seal them up. In an extensive test conducted by the Guardian, Stopgap sealant was named as the best overall product. It costs £25 for 40 metres and will seal cracks 1-8mm wide. Experts say you will really notice the difference. If your floorboards are not on display, you can use homemade papier-mache, filler or silicone sealer – available at £3.59 at DIY store Wickes. You also need to check if there are any gaps between the skirting board and the floor. Draught proof and cover front doors Put your hand next to your front door and you’ll notice how cold it is. First fit a brush strip to the bottom of the door frame (currently £2.50 at B&amp;Q on clearance) as this is where the largest gap tends to be. Around the sides and the top of the door you can use rubber draught seal which is about 80p a metre at DIY stores. Have you got a letter box? If so, fit a letter box draught excluder – this week B&amp;Q discounted them to 88p. Another good option is to fit a heavy curtain across the door. The same goes for any thin windows in the door frame. The heavier the better, say those in the know. Cat flaps and extractor fans Old cat flaps will often blow open, sending a gale through the kitchen. Are the magnets still up to the job of keeping the flap closed? The Ferplast Cat Flap Swing 5 costs £30 and does away with draughts because of its wind stopper system. Check your extractor fan: lots of people never use them. They have blades that are supposed to block the wind when not in use but they become damaged, allowing draughts in. Replace broken ones, and if you never use it, block it up completely using a bag containing loft insulation. Pull the fuse on the fan so you don’t use it by accident. Loft hatch Most people have insulated their loft space – but did you do the hatch too? To draught-proof a resting (rather than hinged) hatch, put a foam strip around the perimeter of the bottom of the loft hatch. As the hatch sits in place, the seal will stop any draughts. Next you need to insulate the hatch door itself. Glue a plastic carrier bag to the top, covering as much of it as you can without going over the edges. Then stuff the bag with insulating wool and tape it closed. Sealing the insulation within the bag prevents the material coming apart when you open the hatch. While we are in the loft, you should aim to have at least 270mm of insulation up there. Any less, and you’ve got a job to do. Curtain liners Everyone knows that curtains keep out draughts, but a thermal liner takes that up to a whole new level. Dunelm Mill will sell you a range – prices start at £10 – and, although it may test your sewing skills, you’ll notice the difference. Block up that unused chimney An open chimney will suck much of the heating out of a room, but a host of firms will sell you a rubber chimney balloon for about £18. A cheaper and easier option is to use an old pillow or bin bag stuffed with loft insulation. A green alternative is a chimney sheep – made from wool. They start at £16, don’t deflate over time, are biodegradable, and should last for years. Just make sure you remove it if you decide to use the fireplace. Check your hot water tank Unless you’ve changed your tank in recent years, the chances are your lagging lags behind best practice. The tank should have a jacket with a minimum of 80mm of insulation – ideally two jackets. If you can’t face adding another this weekend, but you have old duvets or sleeping bags, wrap them around the tank. Also consider insulating the pipes to and from the tank. Insulate behind the radiator Radiators on outside walls lose heat, so a thermal panel behind it will keep more heat in the room. Homes with single-skin walls or without cavity wall insulation will benefit most from these panels. Energy saving company Greenage says not to use kitchen foil mounted on cardboard as it degrades. Much better, they say, is to use an approved material such as Radflek. Packs to fit three to six radiators cost £17 at Ecostore. This material does not crinkle and crease like kitchen foil and will last for years. Screwfix sells 4 metre packs of a similar material for £5.99. Radiators on internal walls are not worth doing, it seems. Lastly, take a look at your living room layout. Radiators with sofas hard up against them will not work efficiently. A shelf above a radiator moves the warm air into the room. Move chairs into warmer spots for maximum comfort."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"sport/2018/mar/01/sebastian-coe-russia-iaaf-hardball-athletics-doping-scandal","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-01T16:16:51Z","webTitle":"Sebastian Coe tells Russia: IAAF will still play hardball despite IOC decision","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/mar/01/sebastian-coe-russia-iaaf-hardball-athletics-doping-scandal","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/mar/01/sebastian-coe-russia-iaaf-hardball-athletics-doping-scandal","fields":{"headline":"Sebastian Coe tells Russia: IAAF will still play hardball despite IOC decision","bodyText":"Sebastian Coe has promised athletics will continue to play hardball with Russia despite the International Olympic Committee’s decision to welcome the country back into the sporting fold. Russia has been suspended from track and field since November 2015 because of massive state-sponsored doping, with its athletes needing to gain the approval of a doping review board to compete as neutral athletes. Only 22 Russians have been granted approval for 2018 so far, with eight of those competing in the world indoor championships in Birmingham – including the high jumpers Mariya Lasitskene and Danil Lysenko, who both won gold in the women’s and men’s events on Thursday night. And Lord Coe, the president of the IAAF, has signalled that the body’s tough stance will not soften until an independent taskforce, headed by the Norwegian Rune Andersen, is satisfied that Russia has cleaned up its act. “We have a responsibility to protect the clean athletes,” said Coe. “And until we are entirely satisfied Russian Athletics has met the objectives we have set – and agreed with them – then our position is not an unreasonable one to have.” Andersen will give his latest report on Russia’s progress to the IAAF’s executive council on Tuesday. But there is little chance of a change in policy, given he has previously stated the suspension will not be lifted until the Russian Anti-Doping Agency is functioning again and the country’s sporting leaders acknowledge their mistakes. Coe refused to comment directly on the IOC’s decision to reinstate the Russian Olympic Committee after just a three month suspension, but indicated he was happy for the IAAF to forge its own path on Russia. “I can’t get into that, we have a very different system,” he said. “It’s different because it’s for the international federation to have the primacy over eligibility rules. “The IOC accepted that before Rio. And they recognised the primacy of the IAAF to say: ‘No, we’re not satisfied this is a system which meets the criteria we have set ourselves.’ Russia will come back when that criteria is met and not before.” Meanwhile, the Briton David Burrell, a masters athlete and javelin coach, has been suspended from all sport for a period of four years following an anti-doping rule violation. Burrell was charged with “evading, refusing or failing to submit to sample collection” after being notified of a test last August."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/mar/02/nigeria-boko-haram-abductions-chitra-nagarajan","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-02T08:00:43Z","webTitle":"Focusing on schoolgirl abductions distorts the view of life in Nigeria | Chitra Nagarajan","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/02/nigeria-boko-haram-abductions-chitra-nagarajan","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/02/nigeria-boko-haram-abductions-chitra-nagarajan","fields":{"headline":"Focusing on schoolgirl abductions distorts the view of life in Nigeria","bodyText":"Once again, abducted Nigerian schoolgirls are making international headlines. Last Monday, 110 girls were taken from the Government Girls Science and Technical School in the town of Dapchi in Nigeria’s north-eastern Yobe state. Fighters belonging to one of the armed opposition groups (commonly known as Boko Haram) operating in the area attacked the town and took the girls who were unable to escape. The attack came shortly after the military withdrew troops from the town. Then came a pattern that is familiar to anyone following events in north-east Nigeria, where the abduction of girls from Chibok in April 2014 brought the region to national and global attention. First, there was silence from government officials, followed by disputes in the media about the number of girls missing. Then an announcement that girls had been rescued by the army, which was later retracted. The abductions from Chibok were neither the first nor the last in north-east Nigeria (at least 2,000 women and girls were kidnapped between January 2014 to April 2015, and large numbers of men and boys have also been taken). But, the Chibok case captured international imagination. This focus on abductions shows the kinds of stories that media pick up but it also means we have a partial picture of what is actually going on. Yes, this was greatly due to the hard work of women’s activists in Maiduguri and the phenomenon that was #BringBackOurGirls. It also made a compelling media story and offered the chance for those involved – from journalists to those who tweeted using the hashtag – to take action and feel good about themselves. Those of us working in north-east Nigeria at the time were at the epicentre of an international media circus. Hordes of journalists descended on Abuja, Maiduguri and Chibok, asking the same questions of the same people, often retraumatising family members of the abducted girls in the process. That, almost four years later, we see them in one of the first scenes of Black Panther, the global cultural phenomenon of 2018 so far is telling; Nakia, an intelligence officer played by Lupita Nyong’o is seen undercover in north-east Nigeria’s Sambisa Forest with dozens of girls being transported by armed fighters. It was the obvious choice for film-makers looking for something topical about the African continent that could symbolise the nascent Wakandan saviour complex – in contrast to the reality of women’s activism in north-east Nigeria. All we know or care about when it comes to north-east Nigeria seems to be either abducted schoolgirls or female “suicide bombers”. This level of attention has resulted in differential treatment for those abducted from Chibok compared with everyone else, with high-level negotiations conducted to free them. Every time abducted women and girls are released, the first question asked is whether Chibok girls are among them. Of course we should care about and campaign for action to be taken when it comes to the girls of Dapchi. However, what happened around the Chibok abductions serves as a salutary warning of how media coverage can inadvertently lead to a hierarchy of humanity – some people being valued above others. I have been working on peacebuilding and human rights in north-east Nigeria for almost five years. Last year, I spent weeks interviewing women and men for a gender assessment of the region. I found stories of women and girls choosing to join armed opposition groups. They have taken part in attacks on villages and towns, recruited members, made bombs and recruited others. Women and girls have also been part of militias set up to protect communities. They screen women and girls at checkpoints, fight alongside the men, patrol towns and villages and, in some cases, command groups of fighters, including men. Moreover, women have saved men from being killed, in many cases hiding them in their homes, dressing them in women’s clothing and smuggling them to safety. Indeed, men “of fighting age” – roughly 14 to 50 – are often the first to be killed or detained, leaving women to take on new roles and decision-making power. Even if husbands and fathers are present, men are no longer able to provide for families, meaning women have to find ways of earning incomes, including through “survival sex”. In some cases, this changed dynamic has caused problems in households where men, fearing a loss to their power, try to prove they are the ones still in charge. In other cases, women say they have more power at home and their husbands have to adjust. After all, if he divorces her to marry another, the dynamics with the new wife will be the same. Of course, women suffer greatly during conflict. They are displaced, disabled, killed, lose family and friends, and experience higher levels of gender-based violence. But they are not just victims. Conflict is also a time where women have greater agency – whether they want it or not. This focus on women as victims also means we lose sight of what happens to men and boys. We all know about the Chibok girls but how many of us know about the Buni Yadi boys? A few weeks before the abductions from Chibok, an estimated 59 boys were lined up in the Federal Government College in Buni Yadi, had knives drawn across their throat, were gunned down or burned alive. Seeing only women and girls as victims plays into gendered stereotypes that we must move away from. It also presents a highly distorted version of reality. • Chitra Nagarajan is a writer and activist, working on civilian protection focused on north-east Nigeria."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/2018/mar/02/canada-first-nations-man-offers-land-rent-free-facebook","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-02T10:00:01Z","webTitle":"'This is all stolen': Canadian man offers to share his land with First Nations","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/02/canada-first-nations-man-offers-land-rent-free-facebook","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/mar/02/canada-first-nations-man-offers-land-rent-free-facebook","fields":{"headline":"'This is all stolen': Canadian man offers to share his land with First Nations","bodyText":"Joel Holmberg had been batting the idea around for years.

There would be no bills, no rent, he explained. Instead the family could join him, his wife and two children in living off the land; hunting, fishing and growing food. “I wanted to offer some sort of hope,” said Holmberg. “It was really disgusting to see the way the racist people were speaking. I wanted to let them know that it’s not everyone in Canada that feels that way.” The invitation to share his acreage near Barrhead, about 100km north-west of Edmonton, seemed like a fair one. “We all know in our heart the truth, that this is all stolen land,” said the 45-year-old. “They’re our hosts and we’re their guests and they’ve been criminally abused for far too long and it has to stop.” Holmberg said his appreciation for First Nations culture began as a child growing up in British Columbia, when members of the Sinixt First Nation began bringing him along as they hunted and fished. “I had the opportunity to do sweats with them and learn about their culture from them and learn about the real history of Canada,” he said. He continued to delve into Canada’s rich tapestry of indigenous cultures as he moved around the country, from the Northwest Territories to Manitoba and Saskatchewan. “They’re the kindest people I’ve ever met. They’ve been there for me in the worst times in my life when I needed help the most,” he said. “It is very clear to my family and I, that it is us that will be blessed by this thing happening most of all.” Since posting the offer earlier this week, Holmberg said he had received hundreds of responses from across Canada and the US. “I haven’t made it through all the messages yet … Somehow it turns out I’m the first white person to think about giving the land back since Marlon Brando,” he said, laughing as he referred to the late actor’s decision to hand over 40 acres of land in California to the Survival of American Indians Association in 1974. He said he had yet to hear any negative reactions to his post. But communities across Canada – from Sikh and Muslim groups to Chinese-Canadians – have expressed interest in helping out. Indigenous elders have contacted him about holding ceremonies on the land while others have inquired about buying the farmland surrounding his property so that his project could expand. Holmberg said he had invited all of them to visit the property, although he said his wife – while still excited about the idea – was starting to feel a little overwhelmed. “It’s starting to look like it could be Woodstock around here this summer,” he laughed. In the coming weeks, Holmberg is hoping to meet interested families and tour them around the property. “It’s a really special place here where we are, there’s a lot of wildlife coming to visit here,” he said. “It’s just really beautiful and I think that a traditional family would really feel that kind of magic that’s in the land here.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"media/2018/mar/01/leveson-2-explained-what-was-it-meant-to-achieve","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-01T18:04:02Z","webTitle":"Leveson 2 explained: what was it meant to achieve?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/mar/01/leveson-2-explained-what-was-it-meant-to-achieve","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2018/mar/01/leveson-2-explained-what-was-it-meant-to-achieve","fields":{"headline":"Leveson 2 explained: what was it meant to achieve?","bodyText":"What is Leveson 2? The Leveson inquiry, led by judge Sir Brian Leveson, started in 2011 after it emerged that journalists at Rupert Murdoch’s now defunct News of the World tabloid hacked the phone of murdered school girl Milly Dowler. The first part of the inquiry looked at the culture, practices and ethics of the press. The second part was meant to be an investigation into the relationship between journalists and the police. How does press regulation work at the moment? The Press Complaints Commission, the previous regulator, was shut down before Leveson published his first report. The PCC had been heavily criticised for its handling of the phone-hacking scandal – the former Labour leader Ed Miliband branded it a “toothless poodle”. Under the royal charter drawn up after the inquiry concluded, newspapers that refused to sign up to a regulator recognised by the Press Recognition Panel (PRP) would be penalised. No major newspaper has signed up to a regulator recognised by the PRP. A series of titles including the Daily Mail, the Sun and the Daily Telegraph, are members of the Independent Press Standards Organisation, which has refused to apply for state-backed sanction under the PRP. The Guardian and the FT are independently regulated. Impress, a small regulator backed by Max Mosley, has been recognised. Its members are a group of small websites and blogs. What is section 40 of the Crime and Courts Act? Section 40 would have forced newspapers to cover the legal costs of a claimant in a libel case – even if they win – unless they are signed up to a state-backed regulator. It was fiercely opposed by the newspaper industry, which said the potential for crippling financial penalties would impact free speech, discouraging the press from conducting difficult investigations and holding powerful people to account. How do the arguments of the two sides stack up? Celebrities including Hugh Grant and victims of press abusesay Leveson 2 is necessary to get to the bottom of wrongdoing by the press. Labour’s deputy leader, Tom Watson, said not going ahead with the second part of the inquiry was a “bitter blow to the victims of press intrusion”. Sir Brian Leveson has written to ministers saying that the “extent of wrongdoing [at News UK] has been far greater than the [first] inquiry was informed” and that there was still a “legitimate expectation” of a full public examination. Matt Hancock, the culture secretary, says that almost £50m has been spent on press investigations to date and that the goals of Leveson 2 have largely been met since the first inquiry. He argued that there have been “extensive reforms to policing practices” and “significant changes to press self-regulation”. Hancock said that the press industry faces much greater issues now in the form of the digital challenge. What are those other issues? Hancock said that “the world has changed” since Leveson 1 and that the press is under threat from new digital forces that require “urgent” attention. Traditional publishers are struggling to make up the loss of revenue from the decline in popularity of printed press with digital income. In 2015, for every £100 newspapers lost in print revenue, newspapers only gained £3 in digital revenue. More than 200 local newspapers have closed since 2005. Google and Facebook control more than 60% of the UK digital ad market, with as much as 90% of all new online ad spend going to the two giants. Hancock said the “largely unregulated” social media world threatened high quality journalism with issues including clickbait, fake news, malicious disinformation and online abuse. “These are today’s challenges and this is where we need to focus,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/ng-interactive/2018/mar/02/the-road-to-brexit-did-the-tories-sales-pitch-work","type":"interactive","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-02T09:56:04Z","webTitle":"The 'road to Brexit': did the Tories' sales pitch work?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/ng-interactive/2018/mar/02/the-road-to-brexit-did-the-tories-sales-pitch-work","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/ng-interactive/2018/mar/02/the-road-to-brexit-did-the-tories-sales-pitch-work","fields":{"headline":"The 'road to Brexit': did the Tories' sales pitch work?","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2018/mar/02/lou-reed-lost-poetry-to-be-published","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-02T09:13:08Z","webTitle":"'We are the people who are desperate beyond emotion': Lou Reed's lost poetry to be published","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/mar/02/lou-reed-lost-poetry-to-be-published","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/mar/02/lou-reed-lost-poetry-to-be-published","fields":{"headline":"'We are the people who are desperate beyond emotion': Lou Reed's lost poetry to be published","bodyText":"“We are the crystal gaze returned through the density and immensity of a berserk nation.” It’s a line that could have been written by an angry young poet from Trump’s America, but it was actually penned decades previously, by the bard of New York’s grimy rock’n’roll underbelly: Lou Reed. A collection of the songwriter’s previously unseen poems will be published later this year, along with recordings of him performing them at St Mark’s Church, New York, in 1971 (with Allen Ginsberg in the audience). The book, entitled Do Angels Need Haircuts? and published in April, will also feature an afterword by his widow Laurie Anderson, as well as Reed’s own introductions to the poems. Of the 12 poems and short stories in the collection, only three have been published before, one as a Velvet Underground song and two in small-press poetry zines. The line quoted above is taken from a poem entitled We Are the People, published exclusively for the first time here, along with a recording of it at the St Mark’s Church performance. We are the people without land. We are the people without tradition. We are the people who do not know how to die peacefully and at ease. We are the thoughts of sorrows. Endings of tomorrows. We are the wisps of rulers and the jokers of kings. We are the people without right. We are the people who have known only lies and desperation. We are the people without a country, a voice or a mirror. We are the crystal gaze returned through the density and immensity of a berserk nation. We are the victims of the untold manifesto of the lack of depth of full and heavy emptiness. We are the people without sorrow who have moved beyond national pride and indifference to a parody of instinct. We are the people who are desperate beyond emotion because it defies thought. We are the people who conceive our destruction and carry it out lawfully. We are the insects of someone else’s thought. A casualty of daytime, nighttime, space and god without race, nationality or religion. We are the people. The people. The people. Reed, who died in 2013 and would have turned 76 today, is one of the most distinctive songwriters of the 20th century, first in the Velvet Underground, whose stark, droning take on rock’n’roll pointed the way to punk and became hugely influential. His subsequent solo career featured lush pop hits such as Perfect Day and Walk on the Wild Side as well as the uncompromisingly noisy likes of Metal Machine Music. He recorded over 20 solo albums, including Lulu, a collaboration with Metallica that his one-time producer David Bowie regarded as Reed’s masterpiece. The poetry comes from a six-month period in 1970, after he left the Velvet Underground and went to work for his father’s accounting firm. Within six months, he had reversed his decision to quit music and was writing solo material, but the book gives a fascinating glimpse into his mindset at the time. The rest of the poems are being kept under wraps for now, but the Guardian was granted a sneak preview. Away from the political We Are the People, others reflect on love, sex, and whiskey, and some are droll character studies. Musical references abound – one poem is entitled Playing Music is Not Like Athletics, a kind of philosophical inquiry into the reasons for making music, while another, The Murder Mystery, is an epic concrete poem in “stereo”, with different coloured lines of poetry printed alongside each other, almost like a multitracked song. It was recorded by the Velvet Underground and included on their self-titled third album. The poems are part of Lou Reed’s archive, acquired by the New York Public Library following Reed’s death. “The Lou Reed Archive has been keen to to publish some of the rare and unique material from the diverse and extraordinary collection of Lou’s life’s work, and we decided to start with these poems,” said archivist Don Fleming, who has co-produced the book. “Lou was a writer at heart, and during this period he considered giving up music to follow this path. Finding Lou’s own cassette tape in the archive, that he recorded at the event, was very exciting because we knew about the reading but had little idea of what he had read. His introductions to the pieces also gave us great insight into his creative process.” He added that he was “happy to share this lesser-known but important chapter in his life.” The literary critic and head of UCL’s English literature department, John Mullan – a self-professed Reed fan – had a muted response on seeing the poetry, however, saying Reed “is not afraid to court banality”. He added that some of the poems “look like, and read like, the transcripts of songs. We all know what Lou Reed’s voice sounds like, and you find yourself projecting that amazing voice onto the poems, backed with some sort of doomy bassline. They almost live as songs but I don’t think they survive the journey to the page; what was a heady quality in the songs is not a heady quality in the poems.” Reed is far from the first rock star to – with varying levels of dilettantism – write poetry outside of their song lyrics. In 1964 as the Beatles’ career was going supernova, John Lennon published In His Own Write, a collection of surreal, free-associative poems and short stories – “I typed a lot of the book, and I can only do it very slowly with a finger, so the stories would be very short because I couldn’t be bothered going on,” he said in a 1968 interview. Bob Dylan’s Tarantula, written in 1965, is a Beat-inspired poetic stream of consciousness, while more recently Tupac Shakur, Ryan Adams, Jill Scott and Tom Waits have all published poetry collections. In 1996, REM frontman Michael Stipe and six friends each wrote a haiku poem every day, and posted them to each other – 365 of them were collected for the resulting book The Haiku Year. One of the most significant rock star poets is Reed’s friend Patti Smith, who has published numerous collections of her verse. In her speech for the posthumous induction of Reed to the Rock’n’Roll Hall of Fame, she declared that “as a poet, he must be counted as a solitary artist. And so, Lou, thank you for brutally and benevolently injecting your poetry into music.” • We Are the People is taken from Do Angels Need Haircuts?, published by Anthology Editions, © 2018 Canal Street Communications, Inc."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"artanddesign/2018/mar/05/how-we-made-tower-of-london-poppies-paul-cummins-tom-piper","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-05T17:08:54Z","webTitle":"How we made: the Tower of London poppies","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/mar/05/how-we-made-tower-of-london-poppies-paul-cummins-tom-piper","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2018/mar/05/how-we-made-tower-of-london-poppies-paul-cummins-tom-piper","fields":{"headline":"How we made the Tower of London poppies","bodyText":"Paul Cummins, artist One rainy day in 2012, I ducked into my local library for shelter and, for some reason, started looking at wills. I found one written by a woman from Derby who had disguised herself as a man and gone off to fight – and die – in the first world war. She had written her will phonetically, which made it easier for me to read as I’m dyslexic. That was one reason why I connected with it. Another was the phrase: “Blood swept lands and seas of red where angels fear to tread.” It leapt out at me, made me think about the war’s death toll. With a bit of research, I discovered that there had been 888,246 British and Colonial military fatalities. I decided to represent those deaths through ceramic flowers, something I had first started making at university. Ceramics are transient and fragile, like we are. They feel part of our very humanity – societies have always been carbon-dated by their ceramics and pottery. I considered making roses, which symbolised sacrifice in Victorian times, but I settled on the poppy because of its links to war and remembrance. I needed a large space so that people could walk all around the installation. While I wanted it to be free, I was keen to have a venue that was historically significant. The Tower of London was the fourth place I tried. I got put through to someone by sheer chance: the Tower’s deputy governor has a friend also called Paul Cummins and they thought I was him. I didn’t stop talking until a meeting had been agreed. Then I did lots of drawings and presented them with a flower I’d made to show them what it might look like. Making nearly one million ceramic poppies is a long process. Each had six petals, one for each charity I wanted to support with money raised from selling the poppies afterwards. I did nothing but make flowers for almost a year: 300 people at three different sites rolled, cut and shaped every poppy by hand. Each one is unique. By the time we’d stacked them all up to dry, on piles of boards raised by bricks, the studio looked like it was full of trenches. We sprayed them red and counted them in and out, then the Beefeaters counted them all again at the Tower. This was vital. Every single life had to be represented.A huge team of volunteers planted them all in the moat. One, a soldier who’d been injured by an explosion in Afghanistan that had killed half his regiment, told me the poppies he was planting represented the friends he had lost. As you looked out onto the sea of red, you felt overwhelmed by the thought of so many people sacrificing themselves for what we have now. Tom Piper, designer Of course it was an exciting and bold project, but at the point of planning I was worried that there would be so much first world war memorabilia and associated events that people wouldn’t be interested and that first world war fatigue would have set in. I started thinking about whether there was a way it could relate more closely to, and engage with, the Tower itself. Given that you can’t see the moat until you’re right on top of it, we needed something you could see from a distance. So I designed Weeping Window: the moment you came out of the tube station, you could see poppies cascading out of the Tower’s bastion window. It became the starting point, the place all the poppies flowed out from and crept around the Tower. A second section, Wave, was visible from across the river. Planting all 888,246 poppies was a huge undertaking. It became a piece of performative art lasting four months, with people watching the volunteers at work and often applauding. Many of the planters had service backgrounds and brought their own powerful stories. Others identified an individual flower with a relative who’d died in the war and thus the planting became ever more meaningful. I sprayed contour guidance lines around the moat for the volunteers to follow, but they quickly started doing their own thing – putting higher ones in with lower ones and mixing things up, so that some areas were densely populated, others sparse. It made for a more living organic piece with its own natural energy and flow. The Tower didn’t do a massive publicity campaign. Nobody really knew what we were doing. As we were planting, people would ask: “What are you up to?” So its huge success took us all by surprise. It was a genuine word of mouth phenomenon. The last poppy went in on 11 November 2014 and the next day we started taking it down. There were calls to save the poppies, but we needed to get the flowers to the people who had bought them, not least as Paul had to recoup the costs of making them and get the promised money to the six charities. Two sections, Weeping Window and Wave, were bought and gifted to the nation, which meant we could tour them around Britain. By the time we finish in November, as many as five million people around the country will have seen the poppies. 14-18 NOW’s national tour of Weeping Window and Wave begins on 14 March."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"film/2018/mar/02/guillermo-del-toro-mexico-oscars","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-02T12:33:17Z","webTitle":"Guillermo del Toro out to complete Oscar glory for Mexico's 'Three Amigos'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/mar/02/guillermo-del-toro-mexico-oscars","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/mar/02/guillermo-del-toro-mexico-oscars","fields":{"headline":"Guillermo del Toro out to complete Oscar glory for Mexico's 'Three Amigos'","bodyText":"Guillermo del Toro has the opportunity to continue an unlikely streak of Mexican success at the Academy Awards on Sunday. If, as expected, the Guadalajara-born film-maker wins the best director Oscar for his fantasy drama The Shape of Water at this year’s ceremony, it will be the fourth time a Mexican has taken home the prize in the last five years, after Alfonso Cuarón won in 2014 and Alejandro González Iñárritu in 2015 and 2016. The three directors, close friends who are often referred to in the industry as the “Three Amigos”, have transformed their nation’s fortunes at the Academy Awards while proving major draws at the international box office. All three have proved as adept at managing grand Hollywood productions as they are at working on smaller homegrown films. Del Toro has directed big-budget blockbusters including Pacific Rim as well as Spanish-language magic-realist works such as Pan’s Labyrinth. Cuarón masterminded the audacious deep-space thriller Gravity (for which he won the best director Oscar) and was handed the reins of a Harry Potter film, but has also made more intimate, Mexico-set dramas such as Y Tu Mamá También. Iñárritu, who made his name with the savage dog-fighting drama Amores Perros, has burnished a reputation for technically complex films starring Hollywood A-listers, including Oscar best picture winner Birdman, starring Michael Keaton, and the Leonardo DiCaprio-fronted survival epic The Revenant, both of which landed him best director Oscars. If the mainstream success of the Three Amigos seems a recent phenomenon, it is one that has been built decades of work. “As Del Toro says, it has taken him more than 20 years to get to where he is now,” says Anna Marie de la Fuente, a journalist who covers the Latin American film industry for Variety. “Like many immigrants before them, they have been embraced by Hollywood thanks to their prodigious raw talent, perseverance, hard work and, in some measure, luck.” Crucial too has been the involvement of the Mexican film industry. “A raft of initiatives in past decades have helped the likes of these film-makers and many before and after them, so it can take some credit for their success,” says De la Fuente. It’s not just the Amigos who have benefited: Emmanuel Lubezki, a regular collaborator with Cuarón and Iñárritu, is regarded as one of cinema’s pre-eminent cinematographers and is the only person to have picked up three consecutive Academy Awards for cinematography. The Three Amigos have now largely left Mexican cinema behind for more universal, English-language films, though not entirely: later this year Cuarón will release Roma, a 70s-set drama about a middle-class family in Mexico City. Still, even if the trio are as much now the property of Hollywood as they are of their home country, there’s a decent chance of the next Del Toro, Cuarón or Iñárritu emerging soon, says De la Fuente. “Mexico has been churning out more than a hundred films a year thanks to more tax incentives, in particular, one called Eficine which, since 2006, gives incentives to private investors in film. So there are many opportunities for new talent to emerge.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"culture/2018/mar/01/trevor-noah-ben-carson-daily-show-colbert-meyers-round-up","type":"article","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-01T16:45:05Z","webTitle":"Trevor Noah slams Ben Carson's 'gold-plated' chairs and 'shady' spending","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2018/mar/01/trevor-noah-ben-carson-daily-show-colbert-meyers-round-up","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/2018/mar/01/trevor-noah-ben-carson-daily-show-colbert-meyers-round-up","fields":{"headline":"Trevor Noah slams Ben Carson's 'gold-plated' chairs and 'shady' spending","bodyText":"Late-night hosts on Wednesday discussed the bipartisan meeting on gun violence held at the White House and controversy at the Department of Housing and Urban Development (Hud) over secretary Ben Carson’s spending habits. Trevor Noah Trevor Noah discussed the Hud secretary, Ben Carson, who has found himself in hot water after his spending habits at the department were revealed. “You may disagree with Ben Carson’s views, but you have to admire a man who’s so consistently committed to saving money,” Noah said. “Unless, it’s all bullshit.” The host showed news coverage of the latest controversy at Hud, where a whistleblower was demoted after refusing to spend over the legal $5,000 limit on redecorations for Carson’s office. “Yesterday morning when this news broke, Carson’s people denied that he was out there buying gold-plated chairs, and that was cool for a few hours until this came out,” Noah continued, noting further reports that Carson spent $31,000 on a dining room set. “The Guardian reported that his department just spent over $160,000 on lounge furniture,” the host explained, before detailing drastic spending cuts to the department and showing Carson refusing to respond to a congressman’s questions about the department’s cuts to housing vouchers and community development block grants. “Ben Carson is clearly doing some shady shit at his department,” Noah concluded. “I do think this is probably why the secretary was so evasive last year when Congress was questioning him about his budget.” Stephen Colbert “The president invited members of Congress for a bipartisan meeting to address gun violence in America,” Stephen Colbert began. “Trump immediately made clear the real obstacle to gun control: Barack Obama.” The host went on to show footage from the meeting, in which Trump continually suggested that the failure to pass gun control legislation was Obama’s fault. “I distinctly remember how the Republicans were begging Obama to sign the GOP gun control bill but Obama couldn’t get it done because Americans demanded to keep their guns to shoot down all the flying pigs,” Colbert joked, before explaining what was perhaps the most surprising moment of the televised meeting. Colbert said: “When vice-president Pence suggested an early intervention system that allows courts to take away people’s guns after a hearing, Trump said this: ‘Take the guns first, due process second.’” The comment shocked some people as a rebuke by Trump of his own party. “Well, he’s finally doing something Obama never did,” Colbert quipped. “He’s coming for your guns.” Colbert also had former White House adviser Omarosa Manigault-Newman on the show, and the two discussed her time working for Trump and comments she made on Big Brother suggesting she was haunted by Trump’s tweets and that “everything is not going to be OK.” “What was it about the tweets that haunted you?” Colbert asked. “He announced major policy issues on Twitter,” Omarosa responded. “The transgender ban, for instance, was announced on Twitter. For someone who is in communications like Hope [Hicks] and myself, that’s not a thing you want to find out at five in the morning about something that will impact so many people’s lives.” In response to a pointed question from Colbert about Omarosa having compared the White House to a “plantation”, she said: “The White House that I worked in was troubling. It was very difficult when you aren’t allowed to do the job that you were brought to do. That’s where that oppression comes from and that’s what that analogy meant. I was speaking as how I felt as the only African American senior adviser to President Donald Trump.” Seth Meyers Finally, Seth Meyers addressed the removal of Jared Kushner’s top-level security clearance and Trump’s open-door meeting on gun violence. “Carson is not the only high-level official mired in scandal at the moment,” Meyers said. “There’s also the president’s son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner, who on Friday was stripped of his high-level security clearance. “Kushner had access to the nation’s most guarded secrets through his temporary clearance,” the host continued, “and yesterday we learned more about Kushner’s conflicts of interests and how other countries may have sought to use those conflicts against him.” Meyers then showed news coverage detailing how four countries, Mexico, Israel, China and the United Arab Emirates, looked to exploit Kushner’s complex business arrangements, financial difficulties, and lack of foreign policy experience. “While more and more of Trump’s aides come under legal and ethical scrutiny, he’s also struggling to deal with the nation’s epidemic of gun violence,” the host added, noting that Trump seemed to express relative support for every idea suggested at Wednesday’s meeting. “Here’s the thing: we’ve been through with Trump before,” Meyers said. “In January Trump held a similar bipartisan meeting on immigration where he said he would support a compromise and then completely changed his mind. And that’s because Trump changes his mind based on the last person he’s spoken with.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"film/2018/mar/02/i-was-terrified-i-was-going-to-be-a-flash-in-the-pan-three-people-who-made-hollywood-history","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-02T06:00:13Z","webTitle":"'I was terrified I was going to be a flash in the pan': the people who made Oscars history","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/mar/02/i-was-terrified-i-was-going-to-be-a-flash-in-the-pan-three-people-who-made-hollywood-history","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/mar/02/i-was-terrified-i-was-going-to-be-a-flash-in-the-pan-three-people-who-made-hollywood-history","fields":{"headline":"'I was terrified I was going to be a flash in the pan': the people who made Oscars history","bodyText":"Rachel Morrison, the first Oscar-nominated female cinematographer If Rachel Morrison had her way, she would be in hiding until after the Oscars on Sunday. Morrison is a cinematographer – part of a tribe that generally prefers to keep a low profile. “We specialise in being behind the camera. It’s strange to suddenly be in front of it.” As Hollywood faces up to #MeToo and #TimesUp, Morrison has been thrust into the spotlight as the smasher of three glass ceilings in as many months: making Oscar history as the first woman to earn a best cinematography nomination, for her work on Mudbound; the first woman to shoot a Marvel movie, Ryan Coogler’s Black Panther; and being the first woman to be nominated by her peers for the American Society of Cinematographers award. It’s lunchtime in Los Angeles, and Morrison is dropping off her car at the garage (this is the only window in her diary that her agent could find to speak to the Guardian). The attention has been overwhelming, Morrison says: “It’s being in demand and being quite exhausted. I have a three-year-old and I’m working …” Her voice trails off. In my experience of film sets, the cinematographer – or director of photography (DP) – is treated with almost as much godlike reverence as the director. But among filmgoers there is confusion about what a cinematographer does. In nuts-and-bolts terms, she or he (usually he; more on that in a bit) heads up the camera, grip and electric departments, which puts them in charge of the biggest crew on set. Morrison is not convinced that she explains the nitty-gritty of her job very well to people. “My dad, before he passed away, never understood what I did. What I say is that I’m responsible for translating the director’s vision, hopefully turning an idea into something people can connect to and relate to.” What that meant on Mudbound was creating its lived-in, gritty aesthetic. Directed by Dee Rees, the film follows two families – one black, one white – farming the same land in 40s Mississippi. For Morrison, authenticity is everything, visualising emotions as images that look and feel real. In Mudbound her two female leads, Mary J Blige and Carey Mulligan, look done in: beautiful, yes, but battered by a hard life and sweating, with dirt caked under their nails and not a trace of Hollywood gloss. “I find beauty in imperfection,” Morrison says. “I love faces that have freckles. I love faces that have wrinkles. For me, beauty is naturalism, I guess.” Cinematography, she adds, should be invisible: “I generally feel that if you notice the cinematographer we’re getting something wrong.” Growing up, Morrison starting snapping photos on her mum’s camera aged six or seven. She got the movie bug in her teens and never looked back: “I realised that there was an incredible job where you could take 24 photos a second.” What draws her to a film, I ask? “I pour my blood, sweat and tears into a movie. What I always look for is a message and a social consciousness; a relevance to what’s happening in our world.” She was disappointed that her first movie with Coogler, Fruitvale Station, based on the real-life police killing of a young black man, didn’t make a difference: “I had this dream that they would show Fruitvale in police precincts across the country. It didn’t come to pass. That was a bit of a wake-up call.” But then again, Black Panther, has far exceeded her expectations: “We just hoped it would resonate. Best-case scenario: we were going to provide a chance for young children of colour to see a superhero who looks like them. Then it created a whole movement. People are setting up voter registration at Black Panther screenings. I do think you get enough of the magic.” The reason Morrison is gritting her teeth and giving interviews before the Oscars is in the hope of helping to shake up the gender imbalance in her profession. Of the 250 top-grossing films in the US last year, only 4% had female cinematographers (that’s lower than women directors, at 11%). Does Morrison understand why representation is so bad? “No. I really don’t. Cinematography speaks to everything women do inherently well. To me, cinematography is all about empathy, which women are groomed to be very good at. It’s about picking up on the subtlety of emotion; about multitasking. So no, I never have an answer for why so few, other than history. It becomes the norm. It’s our job to get people unused to it. We need to get to a point where when you say ‘DP’, people don’t picture a dude.” And spare a thought for her on Sunday night. While most showbiz types live for Oscars night, Morrison is extremely nervous. Winning would be an honour, but the prospect is keeping her awake at night. “I live in fear of public speaking,” she says. “I take Xanax just to get through panel interviews. I’m absolutely terrified. I also live in fear of high heels.” Cath Clarke Yance Ford: the first Oscar-nominated transgender director Yance Ford is the first openly transgender director to have a film nominated for an Oscar. Or is he? “Look, I’m a data wonk,” he chuckles down the line from New York. “Something tells me history will be revised after a little more research. If it turns out to be true, that’s great. But when people say I’m making history, I’m like: ‘Let’s just make sure.’” Putting aside this healthy scepticism, his achievement is impressive, as is his film, Strong Island, a Sundance special jury award-winner now in contention for the Oscar for best documentary feature. It centres on the fatal shooting in 1992 of Ford’s older brother, William, during an argument at a Long Island garage. The situation seemed clearcut. William was a law-abiding 24-year-old teacher, and Ford remembers thinking: “The system is gonna work for us. We’ll get the chance to represent the evidence.” He reckoned without institutional racism. The Fords are an African American family; the killer was white. The case never got to court. Race is necessarily one of the dominant themes of the picture, which shows how the segregation of black communities contributed to tensions on Long Island. But just as important is its engagement with two other issues that have lost none of their relevance: gun violence and queer identity. “In 1992, in the suburban working-class community where I grew up, no one would have guessed there would be a gun on the premises,” reflects the director. “The fist fight was the thing everyone expected. That was how masculinity was expressed, almost like the Sharks and the Jets.” And today? “I would never even speak to another person who seemed agitated. Even in a minor fender bender [road accident], I have sat in the car and waited for the police to arrive because that’s the safest option.” Though Ford plays down the historic significance of his Oscar nod (“I’m happy and honoured, but that’s as far as that story goes”), he will acknowledge that the nomination should foreground the queer elements in the film for those audiences who might otherwise overlook them. “I don’t think I present as gender-conforming on screen, but some people need a little extra information. I have heard it said that this isn’t really a queer film. And I’ve been, like: ‘Wow. Maybe I should have turned the volume up louder.’ There’s a whole section on me coming out.” He talks movingly on-screen about a phone call William made to him a few weeks before his death, in which he seemed to be confiding in him man-to-man rather than brother-to-sister. Ford never came out to William; it was in that moment, though, that he felt properly “seen” by his brother. Race and gender are weighty issues, but there is another, more footling, prejudice that Strong Island will have to overcome if it is to take the Oscar on Sunday. The film is a Netflix production, which guarantees the antipathy of some voters. Peter Bart, a former editor of Variety, said recently: “I don’t want to see Netflix’s streaming universe get rewarded with Oscars based on a symbolic one-week theatre opening.” Ford has no truck with this argument. “No one who looked at the amount of festivals and screening engagements we have had could say the film hasn’t had a theatrical presence. And there are lots of theatres in communities where I want my film to be seen that simply don’t run films like mine. Am I supposed to say: ‘Tough luck’?” In other words, every film can’t be Black Panther. “Exactly!” he whoops. “I’m psyched that Black Panther is gonna join the billion-dollar club and I fully anticipate the same thing for A Wrinkle in Time. But if we don’t start to appreciate how people can and can’t access cinema, we will be having this argument in a vacuum of our own making.” Ryan Gilbey Strong Island is available to stream on Netflix. John Singleton: the youngest-ever Oscar-nominated director, and first African American Oscar-nominated director “Yeah, I was nervous: ‘I’m on the world’s stage. I’m just a kid. What do I know?’” John Singleton is recalling Oscars night 1992, when he was both the first African American and the youngest ever film-maker to be nominated for best director, for his debut Boyz N the Hood. He was 24 years old. He was also nominated for best original screenplay. Singleton also had to go up and present the best documentary award with Spike Lee. Where Lee simply looked pissed off, Singleton looked decidedly hot under his bow tie. “I was just trying to make sure I read the teleprompter right. I couldn’t be cavalier and cool about it, no matter how hard I tried.” That wasn’t all Singleton was nervous about: “My biggest fear was that I was going to be a flash in the pan. I was thinking about Orson Welles, who got nominated at 25 [for Citizen Kane]. I didn’t want to be like that: you do something spectacular your first shot and then, no matter what you do, you can’t follow it up.” It was momentous enough that Singleton had been able to make Boyz N the Hood at all. The film was an authentic, semi-autobiographical story of young men growing up in 80s South Central Los Angeles (now South Los Angeles), in a landscape of poverty, prejudice and gang violence. Its African American cast consisted largely of then-unknowns, including Cuba Gooding Jr, Ice Cube and Morris Chestnut, as well as the established star Laurence Fishburne. “There had been very few historical precedents for me,” he says. “The first African American hired by a studio to direct a film was only in my lifetime and that was Gordon Parks [for 1969’s The Learning Tree].” Singleton is quick to acknowledge Lee, his friend and co-presenter that night. There had been uproar the previous year at the Academy’s lack of appreciation for Lee’s Do the Right Thing, which, despite critical and commercial acclaim only earned best screenplay and best supporting actor nominations. “The year that happened was the year that I got a chance to make a movie,” says Singleton. “I got out of film school in spring 1990, so they were looking for the next Spike Lee, the next black film-maker with the vision to make a mark in commercial Hollywood. So I was the guy. They gave me a chance, gave me $6m to make a movie, and I knocked it out of the park!” Singleton was in Las Vegas at a film convention when he found out he had been nominated. “I was half-asleep, watching it on TV in the morning. I was like: ‘Wow!’ And then I had to get up and go to the bathroom,” he laughs. “Maybe it was out of nervousness I was going to wet my pants, who knows?” Nerves aside, Singleton enjoyed the experience of the ceremony: “It was cool. It was the first time I ever got my nails done. They massage your shoulders and give you all this pampering, and put you in a great outfit. And then they push you out in front of these cameras. It was all new to me.” He didn’t expect to win and didn’t have a speech prepared (best director went to Jonathan Demme for The Silence of the Lambs), but the recognition cemented Singleton’s ambition, he says. “It made me think even more about how important it is to strive to make interesting work and to have an identity as a film-maker, and not give into the hype of what Hollywood does. It builds you up and then, if you’re not a settled person in your mind, you start to think the world revolves around you, instead of just being a student of what this thing is.” The next morning, he began rehearsals for his next movie: Poetic Justice, starring Janet Jackson and Tupac Shakur. Singleton was not a flash in the pan. He has rarely been out of work since. He is now back in South Los Angeles, shooting his TV series Snowfall, which almost picks up where Boyz N the Hood left off. Furthermore, the 90s moment that put black film-makers such as Lee and Singleton on the map paved the way for black nominees such as Steve McQueen (Twelve Years a Slave) and Barry Jenkins (Moonlight). Jordan Peele could be the first black director to win the prize outright this year, underlining how far things can come, if also how far they still have to go. “That moment propagated and became a whirlwind,” says Singleton. “And now that moment is the new normal.” Steve Rose"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"higher-education-network/2018/mar/14/black-academic-expert-race-university","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-14T07:30:05Z","webTitle":"I’m a black academic – that doesn't mean I want to be an expert on race | Jennifer Chisholm","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/2018/mar/14/black-academic-expert-race-university","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/higher-education-network/2018/mar/14/black-academic-expert-race-university","fields":{"headline":"I’m a black academic – that doesn't mean I want to be an expert on race","bodyText":"After months of trying to find the perfect project proposal for my sociology PhD applications, I thought I had it: I would research myself. Well, not exactly myself, but I would propose to research racial discrimination in Brazil. Being black and an aspiring academic, I knew that my proposal to study race in Brazil would be advantageous for two reasons: I’d likely be one of a very small number of students studying race in the department (which ended up being the case) and I also knew I’d be seen as somewhat of an authority on the subject. I chose to write about race in Brazil, and not the US, because I didn’t want to focus too much on myself, and I’d already explored the topic in earlier research. In truth, race is the only topic I’ve felt confident writing about. Shortly after my acceptance on to the PhD programme, I started having doubts about my plan. I would imagine defending my dissertation, alone with two – likely white – reviewers. I pictured these examiners grilling me and providing useful feedback on my methods or argument, but clamming up and deferring to me when it came to talking about race. There is, after all, a general lack of black, Asian and minority ethnic academics in UK universities. During my first year, I realised that I’d restricted myself academically. I panicked, thinking that if I didn’t change direction I would only know about black racial issues. I would be a black academic who only studied black people – and who only had something to say about black things. I began to seriously question whether anyone would take me seriously if I didn’t research myself or people like me. I struggle because I know that my previous research qualifies me to talk about race regardless of my racial background, but I also know that studying race hasn’t been entirely my own choice – social pressures have led me to this route. On my undergraduate courses in the US, I was urged to bring my unique perspective to my essays. I realised that my instructors often wanted and expected me to provide a so-called black perspective. I succeeded academically by doing this. But the assumption that minority students in the social sciences should research race severely restricts our scope – and what we’re expected to be knowledgeable about. It’s as damaging as the assumption that women naturally affiliate with gender studies. We shouldn’t abandon race in our research, and I will talk about race in my dissertation, though it won’t have the same prominence as it did when I first proposed the project. Racial and ethnic studies remain important inside and outside of academia. Those of us who research race and ethnicity are especially well positioned to address the current demands of academia, like calls from students in UK universities to decolonise their curricula. Besides, it sometimes feels that if BAME academics didn’t research race, no one would. But all of us – especially those of us just starting out – should have the courage to rely on our “unique” perspectives less and to research people outside of our own racial and ethnic groups. BAME social scientists need to know that we can be experts in other things. A black academic can be as knowledgeable about indigenous land rights in Norway as she is about institutional racism in universities, or any other topic that directly affects her. Creating truly diverse and inclusive academic institutional cultures isn’t achieved solely through steps like increasing the number of academics from racial minority backgrounds. There must also be nurturing and supportive environments for researchers of colour where we can be led by our skills and curiosity, and not just by our race.

But why join the herd?","bodyText":"So: Jordan B Peterson. This column has resisted comment so far on the biggest self-help sensation in years – the subject of approximately a gazillion media profiles – because I don’t know what to think. Clearly, he’s got some obnoxious followers, including those who spat misogynistic venom at Channel 4’s Cathy Newman, after she subjected their hero to an ordinarily aggressive British TV interview. He’s also too fond of explaining differences between men and women in terms of evolution, no matter how flimsy the evidence. (And who knows what else lurks on the hours of YouTube videos I haven’t watched?) On the other hand, it’s equally clear that many of his detractors have barely opened his bestseller, 12 Rules for Life, a sprawling, often brilliant, sometimes infuriating book built around the core message that life works best if you take responsibility instead of blaming others, tell the truth, pursue meaning over fleeting pleasure, give your day some structure and tidy your room. If rudderless young men are flocking to him in droves, that’s hardly a bad thing. I hope they follow his advice: we’d all be better off. But lately, my wishy-washy ambivalence about Peterson has hardened into defiance: why the hell should I be obliged to decide, as seemingly every writer who encounters his work thinks they are, whether Canada’s most controversial professor is A Good Thing or A Bad Thing? This sort of pressure isn’t limited to Peterson, of course. It’s a symptom of our hyper-partisan times, in which everything is politics – every film, book and sporting event, plus all the regular politics – and it’s your responsibility, as a good citizen, to adopt and then feverishly defend one sharply defined, absolutist viewpoint, come what may. Journalists are undoubtedly among the worst offenders. But spend three minutes on Twitter, or the comment sections beneath our articles, if you think it’s only us. This attitude is especially badly suited to evaluating life advice of the kind that Peterson dispenses. After all, it makes little sense to reject an insight that strikes you as useful simply because the source is wrong about other things, or because you dislike their politics. (Even the cartoonist Scott Adams, now a cynical Trump-booster, wrote a pretty good book on productivity.) For instance, Peterson’s counsel to “treat yourself as if you were someone you were responsible for helping” gets more profound the more you reflect on it, I think. And his peppy tips for digging yourself out of a rut are splendid: “Ask yourself: ‘Is there one thing that exists in disarray in your life or your situation that you could, and would, set straight?’ Then ask yourself, ‘What could I do, that I would do, that would accomplish that, and what small thing would I like as a reward?’” Cheesy, perhaps. But would you rather mock the cheesiness, or get out of that rut? Pledging undying allegiance to a guru’s every word is pathetic, but rejecting his every word on principle is just the same patheticness inverted. Are you really so weak-willed that you fear you’ll tumble headlong into the cult if you dip into his work? As Peterson might put it: have some damned self-respect! Read this M Scott Peck’s The Road Less Travelled, with its famous opening observation that “life is difficult”, offers a complementary, less pugnacious version of Peterson’s outlook. oliver.burkeman@theguardian.com."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"crosswords/quiptic/955","type":"crossword","sectionId":"crosswords","sectionName":"Crosswords","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-05T00:00:09Z","webTitle":"Quiptic crossword No 955","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/quiptic/955","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/crosswords/quiptic/955","fields":{"headline":"Quiptic crossword No 955","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"books/2018/mar/07/river-esther-kinsky-review-an-outsiders-view-of-londons-edgelands","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-07T12:00:07Z","webTitle":"River by Esther Kinsky review – an outsider’s view of London’s edgelands","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/mar/07/river-esther-kinsky-review-an-outsiders-view-of-londons-edgelands","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/mar/07/river-esther-kinsky-review-an-outsiders-view-of-londons-edgelands","fields":{"headline":"River by Esther Kinsky review – an outsider’s view of London’s edgelands","bodyText":"A woman walks around the streets and river paths of the Lea Valley in east London – that fine example of British “edgelands”, where the urban, pastoral and industrial continually overlap and erase each other. She is an outsider and an immigrant, and many of the people she encounters “drifting in the river of the city” are immigrants, too: Katz the greengrocer; the Croat who runs a charity shop for Bosnian refugees; a former circus performer. This last character is from Germany, like the author, who grew up on the banks of the Rhine and has felt drawn to rivers ever since. Little happens in River. Characters are held at a distance, dialogue is largely absent, and the 37 chapters could probably be read in any order with no loss of narrative sense. Esther Kinsky’s unnamed narrator observes and remembers, piling up beautiful, silt-like layers of description and memory until it becomes difficult to know which is which. If you think this sounds like something by WG Sebald, who mapped out his own literary edgeland between history- and place-writing, memoir and fiction, you’d be right. The same lugubrious tone pervades this book, the same ghosts of European history lower on its horizon. I doubt there’s been a more Sebaldian sentence written in the years since his death than: “Again and again during those wind-buffeted weeks, I picked up my battered suitcase with the intention of setting off on a journey.” Kinsky is more interested in people than Sebald, however, and more in touch with the modern city and its inhabitants. This is a book to relish for its precise descriptions of landscape and weather, for its interest in the detritus of other people’s lives that we routinely overlook, and for its international reach as well as its localised intensities, all wonderfully evoked in Iain Galbraith’s translation: A calm winter’s day under a white covering of cloud had given way to the sort of rain London was capable of at practically any time of year, with grey-brown, brightly lined clouds and the salty metallic smack of marshland at low tide, when the wind blew in from the estuary and covered everything in a fine film. Above all, it is a reminder of what a privilege it is to see your home afresh, through an outsider’s eyes and words. • River is published by Fitzcarraldo editions.

To be treated with respect","bodyText":"I recently led a survey of students across my university at all levels of study. We wanted to discover what students felt we did well so we could encourage more of the same and celebrate our successes, hoping to improve our scores in the National Student Survey and the teaching excellence framework. But the findings took us all by surprise. The feedback from the 1,000 responses was pleasingly positive in some areas. We felt smug that our students largely appreciated our efforts. But there was an unsettling, underlying narrative in the responses which felt shocking. Students were essentially asking: why don’t academics have more humanity? They highlighted the lack of kindness, integrity and understanding when academic staff were interacting with them. Seemingly these are the things students really want more of – and so they should. We all deserve these in our lives. Of course, this was not the only point the students raised. There were more familiar complaints about the lack of free printing, better IT systems, better organisation and timetabling of lectures, 24-hour library access, and so on. But the responses made me wonder what has gone wrong. Students identified kindness, integrity and understanding as the most important things that would improve or change their student experience. These things are fundamental. Was I wrong to have assumed that all academic staff would simply be kind and treat students with respect? Then the penny dropped. Maybe some academics have little appreciation of how their behaviour impacts on and influences students. When asking for understanding, students highlighted the importance of acknowledging difference – different experiences, backgrounds, personal commitments and prior learning. They didn’t want to be treated like a homogenous group. When alluding to kindness, students talked about wanting academic staff to have empathy and compassion, to smile and encourage. Most revealingly, they asked academics “to treat and talk to me as though I’m a person”. This is pretty devastating: it’s hard to see how anyone can learn and develop when they feel like that. Some academics act with contempt and irritation for the very people they should want to inspire, educate and collaborate with. Perhaps we have lost our self awareness. Maybe we have forgotten the point of higher education. It is possible that we are so browbeaten ourselves that we’ve lost our sense of common decency. How did this happen? Maybe we have been co-opted into believing this is how higher education is, repeating a mantra like “they’re adults”, “it’s spoon-feeding”, “they’re here to read for a degree” or “if you’re nice to them they’ll just want more”. Perhaps we need to stop and take a moment to think about the damaging effect of this type of behaviour. If we all took a bit more responsibility for our own actions and the actions of others, we could make a difference. We could change the culture and be more collegiate, care a little more and perhaps even begin to reprioritise the most important things. As academics, we might fear the repercussions of questioning our behaviour. Maybe we don’t have the energy, believing it to be too difficult. But I hope we do it, because treating our students with humanity is vital. Join the higher education network for more comment, analysis and job opportunities, direct to your inbox.

Here’s what they can do","bodyText":"University should be one of the best times of your life. Independent for the first time, you’re surrounded by new people, new experiences and new knowledge. For many, it’s a time of exploration and self-discovery – and lots of hangovers. For others, however, the experience isn’t so pleasant. A new report from Revolt Sexual Assault and The Student Room lays bare the brutal scale of sexual violence at UK universities: it seems that the majority of students are not having such a good time after all. A total of 4,500 students from 153 different UK institutions responded to the study – the first consultation of students on this issue in a decade. What it found was shocking: 62% of students and graduates have experienced sexual violence as per the definition used by Rape Crisis. Groping, harassment, unwanted touching, coercion, sexual assault, rape – all commonplace, it turns out, in UK universities. Shockingly, 8% of female respondents said they had been raped at university – double the 4% of all women in England and Wales that the Office for National Statistics estimates. Perhaps even more shocking is how few victims feel able to report crimes to their universities. We already know how low rates of reporting to the police are – Rape Crisis England and Wales says about 15% of those who experience sexual violence report it to the police. Clearly this is an issue for universities, too. Only 6% of respondents reported their experiences to their university; only 2% felt both able to report and satisfied with the reporting process. The figures come shortly after the University of Cambridge admitted to “a significant problem” with sexual misconduct following the introduction of a new anonymous reporting system that led to 173 complaints of “improper behaviour” being made in nine months. The picture is clear: there is an epidemic of sexual violence at UK universities. The impact this has on students cannot be overestimated. Alongside significant consequences for self-confidence, mental health and social life, many students simply feel unable to continue their studies. A quarter of respondents who had experienced sexual violence said they had skipped lectures and tutorials, or dropped modules to avoid perpetrators; 16% suspended their studies or dropped out altogether. More needs to be done. Many students will be miles away from home, living alone and with no idea where to turn for help in the event that they are sexually assaulted. When they do seek help, many hit a brick wall, their trauma exacerbated by the reporting process; at least one respondent saw their complaint “brushed under the carpet”. There are parallels with the student mental health crisis here: isolated from existing support networks, met with obstructive processes from counselling services and those supposedly responsible for pastoral care, many students slip through the cracks. This shouldn’t be happening. Reporting processes need to be dramatically improved: Cambridge’s anonymous system is a step in the right direction. Many students say that their complaints require months of emails, meetings and phone calls before they are even begun to be addressed – a gruelling and traumatic task, especially when you’re trying to concentrate on your degree. The processes need not only to be streamlined but to be designed with the wellbeing of students at their heart. Counselling services also need to do a better job. Mental health services should be signposted to students who may not know they’re there; they also need to be available when a victim of assault most needs them. The same goes for specialist support systems: promoting these both during freshers’ week and throughout the term is vital. Diversity should be considered here. Students who are disabled or LGBT, for example, may need different services, and it’s important that a one size fits all approach is not applied. Students need to know what to do in the event that they’re sexually assaulted. But they also need to know when they’ve been sexually assaulted. One particularly striking statistic from Revolt Sexual Assault’s study is that 56% of students believed that their experience “wasn’t serious enough” to warrant reporting. It’s important for students to be aware that any experience of sexual violence is worthy of time, attention and resolution. For the offender, that may not mean expulsion or prosecution, but help in learning how their behaviour is wrong and has affected others. This kind of education should start before students even get to university, and schools and universities should be working together to provide it. Some institutions already provide consent workshops – informal discussion groups where students are educated on consent, “grey areas” and more. These should be rolled out throughout the country, particularly in those institutions where casual misogyny is considered to be the norm. These institutions have a duty of care to their students. Investing time, money and energy into adequate services for those who have been sexually assaulted should not be optional.

We also examine the cheap generic everyday medicines that are usually half the price of expensive branded drugs. 1. This is a rise in England, not elsewhere. In 2011, Scotland joined Wales and Northern Ireland in abolishing NHS prescription charges. Then, the cost in England was £7.40, but it has jumped by 19% since, despite wages rising less rapidly. When charges were first introduced in 1952 by the Conservative government, the cost was one shilling per prescription. Income from the prescription charges makes up less than 1% of the NHS budget. 2. About 90% of people don’t actually pay for their prescriptions. The NHS said that in 2016, 1.1bn prescriptions were issued, a big rise on the 752m issued as recently as 2006. But it said that in total, 89.4% were issued free of charge. No one under 16 or over 60 has to pay for prescriptions – and six out of 10 prescriptions are taken by the over-60s. 3. It’s not just the under-16s and over-60s who don’t have to pay. If you are in full-time education to age 18, they’re free – but that means university students are mostly liable. Other groups who don’t have to pay are those who are pregnant or who have had a baby in the past 12 months, on welfare benefits, or have a medical exemption certificate that applies to people with cancer, or using insulin for diabetes, and a range of other illnesses. Anyone earning less than £15,276 and on tax credits should also receive free prescriptions, while the NHS low income scheme offers full or partial cover for prescription charges. Use this NHS link to see if you qualify. 4. You can buy a “season ticket” to cut prescription charges. They are called prepayment certificates, and are generally worth getting if you find yourself buying more than one prescription every month. The cost is £29.10 for three months, or £104 for a year – and after that, all your prescriptions are covered. If you get two prescriptions a month – at a cost of £212.20 a year – then the prepayment certificate will save you more than £100. One useful trick to know is that you can request for the certificate to be backdated by one month – and then reclaim the cost of the prescriptions for which you’ve already paid. 5. Some things are cheaper to buy across the counter rather than with a prescription. For example, ranitidine may be prescribed for heartburn, but it sells in pharmacies under the brand Zantac, or generic ranitidine anti-indigestion tablets sell in Morrisons for £1.51 a packet. Branded vs generic The continued sale of high-price branded cold and flu remedies, cough medicines and headache pills tells you all you need about the power of marketing. You pay often twice as much, yet there is no difference between the two. The NHS website says: “The generic versions will be the same as the branded medicine because they contain the same active ingredients. They are used more often by the NHS because they’re just as effective but cost far less. It’s similar to buying branded goods or a supermarket’s own label – the supermarket’s version is usually cheaper.” Each medicine carries a product licence number on their packaging, in the style of PL XXXXX/YYYY. If the PL numbers are the same, you know the generic is identical to the branded product. But a word of warning: the prices of own-brand goods at Boots can be the same or even more expensive than the branded goods, judging by previous surveys. When Guardian Money carried out a price test, we found the best-value medicines were on sale at Wilko. The price test We looked at “max strength” chesty cough and cold tablets, which come under the product licence number PL 12063. The major branded product is Beechams’ Max Strength All In One capsules. A packet of 16 sells for £5 in most supermarkets. Each tablet contains 500mg of paracetamol, 100mg of guaifenesin and 6.1mg of phenylephrine hydrochloride. Boots Ultra Cold &amp; Flu Relief All In One 16 capsules contain an identical list of active ingredients, in the same measures, but sells for £3.50. They are manufactured by a company called Wrafton Laboratories. The same company, Wrafton, makes “Flu-max” all-in-one capsules, containing the same active ingredients, for Asda, Sainsbury’s, Superdrug, Wilko, Lloyds Pharmacy and Boots, although the amount of paracetamol in each capsule is lower. The price? The Sainsbury’s-branded ones are £2.65, while the Boots ones are £2.59. The absolutely identical ones made in the same factory but branded Asda sell for £2. In Wilko they are £1.45. The ones packaged for Lloyds Pharmacy are priced at £3.59. Our conclusion? It’s simple: save 70% by ignoring branded medicines and buying generics instead at Wilko."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"science/2018/mar/02/two-become-one-two-raven-lineages-merge-in-speciation-reversal","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-02T10:00:05Z","webTitle":"Two become one: two raven lineages merge in 'speciation reversal'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/mar/02/two-become-one-two-raven-lineages-merge-in-speciation-reversal","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2018/mar/02/two-become-one-two-raven-lineages-merge-in-speciation-reversal","fields":{"headline":"Two become one: two raven lineages merge in 'speciation reversal'","bodyText":"Speciation, where one species diverges into two, is a well-known concept in the theory of evolution. But a new study based on almost 20 years of research has revealed that “speciation reversal”, the merging of two previously distinct lineages, may also play an important role. Scientists have discovered that two lineages of common raven that spent between one and two million years evolving separately appear to be in the process of such a consolidation. The findings raise intriguing questions about how science should define species – and whether the boundaries are as clearcut as once thought. “The bottom line is [speciation reversal] is a natural evolutionary process, and it’s probably happened in hundreds, or almost certainly thousands, of lineages all over the planet,” said Kevin Omland, professor of biological sciences at University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC) and co-author of the new study. “One of our biggest goals is to just have people aware of this process.” Omland first began studying the raven 20 years ago, after he began to suspect that two separate species could have been lumped together. He reported the existence of two lineages: one concentrated in the southwestern United States, dubbed “California,” and another found everywhere else (including Maine, Alaska, Norway and Russia) called “Holarctic”. The latest paper, published in Nature Communications, provides new intriguing details of the evolutionary history of the two groups. A genetic analysis of 400 birds spanning the geographical range of the two populations suggests that the California and Holarctic lineages diverged between one and two million years ago, but more recently have merged together again and have been hybridising for at least tens of thousands of years. The two populations now comprise pure Holarctic ravens and a group that are hybrids of the two original lineages (the pure California type no longer exists). “The extensive genetic data reveals one of the best supported examples of speciation reversal of deeply diverged lineages to date,” said Arild Johnsen, professor of zoology and evolutionary biology at University of Oslo and another co-author. “The biggest thing is the degree to which we’ve caught them in the act.” The genetic analysis also revealed that the mitochondrial DNA of the hybrids and the Holarctics differed by about 4%, which the scientists said was twice as much as would normally be seen for birds to be considered separate species. Despite being genetically distinct, though, the birds look the same, sound the same and behave the same – although it is possible that they were different before they started to merge into one group. The paper also notes that a third group of ravens – known as Chihuahuan ravens – which branched off from the California lineage, have remained separate and do not interbreed with the other two groups, despite their geographical ranges overlapping. Scientists are not sure why this is the case. “The Chihuahuan raven doesn’t want to play,” said Omland. “It stays by itself and doesn’t interbreed with the others.” The team is now investigating what prompted the merger between the two populations, including whether humans played a role. They are analysing genetic data from ravens that lived in the early 1900s to investigate whether the hybridisation has accelerated since then."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/mar/02/collapse-bnp-edl-far-right-terrorists","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-02T06:00:41Z","webTitle":"The collapse of the BNP and EDL has made the far right deadlier | Matthew Collins","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/02/collapse-bnp-edl-far-right-terrorists","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/02/collapse-bnp-edl-far-right-terrorists","fields":{"headline":"The collapse of the BNP and EDL has made the far right deadlier","bodyText":"Last August Hope not Hate revealed that the proscribed neo-Nazi organisation National Action (banned by the home secretary in December 2016) was not only still recruiting, but was operating from and training in a converted warehouse in Warrington, Cheshire. Our decision to publish this information and other facts therein was not taken lightly. Publishing it was as much a risk to our researchers as it was an act of justifiable self-preservation. The ins and outs and the necessities of such an act will become all the more apparent later this year. National Action remains a very grave concern. But it is not the sole terror threat to emanate from the far right in this country. The three most notable and recent cases of far-right-inspired terrorism appear to have come from people who had no known, overly obvious or hardened link to Nazi organisations. Thomas Mair, who murdered the MP Jo Cox in 2016, had been an infrequent correspondent with obscure Nazi groups in both the UK and the USA. He was not known or regarded as a far-right sympathiser or as someone who harboured murderous desires against his local MP. For his daily update of hate, he simply went to his local library and used the internet there. Darren Osborne, the man who drove into a group of worshippers outside a mosque in Finsbury Park, north London, in June last year, killing father-of-six Makram Ali, had always been an unpleasant individual, often in trouble with the law. His decision to attempt to kill random Muslims was apparently fomented over drink and three long weeks trawling the internet, visiting sites frequented by the likes of English Defence League (EDL) founder Stephen Lennon (“Tommy Robinson”) and anti-Muslim organisation Britain First, paying heed to the dire outpourings of hate-mongers who appeared to double up as cause celebres of interest to the gutter press. The most recent case of far-right terror involved a young man called Ethan Stables, from Barrow in Furness, who was planning to commit a massacre at a gay bar in June last year, but was arrested after a young woman rang 999 (not for the first time) to report his disturbing rantings. We know that he had tried (and failed) to join National Action, but its members felt he lived too far away from the centre of their cells and activists. So why is this threat suddenly so imminent, so more profound than ever before? In his retirement speech earlier this week, Mark Rowley, an assistant commissioner at the Metropolitan police who was the UK’s most senior counter-terror police officer, specifically noted that the public should be “gravely concerned” about banned neo-Nazi terror group National Action. He also compared the actions of “Tommy Robinson” to that of hate preacher Anjem Choudary. Since 2011, Hope not Hate has published an annual State of Hate report. Since at least 2015 we have seen that the demise of the electoral far right in the UK has been giving way to something far more sinister, which is evolving from the embers of the two better-known far-right groups operating in the UK, the electorally dead and insignificant British National party (BNP) and the moribund EDL (which this week has been shaken by a paedophile scandal involving one of its leading members). Although both spawned cheaper imitations upon their demise, they also spawned a million angry voices on social media. One of the groups the BNP and EDL morphed into was National Action. It took a different trajectory entirely – so much so that it and the other groups on the British far right are almost violently opposed to each other. There’s no knowing or guessing from where the next far-right terror attack will come. It could come from a peripheral member of any number of groups that are active in the UK. It could come from another Darren Osborne. We do not even know which particular or pre-eminent ideology it is that will inspire or encourage it. Will it be anti-Muslim; antisemitic; or against “snowflakes”? Or will it be killing for the sake of hate killing? You could hazard a guess by just looking at the outpourings of hate and extremism offered up every day on YouTube, Facebook and Twitter – there is plenty to choose from. Nor can we judge when or what the next “tipping point” will be. A look at the thousands of angry white men on British social media gives a fair indication that the temperature of fear, hatred and misunderstanding driven by social media and far-right fake news and unchecked paranoia is palpable and increasing. And then, of course, there are the very real issues these same people believe, for whatever reason, are not being addressed (or certainly not to their satisfaction). National Action is indeed, as Rowley points out, a grave concern. It is potentially a very sophisticated and ongoing grave concern. But it could be the organised symptom of a thoroughly malevolent tumour of racism and violence, growing and emanating from the cancer that is the British far right, which has retreated from the streets and ballot box into cyber space. • Matthew Collins is head of research for Hope not Hate"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"stage/2018/mar/05/manchester-sari-shops-handlooms-rani-moorthy","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-05T10:00:12Z","webTitle":"'A chaos of colour': new play made for one of Manchester's last sari shops","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/mar/05/manchester-sari-shops-handlooms-rani-moorthy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2018/mar/05/manchester-sari-shops-handlooms-rani-moorthy","fields":{"headline":"'A chaos of colour': new play made for one of Manchester's last sari shops","bodyText":"When Alankar House of Sarees first opened on what is now Manchester’s Curry Mile in 1977, its only neighbours were a grocer’s and the Indian-Pakistani restaurant Sanam. As the years went by the shop was joined by scores of rivals, competing for custom from the area’s growing south Asian community. Forty years later, as many young British Asians are turning away from the sari as an everyday form of dress, the business is one of the area’s few surviving traditional sari shops. Sitting in the store, surrounded by piles of intricately embroidered fabrics, 34-year-old Poonam Modha says she had never planned to dedicate her life to the family business. She is the granddaughter of Gokuldas Modha, who founded the shop after arriving in Britain from Tanzania. “When I was growing up my mum and dad used to bring me to work during the holidays when all I wanted to do was play,” she says. “But as I grew up and got into my late teens I fell in love with the clothes.” The Manchester shop, and the family’s store in Leicester, provide the settings for Handlooms, a new play by writer Rani Moorthy and her company Rasa Theatre, made in collaboration with Manchester’s Contact theatre. Handlooms seeks to explore the changing experiences of British south Asian communities, telling the story of a mother and son who disagree about how to deal with a crisis in their sari business. Audiences in Manchester and Leicester will watch the performances in the shops themselves. Much of the performance will take place on the traditional raised, cushioned platform that shop workers stand on to demonstrate the fabrics to their mostly female customers, who sit drinking masala tea. Audience members will be given headphones so they can listen to interactions taking place out of sight, and hear a specially compiled score. “People will think it’s a gimmick, because site-specific [theatre] is the thing now,” says Moorthy. “But really it’s completely germane to the themes of the play. When you enter the space immediately you are sensing this is slightly different. You can’t really recreate the smells and the sounds elsewhere.” Moorthy says she became fascinated by how the intimate atmosphere of the shops saw gender divisions broken down. “I was very aware growing up that men sold the sari, dictated what we wore, designed the saris,” she says. “I was also conscious of the language used when encountering female clients; sensuous, intimate, about the women’s body, the drape – the gestures – so contrary to the strict social rules we had between genders in the south Asian community. It took me a long time to understand this was something so unique – and that it was dying out.” The play, directed by Alan Lane of the company Slung Low, depicts Rajesh, a 25-year-old man who loves to work in his family business. “Now ladies, I know you better than your husbands, at least when it comes to dressing you,” he says, speaking to the audience as if they were a group of older female customers. “When it comes to undressing you, I’ll leave that to them.” Handlooms, Moorthy says, is in part about documenting and opening up a world under threat. “A lot of the sari shops are becoming more boutique style, looking aesthetically un-Indian and more westernised. I wanted people to experience that chaos of colour you encounter in these traditional shops.” “In my memory there are about 20 sari shops on this road, but there aren’t any more,” she says. “You struggle to find one person walking around and doing her everyday chores in a sari, whereas when I first came here in 1996 there were women in saris everywhere, doing daily chores, doing shopping, going to the post office.” Modha says that running the shop is in her “whole family’s blood”. Can she see a time when Alankar House of Sarees will close? She immediately shakes her head. “We will adapt and change and do whatever is needed. But we’ll definitely always continue.” Handlooms is at Alankar House of Sarees, Manchester, 12-24 March. Box office: 0161-274 0600. Then at Anokhi House of Sarees, Leicester, 10-22 April.

The just-below-the-surface simmer of insouciant sex appeal is what Paris fashion week sells. (For the more in-your-face version, take a look at Milan.) It is a mark of her talent that Ramsay-Levi has made nailing the Chloe house style in just two seasons look easy. After a debut show that paid direct homage to the chic looks of founder Gaby Aghion, this second season continued to play to all the label’s strengths, but was more focussed on one trend: the 70s. All the tropes of cool-girl French dressing were here. Fluid silk blouses worn deshabille, plunging to show bare skin. Ankle boots with a kick of edgy hardware. High-waisted trousers with a sensual, jodhpur-esque curve at the hips. Loose trenchcoats and sensual sweater dresses with cosy ribbed high-necks offset by shark bite peepholes at the ribcage. Party dresses more boudoir than red carpet, with lingerie lace and undone ribbon ties. “For me, the Chloé girl is very French but for a lot of people she is very English – because all the designers were,” Ramsay-Levi recently told Vogue, referring to the trio of British women who preceded her: Clare Waight Keller, Phoebe Philo and Stella McCartney. The cool girl was never more laid-back than in the 1970s. Wide wing collars, flared trousers and earthy tones of tobacco, cream and cognac rooted this collection clearly in that decade. It was another retro reference in a fashion week which finds Paris in nostalgic mode. Dior harked back to the 1960s on Tuesday, and Dries Van Noten to the 1930s on Wednesday."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"travel/2018/mar/02/winter-swimmers-cold-water-swimming-taking-on-beast-from-the-east-in-pictures","type":"article","sectionId":"travel","sectionName":"Travel","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-02T11:41:11Z","webTitle":"The winter swimmers taking on the Beast from the East – in pictures","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2018/mar/02/winter-swimmers-cold-water-swimming-taking-on-beast-from-the-east-in-pictures","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/travel/2018/mar/02/winter-swimmers-cold-water-swimming-taking-on-beast-from-the-east-in-pictures","fields":{"headline":"The winter swimmers taking on the Beast from the East – in pictures","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"business/2018/mar/03/fantasy-miniatures-bring-roaring-success-to-uks-games-workshop","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-03T07:00:11Z","webTitle":"Fantasy miniatures bring roaring success to UK's Games Workshop","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/mar/03/fantasy-miniatures-bring-roaring-success-to-uks-games-workshop","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/mar/03/fantasy-miniatures-bring-roaring-success-to-uks-games-workshop","fields":{"headline":"Fantasy miniatures bring roaring success to UK's Games Workshop","bodyText":"It is usually forbidden for quoted companies to cash in on bloodthirsty conflicts fought by armed mercenaries in distant lands. But for Kevin Rountree it’s just another day at the office. The low-profile accountant, who never gives interviews, runs fantasy figure seller Games Workshop which this week emerged as the sleeper success story of the UK’s bombed-out retail industry, thanks to the enduring success of its tabletop game franchise Warhammer. The Nottingham retailer and model manufacturer was catapulted into the FTSE 250 after pulling off a battle plan that Roboute Guilliman – the avenging son of the Emperor of Mankind in sci-fi spinoff Warhammer 40,000 – would be proud of. The shares have risen more than 160% in the past year, giving the company a market value of £770m, more than breakdown specialist AA – one of the companies booted outed of the 250 index in the reshuffle – and the retailers Card Factory and Jacamo owner N Brown. Its current share price of £22.95 compares with £5 two years ago. “Games Workshop fans act very much like those of Lego, as almost a cult following,” says GlobalRetail analyst Zoe Mills. “It is not cheap however, with great craftsmanship in its range, this is a hobby consumers are willing to invest in. It appeals to an older demographic than Lego, with detailed painting involved in the process. This is not for young children.” Games Workshop shuns the press but on its website 47-year-old Rountree, who has been with the company for 20 years, sets out a simple stall: “We make the best fantasy miniatures in the world and sell them globally at a profit and we intend to do this forever.” Although it has more than 460 stores around the world, Games Workshop insists it is a manufacturer first with its factory in Lenton, Nottingham, producing more than 30m toy solders a year. One of its financial strengths is ownership of the Warhammer franchise and it defends this intellectual property vigorously. The Lenton complex is also home to Warhammer World, an events centre that pulls in visitors from all over the world. Rather than just being places to buy model kits or pick up the latest copy of White Dwarf magazine, Games Workshop views its stores as recruiting grounds for people it describes as having “our particular hobby gene”. Someone with that trait is Dimitri, who has just bought a £95 kit to build an imperial knight. With more than 220 parts to glue together, the model will take hours of work to complete but the prison officer is no stranger to the task as he owns a shed filled with thousands of miniatures. Players collect forces of miniature plastic models, all with different stats and abilities, and use them to play out clashes on a tabletop battlefield. “It’s very strategic,” says Dimitri of Warhammer “40K”, which is his game of choice. “It’s 10-fold more complicated than chess.” He adds: “I got into gaming as a kid but as an adult I enjoy reading the lore. If you think of Lord of the Rings and the universe created by three books imagine what you can do with 50.” In January Games Workshop announced record sales and profits for the first six months of a financial year that runs until the end of May. Sales were up more than 50% at £108.9m while profits more than doubled to £38.8m as its UK manufacturing base protected it from currency depreciation. Most of the growth is coming from outside the UK with international sales accounting for nearly 70% of turnover thanks to expansion into markets like Asia. Games Workshop was founded more than 40 years ago by three school friends: John Peake, Ian Livingstone and Steve Jackson. The gaming fanatics shared a flat in west London where they started out selling handmade, classic wooden games before going on to open stores. Following a management buyout in the 90s the company listed on the stock exchange in 1994. Games Workshop is better run now than in previous years, says Dimitri who spends £100 a month in its stores. “Before you could spend £200 and have an army but then it would stagnate for two years. Now there are new releases all the time and they have tapped into the love of lore.” In the Warhammer shop on Tottenham Court Road, shoppers are greeted by a dramatic snowy battle scene featuring two model armies, dragons and all, advancing on either side of an imposing fortress. A display cabinet in the corner groups figurines by army with the shelves labelled destruction, chaos and death. Other shelves are replete with battlefield scenery props with esoteric names like ferratonic incinerator and promethium relay pipes. Although the central London store has several employees, more than 360 of them have just one person to do everything. The company monitors the success of its shops carefully and if those with several staff dip into the red they are replaced with one man stores. The shops have playtables where staff give lessons on strategy and painting techniques like shading so enthusiasts can create give their models the perfect finish. Staff are expected to be immersed in games lore as customers quiz them about the nuances of orcs, ogres and obliterators. In a world where so much free time is spent online, tabletop gaming is refreshingly analogue although the company encourages fans to share pictures of their finished figures on Facebook and Instagram. Games are played between people in the same room in venues ranging from schools to the former Olympic stadium in Stratford, where in May hundreds will gather for a Warhammer 40,000 convention. “If someone said I was sad for playing with toys I’d say ‘what do you do’?” says Dimitri, who now in his early 30s has dedicated two decades to marshalling his fantastical troops. “Go down the pub?” • This article was amended on 5 March 2018.

Velázquez has deliberately created an uneasy disjunction between the sensual nude lying on an exquisitely painted sheet of grey silk and her melancholy, introspective expression. This great artist of reality, whose paintings delight in paradox and ambiguity, shows us both the woman’s eroticised body and her mysterious inner life. This double vision of her is unsettling and profound. A nude picture becomes a rich insight into the complexity of human life. • National Gallery, London Image of the week Femme au Béret et à la Robe Quadrillée (Marie-Thérèse Walter), 1937, by Pablo Picasso Sold this week at Sotheby’s for £49.8m, this was highest price achieved by a painting at a European auction. The portrait was until recently owned by the artist’s estate and its value was estimated at £35m. Harry Smith, a London art adviser, bought this for an unnamed client, along with three other Picasso pieces at Sotheby’s and nine of the artist’s works the previous evening at Christie’s, a haul totalling £113m. Interest in the artist has been boosted by Tate Modern’s first solo exhibition of Picasso’s work. The portrait of the artist’s lover at the time was painted just months after Picasso completed his 1937 masterpieces Guernica and Weeping Woman, which added to the painting’s appeal. It was created at a time of flux in Picasso’s personal life, as his new muse, Dora Maar, was entering the frame.

The idea that certain races are inherently more intelligent than others is being trumpeted by a small group of anthropologists, IQ researchers, psychologists and pundits who portray themselves as noble dissidents, standing up for inconvenient facts. Through a surprising mix of fringe and mainstream media sources, these ideas are reaching a new audience, which regards them as proof of the superiority of certain races. The claim that there is a link between race and intelligence is the main tenet of what is known as “race science” or, in many cases, “scientific racism”. Race scientists claim there are evolutionary bases for disparities in social outcomes – such as life expectancy, educational attainment, wealth, and incarceration rates – between racial groups. In particular, many of them argue that black people fare worse than white people because they tend to be less naturally intelligent. Although race science has been repeatedly debunked by scholarly research, in recent years it has made a comeback. Many of the keenest promoters of race science today are stars of the “alt-right”, who like to use pseudoscience to lend intellectual justification to ethno-nationalist politics. If you believe that poor people are poor because they are inherently less intelligent, then it is easy to leap to the conclusion that liberal remedies, such as affirmative action or foreign aid, are doomed to fail. There are scores of recent examples of rightwingers banging the drum for race science. In July 2016, for example, Steve Bannon, who was then Breitbart boss and would go on to be Donald Trump’s chief strategist, wrote an article in which he suggested that some black people who had been shot by the police might have deserved it. “There are, after all, in this world, some people who are naturally aggressive and violent,” Bannon wrote, evoking one of scientific racism’s ugliest contentions: that black people are more genetically predisposed to violence than others. One of the people behind the revival of race science was, not long ago, a mainstream figure. In 2014, Nicholas Wade, a former New York Times science correspondent, wrote what must rank as the most toxic book on race science to appear in the last 20 years. In A Troublesome Inheritance, he repeated three race-science shibboleths: that the notion of “race” corresponds to profound biological differences among groups of humans; that human brains evolved differently from race to race; and that this is supported by different racial averages in IQ scores. Wade’s book prompted 139 of the world’s leading population geneticists and evolutionary theorists to sign a letter in the New York Times accusing Wade of misappropriating research from their field, and several academics offered more detailed critiques. The University of Chicago geneticist Jerry Coyne described it as “simply bad science”. Yet some on the right have, perhaps unsurprisingly, latched on to Wade’s ideas, rebranding him as a paragon of intellectual honesty who had been silenced not by experts, but by political correctness. “That attack on my book was purely political,” Wade told Stefan Molyneux, one of the most popular promoters of the alt-right’s new scientific racism. They were speaking a month after Trump’s election on Molyneux’s YouTube show, whose episodes have been viewed tens of millions of times. Wade continued: “It had no scientific basis whatever and it showed the more ridiculous side of this herd belief.” Another of Molyneux’s recent guests was the political scientist Charles Murray, who co-authored The Bell Curve. The book argued that poor people, and particularly poor black people, were inherently less intelligent than white or Asian people. When it was first published in 1994, it became a New York Times bestseller, but over the next few years it was picked to pieces by academic critics. As a frequent target for protest on college campuses, Murray has become a figurehead for conservatives who want to portray progressives as unthinking hypocrites who have abandoned the principles of open discourse that underwrite a liberal society. And this logic has prompted some mainstream cultural figures to embrace Murray as an icon of scientific debate, or at least as an emblem of their own openness to the possibility that the truth can, at times, be uncomfortable. Last April, Murray appeared on the podcast of the popular nonfiction author Sam Harris. Murray used the platform to claim his liberal academic critics “lied without any apparent shadow of guilt because, I guess, in their own minds, they thought they were doing the Lord’s work.” (The podcast episode was entitled “Forbidden knowledge”.) In the past, race science has shaped not only political discourse, but also public policy. The year after The Bell Curve was published, in the lead-up to a Republican congress slashing benefits for poorer Americans, Murray gave expert testimony before a Senate committee on welfare reform; more recently, congressman Paul Ryan, who helped push the Republicans’ latest tax cuts for the wealthy, has claimed Murray as an expert on poverty. Now, as race science leaches back into mainstream discourse, it has also been mainlined into the upper echelons of the US government through figures such as Bannon. The UK has not been spared this revival: the London Student newspaper recently exposed a semi-clandestine conference on intelligence and genetics held for the last three years at UCL without the university’s knowledge. One of the participants was the 88-year-old Ulster-based evolutionary psychologist Richard Lynn, who has described himself as a “scientific racist”. One of the reasons scientific racism hasn’t gone away is that the public hears more about the racism than it does about the science. This has left an opening for people such as Murray and Wade, in conjunction with their media boosters, to hold themselves up as humble defenders of rational enquiry. With so much focus on their apparent bias, we’ve done too little to discuss the science. Which raises the question: why, exactly, are the race scientists wrong? * * * Race, like intelligence, is a notoriously slippery concept. Individuals often share more genes with members of other races than with members of their own race. Indeed, many academics have argued that race is a social construct – which is not to deny that there are groups of people (“population groups”, in the scientific nomenclature) that share a high amount of genetic inheritance. Race science therefore starts out on treacherous scientific footing. The supposed science of race is at least as old as slavery and colonialism, and it was considered conventional wisdom in many western countries until 1945. Though it was rejected by a new generation of scholars and humanists after the Holocaust, it began to bubble up again in the 1970s, and has returned to mainstream discourse every so often since then. In 1977, during my final year in state high school in apartheid South Africa, a sociology lecturer from the local university addressed us and then took questions. He was asked whether black people were as intelligent as white people. No, he said: IQ tests show that white people are more intelligent. He was referring to a paper published in 1969 by Arthur Jensen, an American psychologist who claimed that IQ was 80% a product of our genes rather than our environments, and that the differences between black and white IQs were largely rooted in genetics. In apartheid South Africa, the idea that each race had its own character, personality traits and intellectual potential was part of the justification for the system of white rule. The subject of race and IQ was similarly politicised in the US, where Jensen’s paper was used to oppose welfare schemes, such as the Head Start programme, which were designed to lift children out of poverty. But the paper met with an immediate and overwhelmingly negative reaction – “an international firestorm,” the New York Times called it 43 years later, in Jensen’s obituary – especially on American university campuses, where academics issued dozens of rebuttals, and students burned him in effigy. The recent revival of ideas about race and IQ began with a seemingly benign scientific observation. In 2005, Steven Pinker, one of the world’s most prominent evolutionary psychologists, began promoting the view that Ashkenazi Jews are innately particularly intelligent – first in a lecture to a Jewish studies institute, then in a lengthy article in the liberal American magazine The New Republic the following year. This claim has long been the smiling face of race science; if it is true that Jews are naturally more intelligent, then it’s only logical to say that others are naturally less so. The background to Pinker’s essay was a 2005 paper entitled “Natural history of Ashkenazi intelligence”, written by a trio of anthropologists at the University of Utah. In their 2005 paper, the anthropologists argued that high IQ scores among Ashkenazi Jews indicated that they evolved to be smarter than anyone else (including other groups of Jews). This evolutionary development supposedly took root between 800 and 1650 AD, when Ashkenazis, who primarily lived in Europe, were pushed by antisemitism into money-lending, which was stigmatised among Christians. This rapid evolution was possible, the paper argued, in part because the practice of not marrying outside the Jewish community meant a “very low inward gene flow”. This was also a factor behind the disproportionate prevalence in Ashkenazi Jews of genetic diseases such as Tay-Sachs and Gaucher’s, which the researchers claimed were a byproduct of natural selection for higher intelligence; those carrying the gene variants, or alleles, for these diseases were said to be smarter than the rest. Pinker followed this logic in his New Republic article, and elsewhere described the Ashkenazi paper as “thorough and well-argued”. He went on to castigate those who doubted the scientific value of talking about genetic differences between races, and claimed that “personality traits are measurable, heritable within a group and slightly different, on average, between groups”. In subsequent years, Nicholas Wade, Charles Murray, Richard Lynn, the increasingly popular Canadian psychologist Jordan Peterson and others have all piled in on the Jewish intelligence thesis, using it as ballast for their views that different population groups inherit different mental capacities. Another member of this chorus is the journalist Andrew Sullivan, who was one of the loudest cheerleaders for The Bell Curve in 1994, featuring it prominently in The New Republic, which he edited at the time. He returned to the fray in 2011, using his popular blog, The Dish, to promote the view that population groups had different innate potentials when it came to intelligence. Sullivan noted that the differences between Ashkenazi and Sephardic Jews were “striking in the data”. It was a prime example of the rhetoric of race science, whose proponents love to claim that they are honouring the data, not political commitments. The far right has even rebranded race science with an alternative name that sounds like it was taken straight from the pages of a university course catalogue: “human biodiversity”. A common theme in the rhetoric of race science is that its opponents are guilty of wishful thinking about the nature of human equality. “The IQ literature reveals that which no one would want to be the case,” Peterson told Molyneux on his YouTube show recently. Even the prominent social scientist Jonathan Haidt has criticised liberals as “IQ deniers”, who reject the truth of inherited IQ difference between groups because of a misguided commitment to the idea that social outcomes depend entirely on nurture, and are therefore mutable. Defenders of race science claim they are simply describing the facts as they are – and the truth isn’t always comfortable. “We remain the same species, just as a poodle and a beagle are of the same species,” Sullivan wrote in 2013. “But poodles, in general, are smarter than beagles, and beagles have a much better sense of smell.” * * * The race “science” that has re-emerged into public discourse today – whether in the form of outright racism against black people, or supposedly friendlier claims of Ashkenazis’ superior intelligence – usually involves at least one of three claims, each of which has no grounding in scientific fact. The first claim is that when white Europeans’ Cro-Magnon ancestors arrived on the continent 45,000 years ago, they faced more trying conditions than in Africa. Greater environmental challenges led to the evolution of higher intelligence. Faced with the icy climate of the north, Richard Lynn wrote in 2006, “less intelligent individuals and tribes would have died out, leaving as survivors the more intelligent”. Set aside for a moment the fact that agriculture, towns and alphabets first emerged in Mesopotamia, a region not known for its cold spells. There is ample scientific evidence of modern intelligence in prehistoric sub-Saharan Africa. In the past 15 years, cave finds along the South African Indian Ocean coastline have shown that, between 70,000 and 100,000 years ago, biologically modern humans were carefully blending paint by mixing ochre with bone-marrow fat and charcoal, fashioning beads for self-adornment, and making fish hooks, arrows and other sophisticated tools, sometimes by heating them to 315C (600F). Those studying the evidence, such as the South African archaeologist Christopher Henshilwood, argue that these were intelligent, creative people – just like us. As he put it: “We’re pushing back the date of symbolic thinking in modern humans – far, far back.” A second plank of the race science case goes like this: human bodies continued to evolve, at least until recently – with different groups developing different skin colours, predispositions to certain diseases, and things such as lactose tolerance. So why wouldn’t human brains continue evolving, too? The problem here is that race scientists are not comparing like with like. Most of these physical changes involve single gene mutations, which can spread throughout a population in a relatively short span of evolutionary time. By contrast, intelligence – even the rather specific version measured by IQ – involves a network of potentially thousands of genes, which probably takes at least 100 millennia to evolve appreciably. Given that so many genes, operating in different parts of the brain, contribute in some way to intelligence, it is hardly surprising that there is scant evidence of cognitive advance, at least over the last 100,000 years. The American palaeoanthropologist Ian Tattersall, widely acknowledged as one of the world’s leading experts on Cro-Magnons, has said that long before humans left Africa for Asia and Europe, they had already reached the end of the evolutionary line in terms of brain power. “We don’t have the right conditions for any meaningful biological evolution of the species,” he told an interviewer in 2000. In fact, when it comes to potential differences in intelligence between groups, one of the remarkable dimensions of the human genome is how little genetic variation there is. DNA research conducted in 1987 suggested a common, African ancestor for all humans alive today: “mitochondrial Eve”, who lived around 200,000 years ago. Because of this relatively recent (in evolutionary terms) common ancestry, human beings share a remarkably high proportion of their genes compared to other mammals. The single subspecies of chimpanzee that lives in central Africa, for example, has significantly more genetic variation than does the entire human race. No one has successfully isolated any genes “for” intelligence at all, and claims in this direction have turned to dust when subjected to peer review. As the Edinburgh University cognitive ageing specialist Prof Ian Deary put it, “It is difficult to name even one gene that is reliably associated with normal intelligence in young, healthy adults.” Intelligence doesn’t come neatly packaged and labelled on any single strand of DNA. * * * Ultimately, race science depends on a third claim: that different IQ averages between population groups have a genetic basis. If this case falls, the whole edifice – from Ashkenazi exceptionalism to the supposed inevitability of black poverty – collapses with it. Before we can properly assess these claims, it is worth looking at the history of IQ testing. The public perception of IQ tests is that they provide a measure of unchanging intelligence, but when we look deeper, a very different picture emerges. Alfred Binet, the modest Frenchman who invented IQ testing in 1904, knew that intelligence was too complex to be expressed in a single number. “Intellectual qualities … cannot be measured as linear surfaces are measured,” he insisted, adding that giving IQ too much significance “may give place to illusions.” But Binet’s tests were embraced by Americans who assumed IQ was innate, and used it to inform immigration, segregationist and eugenic policies. Early IQ tests were packed with culturally loaded questions. (“The number of a Kaffir’s legs is: 2, 4, 6, 8?” was one of the questions in IQ tests given to US soldiers during the first world war.) Over time, the tests became less skewed and began to prove useful in measuring some forms of mental aptitude. But this tells us nothing about whether scores are mainly the product of genes or of environment. Further information is needed. One way to test this hypothesis would be to see if you can increase IQ by learning. If so, this would show that education levels, which are purely environmental, affect the scores. It is now well-known that if you practise IQ tests your score will rise, but other forms of study can also help. In 2008, Swiss researchers recruited 70 students and had half of them practise a memory-based computer game. All 35 of these students saw their IQs increase, and those who practised daily, for the full 19 weeks of the trial, showed the most improvement. Another way to establish the extent to which IQ is determined by nature rather than nurture would be to find identical twins separated at birth and subsequently raised in very different circumstances. But such cases are unusual, and some of the most influential research – such as the work of the 20th-century English psychologist Cyril Burt, who claimed to have shown that IQ was innate – has been dubious. (After Burt’s death, it was revealed that he had falsified much of his data.) A genuine twin study was launched by the Minneapolis-based psychologist Thomas Bouchard in 1979, and although he was generously backed by the overtly racist Pioneer Fund, his results make interesting reading. He studied identical twins, who have the same genes, but who were separated close to birth. This allowed him to consider the different contributions that environment and biology played in their development. His idea was that if the twins emerged with the same traits despite being raised in different environments, the main explanation would be genetic. The problem was that most of his identical twins were adopted into the same kinds of middle-class families. So it was hardly surprising that they ended up with similar IQs. In the relatively few cases where twins were adopted into families of different social classes and education levels, there ended up being huge disparities in IQ – in one case a 20-point gap; in another, 29 points, or the difference between “dullness” and “superior intelligence” in the parlance of some IQ classifications. In other words, where the environments differed substantially, nurture seems to have been a far more powerful influence than nature on IQ. But what happens when you move from individuals to whole populations? Could nature still have a role in influencing IQ averages? Perhaps the most significant IQ researcher of the last half century is the New Zealander Jim Flynn. IQ tests are calibrated so that the average IQ of all test subjects at any particular time is 100. In the 1990s, Flynn discovered that each generation of IQ tests had to be more challenging if this average was to be maintained. Projecting back 100 years, he found that average IQ scores measured by current standards would be about 70. Yet people have not changed genetically since then. Instead, Flynn noted, they have become more exposed to abstract logic, which is the sliver of intelligence that IQ tests measure. Some populations are more exposed to abstraction than others, which is why their average IQ scores differ. Flynn found that the different averages between populations were therefore entirely environmental. This finding has been reinforced by the changes in average IQ scores observed in some populations. The most rapid has been among Kenyan children – a rise of 26.3 points in the 14 years between 1984 and 1998, according to one study. The reason has nothing to do with genes. Instead, researchers found that, in the course of half a generation, nutrition, health and parental literacy had improved. So, what about the Ashkenazis? Since the 2005 University of Utah paper was published, DNA research by other scientists has shown that Ashkenazi Jews are far less genetically isolated than the paper argued. On the claims that Ashkenazi diseases were caused by rapid natural selection, further research has shown that they were caused by a random mutation. And there is no evidence that those carrying the gene variants for these diseases are any more or less intelligent than the rest of the community. But it was on IQ that the paper’s case really floundered. Tests conducted in the first two decades of the 20th century routinely showed Ashkenazi Jewish Americans scoring below average. For example, the IQ tests conducted on American soldiers during the first world war found Nordics scoring well above Jews. Carl Brigham, the Princeton professor who analysed the exam data, wrote: “Our figures … would rather tend to disprove the popular belief that the Jew is highly intelligent”. And yet, by the second world war, Jewish IQ scores were above average. A similar pattern could be seen from studies of two generations of Mizrahi Jewish children in Israel: the older generation had a mean IQ of 92.8, the younger of 101.3. And it wasn’t just a Jewish thing. Chinese Americans recorded average IQ scores of 97 in 1948, and 108.6 in 1990. And the gap between African Americans and white Americans narrowed by 5.5 points between 1972 and 2002. No one could reasonably claim that there had been genetic changes in the Jewish, Chinese American or African American populations in a generation or two. After reading the University of Utah paper, Harry Ostrer, who headed New York University’s human genetics programme, took the opposite view to Steven Pinker: “It’s bad science – not because it’s provocative, but because it’s bad genetics and bad epidemiology.” * * * Ten years ago, our grasp of the actual science was firm enough for Craig Venter, the American biologist who led the private effort to decode the human genome, to respond to claims of a link between race and intelligence by declaring: “There is no basis in scientific fact or in the human genetic code for the notion that skin colour will be predictive of intelligence.” Yet race science maintains its hold on the imagination of the right, and today’s rightwing activists have learned some important lessons from past controversies. Using YouTube in particular, they attack the left-liberal media and academic establishment for its unwillingness to engage with the “facts”, and then employ race science as a political battering ram to push forward their small-state, anti-welfare, anti-foreign-aid agenda. These political goals have become ever more explicit. When interviewing Nicholas Wade, Stefan Molyneux argued that different social outcomes were the result of different innate IQs among the races – as he put it, high-IQ Ashkenazi Jews and low-IQ black people. Wade agreed, saying that the “role played by prejudice” in shaping black people’s social outcomes “is small and diminishing”, before condemning “wasted foreign aid” for African countries. Similarly, when Sam Harris, in his podcast interview with Charles Murray, pointed out the troubling fact that The Bell Curve was beloved by white supremacists and asked what the purpose of exploring race-based differences in intelligence was, Murray didn’t miss a beat. Its use, Murray said, came in countering policies, such as affirmative action in education and employment, based on the premise that “everybody is equal above the neck … whether it’s men or women or whether it’s ethnicities”. Race science isn’t going away any time soon. Its claims can only be countered by the slow, deliberate work of science and education. And they need to be – not only because of their potentially horrible human consequences, but because they are factually wrong. The problem is not, as the right would have it, that these ideas are under threat of censorship or stigmatisation because they are politically inconvenient. Race science is bad science. Or rather, it is not science at all. • Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, or sign up to the long read weekly email here."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"global/2018/mar/06/weekly-letters-100-years-of-womens-rights","type":"article","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"Global","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-06T11:58:49Z","webTitle":"Guardian Weekly Letters, 9 March 2018","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2018/mar/06/weekly-letters-100-years-of-womens-rights","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global/2018/mar/06/weekly-letters-100-years-of-womens-rights","fields":{"headline":"Guardian Weekly Letters, 9 March 2018","bodyText":"Carry on with women’s rights I’d like to thank the Guardian for thinking outside the box in conceiving its long feature piece on the centenary of the women’s suffrage movement in Britain: 10 decades, 10 different female writers, 10 fresh perspectives on the past 100 years (16 February).

Most of the stuff sent into space is not steel and so wouldn’t rust even if it could in the vacuum of space and in the absence of oxygen. While solid rocket booster exhaust and the vapourisation of re-entry objects are real issues that deserve critical study, the idea that we are polluting our galactic neighbourhood is absurd. As Douglas Adams said: “Space is big. Really big. You just won’t believe how vastly, hugely, mind-bogglingly big it is.” The Earth, however, is quite small and we are finding that our activities have a direct impact on our only home. Earth-observation satellites enable us to measure what we are doing on the surface. Interplanetary satellites feed our hunger for knowledge and understanding. Human space travel merely points out that the Earth is precious. Space exploration is a worthwhile endeavour. The amount of money devoted to it makes up a tiny fraction of military spending. The pollution caused by military activities is many more times that of space exploration. Peter Sobey Valla, NSW, Australia Prepare for life after work A timely piece by Andy Beckett: What would you like to do after work? (23 February). It lays bare the massive conspiracy that underlies our global religion, capitalism. We have come to rely on our jobs to satisfy all of our material, emotional and social needs, supplemented by social media such as Facebook and Twitter. We urgently need to restructure many of the institutions underlying the Chaplinesque Modern Times that we have come to embrace, starting with education at all levels. We are still trying to prepare the younger generation for a future very much like the past, while the welfare system attempts to apply useless plasters to a running sore. It’s up to those of us with the freedom from workday demands to ensure that the end of work for the majority will not continue to be unthinkable until it has happened. The alternative is a future where we are all employed on short-term contracts in remote call centres, waiting endlessly on hold for someone to make sense of it all. Noel Bird Boreen Point, Queensland, Australia • The post-work debate needs to be connected to thinking about a post-growth world and ultimately a post-capitalist world. It might at first blush seem counterintuitive; however, clarity of thinking about work, growth and capitalism is only likely to emerge from thinking about all three elephants in the room simultaneously. Stewart Sweeney Adelaide, South Australia • The question “What would you like to do after work?” was answered for me years ago when I was a file clerk and attending classes at night to earn a BA.

Back in the UK, however, we might be more resistant to insidiously invading American expressions. For example, we now talk of “stepping up to the plate”, rather than to the crease – don’t we play cricket over here, rather than baseball? And we interject the word “Period!” to indicate the end of discussion. What happened to the full stop? Come to that, where have all the chaps and blokes gone? Nowadays we’re all guys, and that includes women and children. There are many more turns of phrase supplanting our own. Maybe it’s because US expressions are more dynamic.

Lansman is understood to have come under intense pressure in recent days from Corbyn’s allies not to split the left vote on the ruling national executive committee (NEC), but finally announced on Thursday that he was putting himself forward for the role. He said he had been “approached by a number of friends and colleagues” to apply for the role but said he also wanted others, especially women, to apply for the position to make it a truly open contest. He said he hoped one day the general secretary would be elected by the party membership. “I am applying to open up the contest and ensure we have a wide range of candidates,” he said. “In this spirit, I’d like to encourage any one of our 570,000 members who has the talent and experience to apply. “I would especially like to encourage more women to apply. We’ve only ever had one female general secretary, and we should have more women in Labour’s top team. “In the future, I personally would like to see the general secretary position elected by Labour members. This way we can guarantee continuing accountability through the NEC, but also show that we are a party of democracy and pluralism.” The battle for the role, decided by officers of the NEC, will expose a key tension between Corbyn supporters, pitting Momentum’s vision for a member-led social movement against leftwing unions who believe they should have a significant say over the direction of the party and its levers of power. Corbyn and the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, have so far supported Formby, Unite’s officer on the NEC, to replace Iain McNicol when his departure is agreed. Lansman, a veteran of the Labour left and close friend of Corbyn, is believed to feel a deal among trade unions and leftwingers on the committee to secure the position for Formby would be at odds with his vision for a more open and democratic party which is ultimately member-led. “History shows that we will only be able to transform Britain if our own party has the structures, culture, and practices it wants to see in the rest of society, and I will work to ensure that the democracy review ushers in far-reaching and sustained changes to our party,” he said. “If chosen as Labour’s next general secretary, I will stay tuned to the desires of our members and trade union affiliates, work hard to strengthen Labour’s trade union link and use my decades of experience to make sure Labour really can deliver for the many, not the few.” The truncated timetable for the process agreed by the NEC, with McNicol’s successor due to be chosen by 20 March, also irritated some who would have liked an open contest. Lansman, who helped to organise Corbyn’s leadership bid, set up Momentum, the Corbyn-supporting campaign group that played an influential role in Labour’s general election campaign. He was elected to the NEC himself in January. Many in the party have said they believe McNicol’s replacement should be a woman, given that men hold most key positions, including those of the leader, deputy leader, shadow chancellor, leaders of its Welsh and Scottish parties and mayors of major cities. Formby, the only other candidate to have formally announced her candidacy, has stressed her experience as a member of the NEC and a senior Unite official in industrial, political and administrative posts. Corbyn-supporting MPs, including Ian Lavery and Chris Williamson, quickly declared their support after she announced her bid on Monday. Lansman’s entry into the race is thought to have the tacit backing of some other unions, which are irritated by what they regard as Unite’s increasing dominance of Labour decision-making. Key to the decision will be two other major unions, the GMB and Unison, who have so far declined to give Formby their backing. Senior Labour figures now believe the most likely outcome is that a third candidate could come forward and command the support of both sides, with potential candidates including the GMB’s political officer, Lisa Johnson."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2018/mar/01/labour-extends-ken-livingstones-suspension-over-antisemitism-claims","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-01T13:54:04Z","webTitle":"Labour extends Ken Livingstone's suspension over antisemitism claims","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/mar/01/labour-extends-ken-livingstones-suspension-over-antisemitism-claims","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/mar/01/labour-extends-ken-livingstones-suspension-over-antisemitism-claims","fields":{"headline":"Labour extends Ken Livingstone's suspension over antisemitism claims","bodyText":"Ken Livingstone’s suspension from Labour has been extended while the former mayor of London is subject to another formal internal investigation over antisemitism, the party said. Labour’s disciplinary body suspended Livingstone after he made offensive comments about Adolf Hitler, alleging that he supported Zionism before he went mad. Members of the Jewish Labour Movement (JLM), including the MP Luciana Berger, wrote a private letter to Labour’s national executive committee (NEC) on Wednesday to warn of the damage that could be done to the party’s reputation if Livingstone’s suspension was lifted. A Labour spokesperson said: “Ken Livingstone has been administratively suspended from the Labour party, pending the outcome of an internal party investigation. That suspension starts on the date that his membership suspension applied by the national constitutional committee [NCC] ends on 27 April 2018.” The party said that further complaints had now been made about him, which would be investigated separately. The NEC’s disputes panel is set to hear his case within the next six months, and could refer him again to the NCC, the only body with the power to expel a Labour member. Members of JLM, which lobbied hard for Livingstone’s suspension, are understood to fear that the lifting of his suspension, due in April, would seriously damage the party’s reputation in key areas where it hopes to win seats in London council elections. The letter said Livingstone had not changed his behaviour during his suspension, calling it “deliberate and offensive behaviour towards the Jewish community”. It highlighted his appearance on the Iranian state broadcaster Press TV on Holocaust Memorial Day, where the topic for discussion was how the Holocaust had been exploited to oppress others. “His appearance was grossly insensitive, and follows the now familiar pattern of deliberate and calculated offensive behaviour. The NEC cannot allow this to continue whilst Ken Livingstone remains a member of the party,” the letter said. The lifting of Livingstone’s suspension was raised by numerous Labour MPs at the private meeting of the parliamentary Labour party on Monday, with many expressing concerns about the damage that could be done to the party’s reputation. Wes Streeting MP, the chair of the all-party parliamentary group for British Jews, said: “This decision is welcome, but long overdue. Almost a year has passed since Jeremy Corbyn announced that Mr Livingstone’s conduct would be subject to further investigation with seemingly little action by the national executive committee. “It should not have required 11th-hour action by an outgoing general secretary to indefinitely suspend him. It is time for decisive action from the NEC and the party’s leadership, not just to expel Mr Livingstone for his gratuitously offensive remarks about Hitler and Zionism and his subsequent lack of remorse, but against all antisemites and their apologists infesting the Labour party.” Livingstone told the Observer last week that the matter was over and he expected to be reinstated. If he were thrown out, he would take legal action against the party, he said. He argued that he had been referring to an agreement between German Zionists and the Nazi government in 1933. “You can’t expel someone for stating historical fact,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"money/2018/mar/08/credit-card-fraud-payments-easyjet","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-08T07:00:02Z","webTitle":"Why was I punished by easyJet for someone else’s crime?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2018/mar/08/credit-card-fraud-payments-easyjet","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2018/mar/08/credit-card-fraud-payments-easyjet","fields":{"headline":"Why was I punished by easyJet for someone else’s crime?","bodyText":"In June 2014 I reported to my bank fraudulent use on my credit card, which, among other things, related to £2,000-worth of dental treatment and flights purchased with Ryanair and easyJet.

Brexit negotiations. The subtlety, sensitivity and common sense that eventually resolved one of the most intractable of age-old national conflicts with the Good Friday agreement is entirely absent here. Whatever little goodwill existed at the start has blown away on all sides, with Michel Barnier’s brutally unvarnished treaty terms on Wednesday eliciting explosive responses from ever more frantic Brexiteers. Two of the architects of that masterclass in patience and pragmatism in Ireland, John Major and Tony Blair, vent their incredulity that peace after 30 years of terror and over 3,000 deaths is, in Blair’s words on this morning’s Today programme, “to be sacrificed on the altar of Brexit”. These two remind the forgetful what a phenomenal success it was to persuade republicans on both sides of the border to forgo their ancient claim to the six counties, unless the people of Northern Ireland should themselves choose a united island. In exchange, there has been 20 years of peaceful cross-border cooperation on everything. But now the Brexiteers say all that has passed its sell-by date because it is the roadblock to their fantastical dreams of as yet unknown far-away trade deals. These former prime ministers, along with soft-Brexit MPs, are accused of “using” the Irish question for their own pro-EU purposes. But Boris Johnson’s cavalier dismissal of inconvenient Irish peace is the grossest abuse of a foreign secretary’s responsibilities in our lifetime. The Daily Mail retaliates against Major as the most “hopeless and hapless” prime minister of our times and Nadine Dorries calls him a “traitor”, no less, for delivering the strongest speech of his mostly insignificant political career. Full of newfound conviction, Major calls for parliament to decide and if not, a referendum on the final deal. Blair too was at his most reasoned and persuasive, heading for Brussels to try to ease the freedom of movement impasse. What influence do they have? These two has-beens serve only to remind us of the inadequacy of our present leaders in this national crisis, as Theresa May finally reveals on Friday what her Brexit means, including for the Irish border. Or will she parade another nest of unicorns of impossibility? Blair in Brussels seeks easement on freedom of movement, pointing to rising EU nationalist and xenophobic parties. Observers say no chance: he is disingenuous in blurring EU sentiment against arriving Muslims from outside, while internal freedom of movement is largely uncontentious. But he can bring back reminders that other countries such as Belgium use restrictions within EU rules that neither he, David Cameron nor May made use of: registration of all new EU arrivals, sending people home if they have no job after three months – which needs universal ID cards – and insistence they hold insurance for health and unemployment. Those might be enough to sway leave voters who now see the inescapable real world consequences of Brexit all around us, as the high street is hit by an avalanche of shop closures due in part to falling living standards, less shopping, fear for the future and the plummeted pound, while the NHS loses nurses and GPs. All this people start to see already, while the rest of the EU surges ahead of us. Each week negotiations conducted with grudge and blame by pig-headed and pea-brained obstinates reduce the prospect of damage limitation. But of all issues, the Irish border was always the boulder there is no climbing round. Dishonestly, some Brexiters shrug, and say let the Irish and the EU put up their own border if they want: that’s their funeral. That’s nonsense: World Trade Organisation rules require member countries not to discriminate between their trading partners – so if we went for no border with Ireland in a no-deal Brexit, we would need to be equally open to all the world for everything. As a “no deal” threatens, the game is beginning to change to who the public will blame most afterwards. But since almost every step forward is checked by impassable red lines, all red lines may be up for reconsideration – even one fixed since 1917, the question of Sinn Féin’s seats in parliament. The taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, ventured to call on the party on Wednesday to take up their six – soon to be seven – Westminster seats “to make things better for Ireland”. He’s right: this should be their heroic moment to step up to rescue their country, north and south. The Irish Labour party joined the call on them to “defend the interests of Ireland”. If only they could mutter the loyal oath (they could always rescind it later) they would arrive in parliament as a cavalry of saviours of Ireland – and incidentally Britain. As a counterweight to the Democratic Unionist party votes, they could ensure a soft enough Brexit with customs union and single market to keep the border open. They need only appear for the few crucial votes that would stop the Brexiters wrecking Irish prospects – then they can retreat again as noble deliverers of their nation. Naturally, like all other red-liners for now, they say no. A spokesman says: “This is not even a topic of discussion within the party. We are an abstentionist party, and we are mandated to abstain from Westminster by the people who vote for us.” For now, everyone says no. The winners might be those who make the biggest U-turn sacrifice for the sake of their country. • Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/mar/01/surrey-woman-who-killed-husband-can-challenge-conviction","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-01T12:48:32Z","webTitle":"Surrey woman who killed husband can challenge murder conviction","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/mar/01/surrey-woman-who-killed-husband-can-challenge-conviction","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/mar/01/surrey-woman-who-killed-husband-can-challenge-conviction","fields":{"headline":"Surrey woman who killed husband can challenge murder conviction","bodyText":"A woman who bludgeoned her husband to death with a hammer has won the latest round in an attempt to appeal against her conviction for murder. Georgina Challen attacked 61-year-old Richard Challen in August 2010 as he ate lunch at the kitchen table in their former home in Claygate, Surrey. In June 2011 a jury at Guildford crown court took 11 hours to find Challen, known as Sally, guilty of murdering the former car dealer. She was jailed for life with a minimum term of 22 years, which was later reduced on appeal by four years. On Thursday, three court of appeal judges allowed Challen leave to appeal against the conviction. Speaking outside court after the hearing, Challen’s son David, who supports her bid, said: “I’m overcome, overjoyed, most of all thankful. Thankful we are being allowed the opportunity to explore this issue further, to explore the issues that might have been overlooked or not present during the first trial. “There are not many words I can say, but I am optimistic. I think a lot of good can come from this for my mother and for anyone else suffering from mental domestic abuse in reference to coercive control.” Referring to his mother, now 63, he added: “She has already got the independence and now she needs to believe that everyone else is with her and the courts are giving her a chance, that is the most important thing.” He also thanked his mother’s solicitor, Harriet Wistrich, who said David had done an “excellent job” raising awareness of the case and the issue of coercive control. Lawyers for Challen argued that the appeal should be allowed as changes in the law around coercive and controlling behaviour since the conviction amounted to fresh evidence in her defence. Challen’s lawyers argue the conviction could be reduced to manslaughter. Coercive control refers to psychological abuse involving manipulation, degradation, using mind games and generally monitoring and controlling a person’s day-to-day behaviour. Clare Wade QC, representing Challen, told the judges: “The understanding of domestic abuse is in constant flux.” Wade said there was now evidence to suggest Challen suffered from a mood disorder, or possibly bipolar disorder, which, combined with her husband’s coercive and controlling behaviour, could have led to her actions. Lady Justice Rafferty, Mr Justice Stuart-Smith and Mrs Justice Carr granted the application. It was the second time Challen had applied for leave to appeal against conviction. An earlier attempt was unsuccessful. Handing down the decision, Rafferty said: “It should be plainly understood that the application made today is but one step in what, it is hoped by counsel, those who instruct her and many others concerned in this case, will be a full detailed exploration of the position, based on scholarship, learning and clinical expertise, which should prevail now. “A jury, it is argued, should, with the benefit of that learning, be enabled to reach a clear settled conclusion on the basis of an understanding which, it is said, was not available to the jury in 2011. “We scrupulously avoid expressing any view on any outcome but we are persuaded that leave to appeal should be granted.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"artanddesign/2018/mar/01/pablo-picasso-13-works-bought-for-110m-at-london-auctions","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-01T17:02:59Z","webTitle":"13 Picasso works bought for £113m by one London buyer","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/mar/01/pablo-picasso-13-works-bought-for-110m-at-london-auctions","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2018/mar/01/pablo-picasso-13-works-bought-for-110m-at-london-auctions","fields":{"headline":"13 Picasso works bought for £113m by one London buyer","bodyText":"A London art adviser has spent more than £110m bulk buying 13 works of art by Picasso on behalf of unnamed wealthy clients. Harry Smith, executive chairman and managing director of the art advisory firm Gurr Johns, bought four Picasso works, including a 1937 portrait of the artist’s lover Marie-Thérèse Walter for £49.8m, at a Sotheby’s auction in London on Wednesday night. The purchases came a day after Smith bought nine of the Spanish artist’s works at a Christie’s auction – all the Picasso lots available. In total Smith spent £113m on Picasso pieces this week. Smith declined to comment on the identity of the client for whom he bought the works but said the art world was in the midst of a fresh love affair with Picasso. Interest in the artist, who died in 1973 at the age of 91, has also been boosted by Tate Modern’s forthcoming show Picasso 1932: Love, Fame, Tragedy, the gallery’s first solo exhibition of the artist’s work. “Picasso is a giant of 20th century art, and his work appeals to collectors and art lovers from all over the world,” Smith said. “The picture of Marie-Thérèse is a masterpiece portrait by Picasso. Its appeal lies in the subject, the date, the condition, the provenance, and the fact it’s completely fresh to the market having been in the family for so long. The art market has a fairly regular supply of Picassos, but it’s rare to see a painting as special and as fresh to the market as this one.” The portrait of Marie-Thérèse, called Femme au Béret et à la Robe Quadrillée, was until recently owned by the artist’s estate. It sold for almost £15m more than the £35m estimate. The work was painted just months after Picasso completed his 1937 masterpieces Guernica, and Weeping Woman, which added to the painting’s appeal. The painting was created at a time of flux in Picasso’s personal life, as his new muse and lover, Dora Maar, was entering the frame. Picasso was quoted as saying of the work: “It must be painful for a girl to see in a painting that she is on the way out.” Helena Newman, chair of Sotheby’s Europe, said: “The women of Picasso’s life are the fulcrum of his creative genius, unquestionably essential to his creative and intellectual processes – none more universally beloved than his ‘golden muse’ Marie-Thérèse, the star of our painting and the exceptional exhibition opening at the Tate. “In the winter of 1937, we see the depiction of Marie-Thérèse mature from the voluptuous curves and sleepy, passive suggestiveness, to the woman who gave birth to Picasso’s child. This painting undoubtedly represented what is most desirable for a connoisseur and collector of modern art.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"football/2018/mar/01/premier-league-relegation-who-survive-drop-championship","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-01T13:15:08Z","webTitle":"Premier League relegation scrap: who will survive and who faces the drop?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/mar/01/premier-league-relegation-who-survive-drop-championship","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/mar/01/premier-league-relegation-who-survive-drop-championship","fields":{"headline":"Premier League relegation scrap: who will survive and who faces the drop?","bodyText":"Paul Doyle West Brom look to be a write-off even though their fixture list seems relatively favourable. Their form is deteriorating rather than improving, and the injury to Daniel Sturridge is an unfortunate, if foreseeable, blow. Stoke, by contrast, are improving, seemingly energised by Paul Lambert, some astute January signings and an in-form Xherdan Shaqiri. The fear is all that is too little, too late, especially with a difficult run-in. Crystal Palace will survive if Wilfried Zaha returns to fitness soon. Southampton are extremely wasteful and often quite boring, but have enough class to stay up. Haplessness clings to West Ham like a foul smell but they will probably linger, too, thanks to their firepower. Huddersfield have found a second wind, as well as a much-needed schemer (Alex Pritchard). Brighton’s home form should see them right, although their run-in is tough. Newcastle and Watford can pull out big results in times of need. Swansea, meanwhile, have found a method and spirit under their new manager but their squad remains weak and their resurgence looks set to peter out like a bad Carlos Carvalhal analogy. Relegated West Brom, Swansea, Stoke Dominic Fifield West Brom are one of the season’s mysteries given the apparent quality of their squad. But as they continue to unravel it is hard to spy recovery. The identity of the other two condemned to the drop may well go down to the final day. Swansea’s meeting with Stoke on that afternoon already looks critical, particularly with Paul Lambert’s side now confronting an awkward run of fixtures. Even if Stoke scramble just above the cut-off before the trip to Wales, that game against Carvalhal’s improved side may determine which team succumbs. Southampton must hope they are clear by the time Manchester City visit on the last day – that said, Pep Guardiola’s team will surely already be champions and may have the distraction of a European Cup final – although that may be asking too much after one league win since 26 November. Crystal Palace’s predicament can be summed up in 12 names – Zaha, Dann, Puncheon, Kelly, Sakho, Sako, Schlupp, Wickham, Speroni, Ward, Cabaye, Loftus-Cheek – and they need the majority of those walking wounded restored to fitness. What would be remarkable, but feels plausible, is the survival of all three promoted clubs. This correspondent’s game-by-game predictions had each finishing with 38 points, one clear of Stoke in 18th and three of Southampton in 19th. Relegated West Brom, Southampton, Stoke Ben Fisher This weekend could leave a few teams feeling peculiar but, with 10 games left, everybody from ninth-placed Everton and below has cause for concern. West Brom look doomed and there remain serious concerns for Stoke (can they plug their leaky defence?) and Swansea (can they discover an attacking edge to build upon their miserly tally of 21 league goals?) Stoke’s trip to Southampton on Saturday is a proverbial six-pointer, with both teams painfully unconvincing. Mauricio Pellegrino has won only five Premier League matches all season (two of which came against West Brom) and the worry for Crystal Palace is that their dire start could still come back to bite them. With Hodgson’s side out of sorts – with one win from their past six – and matches against Chelsea, Manchester United and Liverpool this month, they have every right to be worried. Bournemouth, Brighton and Huddersfield can strike fear into the Premier League’s elite but tend to self-destruct, while Newcastle and West Ham need to discover some consistency to steer clear of the drop. Relegated West Brom, Stoke, Crystal Palace Stuart James This season’s relegation battle is so hard to call, not least because half the clubs are involved and a couple of wins can change the picture dramatically. That said, West Brom are the one team at risk of being cut adrift. Their squad is talented enough to survive, yet results suggest otherwise; they have won only once in 26 league matches, and that form points to relegation. In terms of the teams most likely to stay up, Bournemouth have goals in their squad and need two wins to hit the 38-point mark that I expect to be enough. Brighton are a point behind Bournemouth, defend well and are strong at home, which suggests Chris Hughton’s team will be OK. Marko Arnautovic and Javier Hernández should help to get West Ham over the line. That leaves two from Huddersfield, Newcastle, Southampton, Crystal Palace, Swansea and Stoke. Shaqiri can be a gamechanger for Stoke and Zaha is a similar player for Palace. Swansea have some momentum and winnable home games, while Rafael Benítez seems to have galvanised Newcastle. Huddersfield have adapted brilliantly and exceeded expectations, yet they could slide into trouble. As for Southampton, their run-in looks particularly tricky and their home form is miserable. Relegated West Brom, Southampton, Huddersfield Louise Taylor Incredibly fine margins will separate survivors from the doomed. Much hinges on injuries – will Swansea’s Alfie Mawson and Palace’s Zaha stay fit, can Newcastle’s Islam Slimani and West Brom’s Sturridge get fit? Sheer luck (an awkward deflection sometimes changes entire narratives) plays a part but mental resilience matters greatly. Newcastle arguably have a weaker squad than their fellow strugglers but, in Benítez, they possess a world-class manager and, galvanised by Jamaal Lascelles’s captaincy, their togetherness can be catalytic. If Newcastle should survive – just – West Brom will surely pay the price for sacking Tony Pulis at the wrong time and Stoke for some high-risk player recruitment. Southampton, too, look vulnerable. If their FA Cup run may prove a debilitating distraction, they lack the experience of fighting recent relegation battles which could serve Crystal Palace and Swansea well. Pardew’s appointment has backfired at the Hawthorns but Carvalhal’s hiring by Swansea looks an astute move and David Wagner’s blend of innovation and inspiration promises to, against all odds, ensure safety for Huddersfield. Ditto Hughton’s calm competence at Brighton. While Crystal Palace and West Ham have the most gifted squads, Bournemouth are unconvincing but should cling on – if only for this season.

England and New Zealand make such a great couple. On a two-paced drop-in pitch, England battled but New Zealand bowled well enough to induce a collapse, in the great English tradition. At 80 for one, NZ were cruising to victory, but when Ben Stokes took a great catch, it was their turn to collapse. They lost five wickets for 23 in seven overs from England’s spinners. It was brainless stuff, but Kane Williamson survived it all and set about rebuilding with Mitchell Santner. They added 96 in 21 overs, and it took a flukey run-out to get England back into the game. Then Woakes and Curran showed steel under pressure, and poor old Williamson was left with a consolation century. England lead the five-match series 2-1. Shall we just declare it a tie now? Time for a few emails. Mark McCaughrean picks up on my existential question from the 43rd over: “We’re all just figboxes of your imagination anyway, surely?” And so does Garry Sharp. “Yes, it is still a blog dear heart. It’s appreciated. I followed the first two matches OBO even as I watched them on Sky in my Nairobi hotel room. Even followed the Adelaide test when I was there 😊 Now I’m back in London and jet lag alone keeps me reading, along with TMS. So do keep it up...” We will! If only for the wit and warmth of people like you. Here’s William Hargreaves. “It’s like one hand catching – it’s even more impressive. On the edge of my seat here.” “China up,” adds Jeremy Bunting. “I care about OBO. I’m reading as always. All us OBOers do. We’re a family. It’s just a 3rd ODI is not that exciting until it gets to a close run-chase. Oh it is.” And the last word goes to David Horn. “Morning Tim ... hate to think of you blogging 50 overs without correspondence. Your efforts are appreciated. NZ though seem to be spoiling my attempts to enjoy a low scoring thriller ... and I’ve made a complete arse of my scrambled eggs, through distraction. Hey ho. Oh - you won’t remember, I’m sure, but we emailed a couple of years ago ... did you ever get to watch The Princess Bride? Perfect snow-day movie.” I did! On a rainy afternoon in Sussex, on holiday with the family. Loved it. Thank you. Whatever happened to Westley? Woakes squeezes a wide yorker past Williamson, and England have won by four runs. What a finish. Williamson didn’t deserve to lose. For run out, against Williamson, who stole a second from a shove into the leg side. He’s fine. Five needed from two. And it’s a dot! Williamson turns down a single, which is brave, minister. Mid-50th over: New Zealand 228-8 (Williamson 110, Sodhi 2) A dot from Woakes! Wide of off, and slow, it defeats Williamson’s swing. But then he laps for – two, as Stokes sweeps up smartly behind Rashid. And then a six! A pull by Williamson, and NZ need seven off three. Even the WASP might have them as favourites now. 49th over: New Zealand 220-8 (Williamson 102, Sodhi 2) Curran bowls two dots! To Williamson! If that’s not worth a couple of screamers, I don’t know what is. What an appetite for the big moment Curran has: he is cricket’s Marcus Rashford. NZ need 15 off the last over. Mid-49th over: New Zealand 219-8 (Williamson 101, Sodhi 2) Needing almost two runs per ball, NZ get them for the first half of Curran’s over. Now they need 16 off nine balls. So tight. Williamson clears mid-off! That’s a much-needed four, and a magnificent hundred – for its tenacity and acumen, if not its strokeplay. 48th over: New Zealand 213-8 (Williamson 96, Sodhi 1) Superb from Woakes, who concedes only three. The dilemma is Williamson’s now – to hit or not to hit. NZ need 22 from 12 balls. A cheering email from Sam Hey. “Hey Tim, don’t worry, me and the rest of us Manchester students are still here. It’s getting tense here in the Westpac. A beer snake just got confiscated and the kiwis might turn on us...” Ooh that’s big. A dot from Woakes draws a swish into the sky from Southee. Stokes, at deep square, calls for it and holds it safely. England are narrow favourites again. 47th over: New Zealand 210-7 (Williamson 94, Southee 7) Can Tim Southee do the business? He can, as Curran serves up a half-volley which gets clipped, imperiously, to deep midwicket. Nine off the over, up with the going rate. Now NZ need 25 off three. An email from Gavin Twedily. “Tim lad, you exist. I exist. We all exist. Do you think the word exist is the origin of the word existential? Buggered if I know. The cricket on the other hand; that’s going to the final over. All the best, Garfin.” 46th over: New Zealand 201-7 (Williamson 92, Southee 1) Not just a wicket, but only two off the over – well done Woakes. The emails, like the wickets, are coming in clusters. “Oh.. tim.” Oh Tapan. “The match is so absorbing that anyone barely has time to write to you!” A straight push, and Woakes deflects it on to the stumps. The bails light up, and so do England’s eyes, as a fine innings comes to an end. For run out against Santner ... Looks out. 45th over: New Zealand 199-6 (Williamson 91, Santner 41) Curran almost makes something happen, as a chop from Santner goes agonisingly close to Roy at backward point. And then Williamson, failing to pick the leg-cutter, chips to midwicket, who would snaffle it if he wasn’t so deep – and it goes for four. Nine off the over. PJ Ullmann sees my question (43rd over) and answers: “No.” 44th over: New Zealand 190-6 (Williamson 84, Santner 39) Morgan, desperate for a wicket, gives Rashid his final over. The batters, knowing this, settle for a few singles. Rashid finishes with two for 34, which is very good, but maybe not good enough. Holy crap – a tweet has come in. “Well I thought we were toast when I woke up to feed my 6 month old daughter 2 hours ago,” says Guy Hornsby, “but we appear to making a game of it now. Listening to TMS while she rocks around, very happy with our comeback. Start ‘em young. #JuniorOBO.” A fearless hashtag. 43rd over: New Zealand 186-6 (Williamson 82, Santner 37) Tom Curran returns, bearing slower balls, but Saunter clubs him through the covers, on the up, for four. If a live blog goes through a whole innings without an email coming in from a reader, can it be said to have been written at all? 42nd over: New Zealand 179-6 (Williamson 81, Santner 31) Now Morgan does turn back to Rashid. Williamson is watchful, Santner more feisty – he swats a short one back past the bowler, like a forehand return, for two. The batsmen are in charge at the moment. 41st over: New Zealand 175-6 (Williamson 80, Santner 28) Stokes opens with a wide, then gets clobbered for four by Saunter, lofting him over mid-on with a short-arm jab. Seven off the over, which is just what NZ need – 60 more required, off 54 balls. 40th over: New Zealand 168-6 (Williamson 79, Santner 23) Tidy again from Wood, when England could do with messy but explosive. 39th over: New Zealand 163-6 (Williamson 77, Santner 21) Captaincy, in cricket, is just one dilemma after another. Does Morgan go back to Rashid, for his last two overs, or to Stokes, with his golden arm? He opts for Stokes, who immediately dishes up a juicy one, drifting down leg, which gives Williamson a rare boundary. 38th over: New Zealand 159-6 (Williamson 72, Santner 21) Here is Wood, and he does well, conceding only three. But still no breakthrough. The WASP now grudgingly gives NZ a 21% chance; I make it more like 51. 37th over: New Zealand 156-6 (Williamson 70, Santner 20) Moeen’s final over goes for three as the batsmen elect to see him off. NZ need 79 off 78 balls – perfectly feasible, as long as these two stay there for another 20 minutes. 36th over: New Zealand 153-6 (Williamson 68, Santner 19) Better from Woakes, but these two have added fifty and England need a breakthrough. If Wood was in form, he’d have the ball now. 35th over: New Zealand 149-6 (Williamson 66, Santner 18) Another tight over from Moeen, and that’s drinks. 34th over: New Zealand 146-6 (Williamson 63, Santner 18) Woakes bowls a wide, which is, bizarrely, the first extra of the innings. And another one, so the wides are like London buses. In between, Santner spots a slower ball and plays a lovely straight drive for three. He holds the key. 33rd over: New Zealand 138-6 (Williamson 61, Santner 14) Moeen puts the plug back in, conceding only two. Morgan, who has only two overs left from each of Moeen and Rashid, gives up on Root and sends for Woakes. 32nd over: New Zealand 136-6 (Williamson 60, Santner 13) Morgan does bring on Root, and Williamson, seeing the chance to break the spell, pulls a long hop for four. The target is 99 now, off 18 overs, so five-and-a-half an over, and the seamers have largely been innocuous: it’s not game over yet. 31st over: New Zealand 129-6 (Williamson 52, Santner 12) Moeen finds the edge of Santner’s blade with a classical off-break, but there’s no slip and it dribbles away for two. A rare case of Morgan missing a chance to attack. 30th over: New Zealand 124-6 (Williamson 52, Santner 9) Rashid overpitches and Saunter gets the first boundary for some time with a dreamy cover drive. Morgan likes what the spinners are doing so much, he’s told Root to loosen up. 29th over: New Zealand 117-6 (Williamson 50, Santner 4) The batsmen finally do the obvious thing to Moeen, and milk him for singles. One of them brings fifty for Williamson, off 69 balls, with just two fours and a six. He’s been quietly excellent, but not dominant – he suffered from Munro hogging the strike, and then from the middle order batting like lemmings. 28th over: New Zealand 112-6 (Williamson 47, Santner 2) Three off the over from Rashid, so he and Moeen have five for 37 off their 12 overs. What a shame that they won’t bowl together in a Test match. The man partly responsible for that situation, Joe Root, is standing at slip: a penny for his thoughts. The third ump, like Roy, was in doubt. For a catch – was it clean? Even Jason Roy, diving forward, wasn’t sure he’d held it, and the soft signal is not out. 27th over: New Zealand 109-6 (Williamson 45, Santner 1) A whole over from Moeen goes by without a wicket. 26th over: New Zealand 107-6 (Williamson 44, Santner 0) The person who can keep his head while all around are losing theirs is Williamson, who takes a couple of twos off Rashid. A hundred is there for him if someone can just stick around at the other end. 25th over: New Zealand 103-6 (Williamson 40, Santner 0) And that’s a wicket maiden from Moeen, who has figures of 4-1-16-3. He’s been good, but not that good. New Zealand are not out of it yet: Santner pretty much won the first match in this series on his own. If you can keep your head... you’re not de Grandhomme at this moment. He goes for the big heave and Woakes, at long-on, hardly has to move. All those twenties that England’s batsmen made are looking rather good now. 24th over: New Zealand 103-5 (Williamson 40, de Grandhomme 3) Rashid keeps up the pressure. There’s plenty of time: NZ just need someone else to bat like Williamson, who has been cool, calm and collected. 23rd over: New Zealand 101-5 (Williamson 39, de Grandhomme 2) Moeen’s hat-trick doesn’t happen as it’s Williamson facing, and calmly defending. Can he dig his team out of this hole? The WASP says no, giving NZ only a 16% chance now. That seems a little harsh. 22nd over: New Zealand 98-5 (Williamson 37, de Grandhomme 0) So NZ have lost three wickets for one run off eight balls. “He missed that by a yard,” says one of the commentators. Not quite true, but a foot, for sure. It was a routine leg-break, Nicholls missed it, and it was hitting, so that’s a wasted review. And a tasty collapse. Another one – Nicholls given out, for either lbw or a catch behind the wicket, and one of them is probably good. 21st over: New Zealand 97-4 (Williamson 37, Nicholls 0) Well that was ebb-and-flow at its best. Stokes turned the tide with his salmon leap, and Moeen took full advantage. He will be on a hat-trick when he starts the next over. But Williamson is still there, and he should be able to see NZ through, shouldn’t he? Yes, it’s hitting leg, so Tom Latham is gone for a golden duck. And Farbrace has his two extra wickets, just like that. Latham’s first ball – full from Moeen, and it may well be out... Another one! Chapman again dances down the track, again fails to get to the pitch, and ends up giving gentle catching practice to Morgan at point. If you’re just waking up, so is the game. 20th over: New Zealand 93-2 (Williamson 37, Chapman 4) Mark Chapman, confident enough to give Rashid the charge from the start, almost perishes when the googly spins away from him, but he manages to get a late dab on it. “Two more wickets,” says England’s assistant coach Paul Farbrace, “and we’re right in this.” 19th over: New Zealand 89-2 (Williamson 36, Chapman 1) On comes Moeen Ali, and his first ball, like Curran’s, is a full toss. Williamson helps himself from the buffet and that’s six. A clear sign that he’s going to run the show now. 18th over: New Zealand 80-2 (Williamson 28, Chapman 0) So Rashid makes the breakthrough, though it was really all about Stokes. A decent knock from Munro, who rode his luck early on, then adjusted well. Just when England needed something, Ben Stokes provides it with a dream of a catch. Munro plays his favourite off shove, and Stokes, at short extra, leaps to his left and swallows it. Game on? 17th over: New Zealand 80-1 (Williamson 28, Munro 49) Munro finally attacks Stokes, with a square push for two and an off shove for three. The pundits are puzzled by the pitch, which isn’t misbehaving as much as it did earlier. Or did the New Zealanders just bowl well? Either way, England have to make something happen in the next half-hour. 16th over: New Zealand 73-1 (Williamson 27, Munro 43) The first over of spin comes from Adil Rashid, who bowls a bit flat and goes for five, but almost persuades Williamson to chip to extra cover. The ring are in close, but not that close. 15th over: New Zealand 68-1 (Williamson 25, Munro 40) Stokes continues to keep things quiet. The broadcasters, getting restless, bring on “an absolute New Zealand legend” for a chat. Who can this be – Richard Hadlee? Jemaine from Flight Of The Conchords? No, it’s Grant Elliott. 14th over: New Zealand 64-1 (Williamson 22, Munro 39) Curran, taking his cue from Stokes, concedes only three singles. Eoin Morgan might have preferred it if he had made something happen, as New Zealand are just beginning to get on top. 13th over: New Zealand 61-1 (Williamson 20, Munro 38) Stokes restores order. As he does. 12th over: New Zealand 58-1 (Williamson 18, Munro 37) Munro, facing Curran, decides it’s time to return to the 21st century. He plays a golfer’s chip into the leg side and almost gets caught on the boundary by Mark Wood, diving like a dervish. Then he repeats the manoeuvre, and so does Wood. “This is almost deja vu all over again,” says a Kiwi commentator, and I can’t tell if he’s joking. 11th over: New Zealand 48-1 (Williamson 17, Munro 28) Ben Stokes comes on and even he, on this surface, is merely tidy. In the crowd, the camera finds some kids dressed in sportswear of a violent shade of pink, who are all looking at their phones. They’re probably reading this. 10th over: New Zealand 47-1 (Williamson 17, Munro 27) And here’s the first bowling change, as Tom Curran replaces Wood. He starts with a full toss outside off, too juicy for Munro to miss out on, before recovering well. Curran seems to have a wonderful temperament. 9th over: New Zealand 42-1 (Williamson 17, Munro 22) Munro gets Woakes away for a rare boundary, punching through the off side. But Woakes still has figures of 5-1-13-1, which are quite something these days. 8th over: New Zealand 37-1 (Williamson 17, Munro 17) Williamson, facing Wood, breaks the spell with an old-school football formation, 4-2-4. All three strokes go through backward point, where there’s an extra fielder for Williamson, but he plays late and gets his placement right. For two minutes, this duplicitous pitch is put in its place. 7th over: New Zealand 25-1 (Williamson 6, Munro 16) After reeling off five dots to Munro in the last over, Woakes goes one better, so that is a maiden. Odd term, that, isn’t it? Time to usher it into retirement, surely. If giving a view on this, please ignore what it says elsewhere on this page and either tweet @TimdeLisle or email tim.delisle.casual@guardian.co.uk. Thanks. 6th over: New Zealand 25-1 (Williamson 6, Munro 16) Munro calms down and plays a more controlled shot, a steer through the covers for four off Wood. Impossible to say who’s ahead. It would be no surprise to discover that these teams were separated at birth. 4th over: New Zealand 19-1 (Williamson 6, Munro 10) Munro manages to get three lives in two balls. He is almost lbw, but England decide against a review as the delivery from Wood probably pitched outside leg; almost run out, off the same ball; and almost caught top-edging a pull off the next one. “This,” says Nasser Hussain, “is just a chaotic innings from Munro.” 3rd over: New Zealand 15-1 (Williamson 3, Munro 9) The ball from Woakes was nothing special, but this pitch is two-paced, which may have made the difference. Kane Williamson comes in, settles for a few dots, then gets off the mark with a cover drive for three. A little chip, a simple catch at mid-on. And a sliver of relief here, as the Guardian spellcheck was doing its damnedest to call Guptill Nuptial. 2nd over: New Zealand 12-0 (Guptill 3, Munro 9) Mark Wood brings some pace to the party, and Colin Munro uses it to steer a four through the covers. He edges the next ball but gets it just past second slip. 1st over: New Zealand 4-0 (Guptill 3, Munro 1) Chris Woakes, now the senior seamer, takes the new ball and the batsmen get through the over. If you’re under 40, this is what the Seventies were like. Morning everyone, or should that be anyone? Thanks to Tanya for taking the dead-of-night shift. Not just a stylish writer, but the founder of a pressure group, @TheNextTest. Enjoy the second innings. I leave you in the expert hands of Tim de Lisle who will take you through the breakfast session. Thank you for your company. 5oth over England 234 all out. (Curran 2 not out) Well that was an eventful last ten overs: 68 runs and 6 wickets. Difficult to know exactly how good a total that is on a pitch with such a whimsical change of mind. Some tight bowling by New Zealand, some courageous bowling by Sodhi, and some patient batting by England, especially, particularly, by Stokes and Morgan who kept things ticking over when scoring was tough. “Not the greatest one-day wicket you’ve ever seen,” says James Franklin back in the Sky studio. Rob Key slates the elaborately mowed fern on the pitch. Hey Rob, I LOVE THE FERN! If you’ve got a bad pitch, at least give the spectators some other eye candy to occupy their time. Wood out off the last ball of the innings attempting a kamikaze second run. Run-out itus starting to infect England now. Rashid hit on the head by a bouncer and attempts a not-on single. 49th over: 227 for 8 (Rashid 7, Curran 0) A boundary! Rashid whips his wrists and divides the two fielders sprinting towards the ball. Seven off the over; one over left. Moeen prematurely scampered down the pitch from the non-strikers end. No run was ever going to come from that. 48th over: 220 for 7 (Moeen 22, Rashid 1) Moeen elegantly wafting at Boult but can’t bisect the boundary. n 47th over: 215 for.6 (Moeen 18, Woakes 16) Southee does well to restrict England to just four singles. Woakes drives elegantly, but straight to Guptill. 18 balls to come. 46th over: 211 for.6 (Moeen 16, Woakes 14) Moeen pulls Boult high and slightly inelegantly, but it is enough to carry the ball to the boundary. “Reading every word” says Tone White, slowly, sipping the first coffee, even slower. Should I put the heating on or go back to bed? Hard waiting for the collapse. Sigh.” Tone, could you set up a bed on the sofa? But then, you’ve already had the first coffee... sleep is never quite as satisfying after that. 45th over: 203 for.6 (Moeen 10, Woakes 12) A wristy blow by Moeen off a shorter, slower ball from Southee for four and then Chris Woakes guides the ball most graciously down to the third man boundary. 44th over: 192 for.6 (Moeen 5, Woakes 6) A beautiful four by Chris Woakes, a sensitive little deflection for four through backward point. What style for a big man! 43rd over: 184 for.6 (Moeen 2, Woakes 0) That’s three for 53 for Sodhi, including Stokes and Buttler at a crucial time in the innings. And just after Buttler had taken a huge stride down the pitch and thwacked Sodhi for 6. Buttler heaving at Sodhi decieved by one that turned away hugely. Latham stumps him just to make sure. 42nd over: 177-5. (Buttler 23, Moeen 2) An angry looking pull from Buttler, hit ferociously hard, beats a diving Boult. With eight overs to go, England could do with another 50? 41st over: 171-5. (Buttler 18, Moeen 1) What a shame! Stokes had done the hard stuff, played with such control. Plaudits to Sodhi, two wickets now. Stokes aims to hit Munro over the top but makes contact with only the bottom of the bat and Munro at long off takes the ball just inside the boundary rope. 40th over: 166-4. (Stokes 38, Buttler 15) Munro not particulary troubling Stokes and Butler, who are innovating their way through the capriciousness of the pitch with a winkle and a glide. 39th over: 159-4. ( Stokes 36, Buttler 10 ) Two consecutive fours by Buttler off Sodhi: a text-book (are they text-book now?) reverse-sweep; a less conventional whallop over mid on 38th over: 149-4. ( Stokes 35, Buttler 1 ) Southee is such a lean mean machine. Stokes dabs him through midwicket for four - this is a remarkably controlled innings - before being surprised by another ball that bangs up from the pitch with frog-like bounce. 37th over: 144-4. ( Stokes 31, Buttler 1 ) Ohhh! Sodhi’s last ball bounces past Stokes’ shoulders, beats the keeper and slip! That was extraordinary. 36th over: 139-4. ( Stokes 29, Buttler 0 ) Southee nearly gets through Morgan’s defences when he tries to pull a ball that doesn’t get a high as he is expecting; a few balls later he gets his prize. A great little innings by Morgan, but he didn’t stay quite long enough to do the fun stuff! A straight ball that arrived more quickly than he was expecting 35th over: 137-3. (Morgan 47, Stokes 28 ) 34th over: 134-3. (Morgan 46, Stokes 27) A boundary for Stokes at last and then a great stop by Latham behind the stumps prevents a boundary from Morgan. 33rd over: 128-3. (Morgan 45, Stokes 22 ) A little bit of this and a little bit of that off Munro brings four off the over This is a war of attenuation, which may be why Sam Hey’s Irish friend has already left. Come back Sam’s friend! - it will get more exciting I promise. Maybe he’s gone to get the scotch eggs? 32nd over: 112-3. (Morgan 41, Stokes 21) Williamson brings Boult back, who immediately hits Stokes in what my mum would call his “gentleman’s department” and then tests Morgan with the shorter ball. He pulls, late, but evades the fielders. 31st over: 120-3. (Morgan 39, Stokes 20) A wide from Munro evades Latham and hits the boundary. Eight from the over, you just get the feeling momentum is building, slowly, here. 30th over: 112-3. (Morgan 37, Stokes 19 ) End of de Grandhomme’s fantastic spell: ten overs, 1-24, always tight and testing. Only ten boundaries for England so far. 29th over: 110-3 (Morgan 36, Stokes 18) One in the eye from the pitch again, as the ball bounces more steeply than either Morgan the keeper or probably Munro expect, and the ball riccochets into Latham. 28th over: 102-3 (Morgan 30, Stokes 16) 100 up! Morgan drives de Grandhomme upishly and the ball fires into Ben Stokes who protects himself with his glove and probably prevents a Morgan boundary. Morgan passes 6000 ODI runs 27th over: 99-3 (Morgan 29, Stokes 14) Bowling change: Munro replaces Sodhi. One run, no run, one run etc 26th over: 96-3 (Morgan 28, Stokes 12) Lots of dibbing and dabbing by Stokes and Morgan to take five off de Grandhomme’s over. How many different words are there for attritional? 25th over: 91-3 (Morgan 26, Stokes 9) First SIX of the innings, a flick by Morgan off Sodhi, 85m over mid-wicket. That breaks the tension a little, and gives the crowd some succour on a sunny day in Wellington. This probably wasn’t what they were expecting this morning. Eleven from the over. 24th over: 80-3 (Morgan 17, Stokes 7) Stokes heaves at a ball from de Grandhomme and then drives nicely at a couple more but can’t pierce the circle. It feels like he’s going to blow in a minute. Sam, I’m not sure if there are many other OBO readers awake, but my brother’s wife who is awesome, Irish, but not a cricket fan, gets pretty excited by the picnic. 23rd over: 78-3 (Morgan 16, Stokes 6) Another neat and tidy over from Sodhi, the sort to please Mrs Tiggy-Winkle. Batting is hard here today, even for these two. 22nd over: 76-3 (Morgan 15, Stokes 5) The bottom of Ben Stokes’s bat has come off! The first ball from de Grandhomme hits the bottom of the splice and huge chunk, a couple of units of Cadbury’s Dairy Milk’s worth, fly into the air. Just one run off the over. 21st over: 75-3 (Morgan 15, Stokes 4) Just two off Sodhi’s over. Tight, nippy, bowling. 20th over: 73-3 (Morgan 14, Stokes 3) Ooochh, another surprise gift from the pitch, a ball from de Grandhomme fires through remarkably high, and so surprises Stokes that his head jolts back puppet-like. As the ball hits the pitch, part of the pitch comes away, not for the first time today. 19th over: 71-3 (Morgan 13, Stokes 2) England are finding it tricky to work Sodhi away, just a couple of singles off the over. 18th over: 69-3 (Morgan 12, Stokes 1) A maiden for de Grandhome as England consolidate for an over. It can’t last - surely - with Morgan and Stokes together. Meanwhile, Sam Hey wants advice from OBO readers: “We’re here in Wellington with our bemused Irish mate who’s never watched a cricket game before.” “What do I tell him to get him excited?” 17th over: England 69-3 (Morgan 12, Stokes 1) A stoic effort by Bairstow ended by Sodhi - who is one of the top three bowlers in the world in ODIs at the moment. He was completely befuddled by the googly. Enter Ben Stokes. Bairstow fooled by the googly “Does anyone out there know where I can get some of the drugs the head groundsman is clearly on?” writes Tim Featherstone Griffin. I can’t help, but I do agree: that huge Fern cut into the grass does hint at some regular halucinogenics. 16th over: England 62-2 (Bairstow 18, Morgan 7)Morgan looking kind of twitchy here, and itching to attack, but so far thwarted apart from a wristy drive at de Grandhomme down to the cover boundary. Bairstow’s 18 has come off 37 balls. 15th over: England 58-2 (Bairstow 18, Morgan 3) 14th over: England 54-2 (Bairstow 17, Morgan 0) Root will be cross with himself there, he had looked in majestic touch. Bairstow set for the anchor role here. Root stepped down the pitch but didn’t get the ball past Sodhi at mid-on 13th over: England 54-1 (Bairstow 15, Root 19) Consecutive fours from Root off Santner : a sort of , im not quite sure what to call it, he switches his hands and gets it down to third man, and then sweeps. He’s looking eager. 12th over: England 42-1 (Bairstow 15, Root 11) Double bowling change with de Grandhomme replacing Boult. England scampering what runs they can here but being held back by some super fielding from Guptill at backward point and the uncertainty in the pitch, and possibly their minds. More whisky info, this time from Chris Bourne. “Whisky and ginger is fine. I have taken to mixing whisky with Fevertree ginger beer, which has much more of a bite and is less sugary than the usual thing. My uncle Jim, when I was first courting up in Clydebank, rescued me from a whole b bunch of potential aunts with the immortal phrase: “You’ll be wanting some lemon in your Grouse?” Whisky is like an ODI in that respect. It doesn’t matter how you mix it as long as you get a result at the end.” 11th over: England 40-1 (Bairstow 15, Root 10) Santner replaces Southee. Root DROPPED on 9. Williamson springs to his right with his left hand at midwicket and can’t quite hold on with his finger tips. 10th over: England 36-1 (Bairstow 13, Root 8) Life continues to be tricky for England against Boult. A little dab from Bairstow somehow nearly makes it to the long-off boundary. A fifth of the innings gone. 9th over: England 33-1 (Bairstow 11, Root 7) A glorious pull by Root through mid-wicket to get off the mark against Southee. It was short and he seemed to have enough time to turn out his pockets in search of a lucky penny before going through with the shot. And advice about whisky and ginger from StJohn Bird (what a name!). “Whisky and ginger is fine - but you need to choose your whisky carefully. If you’re looking at a Whisky Mac, then just mix any blended whisky with green ginger wine - Crabbie’s is an excellent choice. DO NOT mix a single malt whisky into a whisky mac though. Such a waste. Oh, and if you’re ever tempted to try whisky and ginger ale..... well, it had better be Jack Daniels or Jim Beam, because they’re not really whisky so it’s impossible to ruin them... :)“ “Greetings from snowy Edinburgh. Tell Simon McMahon I miss living in Dundee.” 8th over: England 25-1 (Bairstow 10, Root o) That was a wicket that felt inevitable given the pressure being applied by the opening bowlers and the capriciousness of the pitch, particularly at Boult’s end. Roy was surprised by the bounce and speed. Roy pushes at a flier and gets a top edge to Guptill at slip 7th over: England 23-0 (Roy 14, Bairstow 9) Another good over by Southee, probing, probing, with every ball. Bairstow and Roy scampering every possible run - scoring not easy here yet. James Walsh has just got home. “Just walked home through the slush after a Mario Kart night at my friend’s house in Vauxhall. It’s so lovely to come home to the reassuring sound of TMS and the reassuring sight of the OBO. “Late night confessions: for years I thought Jacob Oram was called Jay Caboram. Anyone else made a similar radio-based cricketer name boo-boo?” 6th over: England 19-0 (Roy 12, Bairstow 7) The porridge pitch is bouncing unevenly here. Roy tries to put Boult off by coming down the pitch. Bairstow cuts and the batsmen scamper a quick two off the penultimate ball of the over. 5th over: England 15-0 (Roy 11, Bairstow 4) Bairstow fences aggressively at Southee and the ball disappears through the covers for four and Bairstow is off the mark. 4th over: England 11-0 (Roy 11, Bairstow 0) A whipped pull, sharp as an unexpected punch, by Roy breaks the deadlock, two balls later another four, up and over off Boult. 3rd over: England 3-0 (Roy 3, Bairstow 0) Roy happy to watch and wait while facing Southee, who is bowling immaculately, just a single off the over. “Ha!” says Simon who is definitely still awake for “the same reason everyone’s still awake. Cricket, whisky and peanuts.” Whisky and peanuts - interesting. I like whisky and ginger - is that terrible? 2nd over: England 2-0 (Roy 2, Bairstow 0) Bairstow is surprised by Boult’s first ball which shoots off the pitch like a party popper and catches the edge of the bat - but there is no short leg to catch it. A maiden for Boult. 1st over: England 2-0 (Roy 2, Bairstow 0) Good first over for Southee who finds some early swing. Jason Roy squirts a couple to deep backward square leg but is tested. Not a great crowd here yet, scatterings here and there amongst the yellow seating. Sky show a close up off the pitch - lumpy porridge is the first thing that comes to mind. The players pootle out. England’s ODI totals against New Zealand at this ground again: 130, 123, 89. “Yo Tanya!” writes a very sprightly Simon McMahon. “Minus 5 and snow here in Dundee, Scotland. Roll on spring indeed. The first days of spring. Cue Noah and the Whale. Or Eoin and the tail ... ?” I know I’m being nosy here Simon, but why are you still awake? And here comes the toss... New Zealand have won and will BOWL. Both teams seem slightly suspicious of the wicket which looks strange and “smells agricultural.” For England Mark Wood comes in for David Willey, and Ish Sodhi returns in place of Lockie Ferguson for New Zealand. Ross Taylor’s absence will be “A big loss, it will be frustrating for New Zealand” says James Franklin Meanwhile in New Zealand ...(I hope this works) https://twitter.com/BLACKCAPS/status/969727959522148352 Hot water bottle, check; bed socks, check; coffee, check. Roll on spring. The English cricket season starts in a month and ten days. Official tweet from the NZ MetService: “Warm and windless make for ideal watching conditions for the Blackcaps V England game in #Wellington this afternoon.” A really-quite-chilly-below-zero good morning from ice block Britain. Let’s travel quickly somewhere sunny: to Wellington and to the third one-day international between England and New Zealand and the latest instalment of the Ben Stokes comeback tour. In the last ODI at Tauranga, he took two wickets, conjured up two run-outs, made 63 not out and was named Man of the Match as England beat New Zealand by six wickets. It leaves the series level at 1-1 with three games remaining, and the tantalising question of what Stokes will do next hangs nicely in the air England have played four previous ODIs at the Westpac, but are yet to win one - bowled out for 89, 130, and 123 respectively, and then making 309 for 6, before being beaten by nine wickets by Sri Lanka. But their outstanding fielding performance at Tauranga - the best in recent memory -and their overall dominance in the last game must leave them as favourites. New Zealand get their talisman captain Kane Williamson back but lose Ross Taylor with a thigh strain. England are expected to remain unchanged."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"music/2018/mar/02/mike-huckabee-quits-country-music-association-foundation-protester-bullies","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-02T11:29:13Z","webTitle":"Mike Huckabee quits Country Music Association role due to protester 'bullies'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/mar/02/mike-huckabee-quits-country-music-association-foundation-protester-bullies","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/mar/02/mike-huckabee-quits-country-music-association-foundation-protester-bullies","fields":{"headline":"Mike Huckabee quits Country Music Association role due to protester 'bullies'","bodyText":"Mike Huckabee, the former governor of Arkansas who twice ran for the Republican presidential nomination, has resigned from the board of the Country Music Association Foundation one day after joining it, thanks to vociferous protests against his appointment. The foundation is the philanthropic arm of the Country Music Association, a trade organisation that promotes country music with many projects including the CMA awards, the most prestigious awards ceremony for the genre. Huckabee was hired alongside country star Chris Young, with the CMA stating: “As we continue to advance social change, it’s incredibly important to continue expanding our executive board of directors with dynamic leaders.” Huckabee’s appointment was met with protests, including from businessman Jason Owen, who manages some of the biggest names in country music including Little Big Town, Kacey Musgraves and Faith Hill and described the appointment as “shameful”. Owen, who is gay, said that “Huckabee speaks of the sort of things that would suggest my family is morally beneath his, and uses language that has a profoundly negative impact upon young people all across this country. Not to mention how harmful and damaging his deep involvement with the NRA is.” He said that “with a heavy heart” his companies would “no longer support the CMA Foundation”. Huckabee is an opponent of gay marriage, calling it “Biblical disobedience” that is “outside of nature”, that would “criminalise Christianity”. He is also long-time supporter of the National Rifle Association – he once bought his wife a handgun for a birthday present while at an NRA event as a speaker, and suggested that the Holocaust occurred because Jews had been disarmed: “They had no ability or capacity to resist – the result was the beginning of their captivity, the end of their freedom and the ultimate murder of six million innocent people.” In the wake of the protests, Huckabee stood down from the role, saying he had become an “unnecessary distraction and deterrent to the core mission of the foundation”. On Twitter, he described the protesters as “bullies”, while in a longer written statement he complained of “irrational vitriol” and “intolerant and vicious statements”, adding: “I hope that the music and entertainment industry will become more tolerant and inclusive and recognise that a true love for kids having access to the arts is more important than a dislike for someone or a group of people because of who they are or what they believe.” The most high-profile moment of Huckabee’s political career was in the 2008 presidential election campaign, where he finished third behind John McCain and Mitt Romney for the Republican party nomination. He ran again in 2016, but withdrew early. He now hosts a talk show on Christian TV network TBN, while his daughter Sarah Huckabee Sanders is press secretary in the White House under Donald Trump. Huckabee lists “bass guitarist” in his biography on Twitter, and formed a classic rock band, Capitol Offense, in 1996 when governor of Arkansas, alongside members of his staff. He also once played with right-wing rocker Ted Nugent, and spoke of his passion for music education in his resignation letter. He also has strong opinions on pop music, describing Beyoncé’s lyrics as “obnoxious and toxic mental poison” in his book God, Guns, Grits and Gravy."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"film/2018/mar/02/weinstein-company-avoids-bankruptcy-in-11th-hour-500m-deal","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-02T09:53:32Z","webTitle":"Weinstein company avoids bankruptcy in 11th-hour $500m deal","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/mar/02/weinstein-company-avoids-bankruptcy-in-11th-hour-500m-deal","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/mar/02/weinstein-company-avoids-bankruptcy-in-11th-hour-500m-deal","fields":{"headline":"Weinstein company avoids bankruptcy in 11th-hour $500m deal","bodyText":"Harvey Weinstein’s film and TV production company has avoided bankruptcy at the 11th hour thanks to a $500m (£363m) takeover led by a former senior official in Barack Obama’s administration. On Monday, the board of the Weinstein Company (TWC), which has been pushed to the point of closure following the wave of sexual harassment and assault claims against its co-founder Harvey Weinstein, said it would have to file for bankruptcy after a last minute offer proved “illusory”. The consortium led by Maria Contreras-Sweet, the former head of the Small Business Administration in Obama’s government, and US billionaire Ron Burkle, has returned to the table and is hammering out the final details of a deal to save the business. The transaction includes an $80m compensation fund for victims of Harvey Weinstein, who resigned from the TWC board last year. One of the conditions of the deal going through is that Harvey Weinstein will not benefit financially from the sale. “The deal provides a clear path for compensation for victims and protects the jobs of our employees,” the TWC board said in a statement. “We consider this to be a positive outcome under what have been incredibly difficult circumstances.” Under the $500m deal, which will save 150 jobs, the Weinstein Company will be renamed and hire a new board of directors, the majority of which will be women. Contreras-Sweet said her involvement was inspired by the #MeToo movement that emerged in the wake of the Weinstein allegations. “I have had a long-standing commitment to fostering women ownership in business,” she said. “This potential deal is an important step to that end. The cornerstone of our plan has been to launch a new company that represents the best practices in corporate governance and transparency.” The consortium will take on $225m of debt on TWC’s books. The TWC deal, which will take 40 days to complete, has also received the blessing of Eric Schneidermann, the New York attorney general, who filed a civil rights suit against TWC and its co-founders and criticised the previous structure of the deal. “As I made clear from the start, our office will support a deal that ensures victims will be adequately compensated, employees will be protected moving forward, and those who were responsible for misconduct at TWC will not be unjustly rewarded,” he said. “As part of these negotiations, we are pleased to have received express commitments from the parties that the new company will create a real, well-funded victims compensation fund, implement HR policies that will protect all employees, and will not unjustly reward bad actors.” Weinstein has repeatedly denied all allegations of non-consensual sex. The Weinsteins have put out 94 films since 2010 with the top five grossing more than $1.5bn internationally, according to Box Office Mojo. The company has backed films including The King’s Speech, The Artist, Silver Linings Playbook and Quentin Tarantino’s Django Unchained. Late last year the Weinstein Company sold off the US distribution rights to Paddington 2, the film with the biggest potential earnings due for launch at the time of the scandal, to give it the funds to keep operating while a buyer was sought. The film’s backers and makers also said the family movie should have no association with Weinstein. The film, starring Hugh Grant and the Downton Abbey actor Hugh Bonneville, made $40m in the US and over $200m globally. Two years ago Weinstein valued the company at up to $800m. A year before that the company was flying high as suitors including ITV looked at paying almost $1bn for its TV division, which makes shows including the immensely profitable reality show Project Runway, Netflix’s Marco Polo and the BBC’s War &amp; Peace. Burkle, a friend of the Weinstein brothers who has invested in some of their films, will take a minority stake in the new company taking over TWC through his investment vehicle Yucaipa. Burkle backed the Weinsteins’ failed attempt in 2010 to buy back their original production company, Miramax, which produced hits including Pulp Fiction, No Country for Old Men and The English Patient. Miramax is now owned by the Qatar-based BeIN Media Group."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/blog/live/2018/mar/02/may-brexit-speech-theresa-may-to-use-her-brexit-speech-to-say-we-cant-have-everything-grayling-says-politics-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-02T18:23:00Z","webTitle":"Brexit: May not compromising enough to make deal possible, say top MEPs  - Politics live","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2018/mar/02/may-brexit-speech-theresa-may-to-use-her-brexit-speech-to-say-we-cant-have-everything-grayling-says-politics-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/blog/live/2018/mar/02/may-brexit-speech-theresa-may-to-use-her-brexit-speech-to-say-we-cant-have-everything-grayling-says-politics-live","fields":{"headline":"Brexit: May not compromising enough to make deal possible, say top MEPs  - Politics live","bodyText":"Theresa May has given her most detailed account yet of the final UK-EU trade relationship she wants without antagonising either the harder or softer Brexit wings of the Conservative party. In fact, leading pro-European backbenchers have broadly welcomed what she said, while Tory Brexiters have also signalled that they are happy with her stance. In her speech May went further than ever before to acknowledge some downsides to leaving the EU. She also set out her proposals for a Brexit involving managed divergence, which would see the UK continuing to remain closely aligned with EU regulations in some areas after Brexit, but not in others. This would amount to the softest version of the hard Brexit that became inevitable when May committed the UK to leaving the single market and the customs union. Her ability to hold her party together could be seen as a masterly act of diplomacy and compromise. But, equally, it could be seen as evidence that she is still in cakeland, and refusing to make necessary choices. And there is little evidence that her artfully-constructed compromise will survive contact with the EU’s negotiating team. My colleague Anushka Asthana has more on the speech here. Leading MEPs have said that May has not gone far enough to make a Brexit deal possible. (See 3.44pm.) And Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, has given just a tepid welcome to the speech. (See 3.53pm and 4.02pm.) The Centre for European Reform says the EU will reject what May is proposing. This is from its director Charles Grant. Theresa May’s speech was serious. It was good that she recognised that the UK faces trade-offs and will lose some access to the single market. But the EU will see her demands on goods, such as mutual recognition in some areas, and on services like finance and media, as cherry-picking. She assumes the EU will see the economic case for close relations governed by mutual rule-making – if only. And this is from its deputy director, John Springford. Theresa May is trying to find a Goldilocks trade deal. She wants to make parliament and the British courts sovereign, but also to protect UK-EU trade. So she has advanced a plan that the EU will not accept. Ultimately, the EU will say no to her suggestions for a very broad and deep free trade agreement, and we are heading for something much more economically damaging – unless she changes her red lines. That’s all from me for today. Thanks for the comments. Here is a round-up of some of the more interesting comment on the speech not already covered, mostly from journalists. Where people have posted a Twitter thread, I have just posted the first tweet. But if you click on it, you should be able to pull up the whole thread. A thread from Alan Beattie, the FT’s European leader writer A thread from Politico Europe’s Brexit correspondent, Charlie Cooper From Charles Grant, director of the Centre for European Reform A thread from Peter Ricketts, former head of the Foreign Office A thread from Politico Europe’s Tom McTague A thread from Rupert Harrison, George Osborne’s former chief of staff A thread from Alberto Nardelli, BuzzFeed’s Europe editor From the Resolution Foundation’s Torsten Bell A thread from the Times’s Sam Coates From the anti-Brexit journalist Ian Dunt From James Blitz in his FT Brexit briefing Theresa May’s speech at Mansion House today was the most considered and conciliatory of the three set piece orations she has given on Brexit. She was realistic, in a way she has not been before, about the trade- offs and compromises that the government will have to make as it tries to forge a deal with the EU. And the speech has already received a positive response from Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, who praised it for its “clarity.” But on an initial read, it is hard to see how her words will help advance the second phase of Brexit negotiations. None of the fundamental concerns that the EU has raised about protecting the integrity of the single market have been allayed. From the Guardian’s Jessica Elgot Simon Coveney, the Irish foreign minister and deputy prime minister, has put out a statement welcoming Theresa May’s commitment to the Good Friday agreement and to avoiding a hard border. Frances O’Grady, the TUC’s general secretary, says Theresa May is still not being honest with people about the impact of Brexit. Nick Macpherson, former permanent secretary to the Treasury, wasn’t impressed. This is from the Telegraph’s Brussels correspondent, James Crisp. Open Britain, which is campaigning for a soft Brexit, has put out this statement from the Labour MP Peter Kyle. This was supposed to be the speech that would finally provide detail about what the government actually wants. Instead, all we got was yet more vacuous slogans, yet more meaningless soundbites and yet more attempts to have our cake and eat it. And Best for Britain, which is opposed to Brexit and is campaigning for a second referendum, has put out this from its CEO, Eloise Todd. This speech today was a parade of platitudes and statements about how we need to stay close to Europe in area after area. You have to wonder: was this all worth it? The speech was nuts and bolts and no vision. The worryingly blank board the prime minister stood behind is a metaphor for this government. Without any ideas and in desperate need of anything they can get through Jacob Rees-Mogg and the extremists on the right of her party. An example of the Gordian knot that the prime minister is tangled up in is the European Medicines Agency, which she mentioned in her speech, which will no longer be in the UK after Brexit, but she wants the government to pay into it, have access to it, but lost jobs as she allowed its HQ to leave London. All this would be funny if it wasn’t so tragic. Jeremy Corbyn has recorded a clip for the BBC, which you can watch here, giving his reaction to the speech. He said it provided “no clarity” and “no real sense of priorities”. Ruth Davidson, the Scottish Conservative leader, who played a leading role in the remain campaign, has described the speech as “a pragmatic, realistic plan which gives us the basis for the next round of negotiations”. Davidson went on: As she said, not everyone will get what they want out of those talks. But the prime minister has made clear that she wants to construct a deal that delivers as much common ground as possible, respecting the result while also maintaining close ties with our friends and allies on the continent. Here is some more political reaction to the speech. From the Welsh first minister Carwyn Jones From the former Lib Dem leader and deputy prime minister Nick Clegg From Matthew Elliott, who was chief executive of the Vote Leave campaign From the Labour MP and Open Britain backer Chuka Ummuna From Stephen Hammond, a pro-European Tory who backs staying in a customs union with the EU From the Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood From the former Ukip MP Douglas Carswell Here is a Guardian Opinion panel, with contributions from Polly Toynbee, Katy Balls, Maya Goodfellow and John Redwood, with verdicts on the May speech. Here is Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland’s first minister, on what May said. She says it was “bizarre” that May’s speech set out the reasons why the hard Brexit she is proposing is such a bad idea. Jeremy Corbyn, or the minion who runs his Twitter account (as I put it earlier – see 11.36am), has tweeted a video response to May’s speech, which does not mention Brexit at all. The CBI has welcomed some aspects of Theresa May’s speech. But, in a statement, its director general, Carolyn Fairbairn, says the government must do more to “lift the fog of uncertainty”. We heard the strongest acknowledgment yet of what’s needed to get a good deal. A possible future role for the ECJ, membership of some EU agencies, willingness to take steps to guarantee a level playing field – these are all welcome softening of red lines. They will make a good deal more achievable. But more is needed to lift the fog of uncertainty and we welcome the PM’s call to ‘get on with it’. This is all about delivery, with three top priorities. Fairbairn is particularly critical of the government’s proposals for customs after Brexit, which she says “do not deliver”. Stephen Kinnock, the pro-European Labour MP, says Theresa May’s speech overlooked the fact that many EU agencies do not have provision for the kind of third party participation May envisages in some cases. Peter Foster, the Telegraph’s Europe editor, says Michel Barnier’s tweet (see 3.53pm) should be seen more as a threat than a compliment. Heidi Allen, a pro-European Tory, says she is “greatly encouraged” by the speech. Another Tory pro-European, Sarah Wollaston, has also welcomed it, but in a much more qualified manner. Allen and Wollaston are among the few rebel Tories who have signed the amendment to the trade bill saying the UK should stay in a customs union after Brexit. Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, has welcomed Theresa May’s speech on the grounds that it provides “clarity”. He does not sound swept away with enthusiasm, but he is being positive. Gerard Batten, the acting Ukip leader, isn’t satisfied with the speech. In a statement he said: On many points of detail, to be fair, [May] appears to be going in the right direction, but not with the fortitude and speed that is required. Time is short to ensure the preparations are in place to ensure her promises, good promises that both parliament and most importantly the UK courts will have complete sovereignty in this country. But it is clear that she isn’t actually a committed leaver with all her talk of regulatory alignment and continued membership of a slew of EU agencies and organisations. Guy Verhofstadt, the European parliament’s lead Brexit spokesman, says he thinks there will be “little appetite” in the EU to sign up to what Theresa May is proposing. Verhofstadt (a Belgian liberal) is in some respects Brussels’ answer to John Mann; he is always up for a pithy quote slagging off the Tory government. And he is also not quite as important in the process as some reports suggest; the European commission is in charge of the Brexit talks, not the parliament, although the parliament will have to agree it in the end. But he is a mainstream, serious MP (as well as a former prime minister), and he is not the only figure in Brussels to criticise the speech. Manfred Weber, the German MEP and Angela Merkel ally who leads the centre-right European People’s party group in the European parliament (the biggest group), has tweeted this. Verhofstadt is also leader of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe group in the European parliament, the fourth biggest group. So the leaders of two of the biggest four groups in the parliament have criticised the speech. Perhaps Theresa May has won back the Institute of Directors after their flirtation with Jeremy Corbyn? The IoD’s director general, Stephen Martin, has issued this response. Business leaders will welcome the prime minister’s honest admission that negotiating the future UK-EU relationship will involve making difficult choices. The prime minister put forward an ambitious vision for this new partnership, both in terms of access and sectors. It is important that she explicitly referenced the need for binding commitments in areas such as state aid and competition policy, which the IoD has long called for. Her acknowledgment of the need for new labour mobility arrangements will also strike a positive chord with businesses. On regulation, we are glad to see her refer to the importance of new cooperation mechanisms that will underpin the trust in each other’s regulatory frameworks. We look forward to the UK putting forward proposals that set out more clarity about how this would work. It was also welcome to hear an explicit reference to continued participation in EU regulatory agencies such as the European Medicines Agency. But Martin also said he thought the transition might have to be extended. We are keen for more details from the government on the timelines. It is important to stress that if the UK is doubling down on its unprecedented customs partnership model, HMRC have said it will take five years minimum to implement. That means businesses will need longer to adjust to new settings. We have long emphasised that businesses and government agencies need time to prepare for post-Brexit arrangements. Nicky Morgan, the Conservative pro-European and one of the Tories who has signed an amendment to the trade bill saying the UK should stay in a customs union with the EU, has welcomed the speech. Here is the full text of Theresa May’s speech. The European Research Group, which represents about 60 Tories pushing for a hardish version of Brexit, liked the speech, the Telegraph’s Christopher Hope reports. The Lib Dem leader, Sir Vince Cable, has criticised the speech, saying May has avoided tough decisions. He said: Theresa May has once again prevaricated from making serious decisions about our future. Her speech outlined all the reasons why we should stay in the single market and customs union, but she will carry on regardless, driving us out to placate Brexiters in the cabinet . May’s diminished authority is allowing Brexit extremists to neuter any chance she has at getting an acceptable deal for the UK. Iain Duncan Smith, the former Tory leader and a key Brexiter, described the speech as “upbeat and clear” and called on the European commission to “stop playing games” and treat Britain as an equal partner. He told the Guardian: It was a good speech – it covered all the key items about leaving the EU but also the single market and customs union and ruled out simply adopting other options such as Norway and Canada. He said the prime minister wanted to secure a special relationship that seemed “reasonably and wholly achievable”. He went on: There are negotiations to be done. It is now over to the commission but it is time for the commission to stop playing games and stop the megaphone and start negotiating as equal partners. Yes there are needs for compromises but on both sides. He described the legal text of the withdrawal agreement – which included the possibility of Northern Ireland remaining in the customs union in a divide from the rest of the UK – as “absurd” and said the urgency now was to talk about trade as the border arrangements would flow from that. Arlene Foster, the DUP leader, has welcomed the speech. She put out this statement: The prime minister has set forward the basis upon which it would be possible to move forward. The issues facing both the United Kingdom and the European Union are of fundamental importance and it is vital that we achieve outcomes that are sustainable for the future. I welcome the prime minister’s clear commitment that she will not countenance any new border being created in the Irish Sea between Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom. Northern Ireland goods must have unfettered access to trade into Great Britain and the same must apply to Great Britain goods entering Northern Ireland. Indeed, it is particularly welcome that one of the ‘five tests’ is strengthening the union. Securing a sensible outcome for everyone will require the EU27 to consider innovative solutions rather than rule out any proposal which has not been conceived in Brussels. As Michel Barnier himself has said, “the solution cannot be based on a precedent”. Last August’s United Kingdom proposals were innovative but did not receive a fair hearing in many quarters. Those proposals can ensure there is no hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland after we exit the EU. We want to see an outcome that protects the economic and constitutional integrity of the United Kingdom but one that also enables us to have a good trading relationship with our nearest neighbours. Here is the customs paper (pdf) that Foster is referring to and that May mentioned extensively in her speech. Foster says it did not get a fair hearing, but the paper itself describes the “customs partnership” proposal it sets out as “an innovative and untested approach that would take time to develop and implement”. Here is a snap summary of top lines from the speech. May conceded that the UK would have less access to the single market after Brexit. She said: We are leaving the single market. Life is going to be different. In certain ways, our access to each other’s markets will be less than it is now. How could the EU’s structure of rights and obligations be sustained, if the UK – or any country – were allowed to enjoy all the benefits without all of the obligations? As the TUC (see 11.47am) and Open Britain (see 1.10pm) have said, this contradicts what May was saying about Brexit last year. She said the UK would have to make “binding commitments” to maintain EU regulatory standards in certain areas after Brexit. The next hard fact is this. If we want good access to each other’s markets, it has to be on fair terms. As with any trade agreement, we must accept the need for binding commitments – for example, we may choose to commit some areas of our regulations like state aid and competition to remaining in step with the EU’s. The UK drove much of the policy in this area and we have much to gain from maintaining proper disciplines on the use of subsidies and on anti-competitive practices. Speaking with reference to her proposals for a new customs arrangement with the EU, May also said that the UK would not be able to lower regulatory standards on industrial goods after Brexit. We recognise this would constrain our ability to lower regulatory standards for industrial goods. But in practice we are unlikely to want to reduce our standards: not least because the British public would rightly punish any government that did so at the ballot box. She said the UK wanted to remain part of the European Medicines Agency, the European Chemicals Agency, and the European Aviation Safety Agency after Brexit. We will also want to explore with the EU, the terms on which the UK could remain part of EU agencies such as those that are critical for the chemicals, medicines and aerospace industries: the European Medicines Agency, the European Chemicals Agency, and the European Aviation Safety Agency. We would, of course, accept that this would mean abiding by the rules of those agencies and making an appropriate financial contribution. She said the UK would not be part of the digital single market after Brexit. On digital, the UK will not be part of the EU’s digital single market, which will continue to develop after our withdrawal from the EU. This is a fast evolving, innovative sector, in which the UK is a world leader. So it will be particularly important to have domestic flexibility, to ensure the regulatory environment can always respond nimbly and ambitiously to new developments. She said EU legal decisions would continue to affect the UK after Brexit. The second hard fact is that even after we have left the jurisdiction of the ECJ, EU law and the decisions of the ECJ will continue to affect us. For a start, the ECJ determines whether agreements the EU has struck are legal under the EU’s own law – as the US found when the ECJ declared the safe harbour framework for data sharing invalid. When we leave the EU, the withdrawal bill will bring EU law into UK law. That means cases will be determined in our courts. But, where appropriate, our courts will continue to look at the ECJ’s judgments, as they do for the appropriate jurisprudence of other countries’ courts. She reaffirmed her commitment to having no hard border in Ireland after Brexit, but did not offer any new proposals as to how this might be achieved. Instead she referred to the two alternative proposals for customs arrangements with the EU set out in a government paper last summer. She did not say which of the two, a “customs partnership” or a “highly streamlined customs arrangement” she most favoured. She strongly rejected EU claims that what the UK wants amounts to cherry picking. The EU itself is rightly taking a tailored approach in what it is seeking with the UK. For example, on fisheries, the commission has been clear that no precedents exist for the sort of access it wants from the UK. The fact is that every free trade agreement has varying market access depending on the respective interests of the countries involved. If this is cherry picking, then every trade arrangement is cherry picking. Moreover, with all its neighbours the EU has varying levels of access to the single market, depending on the obligations those neighbours are willing to undertake. What would be cherry picking would be if we were to seek a deal where our rights and obligations were not held in balance. And I have been categorically clear that is not what we are going to do. And the Q&amp;A is now over. I will post a snap summary shortly. Q: [From a French journalist] Isn’t it time you told the truth, that there will be a border in Northern Ireland? Maybe a light border, but there will be a border. May says she has been very clear; there will be no return to a hard border in Northern Ireland. And she will maintain the common market of the UK, she says. Q: [From a German journalist] Is Brexit worth it in the light of what you are saying today? May says, if that was a question about whether the UK will think again, it won’t. She says the people took the decision. It is up to parliament to implement it, she says. Unlike some politicians, she is being straight with people, she says. Q: [From the Guardian’s Anushka Asthana] What happens if having a customs union is the best way to protect jobs and the economy, would that trump independence from EU laws? May says she has set out her five tests. She thinks a customs arrangement is the way forward. Q: [From the Mail’s Jason Groves] Are you telling your colleagues the UK will not get full autonomy over its laws after Brexit? And is this speech today your bottom line? May says parliament will be sovereign. It will determine UK laws. But there are other countries that make agreements with other countries. The European court of justice will still have a remit within the EU. Q: [From the Sun’s Tom Newton Dunn] What will you do if you do not get what you want? Is no deal still a possibility? And will you repeat that now? Yes, says May. She says she has said on many occasions that no deal is better than a bad deal. But she is confident of reaching a deal. Q: [From Sky’s Faisal Islam] Is the customs partnership option the favoured one? It was described as a blue skies option. And it was said it would take five years to implement. May says the government has set out two options on customs. She says the UK and the Irish will sit down with the EU to discuss the details of this. Q: [From ITV’s Robert Peston.] People voted to take back control. But today you are promising not to exercise the control you are taking back. So what was the point of Brexit? May says people voted to take back control of money, borders and laws. That will happen. In some areas it will make sense to operate on the same basis as now. But the decision will be for parliament. There will be commitments. But that happens in any trade deal, she says. Q: [From the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg] What you call hard facts could be seen as compromises, many of which were obvious months ago. Do you accept we cannot have it all? And what makes you think the EU will change its mind? May says she thinks this is the best deal not just for the UK, but for the EU. The EU itself has said it wants an ambitious relationship, she says. May says the approach she has set out today would honour the referendum result. And it would appeal to those who voted leave and remain. Whatever deal is secured, the future of the UK is bright, she says. She says she looks forward to discussing this with our European friends. Although we are leaving the EU, we are all still European. She says, as in any negotiation, no one will get everything they want. There will be ups and down ahead, she says. What will be remembered will be whether the UK and the EU reach and enduring solution. She says both sides have a shared interest in getting this right. So let’s get on with it. May says “bold and creative” thinking can lead to new agrements in a range of areas. And, in the light of the rise of protectionism (she says this in a tone of voice that implies she is talking about President Trump) she says the EU and the UK can set an example on free trade. May turns to transport. And May says the UK does not want to be part of the single market for digital. The UK is a world leader here, she says. It needs to be able to respond swiftly and flexibly to new developments. May turns to energy. The UK would want broad energy cooperation with the EU, she says. She says she wants a close association with Euratom. May says broadcasting and financial services have not been covered in any free trade deals before. On broadcasting, she says the UK provides 30% of the channels available in the EU. We should explore creative options, she says. On financial services, she says Philip Hammond, the chancellor, will say next week how financial services should be part of a deep and comprehensive partnership. May says the UK is not looking for passporting. May says the goal should be the ability to access each other’s markets. May turns to services. She says the UK and the EU can break new ground with a better deal than ever before. The UK does not want to discriminate against EU service providers in the UK.And it wants its fims to have the same access. An appropriate labour mobility agreement should be struck, she says. She says it would make sense to continue to recognise each other’s qualifications. May says the UK is leaving the common fisheries policy. But the UK and the EU will want to manage shared stocks, and negotiate mutual access and shared markets. May says there also has to be an agreement on customs. The EU has a customs union with some other countries. But they involve them having to abide by the EU’s common external tariff. That is not acceptable to the UK. It would mean the UK not having control of trade policy. Leave and remain voters would not accept that. She says the UK set out two options in its customs paper last summer: a system allowing the UK to shadow EU tariffs; and a “highly streamlined customs arrangement” where both sides would agree to coordinate what they do, as well as measures for Northern Ireland. May says 80% of North-South trade in Ireland is carried out by mico, small and medium-sized businesses. They could carry on as now. And there could be trusted trader arrangements for larger firms. Some of these ideas depend on technology, and trust and goodwill. But there are serious, she says. Summing up, she says trade can be as frictionless as possible. She says this would constrain the UK’s ability to lower standards for industrial goods. But the UK would not want to do this, she says. May says UK would not be able to lower standards for goods under her plans for UK-EU future trade. May says she will want to explore if the UK can remain part of agencies affecting medicines, chemical and the aerospace industries. She says she accepts that could involve accepting EU rules. Association membership would mean the UK being able to continue to supply its expertise, she says. She says if the UK were an associate member, matters could be resolved in UK courts. She says that in medicines the UK regulators assesses more new medicines than any other EU member state. May is now talking about trade in goods. She says the UK will make a commitment to high regulatory standards. In some cases parliament will have the same regulations as the EU. In others, it will want to do something different. May says the EU takes different approaches in different trade deals. The commission has been clear that no precedent exists for the kind of access it wants for fishing in British waters. She says every trade agreement includes different types of access to markets. If this is cherrypicking, then every trade arrangement is cherrypicking. May says it would be cherrypicking if the UK wanted an unfair level of access. But it does not. May rejects claim the UK is ‘cherrypicking’, saying all trade deals are bespoke. May sums up the five points. They will be the foundations underpinning this new partnership, she says. May says there must be five principles behind a new relationship. First, there must be “reciprocal and binding commitments to ensure fair and open competition”. Second, there must be “an arbitration mechanism” that is completely independent. Third, there will have to be an ongoing dialogue and means of consultation. Fourth, there will have to be an agreement on data protection. And, fifth, the EU and the UK must maintain the links between their people. May says the UK and the EU need to look beyond the precedents and find a new balance. She says they must get beyond the transactional, and get something better. She says she wants the “broadest and deepest possible partnership”. May says the UK and the EU must accept this is a negotiation. Neither of us can have exactly what we want. May says the EU has said the only option available to the UK is an off-the-shelf model. But it has also said it is committed to an ambitious deal. A Canada deal would not count, she says. May says, in some areas, the UK will make binding commitments for regulations to remain in step with EU ones. May says UK will make binding commitments for regulations to remain in step with EU ones. She suggests the UK will remain committed to state aid rules. And there will be no race to the bottom in the UK, she says. May says that after Brexit, cases will be decided in UK courts. But European court of justice decisions will still be taken into account. May says existing models do not provide a way forward. She wants to set out some hard facts. In some ways, there will be less access to the single market than now. May says Brexit will reduce access to the single market in some respects. May says the Florence speech set out problems with the Norway or Canada models for a relationship with the EU. She turns to Northern Ireland. Successive British governments have worked to bring about peace in Ireland. Upholding the Belfast agreement will be at the heart of the government’s approach. She says it is not surprising the Brexit vote has caused “anxiety” in the Irish Republic. She says the UK will not introduce a hard border. But it cannot just say it is the EU’s job to find a solution. She says the UK, Ireland and the EU will work to find a solution. She says it would be unacceptable to break up the UK common market. She says she will not let Brexit set back the historic progress in Northern Ireland. May says both sides should turn all their attention to considering the new relationship. But the UK has to set out what it wants. In Munich last month, May outlined what she wants from the security partnership. Today, she will set out what she wants from the economic partnership. May says we are now at a crucial moment in the talks. There is no escaping the complexity of the task ahead of us. She says the government is making “real progress”. The key elements of the withdrawal were agreed last year. The government expressed its concerns about the draft text of the withdrawal treaty published by the EU on Wednesday. But it is committed to the joint report agreed in December. May says she will apply five tests to the Brexit deal. This is the passage briefed in advance. See 10.11am. May says she is here to set out her vision for a future economic partnership with the EU. She has listened to many views. But she wants to start by looking back. She refers to the pledge she made in her speech in Downing Street when she became PM, saying the government would act in the interest of working people, not the elite few. She says, as we leave the EU, we will forge a bold, new role in the world. We will make a country that works “not for the privileged few”, but for everyone. Theresa May is speaking now. She starts by thanking everyone “going the extra mile to help people” at this time of severe weather. Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, has turned up for the speech. This is from my colleague Anushka Asthana. The Sun’s Nick Gutteridge doesn’t like the backdrop. He is referring to the Florence speech, where something similar happened. This is from the FT’s Sebastian Payne. This is from the BBC’s Nick Eardley. 1922 committee meeting don’t normally end up looking like that ... Theresa May is due to start her speech very soon. She is at the Mansion House in London. Boris Johnson, the foreign secretary, is going to miss the speech, ITV’s Robert Peston reports. Open Britain, the group campaigning for a soft Brexit, has identified six government Brexit promises that it thinks are incompatible with Theresa May’s Brexit policy and her determination to take the UK out of the single market and the customs union. It has set them out in an open letter to her signed by Sir Vince Cable, the Lib Dem leader, Caroline Lucas, the co Green party leader, and Chuka Umunna, the Labour MP. Here is an extract. Since the referendum, you and your ministers have made a number of promises about our future trading relationship with the EU: 1 - The exact same benefits as today 2 - No hard border on the island of Ireland or across the UK 3 - Fully negotiated by March 2019 4 - No payment for access to the EU market 5 - A complete end to EU rules and regulations 6 - Continuation of all EU trade deals and new deals ready to come into force Listed below are the promises made by you and your ministers, in your own words. We have grave doubts as to whether these six promises can be delivered, and we do not believe they are all desirable. But they are the commitments against which your speech tomorrow will be judged. If you back away from them everybody has the right to ask whether the reality of Brexit matches up to what has been promised. You can read the full text of the letter here. It includes helfpul notes showing who made these six questionable promises, and when. Theresa Villiers, the former Northern Ireland secretary and leading Vote Leave campaigner, has said she expects to find some of Theresa May’s speech “uncomfortable”, the BBC reports. In the light of what Chris Grayling was saying this morning, and the briefing the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg was getting yesterday (see 9.20am), this looks a bit like an attempt to break it gently to the Brexiters that they may not like everything they hear. Mark Rutte, the Dutch prime minister, is speaking in Berlin today. As the BBC’s Adam Fleming reports, he started with a jibe at Theresa May. UPDATE: Good riposte from the Economist’s Tom Nuttall. My colleague Rafael Behr has written a column arguing that EU leaders will find it difficult trusting Theresa May in the Brexit talks because they know that she is constrained by the hard Brexiters in her party. Here’s an extract. The patterns of recent Tory history are familiar to May’s counterparts in the Brexit talks. They probably have a clearer-sighted understanding of them than she does. This matters because May’s pitch to the EU is that she can be trusted to uphold the values of the European project even while quitting its institutions. She offers “deep and special partnership” on matters of security and economic cooperation. She rejects the suggestion that Britain seeks to undercut its continental neighbours by dropping labour standards and environmental protections. She promises a post-Brexit partnership “based on high standards”. So May invites her EU counterparts to be generous and cooperative on the basis that she is an ally – aligned and equivalent in values if not exactly identical in regulations. But even if the rest of the EU accept that May is sincere, they know she is weak. They know there is a section of the Tory party that is implacably hostile to the European project. That faction saw a regulatory bonfire as Brexit’s primary purpose. Some fantasised about a great unravelling of the union as a happy side-effect. That hostility is not a secret and the EU cannot ignore it. They have followed British history enough to know which side tends to win tugs of war between Tory leaders and Eurosceptic backbenchers. They knew where power lies in that party. The reports this morning about how cabinet Brexiters forced May to drop a line in the speech about making “binding” commitments to align with EU rules in some areas after Brexit reinforce the argument that Rafael is making. “Binding” has reportedly been replaced with “strong”. (See 11.03am.) But EU leaders might reasonably conclude that, if a commitment is not “binding”, it is not actually a commitment in the first place. In this context, it is worth pointing out the Michael Gove, the environment secretary and leading cabinet Brexiter, argued in a Telegraph article last year (paywall) that, if a future government did not like the Brexit deal, it could always change it. He said: The British people will be in control. By the time of the next election, EU law and any new treaty with the EU will cease to have primacy or direct effect in UK law. If the British people dislike the arrangement that we have negotiated with the EU, the agreement will allow a future government to diverge. That was both a statement of the obvious (governments don’t bind their successors) and a hint that, if Brexiters don’t like the eventual deal, they will reserve the right to seek to change it at a later date. Open Britain, which is campaigning for a soft Brexit, has sent some unfortunate volunteer to the Theresa May speech venue in central London to make a point about the impossibility of being able to eat cake, but have it at the same time. (See 9.20am.) (Hope the poor chap doesn’t have to stand out there until 1.30.) ITV’s political editor Robert Peston says in a Facebook post that Theresa May’s speech might be coming too late. Here’s an extract. The twin big fear that she - and the rest of us - will have is whether her plan has come too late to significantly influence the rest of the EU and has been shaped too much by what holds her cabinet and party together, rather than what EU leaders would see as a sensible starting point for talks. In other words, the risk is that when EU leaders announce the negotiating guidelines for trade talks in just three weeks, these will reflect the Barnier/Tusk entente that - because of May’s red lines on the ECJ, migration, the right to negotiate third-party trade deals, and so on - the best the UK should get is a shallow and narrow free trade deal, modelled on Canada’s. For reference, here is the slide that Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, is fond of brandishing which shows why he thinks May’s red lines mean a Canada-style deal is the only one realistically available. UPDATE: Ukip have responded to Peston. Here is Frances O’Grady, the TUC general secretary, on the prime minister’s speech. O’Grady is referring to something that Theresa May said on 29 March last year, the day she triggered article 50. This is what she told Andrew Neil in an interview. What we’re both looking for is that comprehensive free trade agreement which gives that ability to trade freely into the European single market. And for them - and for them to trade with us. It will be a different relationship, but I think it can have the same benefits in terms of that free access to trade. This is from Sky’s Faisal Islam. Theresa May (or the minion who does it on her behalf) has been tweeting this morning about the weather. According to some reports, at the last minute Theresa May dropped a line in the speech promising to make “binding” commitments to mirror EU regulations after Brexit in certain areas. Brexiter ministers objected, and now the speech will just promise “strong” commitments instead. The Times (paywall) reports: Objections from pro-Brexit cabinet ministers mean that a promise to make “binding commitments” to mirror EU rules in some sectors has been dropped, The Times understands. Greg Clark, the business secretary, and Philip Hammond, the chancellor, had argued in a cabinet meeting that the phrase was needed to provide businesses with the certainty they required to remain in the UK. David Davis, the Brexit secretary, and Boris Johnson, the foreign secretary, argued that the phrase implied that the UK accepted the EU’s legal framework in those areas. Other Brexiteers such as Michael Gove argued that it would make it unnecessarily hard to negotiate. Mrs May will now promise “strong commitments” and frame her appeal to Brussels in terms of five tests that any deal must meet. And the Financial Times (paywall) reports: Boris Johnson, foreign secretary, and David Davis, Brexit secretary, argued against a line in Mrs May’s draft speech that spoke of a “binding commitment to align” in certain sectors. Greg Clark, business secretary, and Philip Hammond, chancellor, have argued that Britain should accept EU rules in sectors with long supply chains or with complex regulations — including a role for EU agencies and the European Court of Justice. They have also proposed that heavily regulated sectors such as pharmaceuticals, chemicals and aviation should also continue to operate under the EU regulators, arguing there is no sense in Britain adopting a parallel regime. But officials briefed on the cabinet talks say that Brexiters balked at the idea, which they feared suggested Britain would stay under EU rules forever in certain sectors. “They place a great importance on having the right to diverge,” said one. Downing Street said “constructive suggestions” were made for amendments to the draft speech and deny there was a row. A compromise text spoke of a “strong commitment” to align. My colleague Jennifer Rankin, the Guardian’s Brussels correspondent, has posted an interesting Twitter thread on EU Brexit tactics. It starts here. Nicola Sturgeon, the Scottish first minister, is not impressed by the overnight Downing Street briefing. She posted this comment about a tweet setting out the May “five tests”. (See 10.11am.) Downing Street released some extracts from Theresa May’s speech overnight. Mostly they focused on the “five tests” she will set out that she says will guide her when she is negotiating a future trade relationship with the EU. For the record, here is the key passage. First, the agreement we reach with the EU must respect the result of the referendum. It was a vote to take control of our borders, laws and money. And a vote for wider change, so that no community in Britain would ever be left behind again. But it was not a vote for a distant relationship with our neighbours. Second, the new agreement we reach with the EU must endure. After Brexit both the UK and the EU want to forge ahead with building a better future for our people, not find ourselves back at the negotiating table because things have broken down. Third, it must protect people’s jobs and security. People in the UK voted for our country to have a new and different relationship with Europe, but while the means may change our shared goals surely have not – to work together to grow our economies and keep our people safe. Fourth, it must be consistent with the kind of country we want to be as we leave: a modern, open, outward-looking, tolerant, European democracy. A nation of pioneers, innovators, explorers and creators. A country that celebrates our history and diversity, confident of our place in the world; that meets its obligations to our near neighbours and far off friends, and is proud to stand up for its values. And fifth, in doing all of these things, it must strengthen our union of nations and our union of people. We must bring our country back together, taking into account the views of everyone who cares about this issue, from both sides of the debate. As prime minister it is my duty to represent all of our United Kingdom, England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland; north and south, from coastal towns and rural villages to our great cities. The Conservative former deputy prime minister Michael Heseltine was also on the Today programme this morning. He encouraged pro-European Tories to rebel against Theresa May over Brexit. Here are the key points. Heseltine said some Tories would rather have Jeremy Corbyn in power than back May’s policy on Brexit. When asked whether pro-European Tory MPs should vote for the UK to stay in the customs union even if that risked bringing down May, he replied: I say to them: in the end you are in politics for what you believe to be right, and you have got to put your personal convictions [first]. When pressed on whether he would be happy for this to happen even if it led to Corbyn being in power, he went on: Look, I hate the idea of Jeremy Corbyn in power. I don’t have a vote [as a member of the House of Lords], which is a cop-out answer, I know that. But the real world is that there are an increasing number of people, particularly the young people, and by that I mean under 40, who today think that Corbyn is an alternative they can live with. And there are Conservatives who feel so strongly about the European issue that they would rather risk the short-term damage of a Corbyn government, and let’s not under-estimate that, than to see Britain make this calamitous mistake of leaving Europe. Heseltine said that he had defied the Tory whip three times in his career, over race relations, the poll tax and Europe. In each case the Conservative party eventually ended up adopting the stance he took, he said. He said there was no majority in parliament for the kind of Brexit May wanted. The fact is that the prime minister has no majority for the sort of deal that is being talked about and the only way to resolve this is to go back, I would hope to parliament, but if not to parliament then to a referendum. He said he backed Sir John Major’s call for MPs to get a free vote on the final Brexit deal. He said that public opinion was turning against Brexit. If you look at the polling situation, you can see now that the opposition to Brexit is now beginning to move ahead whereas earlier on there was support for it. He also said that Labour’s decision to commit to staying in a customs union for good showed that it was responding to changing public opinion. Heseltine is right about public opinion, although the polling uptick he refers to is slight, rather than significant. This chart, from What UK Thinks, show how the figures have changed when people have been asked in polls how they would vote on EU membership. The polling expert John Curtice addressed this very question in a blog for the What UK Thinks website about a month ago. He wrote: There appears to be consistent evidence across a number of poll series that what until the middle of last year was still a small majority in favour of leaving the EU has now become a small majority for remaining. That said, we have to sound the warning that, with the polls as close as they mostly are, nobody can be sure that there would be a different outcome if another referendum were held now. After all, most (though not all) of the polls conducted immediately before the EU referendum had Remain narrowly ahead, yet in the event it was Leave that prevailed. Heseltine denied suggestions that pro-Europeans like himself, Major and Tony Blair were coordinating their efforts against the government. One of the most persistent, and fair, criticisms of the government’s Brexit policy is that ministers have been unwilling to admit that leaving the EU won’t be a universally positive experience. Theresa May has so far given three major Brexit speech - the Tory conference one in 2016, which firmly ruled out a soft Brexit; Lancaster House, which confirmed that, and announced a transition and a vote in parliament; and Florence, which proposed a standstill transition and promised payments to the EU - but none of them had anything much to say about the potential downsides of the policy she is implementing. Broadly ministers have adopted the line taken by the leave campaign in the EU referendum, and suggested that the UK will be able to leave the regulatory burdens of the single market while retaining almost all of its benefits. Boris Johnson famously used to say his policy on cake was being to have it and eat it, but to many it appears his cavalier joke has been elevated to the status of government policy. He has also gifted something to the English language; amongst Brussels bureaucrats, “cake” has become slang for an unrealistic or impossible demand. Today it is just possible that might change. May will give her fourth major Brexit speech and, according to Chris Grayling, the Brexiter transport secretary, who was doing the media round this morning, she will tell the public that “we can’t have everything” when we leave the EU. He told the programme. I think the prime minister will recognise in the speech today that it is not about cherry picking, that we can’t have everything that we might like to have because we are leaving. This backs up the briefing given to the BBC’s Laura Kuennsberg, who in a blog about the speech says a minister told her it would feel like May “being honest with the public” and delivering “hard truths”. The speech is due to start at 1.30pm. I will be covering the build-up, reporting what May says at length, and then bringing you the best and most interesting reaction and analysis.

When it comes to politics, they have a good case. Where political parties nationally and most states often fall over themselves to stress they are not the favourites coming into an election, lest complacent supporters drift away, in Tasmania they tend to go the other way. “Tasmania is different,” University of Tasmania political scientist Richard Eccleston said at an election forum this week. “There is a kind of underdog theory in terms of Australian politics generally but here – with the paranoia about minority government – both of the major parties fall over themselves to try to make the claim that they can form majority.” This has been one of the stories of the state’s election campaign, which concludes as voters go to the polls on Saturday. The Liberal government, under premier Will Hodgman, has stressed it is the front-runner, and the party able to hold power in its own right. Though starting well behind, Rebecca White – the 35-year-old former political staffer who breathed life into Labor’s failing fortunes when she assumed the leadership a year ago – has tried to make the same case the ALP can win a majority of seats in the state’s 25-seat lower house. There is a science to this. Uniquely in Australia, Tasmania has a history of hung parliaments, with the Greens as a legitimate third force denying either major party a majority. Polls suggest most voters believe majority governments are best for the state. Recent history shows a large proportion are willing to swing between the major parties in the space of a couple of elections to deliver it. But the state’s electoral system, with the Hare-Clark model delivering five members each from five very different electorates, means even a landslide win in pure votes is likely to yield what looks a paper-thin majority, no bigger than a couple of seats. It means – though the Liberals go into polling day as the favourite – the result is more unpredictable than at an average election elsewhere in the country. Outwardly, the defining issue of the campaign has been Labor’s pledge in December that it would make Tasmania the first state in the country to remove poker machines from pubs and clubs. It has been an historic stance, breaking the ALP’s close ties with gambling giant the Federal Group, and has triggered an historic level of election spending. Voters will not be told how much the major parties have received in political donations until 2019, but the perception is there has been an unprecedented flood of money from gaming and business interests to the Liberals. It has dominated advertising across all media, prompting estimates the government has outspent its opponents by a factor of at least five-to-one – and claims that the election was been “bought” by vested interests. David Walsh, the founder of the Museum of Old and New Art, got to the heart of this concern on Thursday when he revealed he had given $250,000 to the anti-pokies campaign in a bid to “de-bias” the election. In the final days, Hodgman struggled to respond when repeatedly asked why voters should have to wait nearly a year to find out who funded his campaign. Analysts say this may have had some traction in the last week of the campaign, particularly in the Hobart-based seat of Denison. They say it has raised serious issues about transparency likely to echo long after the election. But they also stress it would be wrong to assume it will be decisive in how most people vote. An overwhelming majority would prefer pokies were removed, but a ReachTEL poll published by News Corp found it was of major issue for only 14%. The issues most likely to persuade voters are more time-honoured – principally, the state of the economy. This has been at the heart of the Liberal’s message: that the state has been strengthening since they came to power four years, with 10,000 jobs created. Hodgman came to office after 16 years of Labor rule that, as often happens with governments of that age, ended badly. Labor shared the government benches with Greens in its final term, but the deal between them collapsed in its final months. Hit by the financial crisis and the collapse of the forestry industry, the state was struggling. Tasmanians responded by elected the Liberals with more than 50% of the vote. Saul Eslake, the Tasmania-based economist, says Hodgman has a good story to tell, having delivered most of his 2014 election commitments and an economy that is clearly in better shape, though most of the jobs added have been part-time. This was Hodgman’s message at his final press conference on Friday. “I ask Tasmanians: why would you want to change… given how far we’ve come?” Some of the improvement has little to do with the government. The birth of Mona has changed the way the state presents itself to the world and led a tourism boom, helped by a favourable dollar, and the budget has been boosted by the carve up of the GST shifting in its favour. But the Liberals can justifiably claim business confidence is up – Tasmania is the only place in the country where business sentiment towards the government is positive. “In the ordinary course of events, you would expect this government to get a second term,” Eslake says. This view has been reinforced by the widely shared view that the Liberals ran a better organised and targeted campaign. Polling by Tasmanian market research company EMRS suggests it is on track to get 46% of the vote, ahead of Labor on 34% and the Greens on 12%. Pokies has been Labor’s major point of differentiation. White pinned much of her campaign on improving the state’s perennially underfunded health system, promising to spend $560m, but was trumped by the Liberals, who promised $757m over six years. The bulk of the government’s pledge was pushed beyond the 2022 election and therefore basically meaningless, but the size of the commitment nullified the issue as a point of difference. The environment – traditionally a central feature in Tasmanian elections – was largely absent. The pace of expansion about salmon farming has raised concern in some communities, but neither major party released a forestry policy. The lack of attention may be bad news for the Greens, led by former journalist Cassy O’Connor. Analysts says that, combined with Labor stealing their thunder with a similar pokies policy, it has been difficult for the third party to gain its usual traction. On the final day, a wild card was thrown into the campaign when The Australian reported the government had quietly told farmers and shooting groups that it would meet many of their demands to soften the state’s gun laws. Its impact late in the campaign is difficult to measure: 22 years on, the scars from the Port Arthur massacre still run deep in the Tasmanian community, particularly in the south. The Liberal party starts today with 15 seats, Labor seven and the Greens three. The government can afford to lose only two seats to retain a majority. It is expected to drop one MP in Braddon, a north-west electorate based around Devonport and Burnie, where it won an unlikely four-out-of-five in 2014. It should hold its three seats in Bass, centred on Launceston. It means it will need to hold on to three in either Lyons, a largely rural seat in the centre of the state, or Franklin, in Hobart’s southern suburbs and the regional south. Polls suggest Lyons is a better bet. Labor is pinning its hopes of denying the Liberals majority on winning a third seat in Denison, the state’s most left-wing electorate. It is unclear what will happen if it does. The Greens have promised to move a no-confidence motion in the Liberal party on the first day of the next parliament regardless of the result due to its refusal to reveal who has bankrolled its campaign. But Labor has said it will not support the motion, and will never again govern in partnership with the minor party. Assuming the Jacqui Lambie Network does not snag an unlikely seat, it means the most likely short-term scenario is the Liberals governing precariously in minority. How long that would last is anyone’s guess. Eslake, for one, believes the issue of whether the government is a majority or minority should not be decisive. He says the benefits of a majority are regularly overplayed, and argues two of the state’s three minority governments in recent decades – under Labor’s Michael Field and Liberal Tony Rundle – have been more successful than others with more seats. “I think a good minority government is much better than a bad majority government, and Tasmanian history supports that.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/mar/02/siemens-to-set-up-train-factory-in-east-yorkshire","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-02T11:37:26Z","webTitle":"Siemens to open train factory in east Yorkshire","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/mar/02/siemens-to-set-up-train-factory-in-east-yorkshire","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/mar/02/siemens-to-set-up-train-factory-in-east-yorkshire","fields":{"headline":"Siemens to open train factory in east Yorkshire","bodyText":"Siemens is planning to invest up to £200m and create hundreds of jobs in a new UK train factory in a show of a faith in the drive to improve Britain’s flagging transport infrastructure. The German engineering company said the new plant would be located in Goole, east Yorkshire, creating up to 700 skilled engineering and manufacturing jobs, and a further 1,700 jobs in the wider UK supply chain. The company said the plant would go ahead “subject to the company’s success in major future orders”, referring to contracts for HS2 and London Underground. Juergen Maier, chief executive of Siemens UK business, said the company believed the political will to improve Britain’s railways justified the spending pledge, as the government presses ahead with its “northern powerhouse” industrial strategy. “We’ve got the confidence now that there is a mood to invest in railways. There is a national mood among business and government at a local and national level that we need to better connect this country.” Maier, who recently led the industrial digitalisation review commissioned by the government, said the company had looked “up and down the country” for the right location, before settling on the 67-acre site in Goole. “Yorkshire has long been a proud railway beacon. This investment has the potential to have a tremendous impact on the Yorkshire economy and the north of England as a whole, ensuring that the benefits of infrastructure spending are spread widely and helping to ensure the ongoing development of the UK rail industry.” Siemens plans to start building on the site later this year. There is no specific timescale for opening the factory, which will depend on new contracts, but the firm said it should be up and running within the next couple of years. The Munich-based company has had UK operations for over 170 years and employs about 15,000 people. Siemens has more than 450 passenger trains in service in the UK, maintained at eight purpose-built facilities. Maier said that in the current climate of Brexit uncertainty, it was easier to justify an investment decision to build a factory in the UK that would supply the domestic market, rather than one reliant on export orders from the rest of Europe. “Of course, we are still going to be shipping parts so we want to maintain free and frictionless trade,” he added. Chris Grayling, the transport secretary, said Siemens’ decision to invest in a new plant underlined the benefits of the government’s plans to improve and modernise transport in the north of England. “From delivering brand new and refurbished trains through the great north rail project, our plans to upgrade the transpennine route to our investment in Yorkshire’s roads, we are driving forward job creation, economic growth and unlocking the potential of the northern powerhouse.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2018/mar/02/nra-chief-lobbyist-chris-cox-donald-trump-does-not-want-gun-control","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-02T08:14:08Z","webTitle":"NRA's chief lobbyist: Donald Trump does not want gun control","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/mar/02/nra-chief-lobbyist-chris-cox-donald-trump-does-not-want-gun-control","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/mar/02/nra-chief-lobbyist-chris-cox-donald-trump-does-not-want-gun-control","fields":{"headline":"NRA's chief lobbyist: Donald Trump does not want gun control","bodyText":"The US National Rifle Association’s chief lobbyist has claimed Donald Trump has reversed his position on gun control, just a day after the US president held a televised meeting with lawmakers in which he said he supported increased background checks for gun buyers. Chris Cox tweeted late on Thursday night that he had met Trump and the vice-president, Mike Pence, and they “don’t want gun control”. They also “support strong due process”, he added. Trump later tweeted a confirmation of an Oval Office meeting with the NRA, saying it was “great”, but not elaborating on whether he had changed position. The president’s remarks on Wednesday, warning lawmakers not to be afraid of the NRA and speaking in favour of a law expanding background checks for gun sales, as well as other gun-control measures, had shocked his allies and opponents alike. “Some of you people are petrified of the NRA. You can’t be petrified,” Trump had said. His comments suggested that, after a school shooting in Parkland, Florida, left 17 people dead and sparked a youth movement for gun control, he was interested in breaking with the gun-rights group on key issues. Trump and the NRA had already expressed conflicting public views on whether to raise the legal age to purchase certain weapons. The NRA, which endorsed Trump early and gave more than $30m to back his bid for the White House, has been one of the his staunchest supporters. Trump’s public remarks infuriated some NRA members. They appeared to suggest he was open to gun control policies that the group had long opposed. “Every word of it was a betrayal,” said one NRA member. Trump had also on Wednesday appeared to endorse aggressive measures to confiscate guns from dangerous people. Conservatives, including Pence, had suggested that it might be possible to petition a court to temporarily remove an unstable person’s firearms. “Take the guns first, go through due process second,” Trump said. Gun violence groups had hailed Trump’s comments, with Everytown for Gun Safety releasing a statement saying that “the president today called for sweeping gun violence reform that would meet the moment of public sentiment after the tragedy in Parkland”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/mar/02/tasmanian-premier-defends-selective-announcement-of-gun-law-plans","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-02T07:12:02Z","webTitle":"Tasmanian premier defends selective announcement of gun law plans","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/mar/02/tasmanian-premier-defends-selective-announcement-of-gun-law-plans","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/mar/02/tasmanian-premier-defends-selective-announcement-of-gun-law-plans","fields":{"headline":"Tasmanian premier defends selective announcement of gun law plans","bodyText":"The Tasmanian Liberal government, under fire for telling only farmers and shooters of its plan to change the state’s gun laws, has declined on the eve of the state election to reveal what other policies it has released directly to interest groups. Speaking on ABC Radio on Friday morning, the premier, Will Hodgman, defended the government’s decision to promise gun law changes in a letter to a firearms consultation group last month without making a public announcement or posting the policy on its website. “There are a number of policies that we announce … that have particular interest to certain sections of our community, and certain organisations, and typically we’ll communicate directly with them,” Hodgman said. At a later press conference, he said the government had 300 policies but had posted only 100 online. On Friday afternoon, the Liberal party election website listed 85 policies under headings including “investing in health, education and Tasmanians in need” and “protecting the Tasmanian way of life”. Its firearms policy had been added on Friday morning, categorised as “delivering a stronger economy and more jobs”. A Liberal spokesman did not respond to a request for details about the policies not on its site. The proposed gun law changes – including increasing the limit on the gun licence duration from five to 10 years and pushing for expanded access to Category C firearms to allow more sporting shooters to use rapid-fire shotguns – became public after the letter was leaked to the media. Hodgman told the ABC the government would always work “with any group that had an interest or an issue, and make sure we get the balance right and the policy right”. Richard Eccleston, a political scientist at the University of Tasmania, said it was particularly important that parties were upfront about policies on issues that registered strongly in the electorate, such as guns. Many Tasmanians remain affected by the murder of 35 people in the 1996 Port Arthur massacre. “To cherry-pick certain constituencies and commit to meeting their policy demands without making those policies generally available is not good practice and potentially misleading,” Eccleston said. The Liberal website lists significantly more policies than Labor, the Greens or the Jacqui Lambie Network, though some are relatively small funding announcements. The opposition and minor parties’ policy statements tend to cover broader subject areas. A Labor spokesman said all its policy positions were on its website. “Unlike the Liberals, we are proud of our policies and want people to know about them,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/mar/02/chris-uhlmann-accused-of-egregious-breach-by-revealing-michaelia-cash-phone-text","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-02T06:37:04Z","webTitle":"Chris Uhlmann accused of ‘egregious breach' by revealing Michaelia Cash phone text","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/mar/02/chris-uhlmann-accused-of-egregious-breach-by-revealing-michaelia-cash-phone-text","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/mar/02/chris-uhlmann-accused-of-egregious-breach-by-revealing-michaelia-cash-phone-text","fields":{"headline":"Chris Uhlmann accused of ‘egregious breach' by revealing Michaelia Cash phone text","bodyText":"Channel Nine’s political editor Chris Uhlmann has been accused of an “egregious breach” of press gallery rules by revealing on television and on Twitter the contents of a text conversation on Michaelia Cash’s mobile phone. A Nine camera operator got a close-up shot of the jobs minister texting on her mobile phone to staffers about how to avoid media scrutiny as she entered an estimates committee. Uhlmann included the shot with the conversation clearly visible in his report for Nine News and posted the image on Twitter, but it has since been deleted. The image came after the Liberal Senator had become embroiled in a political storm over comments she made about the women in Bill Shorten’s office. She was accused of trying to hide from the cameras when her arrival at the committee hearing was obscured by a whiteboard positioned by parliamentary security guards. A day earlier she had threatened to name young women in Shorten’s office “about which rumours in this place abound” in retaliation for ongoing questions about her staff and the Australian Workers’ Union raids. Uhlmann, a former ABC journalist, has been asked by the Senate’s usher of the black rod, Brien Hallett, to explain why he should not face a penalty for the breach. The penalties range from a single day ban on entering the chamber galleries right up to the cancellation of his press gallery pass. Hallett’s job is to maintain order in the Senate chamber and its galleries, and to provide support to committees and senators. “I wish to advise the committee that I have received a formal complaint from a senator about an image that appeared on Twitter with the Channel 9 watermark that purports to show minister Cash’s mobile phone and in which messages between the minister and her staff during yesterday’s estimates hearing are clearly legible,” Hallett wrote to the committee. The letter does not say which senator complained about the image. “As this appears to be a particularly egregious breach of the rules, I have written to Mr Uhlmann asking him to show cause as to what one or more of the penalties listed should not be applied.” Uhlmann, who has until Monday to reply to Hallett’s letter, declined to comment."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2018/mar/02/minimalism-music-revolution-charles-hazelwood","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-02T14:05:38Z","webTitle":"Adventures in motion and pitches: how minimalism shook up classical music","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/mar/02/minimalism-music-revolution-charles-hazelwood","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/mar/02/minimalism-music-revolution-charles-hazelwood","fields":{"headline":"Adventures in motion and pitches: how minimalism shook up classical music","bodyText":"When I was an organ scholar at Oxford University in the late 80s the very idea that Kraftwerk and Japan were as important to me as Mozart and Poulenc incited scorn from my tutors. I was warned that I would never be taken seriously as a musician if I didn’t give up my passion for rock’n’roll. But no matter how stern the warning to stifle my dark side, I continued to love music of all genres. I still do. So imagine my excitement when I discovered that classical music had birthed its own dark side, known as minimalism. Here was a whole new genre that unashamedly combined the rigours of classical music with the rebel spirit of rock’n’roll. Not only did it flout convention, it was seriously adventurous. Here was the musical equivalent of space exploration. Minimalists weren’t just defying convention, they sought to reimagine what music is. So how did they do this? All western music up to this point (classical and popular) was narrative, goal-oriented music. It’s like a story; it has an opening gambit (boy meets girl), a development (they fall in love), a climax (they lose each other), and a resolution (they marry or die). Minimalist music steadfastly does not do this. Its signature is repetition. Think of Tubular Bells – an iconic example of minimalist influenced music. It takes simple grains of music or sound and repeats and repeats. Think Damien Hirst’s Spot paintings and how far they are from Van Gogh’s Sunflowers: that’s the leap minimalists made in one generation. Minimalism was not only a sound revolution but a cultural one. Classical music of the 60s was squarely in the hands of European composers, Stockhausen, Boulez at al: the heavily discordant sounds of Europe’s cultural recovery from two world wars. There were no consonant harmonies and the music was hard to listen to. “Music by creeps, maniacs,” as Philip Glass famously put it. But the young American revolutionaries – Glass, Terry Riley, Steve Reich and La Monte Young – made contemporary music that was hopeful and harmonious; music that chimed with the pulse-driven, youthful zeitgeist of rock. As one critic explained about minimalism, it’s like you have to drop your usual way of listening, lose your expectations and surrender to an eternal now – it’s not dissimilar to mindfulness or meditation. Riley and Young studied under a spiritual master of chant music, Pandit Pran Nath, in India and brought back with them not just a way of listening, but a new way of being that was part of the 60s cultural revolution. Minimalism musicians looked to the east as no one had done before, and also embraced the new noise of the 20th century. We forget now how quiet things must have been before the combustion engine and the development of a mechanised world. At the start of the 20th century the sound canvas of daily life was mostly organic: wind, birds rain. By the middle of the century mechanised sound took over – cars, trains and machines dominated daily life. Classical music up to this point had shut its doors firmly on the sound-world of the streets in order to conserve the pure sound of acoustic instruments. Minimalists did the opposite, flinging open the concert doors and letting in a panoply of new sounds – some organic, some mechanised – and remixed them for and alongside acoustic instruments to create a new sound order. So radical was this shift that it was some years before minimalist music was regularly heard in the hallowed temples of the musical establishment. The first performance of Reich’s Four Organs in Carnegie Hall so disturbed its audience one woman stormed to the front and banged the stage while someone else shouted: “I confess!” Minimalism remains a central plank of my repertoire as a conductor. My particular joy is reinventing orchestral music in ways that allow a 21st-century audience to experience the visceral excitement of a live orchestra. It was a personal moment of triumph when my integrated orchestra of disabled and able bodied musicians – Army of Generals/The British Paraorchestra – headlined the Park Stage at Glastonbury in memory of David Bowie. Only a minimalist piece (Glass’s Heroes Symphony) could have done that. One of my goals as a conductor is exposing how an orchestra works, which is very hard to do with traditional repertoire. Again, minimalism comes to my aid: I’ve chosen Reich’s The Four Sections for my project Anatomy of the Orchestra, premiering in Bristol next month, because the absolute regularity of pulse means I can spread the musicians out across a huge space without the piece breaking down or losing coherence. It would be wonderful if someone was so incensed by what we were doing they started shouting, but somehow I think that’s unlikely. Tones, Drones And Arpeggios: The Magic of Minimalism presented by Charles Hazlewood begins tonight (2 March) on BBC Four at 9pm and will be on iPlayer for 30 days. The Anatomy of the Orchestra is at Colston Hall, Bristol, on 21 April, part of Bristol New Music festival."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"us-news/2018/mar/05/will-pennsylvania-provide-the-next-election-flop-for-trumps-republicans","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-05T11:00:13Z","webTitle":"Will Pennsylvania provide the next election flop for Trump’s Republicans?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/mar/05/will-pennsylvania-provide-the-next-election-flop-for-trumps-republicans","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/mar/05/will-pennsylvania-provide-the-next-election-flop-for-trumps-republicans","fields":{"headline":"Will Pennsylvania provide the next election flop for Trump’s Republicans?","bodyText":"His corner of Pennsylvania coal country was “an ocean of Trump signs in 2016”, Democratic activist Ben Bright said. Today, all across the staunchly Republican area, there are Democratic yard signs backing Conor Lamb, a young ex-marine who is fighting for a seat in Congress. The special election in Pennsylvania’s 18th district has become an important test of Donald Trump’s political potency. He won overwhelmingly here in 2016, in a district that includes Republican-leaning Pittsburgh suburbs and vast swaths of coal country that were ancestrally Democratic. When he ran, Republican congressman Tim Murphy faced only token opposition. However, in October 2017 Murphy was forced to step down after it was revealed that he urged a woman with whom he was conducting an extramarital affair to have an abortion. His resignation set up a special election in which Democrats are running a candidate who is considered formidable while Republicans have chosen one considered weak. Lamb is 33, an ex-marine and federal prosecutor with the good looks and earnest demeanor of a student council president. His opponent, Rick Saccone, is a 60-year-old state legislator with an arch-conservative record and the type of broad, close-trimmed mustache that went out of style some time shortly after the end of the second world war. Saccone has billed himself as “Trump before Trump”. However, in a blue-collar and heavily pro-union district that is as concerned about workers’ rights as the second amendment, his conservative voting record on labor issues has led to unions unanimously endorsing the Democrat. Before the sex scandal, Murphy was consistently endorsed by unions. In interviews with the Guardian, both candidates were cautious on how they would deal with gun control demands following the Florida high school shooting. They equivocated on whether they would support increasing the minimum age to buy an AR-15 semi-automatic rifle. Lamb wanted to focus on “fixing the background check system” while Saccone hedged, saying he was “willing to listen to both sides and engage in that debate”. In a televised debate with Lamb on Saturday, the Republican came out against an increase in the age limit. As a legislator, Saccone was the sponsor of a bill to allow gun owners to freely carry a concealed firearm without a permit. The two men are in an election race brought about by a sex scandal, but both declined to weigh in on the many allegations of sexual misconduct and assault against Donald Trump. “As far as I know, the president denies that and I haven’t heard anything from the voters in the 18th district about that,” said Saccone. “I’m focused on taxes and spending issues that people in the district have told you about.” Lamb said: “I’m not running against the president. In this entire campaign, you guys love to ask about him but that’s not what my voters want.” Anti-Trump sentiment, however, is clearly a factor behind the enthusiasm for Lamb. Speaking to the Guardian at a Lamb fundraiser, former Maryland governor Martin O’Malley compared the grassroots energy in the Democratic party to “green shoots after a forest fire”. One of those shoots was the Washington County Democrats, a grassroots group set up a year ago, different from the formal county Democratic party in an area pockmarked with blue-collar industrial towns. Two leaders, Ben Bright of Slovan and Christina Proctor of Canonsburg, said the new group had started to run monthly meetings and was actively volunteering for Lamb. Many members had not been involved before Trump’s election and talked about the spark of enthusiasm that they saw. Bright noted that Lamb had “yard signs in yards” all over the district while Saccone’s campaign only seemed to put signs in the right of way on the side of the road. Yet for all the proliferation of signs, the race will come down to voters. Outside a Whole Foods in Upper St Clair, a prosperous, traditionally Republican suburb of Pittsburgh, shoppers overwhelmingly preferred the Democrat. Linda Ortenzo told the Guardian “we need someone young and fresh” in Washington and talked about the need to “clean house”. There were exceptions, like Victor Raj of South Fayette, who thought Trump “was doing a good job” and was backing Saccone. The question is whether the district’s instinctive conservatism will overcome the surge in Democratic intensity. Both Democratic and Republican observers consider the race a toss-up. Outside Republican groups have invested millions of dollars, trying to counterbalance Saccone’s lackluster fundraising and what one Republican operative conceded was an “underwhelming” campaign. But while Lamb has been a strong fundraiser, raising more than $3m with 70,000 individual contributions in the last fundraising period, outside groups on the left have been far stingier. Whatever happens in the 13 March vote, the 18th district will not exist in November when every House seat is up for grabs in the midterms. The Pennsylvania supreme court ruled in February that the state’s congressional districts were unconstitutional, producing a new map that erased the 18th. If Lamb wins he will face a different Republican in a redrawn suburban swing district in November. For Democrats, even a narrow loss would be a moral victory, leaving Lamb with a developed brand, poised to win a new race in November. For Republicans, a Democratic victory in the Trump heartland would be a major blow ahead of the midterms, after losing a Senate race in deep red Alabama in December. For all of Saccone’s flaws, he is not Roy Moore, the Republican whose Alabama campaign was marred by sexual assault claims. In order to win, Democrats have to build a fragile coalition of their own energized base, suburban Republicans disaffected with Trump and blue-collar voters disaffected with everything. Chuck Nimal, a union truck driver from Canonsburg, Pennsylvania, showed up to support Lamb at a labor rally last week in front of the Washington county courthouse. About two dozen other union members rallied to express support for public sector unions as the supreme court heard a case that could potentially cripple them. They were addressed by Lamb and several union activists on a handheld megaphone that projected the speeches over quiet rumbles of trucks and loud roars of motorcycles driving by. Afterwards, Nimal, a lifelong Democrat, thought his neighbors in an area that overwhelmingly voted against both Ronald Reagan and Barack Obama, might support Lamb. They just have to be “tired enough of being tired”, he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/mar/03/from-the-barrier-reef-to-batman-labors-roads-all-lead-to-adani","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-02T20:59:29Z","webTitle":"From the Barrier Reef to Batman, Labor's roads all lead to Adani | Katharine Murphy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/mar/03/from-the-barrier-reef-to-batman-labors-roads-all-lead-to-adani","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/mar/03/from-the-barrier-reef-to-batman-labors-roads-all-lead-to-adani","fields":{"headline":"From the Barrier Reef to Batman, Labor's roads all lead to Adani","bodyText":"It is hard to look past the spectacle of Michaelia Cash and her tantrum at taxpayer expense, followed by the undignified crouching behind a whiteboard, or Peter Dutton “not moralising” while moralising about Bill Shorten. But we do have to train our eyes this weekend on something more consequential. While the Turnbull government was thrashing about with its inept and downright nasty efforts to wound the Labor leader – reactivating its morale-boosting “Kill Bill” strategy, because apparently that’s what politics is now about, constant carping and corrosion – someone outside politics fronted up calmly to a television network and showed the mewling Canberra toddlers what a precision demolition looks like. But before we reach the point in our story where Geoff Cousins, the businessman and environmentalist, is sitting on the 7.30 Report on Tuesday night like a coiled spring, waiting to run down Shorten on live television – we need first to roll back to last December. Just before Christmas, Shorten rang the former president of the Australian Conservation Foundation and asked if they could travel to Queensland together to ponder options on Adani. Shorten lined up the sensitive sortie without telling colleagues, and flew north in late January with a handful of staff. A number of people who you would think would be in the know in the opposition and around the Labor fraternity found out about the field trip only after it had happened. Now we can roll forward to Tuesday night when Cousins provided a live action recount of their joint expedition on national television – a bit like David Attenborough narrating a nature documentary. Shorten wanted to examine what was going on with the Great Barrier Reef and elsewhere, and think about what options Labor might have to take a stronger stand against a project that has mobilised the most substantial civil society campaign in this country since the Franklin. Cousins says Shorten signalled at the conclusion of the trip that he would go as far as telegraphing his preparedness to revoke Adani’s licence based on concern about the impact of the project on the reef, on groundwater and endangered species. The businessman, who is as tough as they come, says Shorten also gave him a precise timetable for a public announcement to this effect, before beginning to equivocate, noting internal opposition, then vanishing entirely last weekend. The full recount was delivered by Cousins over the two interviews, blow by blow, right down to the footnotes. To describe his public calling out of Shorten as a flip-flopper on Adani as bold doesn’t really do it justice. Nuclear is more like it. It’s interesting to note that Cousins, just like Shorten, was on his own version of a solo flight this week. While the environment movement is engaged in intricate coordination on matters Adani in order to run a disciplined national campaign – most of the movement found out what Cousins was doing only when they saw the former ACF president on the ABC on Tuesday night, and then read his extensive interview in Guardian Australia the next day. Mouths fell open. Phones lit up. To say people are shocked is an understatement. Some believe it was important to call out Shorten’s equivocation, and entirely justified in the circumstances given the Labor leader’s prevarication and tendency to walk all sides of the street. But others argue the public intervention has tipped Shorten out of the probable stop Adani column into the “maybe, I’ll get back to you after I’ve calmed down in about a decade” column – which in practical terms is a set back for the Stop Adani movement, which needs a party of government to take a stand. As the kids say – life comes at you fast. Also coming fast is a byelection in the Melbourne seat of Batman. Cousins’ foray is like a small bomb exploding in that metropolitan contest where Labor is currently facing off against the Greens. From the moment Cousins opened his mouth, Labor braced itself for the negative impact on the ground in Batman. How bad might this get? While environment groups are already deployed in the contest, with anti-Adani messaging as their focal point, GetUp – the group with the ground game grunt to make a serious impact in political contests – has made a decision to sit it out. GetUp’s national director Paul Oosting says his group fully supports the anti-Adani activist groups in Batman campaigning in the contest, and he says all political parties should oppose the project, but his organisation won’t “be throwing our weight into campaigning in Batman”. Again, it’s worthwhile pointing out something interesting. On Cousins’ account of his conversations with Shorten, he asked the Labor leader to give him his definitive position on Adani this past weekend – was Labor committed to revoking the licence or not? The definitive position Cousins sought from Shorten never arrived, and Shorten has thrown his position into reverse this week – but the Labor leader was, however, definitive on another red hot issue in progressive circles. On Sunday, the Labor leader gave his strongest public undertaking that the opposition would not support controversial changes the Turnbull government is currently proposing to third party campaigners, including GetUp, charities, and not-for-profits. Oosting says GetUp won’t deploy on the ground in Batman because it wants to stay focussed on blocking the foreign donations bill. That bill, he says, “represents a seismic attack on civil society, charities and GetUp [and] is our organisation’s number one priority. Right now we’re pouring our resources into the biggest campaign in our history to stop that bill.” So Labor has caught a break with GetUp electing to sit Batman out. It has also caught a break with the Greens battling internal issues in a seat it should be in the box seat to win. This week it emerged that the Batman candidate, Alex Bhathal was the subject of a 101-page internal complaint by 18 party volunteers. Third party groups active in the contest report the Greens ground operation is not functioning as it should, with little signs of deployment beyond their Northcote stronghold, and little evidence of messaging to swinging progressive voters beyond Labor is bad on Adani and bad on refugees. The message from activists is Labor’s ground operation is deployed right across the footprint of the electorate, from end to end and top to bottom. While the Greens have been regarded as the favourites, some insiders report their Batman campaign is struggling because talented people aren’t working on the contest because of the lingering controversy behind the scenes. How will this story end?

To our knowledge, every case of cervical cancer is initiated by infection with one of about a dozen closely related types of this virus. The same virus types also include one that seems to be responsible for some other genital cancers, and some throat cancer. The good news is that we have effective vaccines to prevent infection with these viruses: there are now three vaccines that have been shown effective – they all prevent the two strains of papillomavirus most commonly responsible for cancer, and one provides protection against another five types that more rarely cause cancer, as well as protection against genital warts. Australia has been fortunate to have had a government sponsored school based cervical cancer vaccine program since 2007, and studies in Australia have shown that this program has virtually eliminated new infections with the viruses responsible for cervical cancer for girls and boys who were immunised as young teenagers. Australia also has a world class screening program for cervical cancer prevention, which will become even more effective this year, with a switch to looking for the causative viruses in the samples collected. This will be complemented by screening for abnormal precancerous cells, as used in the previous screening program, if the relevant viruses are found. The screening program has been shown 100% effective at preventing cervical cancer for women who take full part in the program. There is thus a real prospect that, by combining the cervical cancer immunisation program, now with the new nine valent vaccine, and the improved screening program, the 200 cases of cervical cancer that occur in Australia each year will drop over the next few years to negligible numbers, and that sometime in my lifetime we will see the last cases of cervical cancer in women who have lived their teenage and adult life in Australia. The recent announcement by the International Papillomavirus Society that they can envisage a date when cervical cancer will be eradicated globally reflects the opportunity we now have to eliminate, through immunisation, a cancer that kills 250,000 women worldwide each year. The international research community has done its bit, by discovering the virus causing cervical cancer, by coming up with the technologies that have enable the pharmaceutical industry to develop effective vaccines, and by showing, in conjunction with the pharmaceutical companies, that these vaccines, when made available, can be delivered effectively across the globe. I would now hope to see a commitment from national governments and inter-governmental agencies to implementation of universal cervical cancer immunisation programs over the next few years, so that elimination of cervical cancer becomes a reality on a global basis. The challenges are many and should not be underestimated: the vaccines are most effectively delivered to young women by giving two immunisations in their last years in primary school, and this will require the development of complete new vaccine delivery programs. The cost of these programs then needs to be added to the cost of the vaccines themselves, and, before the vaccines can be deployed, education programs for the girls, their parents, and the immunisation teams must be put in place. However, It can be done. Bhutan, a small developing world country, with very limited resources, has implemented an effective HPV vaccine program over several years, with near universal coverage. Key to the success of the program, delivered entirely by the Bhutanese themselves, has been government willingness, royal sponsorship, and some financial assistance from the pharmaceutical industry and from international aid. Translating this sort of effort into practice on an international basis is a work in progress. Nearly 50% of girls and boys in the US are now receiving the cervical cancer vaccines, and universal immunisation programs are in place in many European countries, and in Canada. The immunisation programs to eradicate polio virus and measles virus which, like the cervical cancer causing papillomaviruses, only infect humans, have been struggling to achieve universal immunisation and successful disease eradication for some years, and there are risks of donor and program fatigue. While intergovernmental agencies have a role to play, the focus for international public health interventions is now shifting to making individual governments responsible for their programs, and answerable to their people for their choices as to where to spend the public dollar. As with most public health measures, implementation will require education, dedication, and patience. But, the reward will be a healthier, and therefore happier and more prosperous society. And that’s something worth striving for. • Ian Frazer is a Professor of Medicine at the University of Queensland.

Shorten was asked on Friday to clarify Labor’s position after the businessman and environmentalist Geoff Cousins this week gave a detailed account of private discussions he had with the Labor leader over December and January. Cousins said that after a tour of the Great Barrier Reef and the Adani mine site in January, Shorten signalled his support for Labor revoking Adani’s licence based on concern about the impact of the project on the reef, on groundwater and endangered species. He then indicated he would make an announcement to that effect imminently. The Labor leader faced questions while campaigning in Devonport on Friday ahead of the Tasmanian election on Saturday, including whether he was prepared to announce Labor would revoke the project’s licence if it won government. Shorten denied on Friday that he wanted to ban the project, and had to be talked out of that position by colleagues. But the Labor leader did signal publicly after his trip with Cousins, without locking in to a specific option, that he was intending to adopt a harder line against the controversial Queensland coal project. Shorten also made it clear internally following his discussions with the former president of the Australian Conservation Foundation that he wanted to toughen Labor’s position on Adani, and explore options within the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act for stopping or limiting the project. Labor’s pivot on Adani went for discussion to shadow cabinet in early February. Guardian Australia has been reporting since January that there are a range of internal views about how hard to go – and some players, including the CFMEU and the frontbencher Anthony Albanese, have argued publicly against stopping a project which has already been through environmental approvals. Some Labor figures have been worried about triggering a backlash about sovereign risk, others about the political impact in Queensland. Some who are opposed to the project are concerned there is not a clear legal pathway to that policy. Legal advice supplied by Cousins and the ACF is considered by some Labor figures to be overly optimistic. Cousins’s comments have been deeply embarrassing for Shorten and uncomfortable for the ALP given the party is currently facing off against the Greens in the Batman byelection in Melbourne. Shorten on Friday said he’d made no secret of the fact he wasn’t a fan of the Adani project. “But what I’ve also said – and I’ve also said it to the Australian Conservation Foundation and right through Queensland – is I respect the principle of Australian politics that if one government enters into contracts then a future government can’t simply rip them up. To do so would be sovereign risk.” Shorten said he did not believe the project would materialise, citing Adani missing deadlines and his assessment that the project didn’t stack up “financially, commercially, or environmentally”. Shorten denied that he wanted to ban the project and had to be talked out of that position by colleagues. “You can’t simply ban it and create a sovereign risk ... No party, even the Greens political party, can simply say they can ban something – you have to adhere to the law.” Asked if he had said – at any stage – that he wanted to revoke the licence of the Adani mine, Shorten said: “No prime minister can simply ignore the law, no prime minister worth their salt should simply engage in massive sovereign risk.” Shorten said Adani had become “ground zero for a whole lot of other arguments” and accused others of “dumbing down the debate about climate change and the future of mining to one mine project”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2018/mar/05/roger-moore-jerry-lewis-and-sridevi-remembered-at-oscars-2018-ceremony","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-05T04:11:31Z","webTitle":"Roger Moore, Jerry Lewis and Sridevi remembered at Oscars 2018 ceremony","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/mar/05/roger-moore-jerry-lewis-and-sridevi-remembered-at-oscars-2018-ceremony","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/mar/05/roger-moore-jerry-lewis-and-sridevi-remembered-at-oscars-2018-ceremony","fields":{"headline":"Roger Moore, Jerry Lewis and Sridevi remembered at Oscars 2018 ceremony","bodyText":"Each year the Oscars’ In Memoriam section acts as a tribute to the film world’s great and good who have sadly passed away.

The Polish League Against Defamation (RDI) filed the motion in response to an article in Argentinian newspaper Página/12 published in December 2017 – before the new law existed – that accompanied a discussion about the massacre of Jews in the Polish village of Jedwabne in 1941 with a picture of anti-communist Polish partisans. The RDI argued that confusing the image of the partisans with the issue of Jedwabne amounted to a defamation of Poland. The law, which went into force on 1 March, has provoked a storm of international criticism amid concerns that its provisions could restrict open discussion of Poland’s wartime history. Página/12 said in a statement published over the weekend that it had not received official notification of the legal action, which it had learned about through the international media. In response, it published testimonies from Argentinians of Jewish origin describing allegations of brutal mistreatment at the hands of their Polish neighbours. It has changed the photo of the partisans to that of a monument in Jedwabne vandalised with a drawing of a swastika. “I want Poland to report me too, sue me, accuse me, and crucify me,” wrote Diana Wang, who left Poland for Argentina in 1948 and serves as president of Generations of the Shoah in Argentina, an organisation representing Holocaust survivors and their descendants, in a testimony quoted on Página/12’s website. Other Argentinian outlets have published the original article about Jedwabne en masse in solidarity with Página/12. Argentina’s government also came out in support of Página/12. “No law can limit, condemn or prevent freedom of expression or limit reasearch,” tweeted the human rights secretary, Claudio Avruj. Observers in Poland have noted that the RDI’s legal action is directed not at the claims contained in the text of the article about Jedwabne, but at its association with an image of anti-communist resistance fighters. A wide range of fighters resisted Soviet domination of Poland during and after the second world war, some of whom were members of radical far-right organisations and faced accusations of participating in ethnic cleansing. Critics accuse the government of adopting an uncritical attitude towards the partisans as part of an attempt to build bridges with the far right. There has been confusion as to how the new law will be enforced, especially against foreign outlets, but Poland’s deputy justice minister, Michał Wójcik, expressed his hope to the private radio station Zet that the Página/12 case would go to court. “If the court decides the complaint is admissible – and it should do so – then there will be a court case.” The law remains a source of controversy in Poland, with Jewish groups warning of a rise in expressions of antisemitic sentiment and ruling party politicians lashing out at an internationally coordinated campaign to defame the Polish nation. In February the leader of the Polish senate, the Law and Justice senator Stanisław Karczewski, wrote an open letter calling on Poles abroad to notify diplomats of instances of anti-Polish slander."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/mar/06/antigua-barbuda-election-communal-land-ownership","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-06T07:30:04Z","webTitle":"Snap election in Antigua puts Barbuda's communal land ownership on the ballot","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/06/antigua-barbuda-election-communal-land-ownership","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/mar/06/antigua-barbuda-election-communal-land-ownership","fields":{"headline":"Snap election in Antigua puts Barbuda's communal land ownership on the ballot","bodyText":"The announcement of snap elections in Antigua and Barbuda has exacerbated controversy over moves to abolish a centuries-old system of communal land ownership on Barbuda, which was devastated by Hurricane Irma. Voters in the twin-island nation will head to the polls on 21 March, a year before general elections are constitutionally due. The prime minister, Gaston Browne, says the government wants to provide stability for investors – and protect half a billion dollars’ worth of developments currently under construction in the tourism-dependent nation. But critics say the government is trying to solidify plans for a “land grab”, amid fears that wealthy investors stand to benefit from Barbudans’ displacement. One of the most prominent projects is a $250m mega resort called Paradise Found, being built by movie star Robert De Niro and Australian billionaire James Packer. Browne announced the election date on 24 February – five days after the government lost a high court attempt to reject a case brought by two Barbudans protesting against legislation brought in to facilitate the 391-acre scheme in 2015. Applicants Mackenzie Frank and Trevor Walker will now get the chance to legally challenge the legislation which they say sets a precedent for major developments to get the green light without the consensus of the people. They claim the act is unconstitutional because all land on Barbuda is owned in common under a 19th-century practice, which was codified into law in 2007. Since emancipation from slavery in 1834, Barbudans have governed their land communally, without private ownership. Barbuda’s quirky system has long included public town hall-style meetings to gauge consensus. But fury erupted when a separate law revoking communal land ownership – which islanders describe as their birthright – outright was introduced shortly after Hurricane Irma obliterated homes and infrastructure in September. The bill was announced when a mandatory evacuation order – issued as a second hurricane barrelled towards the island – was in place, and most of Barbuda’s 1,800 shell-shocked residents were still living in shelters on Antigua. The new law was signed by the governor-general – the representative of the head of state, Queen Elizabeth II – on 22 January after passing both chambers of parliament. Campaigners say that allowing the sale of land will destroy their unique way of life and have vowed to fight all the way to the privy council in London – the country’s final court of appeal. Browne argues that Barbuda belongs to the nation as a whole and not Barbudans alone. He did not respond to requests for further comment but has previously said revenue from the sale of land is urgently needed to help rebuild the battered island. The government says freehold titles will not be available to foreign investors who will continue to apply for leases, but the contention highlights deep-seated mistrust between many Barbudans and the national government. Elections had been hinted at since late last year but the 24 February declaration of a poll in less than four weeks has sparked concern. “The government is rushing to concretise its development plans,” said Walker, who is running for a seat as leader of the Barbuda People’s Movement. “The prime minister knows if he gets re-elected he can do what he wants without elections hanging over his head in a year’s time. “It’s unprecedented to have elections a year early unless something major has happened,” said Walker. “People are concerned and curious as to the motives.” John Mussington, a secondary school principal, and campaigner against the reforms, said he believes the government is responding to pressure from investors. “Calling the election early implies an amount of desperation,” he adds, “the government needs the money; rebuilding work has slowed to a crawl.” The British QC Leslie Thomas, who represented Mussington and other protesters in an unsuccessful application for an injunction to slow the land reforms, described the high court ruling as “fantastic news”. Campaigners are now set to restart their legal effort to have the new law quashed."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/mar/02/england-elliot-daly-comeback-france-six-nations","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-02T22:00:00Z","webTitle":"Elliot Daly declares himself fit to make England comeback against France","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/mar/02/england-elliot-daly-comeback-france-six-nations","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/mar/02/england-elliot-daly-comeback-france-six-nations","fields":{"headline":"Elliot Daly declares himself fit to make England comeback against France","bodyText":"Elliot Daly is ready and willing to help revive England’s Six Nations campaign in Paris next week.

Russia didn’t intervene then, but in late 2015, soon after which it pushed Isis out of Palmyra, its first significant defeat. So “targeted air strikes” in August 2013 would have done the trick? Against whom: the Syrian government, which however authoritarian represented the vast majority of Syrian Shias, Christians, Alawites and Druze? Only major on-the-ground armed intervention could have brought a grudging end to the civil war. Would our public have tolerated so risky and unclear a venture?

The rock-solid action taken by members of the University and College Union, and the incredible support they have received from their students, has lit up our campuses. To see this as just a normal strike is wrong. Pensions are deferred pay. In the case of universities, many staff could earn much more in the private sector but instead choose to work for the public good. Decent pensions have helped to offset the relatively low pay and have been a powerful recruitment and retention tool for institutions seeking to attract staff from around the globe. Yet the proposals that Universities UK (UUK) have sought to impose would mean cuts of up to £10,000 a year for a typical member of the Universities Superannuation Scheme (USS). That is bad enough, but what has exacerbated the situation is a sense that until last week many employers had not been interested in engaging with the strong feelings of staff about these cuts – that their views were not worth listening to. Politicians, students and parents are rightly worried and have made it clear in recent days that they think UUK needs to start listening. The pressure they have helped apply on UUK has got us to talks at Acas on Monday. We start talks as staff walk out for a further four days of strikes with a full week planned after that. UCU wants to resolve the dispute and that is why we have tabled a 10-point plan which would retain a decent, guaranteed pension for staff, deal with the long-term issues facing the fund and be affordable for universities. We are prepared to stay at Acas day and night to resolve the dispute this week. That is the least that we owe to our students. Time to resolve this dispute is running out. While we will do everything in our power to achieve a settlement this week, if there is no solution acceptable to UCU members my personal recommendation to the union’s governing body will be to call for a further round of industrial action. Inevitably, this will hit exams, assessment and, of course, teaching for many students. We do not want to take that action. For six months we have tried to resolve the dispute, talking to individual vice-chancellors and trying to persuade negotiators on the other side to take UCU members’ views seriously. So when I say that a failure to resolve the issues this week will see the dispute escalate, I hope my message is taken seriously. There are signs that the employers are beginning to understand this. Until a week or so ago, vice-chancellors like Stuart Croft from Warwick and Robert Allison from Loughborough stuck out like sore thumbs with their insistence that UUK reconsider its position. Now that is the view of many leaders in striking institutions. Cambridge has become the latest high-profile university to say UCU’s proposals must be properly explored. Others like Imperial have said that, if necessary, the current scheme should continue while further work is done on the hotly contested issue of how to value the USS pension fund and its liabilities. While it should never have come to this, I do welcome these key interventions and hope they translate into meaningful negotiations. But whatever happens – the sector has important lessons to learn from the dispute. Just as with the public criticism of vice-chancellors’ pay, too often the response to genuine staff concerns has been tone deaf. The impression has been left of a group of leaders talking to themselves and disinterested in hearing a contrary view. Vice-chancellors are a much-maligned group, sometimes with good reason. But I know that many do care deeply about their universities and the people within them – how sad that exactly the opposite impression has been allowed to take root thanks to one wrong move after another. Things must be done differently in the future. The sector faces real issues, such as casualisation, transparency at the top and creeping marketisation, which have been hidden from public gaze and must now be addressed so we can move on from the image of a sector in permanent crisis and make the case anew for our universities as a public good. • Sally Hunt is the general secretary of the University and College Union"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"news/2018/mar/02/corrections-and-clarifications","type":"article","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-02T21:00:17Z","webTitle":"Corrections and clarifications","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/mar/02/corrections-and-clarifications","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/2018/mar/02/corrections-and-clarifications","fields":{"headline":"Corrections and clarifications","bodyText":"• The ingredients list for a rich chocolate buttermilk cake in last Saturday’s Feast magazine (24 February, page 11) should have included 240ml of hot coffee, not 40ml. • Long John Baldry met Rod Stewart playing the harmonica at Twickenham railway station, not on an underground platform as we said (A Hero for High Times, 17 February, page 16, Review). • Other recently corrected articles include: Is the British establishment finally finished?"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2018/mar/04/tipping-point-americans-organizing-more-than-ever-after-florida-shooting","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-04T07:00:12Z","webTitle":"‘Tipping point’: Americans organizing more than ever after Florida shooting","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/mar/04/tipping-point-americans-organizing-more-than-ever-after-florida-shooting","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/mar/04/tipping-point-americans-organizing-more-than-ever-after-florida-shooting","fields":{"headline":"‘Tipping point’: Americans organizing more than ever after Florida shooting","bodyText":"Americans outraged by their country’s mass shooting epidemic appear to be organizing at an unprecedented rate, following the 14 February shooting at a high school in Parkland, Florida, in which 17 people were killed. The gun policy reform group Everytown for Gun Safety said a 25% leap in members in the two weeks after the Parkland shooting meant the group had overtaken the National Rifle Association in size – although the gun lobby’s claim of 5 million members has not been independently verified and is widely seen as inflated. The Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence has opened 16 chapters since the Parkland shootings, the group said. Sandy Hook Promise, an advocacy group founded after the 2012 elementary school shooting in Newtown, Connecticut, in which 20 young children and six adults were killed, has seen a wave of new signatories to its namesake vow. At least 20 corporations have changed their gun sales policies, by activists’ count, including most recently LL Bean, which announced on Friday that it would no longer sell guns or ammunition to anyone under the age of 21. “I think the Parkland shooting was the straw that broke the camel’s back for most Americans to get off the sidelines,” said Shannon Watts, founder of Moms Demand Action, the grassroots arm of Everytown for Gun Safety. “I think the regurgitation by politicians of ‘thoughts and prayers’, once again without any action, was just too much for most Americans to bear. And I think that’s why we’re seeing this movement.” Nicole Hockley, a co-founder of Sandy Hook Promise whose six-year-old son, Dylan, was killed at the school, said: “There’s a lot of increased activity, because people are just fed up with school shootings continuing.” Hockley credited student activists in Parkland with energizing the movement. “I think there’s a difference between parents like myself advocating for children who were killed, versus these kids advocating for themselves and asking adults to protect them,” she said. “That it’s the kids requesting and imploring for help has brought a new sense of urgency.” A greater share of the public also appears to believe change is possible. A HuffPost/YouGov survey two weeks after the shooting found that 60% of Americans “now say that mass shootings are something that can be stopped, rather than a fact of life in the country – up 18 points from as recently as last October”. Everytown and Moms Demand Action added 1.2 million supporters – “people on our mailing list that donate or take action” – since Parkland, bringing their total to 5.2 million, Watts said. “We also, the day after the Parkland shooting, started Students Demand Action,” she said. “We already have 10,000 new volunteers signed up.” The group has organized 600 events since the shooting and attendance at annual events is up tenfold, Watts said. “Last year we had a state advocacy day at the Georgia statehouse,” she said. “We had 150 people. And we just had it again last week – we have it every year – and 1,600 people showed up. So we’re just seeing incredible turnout everywhere. “We built the machinery over the past five years that can accommodate all these new members. We have a chapter in every single state. It’s a robust leadership system with volunteers, and each has a different role. That has enabled us to plug them in immediately. “We’ve been creating this movement on the ground and now we can make sure we’re accommodating this moment that has happened.” Hockley said there was still room for a lot more. “There’s a huge amount of potential,” she said. “We’re in all 50 states at the moment. But there’s always a need for more penetration within those states. “The individual state legislation, and then at the federal level – considerable policy is still required for gun safety reform, mental health and wellness and funding. There’s still a lot of room for growth in this movement.” Hockley had just returned from the White House, where she met Donald Trump for a second “listening meeting” about gun violence in as many weeks. “It’s easy to be cynical, and people can keep saying ‘Nothing’s going to happen’ but then I think you fulfill your own prophecy,” she said. “It’s important to say, ‘Hey, these conversations are happening.’ We’ve heard different options coming out from the White House, some of them are very good, some of them are not so good. “But the fact that there are multiple solutions being discussed, that is good in and of itself. The more that this turns from a fight into a conversation focused on solutions, the greater chance we have for progress.” Watts declared a “tipping point”. “It’s time for all Americans to get off the sidelines and to get involved in this issue and to make it a voting priority, and to remember in November which lawmakers are beholden to the NRA and to vote them out, throw them out,” she said. “These movements take time. The NRA has a 30-year head start. It isn’t going to happen overnight. It’s going to take several election cycles.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"community/2018/mar/02/an-almighty-fudge-readers-on-theresa-mays-brexit-speech","type":"article","sectionId":"community","sectionName":"Community","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-02T17:19:20Z","webTitle":"'An almighty fudge': readers on Theresa May's Brexit speech","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/community/2018/mar/02/an-almighty-fudge-readers-on-theresa-mays-brexit-speech","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/community/2018/mar/02/an-almighty-fudge-readers-on-theresa-mays-brexit-speech","fields":{"headline":"'An almighty fudge': readers on Theresa May's Brexit speech","bodyText":"Theresa May has given a major speech on Brexit, in which she warned that Britain needs to face up to “hard facts” and reiterated that leaving the EU would mean a reduction in Britain’s access to the single market. Below, we collate some of the reaction from readers of the Guardian’s politics live blog. ‘We’ll continue to send billions to the EU for access’ So after 20 months Theresa May has in effect told the UK electorate that Brexit is a total waste of time. All you’ll get is the illusion of taking back control and not even stronger vacuum cleaners and old light bulbs because we will still have to abide by EU regulations. They won’t even see much control of our borders or reduction in immigration or no longer abiding by ECJ rules. We’ll also continue to send billions to the EU for access to a more limited market. - Driscoll The speech made a very strong argument for joining the EU. - Valencia1984 ‘This will all take years and cost billions’ We’re heading for an almighty fudge, but it won’t be as good as what we’ve got now and it will cause damage, but not as much as Rees-Moggeddon. The fudge will necessitate renegotiating our relationship across dozens of areas, from customs to Euratom to the role of the ECJ, with possibly a new adjudication system to oversee everything. This will all take years and cost billions. Thanks Brexiteers, we could have got all this and more simply by a few of you voting Remain. - TheSadMafioso ‘Her best speech on Brexit’ I thought that was by far her best speech on Brexit - some more detailed considerations of the different sectors. Big points obviously the independent arbitrator and achieving equal regulatory outcomes rather than identical regulations. - Smithy07 ‘A tricky but achieveable vision’ That was a pretty good speech. It set out an honest, tricky but achievable vision of what a good Brexit deal would look like. Ireland is still being fudged, but again, that’s largely because the EU refuses to engage with any proposals about how it could work. For Verhofstadt - we are not asking the EU to change its rules. We asked for that in 2015, to give us a reason to stay in, and the rest of the EU didn’t want it. What we’re asking for is a bilateral agreement that offers good market access but doesn’t include freedom of movement. There is no reason that is impossible, it is just that the EU is currently choosing not to negotiate at all. - FFC800 ‘The onus remains on the UK’ If May had made this speech about a year ago, before Article 50 was triggered, we could just shrug and say it’s an understandable position for her to adopt prior to any negotiations. Now, a year later, with time running out, it is self-destructive and dangerous. The EU negotiators will yawn and say ‘So when will you be tabling a detailed proposal about what you want?’ The onus remains on the UK to make a proposal. - somalipirate I fear that Mrs. May is setting up the country to fail in the negotiations, but now she has a wide latitude for blaming the EU27 when they’re deemed “inflexible and unimaginative” by the right-wing press because she has set her stall out now. I think she’s trying to inveigle Europe into making compromises she knows they can’t or won’t be able to because, at least, it’s not been done before. No guarantees over the Irish border, but everything is being based on vague aspirations requiring a lot of trust probably because it is a deal where the European side is holding most of the cards. The UK is the supplicant, but at this point how much trust and goodwill remains? - El Zorro"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2018/mar/02/arctic-spring-is-starting-16-days-earlier-than-a-decade-ago-study-shows","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-02T15:49:53Z","webTitle":"Arctic spring is starting 16 days earlier than a decade ago, study shows","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/mar/02/arctic-spring-is-starting-16-days-earlier-than-a-decade-ago-study-shows","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/mar/02/arctic-spring-is-starting-16-days-earlier-than-a-decade-ago-study-shows","fields":{"headline":"Arctic spring is starting 16 days earlier than a decade ago, study shows","bodyText":"The Arctic spring is arriving 16 days earlier than it did a decade ago, according to a new study which shows climate change is shifting the season earlier more dramatically the further north you go. The research, published on Friday in the journal Scientific Reports, comes amid growing concern about the warming of Greenland, Siberia, Alaska and other far northern regions, which have recently experienced unusually prolonged and frequent midwinter temperature spikes. The authors from the University of California, Davis, based the study on temperature records and 743 previous phenological studies looking at timings of bird migrations, flowers blooming and amphibians calling. The results showed a curve, with spring events occurring earlier further north of the equator. “Spring is arriving earlier, and the Arctic is experiencing greater advances of spring than lower latitudes,” said lead author Eric Post, a fellow of the John Muir Institute and polar ecologist at UC Davis. Over the past 10 years, this means the end of winter will come about a day earlier in Los Angeles, but two weeks earlier in the Arctic. The authors say the northward increase in the rate of springtime advance is roughly three times greater than indicated by previous studies. This underlines how pronounced climate change is in the Arctic, where temperatures are rising twice as fast as the global average and ice fields are rapidly shrinking. The warming trend has been unusually apparent in recent weeks. Although the sun has not reached the high Arctic since October, temperatures has been above freezing for 61 hours – more than three times the previous record – at Greenland’s northernmost weather monitoring station. Martin Stendel, lead scientist of the Polar Portal and a senior researcher at the Danish Meteorological Institute, said temperatures in the central Arctic have been 4C warmer than average this winter. In February, several regions were 10C above historic norms. Despite fluctuations, he expects this trend to continue. “Think of waves on the beach. Some are high, some are low. That’s the weather. But in the background the tide is coming in. That’s climate change. Even though the waves haven’t changed their properties, they come closer and closer to your feet,” he says. The consequences would include increased melting of the ice sheet, less sea ice, thawing permafrost both on land and under the sea, less snow and more rain even in winter. The weather has appeared out of joint seasonally and geographically. As much of northern Europe was hit by blizzards and chills, the Danish media joked that residents should visit the Arctic special forces base at Daneborg because it is warmer there. The Information newspaper interviewed a member of the Sirius Dog Sled Patrol at the base – one of the most northern permanent outposts of humanity – who said the high temperature had turned slow into slush and made sledding heavy. The handful of troops at the base are used to spending months in cold and darkness. “The first day the sun doesn’t come up you think ‘Wow’,” one member told Greenland Today in 2015. “The water and the rivers stop running because they freeze. The fjord freezes too, so there are no waves or swells that lap at the shore. The small birds fly south so there is no birdsong. Only the ravens overwinter. And then a thick layer of snow comes that muffles everything even more.” On some patrols, they encounter blizzards that last for days and temperatures as low at -51C. But there is increasingly frequent respite in the form of warm “foehn wind”. This abrupt warming and drying of moist winds as they pass over ice-masses or mountains is commonly seen in the Alps. Similar phenomenon are the Chinook or “snow eater” of the North American Rocky Mountains; the Zonda of the South American Andes; and the Helm wind of the English Pennines. February has seen such warmth arrive with unprecedented frequency. One member of the Arctic Patrol described the effect as surreal. “Outside, the dogs lie on their backs boiling and we dance around in our underwear enjoying it, until the cold returns.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2018/mar/11/the-genius-within-review-smart-look-boosting-brains-david-adam","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-11T11:00:28Z","webTitle":"The Genius Within review – a smart look at boosting our brains","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/mar/11/the-genius-within-review-smart-look-boosting-brains-david-adam","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/mar/11/the-genius-within-review-smart-look-boosting-brains-david-adam","fields":{"headline":"The Genius Within review – a smart look at boosting our brains","bodyText":"Which of us would not want to enhance our intelligence? Indeed, some ethicists, such as John Harris at Manchester University, argue that it is our duty to improve ourselves if we can, and in turn society and the quality of life for future generations. If we were more intelligent, perhaps we would invent better ways to generate energy efficiently at less cost and damage to the environment. Or generate ideas for solving political disputes without engaging in aggression and conflicts. It is interesting that when we think of improving ourselves as individuals, we immediately consider boosting “cold” cognition – logic, critical thinking, memory capacity, etc – rather than “hot” cognition – the type required for you to understand what another person is thinking, termed “theory of mind”, and so important for soft diplomacy, resolving conflicts and psychological therapy. Cold cognition is nonemotional and reflects what is measured by the intelligence test, whereas hot refers to social and emotional cognition. David Adam, author of The Genius Within, regards cold intelligence as a key target for enhancement and I agree that superior cold intelligence is a great advantage. However, many of the jobs currently available are in the service industry and while these require a certain degree of skill, such as knowledge of computer use, the ability to have theory of mind, to understand what others are thinking and feeling and to be personable and likable are essential. The Genius Within is a fascinating account of intelligence and its measurement. The book covers the history of intelligence: how the concept developed from Alfred Binet (inventor of the IQ test) and its subsequent misuse in the eugenics movement. The author, who writes for Nature, informs us that even that outstanding scientific journal had a 1926 editorial on the subject of intelligence entitled Racial Purification.The reflections on ethics are extremely refreshing, especially given the emphasis currently being placed on genetics in health science, even in the area of complex mental health disorders such as schizophrenia, despite the fact that there are many genes involved of very small effect. In addition, Adam experiments with DIY brain stimulation, where, using an electrical brain stimulator bought over the internet from the US, he attaches electrodes to his head and has his wife turn on the stimulator. While transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is an approved treatment for depression in both the UK and US, the evidence for the efficacy of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) to boost cognitive abilities is controversial. Some experts have reported positive effects; others have found no effect. Adam also purchases the “smart drug” modafinil and when the package arrives from India he tries 200mg(after having it analysed to make sure it is the real thing). This dose has previously been found to be the most effective for cognitive enhancement in our placebo-controlled, double-blind experiments, and he does feel that focus, motivation and even progress in writing the book are improved. But as Adam discusses, there are many unanswered ethical questions raised by cosmetic neuroscience and how the desire for human enhancement will change society as we know it. To what extent is neuroenhancement cheating, undermining effort and hard work? Should those who are disadvantaged in life have the chance to use technology to close the gap? Adam points out that while populations are growing, work opportunities are shrinking. He regards cognitive enhancement as a vital tool to help people get on. As we develop new drugs, technologies and devices to help people with neurological and psychiatric disorders improve cognition, healthy people will also use these innovations to boost their brain power. Are we likely to use these new enhancement techniques to improve our work-life balance, complete our work so that we can develop hobbies, learn a new language or spend more time with friends and family? Or will we simply accelerate into a 24/7 work pattern, because we can now stay awake, alert and focused? It is clear that with the rapid advance in neuroscientific techniques and indeed in artificial intelligence, we, as a society, will need to consider which forms of cognitive enhancement are acceptable and by what methods we would wish to improve and flourish. Meanwhile, I recommend exercise, lifelong learning and evidence-based brain-training games, which are all safe and effective ways to boost the genius within you.

Under Ronald Koeman, the Merseyside club finished seventh and went on an expensive summer trolley dash. Supporters were buoyant with optimism for a brave new dawn, with hopes high that their team would once again finish seventh, but in a swashbuckling style befitting a club that had spent the thick end of £180m on the likes of Gylfi Sigurdsson, Michael Keane, Davy Klassen and Jordan Pickford, as well as bringing in Wayne Rooney, Sandro and Cuco Martínez. Having assembled these expensive new acquisitions, Koeman set about putting them together with all the dexterity and skill of a drunk trying to assemble an Ikea kitchen cabinet without instructions and was soon sent packing, making way for “Unzy”, who it soon became apparent was hopelessly out of his depth. With the very real prospect of relegation looming, there was only one thing to do and the Big Sam insignia could soon be seen lighting up the sky over Goodison Park. Now Everton are ninth, playing the kind of agricultural percentage football for which Big Sam has long been renowned despite his dogged insistence, in the face of all available evidence to the contrary, that it is not the kind of agricultural percentage football that his teams play. “At the moment we are in a very good position,” said Sam earlier, when it was put to him that his team is not in a very good position and that he might be ordered to do one at the end of the season. “I am slightly surprised about the [speculation] but you can look at the two differences between us: good at home and not good enough away from home.” Sam also put forward the tenuous argument that Everton must be having a good season, because they’re only three points behind Burnley and everyone seems to think they are doing great. That’s the same Burnley, who spent about £30m last summer and have failed to win any of their past 11 top-flight games. While there is every chance that Everton will reel in Burnley and finish seventh again, the fact of the matter is that they are currently 13 points worse off than at the corresponding time last season. While the blame for this cannot be laid at the door of a manager who only took over in late November, the style in which they are going about their business most certainly can. “Style of play is only brought up by previous people making out from many years ago we were playing this type of football, which is 10 years ago past,” sniffed Sam, accusing those who take umbrage at his overly-cautious approach of yearning for halcyon, long gone days of yore. Indeed, who can forget the samba-style tiki-taka approach of Tony Hibbert, Nuno Valente and Steven Pienaar under David Moyes, at a time when Manchester City and Tottenham Hotspur were both bobbins and the Scot led them to the dizzy heights of fifth.

It has also been involved in regulatory transgressions which legal experts believe means its plan to take over Sky should be closely scrutinised by watchdogs. The pay-TV firm, which is poised to formalise its bid to try to steal Sky from under Rupert Murdoch’s nose, announced a $300m plan to spruce up customer service three years ago, but to little avail so far. Comcast was named “America’s most-hated company” in a respected customer satisfaction survey last year. On top of Comcast’s poor reputation with consumers, it is the company’s corporate transgressions that are most concerning to legal experts examining the merits of its potential takeover bid for Sky. In recent years, Comcast has been fined more than $2m (£1.5m) by US regulators and was forced to relocate a rival news service nearer to its news channels on its TV guide, while one of its leading TV presenters was involved in a sex scandal. In November, NBC News host Matt Lauer, one of the best-paid TV presenters in the US, was fired after a complaint from a colleague about inappropriate sexual behaviour. In 2016, Comcast paid a $2.3m fine to resolve a federal investigation into allegations it added charges to customers’ bills for unordered services, including premium channels, set-top boxes and digital video recorders. As a condition of Comcast’s takeover of NBC Universal, the company agreed to a “neighbourhooding” rule to group similarly themed TV channels together to guard against potential anti-competitive or discriminatory behaviour. However, Comcast argued it did not need to relocate Bloomberg News, as it was not grouped with other news channels at the time of the merger. Bloomberg filed a complaint with the Federal Communications Commission which rejected Comcast’s argument and ordered it to move the business channel alongside its own stations in the channel line-up. Comcast has pledged to “maintain Sky News’s existing brand and culture, as well as its strong track record for high-quality impartial news and adherence to broadcasting standards”. “Sky News is an invaluable part of the UK news landscape,” Comcast said, when it announced its proposed bid for Sky last week. Comcast has experienced echoes of the Fox News scandal, which saw top host Bill O’Reilly leave following accusations of sexual harassment. In November, NBC News host Matt Lauer, one of the best-paid TV presenters in the US, was fired after a complaint from a colleague about inappropriate sexual behaviour. “Comcast has been found by US antitrust enforcers to have the opportunity and incentive to harm consumers and competition by favouring its own content, raising prices for rivals and potentially interfering with broadband transmission,” said Gene Kimmelman, the former chief counsel for competition policy at the US Antitrust Division during the Obama administration. “Based on our experience in the US, it is likely that UK competition officials would have significant concerns about whether Comcast may harm competition and drive up consumer prices through an acquisition of all or the majority of Sky assets.” Comcast has already been in regulatory hot water in the UK with a string of breaches of the broadcasting code in recent years. A four-year investigation by Ofcom found that CNBC, BBC World News and CNN International repeatedly breached rules on sponsored and free content funded by governments, NGOs and charities. The international news channels broke the rules on sponsorship and current affairs programming almost 50 times between 2009 and 2011, Ofcom found. In 2015, NBC Universal-owned channel E! Entertainment was fined £40,000 by Ofcom for broadcasting episodes of Girls of the Playboy Mansion when children were likely to be watching. Legal experts believe these transgressions mean its takeover of Sky should be scrutinised just as closely by UK regulators as Rupert Murdoch’s has been. Murdoch’s £11.7bn bid to buy the 61% of Sky he does not already own has been the subject of intense regulatory scrutiny since being announced almost 18 months ago. 21st Century Fox’s bid has been subjected to investigation by Ofcom and the Competition Markets Authority over its commitment to broadcasting standards, compliance and high editorial standards in the UK and US. This was prompted by issues including sexual misconduct, harassment and corporate failure at Fox News in the US, the potential “Foxification” of Sky News and the ongoing issue of phone hacking dogging Murdoch and his son, James. The CMA and Ofcom, which found the Murdochs were “fit and proper” owners of a licence to run Sky, cleared Fox on broadcasting standards. Comcast has said it does not foresee any media plurality or regulatory issues in taking over Sky. Brian Roberts, the chief executive and son of the company’s founder, added that Comcast was a “proven steward” of the businesses it owns. Earlier this week, Tom Watson, the shadow culture secretary, said any new bidders for Sky that emerge should be carefully vetted. Comcast declined to comment. •This article was amended on 5 March 2018 to correctly report that Comcast was named worst company in America twice in recent years, not two years running as we reported earlier.

I give an account of the 1938 Berlin salute and its political context in the memoir I am writing about my father, the England football captain Eddie Hapgood. After the war, he maintained that the decision to salute was made after several days of discussion but only minutes before the match began. The unrest in the dressing room triggered an instruction from the Foreign Office in response to the ambassador’s anxiety. It was a flawed and ineffective decision inspired by panic. The players’ perspective as footballers rather than political puppets is rarely acknowledged. The salute wasn’t necessary to “keep the crowds happy”, as the FA secretary, Stanley Rous, claimed. An unforgettable aspect of that contentious tour and one which my father treasured, was the delight with which German football supporters welcomed the English players when they arrived in Berlin, waved them off when they left and the roars of admiration as the final spectacular goal scored against them made the result 3-6. England won, and the players reclaimed their rights with a style of playing that demonstrated, as they believed, the very best of national values. Dr Lynne Hapgood Leamington Spa, Warwickshire • I cannot imagine what possessed Richard Williams to link Pep Guardiola’s fronting for Qatar’s World Cup bid with the FA insisting its players salute Hitler. That was five years after the Reichstag fire, the Enabling Act, the establishment of the Gestapo, the opening of Dachau and the first book burnings. It was three years after the passing of the Nuremburg laws. By all means criticise Guardiola, but with a sense of proportion. Allusions to Hitler are rarely wise – and this was no exception. I am not a supporter of Catalan independence. Justin Horton Huesca, Spain • Pep Guardiola’s yellow ribbon does not, as Richard Williams states, constitute a display of political affiliation. There is a consensus in democratic European countries that jailing politicians for their beliefs is reprehensible. There is also a consensus that it is appropriate to remember the millions who died in the last century’s two world wars. If managers and pundits are allowed to wear red poppies to acknowledge the latter, surely Guardiola should be allowed the same freedom in relation to the former.

The Everton manager is facing growing criticism over results, performances and public pronouncements that have alienated many supporters, the latest being that expectations at Goodison Park are no different than at Newcastle United or West Ham, two of his previous clubs. Allardyce signed an 18-month contract to succeed Ronald Koeman in November but may struggle to survive the summer. The former England manager believes Everton’s problems are deep rooted and that the possibility of drawing level on points with Burnley with victory at Turf Moor is evidence of improvement. Everton were five points above the relegation zone after David Unsworth’s final game as caretaker and are now seven points clear. “I am here as long as I win matches,” Allardyce said. “If you don’t win it doesn’t matter how long your contract is – you lose your job. If you win you keep your job and can plan for the future. At the moment, we are in a very good position. I am slightly surprised about the speculation. “The differences between us are we are not good enough away from home, but good enough at home. From where we started, down in the bottom end and everyone talking about relegation, to where we are now [is an improvement]. Burnley are having a magnificent season and if we beat them we are level with them on points. That is the realistic view and all the other speculation will go on. “The away form is a longstanding problem at the club. It hasn’t only arrived with my tender. It was under Ronald and Roberto [Martínez] before I got here. It is not something I want. I have to remedy it. In 2017 there were only two games won away from home.” Allardyce claimed he had improved Everton’s away form before last Saturday’s trip to Watford but a fifth consecutive defeat equalled the club’s worst run on the road for three years. The team’s style of play, with chances and shots on goal again limited, also rekindled a criticism that Allardyce insists is out of date. “Style of play is only brought up by people making out we played a certain type of football but that was more than 10 years ago,” he said. “Style of football is about a team going on the pitch and playing to its best to win. Style of play has never really been an issue apart from the legacy which was laid against my name. Style of play is about going out and performing better than the opposition and getting a win.” Everton’s manager risked further aggravating fans – and possibly Farhad Moshiri, the major shareholder who has invested almost £250m with the aim of challenging for Champions League football – with his assertion the pressure is no greater than at Newcastle or West Ham. He said: “The expectation is the same as Newcastle and the same as West Ham but Everton have won a lot more in past years. They have as big an expectation at Newcastle and West Ham as they do at Everton. Newcastle have 52,000 fans who want to see the club win things and West Ham 48,000-50,000 who want to see the club win things. Everton is the same and they want to see the club do better. You have to try to build a team that gets some success back here.” Allardyce confirmed the January loan-signing Eliaquim Mangala will miss the rest of the season with damaged knee ligaments and will spend his rehabilitation with Everton at the request of parent club Manchester City."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/2018/mar/02/nolli-waterman-im-very-driven-what-i-do-after-retiring-must-be-challenging","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-02T14:21:14Z","webTitle":"Nolli Waterman: ‘I’m very driven – what I do after retiring must be challenging’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/mar/02/nolli-waterman-im-very-driven-what-i-do-after-retiring-must-be-challenging","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/mar/02/nolli-waterman-im-very-driven-what-i-do-after-retiring-must-be-challenging","fields":{"headline":"Nolli Waterman: ‘I’m very driven – what I do after retiring must be challenging’","bodyText":"Much of Britain has been carpeted in white this week, pristine and unblemished. The top of the women’s Six Nations table is similar: there is still one white-shirted team with a perfect record and a grand slam in their sights. Should England emerge from their igloos to beat France and Ireland in the next fortnight while their male counterparts falter, it may just bring the increased public recognition that, in several cases, is overdue. Take Danielle – known to all as Nolli – Waterman. Last week’s game against Scotland in Glasgow was her 80th cap for her country; along the way she has been a World Cup winner and competed at the 2016 Olympic Games. At 33 she looks sharper than ever: every member of Eddie Jones’s backline would kill for her sidestepping ability. Her stunning individual try for Wasps against Bristol last month would grace the flashiest of show reels. In company with other inspirational totems such as Rochelle Clark, Katy Daley-Mclean, Tamara Taylor and Sarah Hunter, she has elevated the standards of the women’s game to levels barely imaginable when she won her first cap aged 18 – the youngest English female international on record – against Ireland in Limerick in 2003. Since then she has featured in four World Cups and scored 46 Test tries. All good things have to end some time but, equally, Waterman comes from durable stock. Her father, Jim, played more than 450 games for Bath and, until recently, was still turning out for his local club Minehead Barbarians: “I think he played his last game a couple of years ago which isn’t too bad considering he’s now 73,” she says. “To justify playing he said he had to make at least one tackle, otherwise it wasn’t rugby. I remember watching him three or four years ago. He was playing fly-half and still making people look silly. He just hasn’t got the hamstrings to finish things off once he’s gone through a gap.” Her mother, Sue, also remains a faithful fan and was in Glasgow last week to watch her daughter score two tries in England’s 43-8 win. Having beaten Italy 42-7 and Wales 52-0 the defending champions are regaining some of the feelgood momentum briefly lost following their 2014 World Cup triumph. “When we played Wales at the Stoop the crowd was absolutely incredible. I’ve never seen that many teenage girls at a fixture. They were absolutely buzzing after the game, wanting to talk to us and have photos taken. To be inspiring those girls is really important for us as a team.” If anyone is qualified to know exactly how best to continue growing the women’s game it is surely England’s longest-serving international; she is now into her 15th season at the top having battled back from knee and cheekbone injuries she briefly feared might curtail her career. Attracting more interest would be easier, for a start, if the national team’s key fixtures took place in higher-profile slots. This season’s potentially crucial final game between England and Ireland is due to kick off at 5.30pm on a Friday in Coventry. Not exactly prime-time scheduling. Having represented her country in both a paid and unpaid capacity, Waterman has been on the frontline of the fierce debate surrounding professional 15-a-side contracts. Going self-employed to allow herself extra time for proper rehab and conditioning has made a huge difference this season, she says. “The majority of the girls have gone back to work and are doing a great job of balancing rugby and work but it isn’t an ideal situation. There’s definitely more that everyone can do: bringing in full-time professional contracts, more people coming to the games, more sponsorship, more media.” A lively dressing-room argument is also ongoing as to whether 15s or sevens will ultimately be the holy grail of women’s rugby. “There’s a regular debate between the girls: would you rather a World Cup winners’ medal or an Olympic gold medal? It’s a really difficult one. “Having played both codes it’s very challenging to go from 15s to sevens. At the top level in sevens you have to have an unbelievable fitness base and that takes time to build. In the end it comes down to what drives a person. As I child I thought it would be incredible to go to an Olympic Games but I never imagined it was going to happen. Rugby was my sport and that was where my heart lay.” Money, though, has not been her primary motivation – “if it was I’d have quit a long time ago!” – at any point. Growing up with two older brothers it was far more about survival. “We’d play two versus one in the garden and there were no holds barred. It was full contact. I had to learn very quickly how to sidestep effectively. There was never any leeway shown to me as the younger sister. It was a case of: ‘If she wants to join in she’s got to be good enough.’ That’s how I’ve ended up approaching a lot of things; it’s stood me in good stead.” Early in her England career she was also inspired by the commitment and fitness of Sue Day and Shelley Rae – “they were fantastic role models who were also still working full-time” – and the sage advice of the coach Geoff Richards who “brought a professional edge with a little p”. Then there was the remarkable Sophie Hemming, who combined international rugby with working as a vet: “I remember turning up to a World Cup camp in Hull. She’d driven up having been out most of the night helping to deliver calves in the middle of a field. She was absolutely shattered but she was still there at the right time in the right kit encouraging the other girls. I never knew quite how she did it.” These days many are saying similar things about Waterman. Finding an alternative drug to rugby will not be straightforward – “I’m a very driven person and I need to make sure the next thing I do is challenging” – but first there is a red rose Six Nations title to be grasped. “I think it’ll be a big challenge to go away to France but it’s one we’re relishing. This is the business end of the tournament and I’m really excited to see how we can perform.” Catch them if you can."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"social-care-network/2018/mar/05/governments-fostering-stocktake-huge-opportunity-wasted","type":"article","sectionId":"social-care-network","sectionName":"Social Care Network","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-05T11:42:25Z","webTitle":"Government's fostering stocktake is a huge opportunity wasted | Kevin Williams","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/social-care-network/2018/mar/05/governments-fostering-stocktake-huge-opportunity-wasted","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/social-care-network/2018/mar/05/governments-fostering-stocktake-huge-opportunity-wasted","fields":{"headline":"Government's fostering stocktake is a huge opportunity wasted","bodyText":"The Fostering Network – the charity of which I am chief executive – has taken the unusual decision to publish a strongly worded letter sent to the children’s minister, Nadhim Zahawi. The reason was our extreme disappointment with the fostering stocktake, commissioned by the Department for Education (DfE), and our desire to inform the minister of the overwhelming feeling in the sector that the report is a huge opportunity wasted. We know that good foster care works, and foster carers make a huge difference to tens of thousands of children’s lives every day. But the system and culture make their jobs so much more difficult, rather than enabling and supporting them to carry out their vital task. We had hoped that the stocktake report would tackle the issues that are widely recognised by those who work in this field. However, we believe the report has no vision for foster care; instead it seems to view fostering as a stepping stone to adoption or special guardianship orders. It fails to address key issues the sector is experiencing – not least how foster carers are viewed and treated. While we agree with a number of the recommendations, they are largely superficial and will only scratch the surface; the report makes almost no recommendations that will have any significant impact on transforming foster care. There is nothing radical or brave in the report, nor anything the DfE did not know before the stocktake. Given that this was a review of foster care, the voice of the foster carer and of children and young people is woefully absent. In particular, the authors show very little understanding of the complex nature of fostering and its different roles for different children, and – insultingly – effectively dismiss long-term fostering as a permanence option by suggesting children should be moved on to special guardianship orders and adoption to avoid the problems of staying put. Hardly a child-centred approach. The stocktake team received 300 pieces of evidence and met hundreds of social workers, foster carers and others in the sector over several months. We ourselves submitted an official response and several accompanying reports, as well as sharing all the findings of our State of the Nation’s foster care report (based on a survey of more than 2,500 foster carers). We also held a specially convened session on staying put at the team’s request, and invited them to meet our members at a number of our conferences. And yet the report fails to demonstrate how it has drawn on any of the evidence collected, nor does it reflect the comprehensive literature review commissioned by the DfE. It also appears to give too much weight to personal opinions and bases its recommendations on the views of a very small number of people. We are also surprised by sweeping statements in the report that are backed by little or no evidence, such as saying that “understandably” foster carers of young children and those with no complex needs are not paid. Understandable to whom, and why? Other unsubstantiated sentences include: “Carers overwhelmingly see fostering as a vocation, and see themselves primarily as substitute parents.” Phrases such as “many”, “often” or “too few” are used with no reference to data, when the findings of the State of the Nation – representing 2,500 foster carers’ views – are not referred to at all. We fail to see how the stocktake has been value for taxpayers’ money or a good use of the sector’s time over the past year. Indeed, we are not alone in the view that this report is a missed opportunity. The outcry in the sector has been significant and there appears to be very few who think the report worthy of the time and effort put into it. The Fostering Network is extremely concerned that any plans built around this stocktake will just tinker around the edges and fail to make any demonstrable difference on the lives of children and the families that dedicate themselves to looking after them. Our letter urges the minister to ensure this is not the case and that the government’s response to this report looks beyond its recommendations, setting out a long-term and ambitious plan to make foster care the very best it can be. • Kevin Williams is chief executive of the Fostering Network Join the Social Care Network for comment, analysis and job opportunities, direct to your inbox.

But let’s hope it doesn’t come to that.” Matuidi does not enjoy having to denounce racism. Speaking to the Guardian at Juventus’s training centre just outside Turin before Wednesday’s Champions League showdown with Tottenham Hotspur at Wembley, the Frenchman explains that he takes more pleasure in showing what he is for than what he is against. But being targeted for racist abuse by fans during two matches in Serie A this season forced him to make a stand. Verona received a €20,000 fine and a suspended partial stadium closure when a portion of their fans abused the midfielder after he scored against their team in December. Two weeks later, during Juventus’s win at Cagliari, Matuidi appealed to the referee to act after a number of home fans aimed similar abuse at him. Cagliari issued a public apology to the player “if you were insulted at the Sardegna Arena because of the colour of your skin”, although no sanction was imposed against the club because match officials said they did not hear any abuse. After the Cagliari match Matuidi responded with eloquence on Facebook, declaring: “Weak people try to intimidate with hate. I am not a hater and can only be sorry for those who set bad examples. Football is a way to spread equality, passion and inspiration and this is what I am here for. Peace.” Juventus have been among the most proactive clubs in tackling racism in Italy. In 2015 they worked with Unesco to investigate the causes of racism in football and recommend ways of addressing it. They run a Gioca con me (“play with me”) scheme with local schools with the aim of “mixing children with very different upbringings” and “breaking down dangerous prejudices”. So the club was vexed by the abuse aimed at Matuidi, who, at the age of 30, moved to Juve last summer having spent all of his previous career in France, including six highly successful seasons at Paris Saint-Germain. “This was the first time I’ve experienced such abuse personally – it never happened to me in France, although I do know of others to whom it did happen there,” he says. “I’ve kind of turned the page on the incidents here but they are certainly things I don’t want to see happen again. Nobody should want it to happen. When you’re a football fan – and above all, when you love others – you can’t accept that.” “But it’s important to remember it’s only a minority. Italy is a great country with people who adore football – that’s one of the things that has struck me, how deeply people care about football here. It’s different to France. Football really has a strong hold on society here and that’s beautiful to see because football is a magnificent sport. “In general I’ve been really well welcomed. Yes, there is that minority and I’ve said what I think about them. Ask the authorities whether there is more they could do about them. I’m a player and what I try to do is give pleasure to people who come to support us, as well as to myself and my team. That’s how it’s been throughout my career. The most important thing is to be able to turn the page on bad experiences. I hope we can do that.” Matuidi is moving on well with his team. On Wednesday he played all of Juve’s Italian Cup win over Atalanta, keeping the club in contention for trophies on three fronts. The match was Matuidi’s first since damaging a hamstring a month ago, an injury that forced him to sit out the first leg of the tie with Tottenham, which ended in a 2-2 draw. He was sorely missed by his team, as Spurs, thanks notably to Mousa Dembélé, dominated midfield for most of the match in Turin. Matuidi’s return is well timed and he is relishing his duel with the Belgian. “He is a super player,” Matuidi says. “He has great technical qualities and a lot of composure. But Tottenham are a very good team overall. They have been showing that all season and they confirmed it in Turin. They go into the second leg with the advantage of two away goals, so we have to score at Wembley. And that’s what we plan to do. We are going there with the intention of showing that we are Juve, we can score anywhere.” He has been making that point privately to his friends in the Spurs ranks. He is close to his fellow France internationals Hugo Lloris and Moussa Sissoko, and also to two former PSG team-mates now at Tottenham, Serge Aurier and Lucas Moura. “As soon as the draw was made we began teasing each other,” he says. “And after the first leg they teased me a little harder. But I just said: ‘Be careful, this is far from finished.’” Matuidi is especially close to Aurier, describing the 25-year-old as his little brother. Aurier, like Matuidi, left PSG last summer but, unlike Matuidi, Aurier departed with a reputation as a trouble-maker, with the full-back’s offences including a conviction for assaulting a police officer during a night out (his suspended sentence was downgraded to a fine) and a ludicrous online Q&amp;A in which he disparaged several of his PSG team-mates and referred to the club’s then-manager, Laurent Blanc, as a “faggot”. “His reputation is false,” says Matuidi. “Yes, he has made mistakes in his life but the errors of his youth do not reflect the man he is. I’ve never seen him as a bad person. On the contrary, he’s a very good person which is why I am happy to call him a little brother, although calling him a little brother is a little strange because he’s actually very mature. “He is very intelligent and thoughtful. When you talk to him you see he understands things quickly. He works hard and leads a settled life. He deserves to be congratulated. He got a little pigeon-holed in France, which is a pity. But I think it’s done him good to go to the Premier League and experience new pastures. And he has joined a fine team.” Matuidi was also approached by Premier League clubs last summer – he declines to specify who – but opted for Juve after talking to the manager, Max Allegri, and two fellow Frenchmen who played for the Turin side, Paul Pogba and Patrice Evra. “They told me that if I wanted to win titles, including European titles, then this was the place to come. As soon as I got here I could see they weren’t wrong.” There is a certain irony to Matuidi’s transfer, in that PSG were willing to sell him because they fancied an upgrade but Matuidi has moved to the sort of club PSG aspire to become. “Juve is an institution and has been for many years. That’s the difference in the clubs’ levels. You can see when you come that Juve has vast experience. All the titles, the rigour, the workload. PSG is a great club too, of course, and hopes to become a giant – and they will succeed because they have the money and some exceptional young players who could go on to win the Ballon d’Or. But Juventus is already a giant.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"education/2018/mar/06/brexit-brain-drain-russell-group-universities-research","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-06T06:45:04Z","webTitle":"Brexit brain drain: elite universities say they are losing future research stars","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2018/mar/06/brexit-brain-drain-russell-group-universities-research","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/education/2018/mar/06/brexit-brain-drain-russell-group-universities-research","fields":{"headline":"Brexit brain drain: elite universities say they are losing future research stars","bodyText":"Belgian law professor Geert van Calster is used to approaches from European students who have abandoned plans to do a PhD in Britain with Brexit looming. But a few weeks ago, he got a surprise: a PhD student enrolled at a British university contacted him to say she wanted to jump ship. Calster, a professor in Leuven University’s Institute of European Law, explains: “She had already started her PhD but was concerned her qualification might not be recognised in Europe after Brexit.” She was also worried because many PhD supervisors were leaving to go abroad, he says. Many top European academics working in Britain arrived as young PhD students. Now universities fear discoveries and research are at risk because of a drop in applications from bright EU PhD candidates. Early figures from the Russell Group universities reveal a 9% fall in non-British EU students starting postgraduate research courses in 2017-18, compared with last year – a big concern in universities that rely on European talent. Overall 16% of Russell Group PhD students are from the EU, but this rises to 27% for maths, 22% for computer science and 19% for the physical sciences. Michael Arthur, president and provost of University College London, says: “If I look at the top research teams at UCL Europeans are over-represented, and many of them first came here as PhDs or post docs.” Arthur says he was relieved by the government’s December announcements offering “settled status” for Europeans already here, and the acknowledgement that his researchers can leave the country and work elsewhere for up to five years without losing that status. But many European researchers and students still fear for the future. “I try to reassure academics but it takes time to rebuild trust. There was a long period in which European citizens felt they were being used as bargaining chips. That has eroded confidence.”Calster can understand why young students are being put off Britain. “Just after the Brexit vote most of us assumed there would be some sort of coordinated, predictable approach. But that impression that things are under control and people will be reasonable is no longer valid.” Other doubts contributing to the potential PhD brain drain include uncertainty over the right to remain after studying, and whether Britain will have access to EU research funds after 2020. Jessica Cole, the Russell Group’s director of policy, says academics are still getting used to the idea of settled status. “People doing a PhD here already now know they can stay. But the government needs to get that message out as forcefully as possible. Not only that you can stay – but that we want you to stay.” Guillaume Charras, a French professor in biophysics at UCL, arrived from Paris to do his PhD. He went to Harvard and returned in 2007, becoming a big name in UK nanotechnology. As a research student he was attracted by how welcoming Britain was then. “Part of the reason I decided to return to the UK was this openness. But now there is a very big question mark for people who are not yet in the UK and who haven’t already experienced that openness first hand.” Charras, whose lab has brought in £2m from the European Research Council in the past 10 years, says the biggest fear among all scientists is that Britain could be shut off from EU research cash. The government has said Britain will remain part of the €70bn (£62bn) Horizon 2020 programme, which funds cutting-edge science, until its end. But official figures have revealed that Britain is already getting millions less from it – owing to a downturn in UK participation and success in winning grants. And many scientists are anxious about what will happen after 2021. “Some of the best scientists working in this country get European Research Council grants, and they are at the highest risk of leaving,” Charras says. One of Glasgow University’s research stars, Tomasz Guzik, regius professor of physiology, agrees. “Brexit brings many unanswered concerns both about funding and about collaborations.” Guzik, from Poland, is finding it harder to recruit European research students. “They all ask me ‘What will the future be like if I come?’ and I am not sure what to answer. But if we could give the clear message that Britain understands that science is a national treasure – then I am confident scientists worldwide will come.” Many of his European colleagues are already leaving Britain. “I’ve received several approaches from Europe asking if I would be willing to move and bring this unique project and my team with me.” Competitors outside Europe are spotting an opportunity. Andrew Timming, an associate professor at the University of Western Australia’s business school, recently advertised on Twitter for PhDs, urging them “jump from the sinking ship” of “Brexit Britain”. He says: “Does Brexit represent a recruitment opportunity? Absolutely. Not only do fewer potential PhD students want to study in UK universities, but there are also fewer opportunities for those who do. Many PhD studentships are funded from European sources and this tap is now being turned off, with no firm commitment on the part of the British government to plug the funding gap,” he says. John Dainton, professor of physics at Lancaster University and a spokesperson for the Campaign for the Defence of British Universities, says: “I feel like Britain is right back where we were in the 1970s when I was a young postdoc. We are losing young people.” He spends a lot of time working in Europe, but says it is increasingly difficult to persuade talented young people he meets to relocate. “If I tell someone they stand a good chance of getting a funded research fellowship at a UK university they will now still think twice because they see Brexit as a disconnect from opportunity.” Brexit is striking right at the heart of science, he says. “The very best science has always been international. It is about people in different places and fields pushing to get the best answers to big questions. National boundaries don’t come into that.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/shortcuts/2018/mar/04/farm-heists-a-hive-of-criminal-activity","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-04T15:00:08Z","webTitle":"Farm heists: a hive of criminal activity","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/shortcuts/2018/mar/04/farm-heists-a-hive-of-criminal-activity","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/shortcuts/2018/mar/04/farm-heists-a-hive-of-criminal-activity","fields":{"headline":"Farm heists: a hive of criminal activity","bodyText":"What getaway car would suit the theft of 1m bees? Oxfordshire police have been pondering this very question since last week, when they were called to investigate the biggest ever bee theft in the UK. Forty hives, each home to around 25,000 bees, were taken from a family-run business, Beekeeper Honey. Bee thefts have been growing over the past decade, which an industry spokesperson has blamed on rivalry between beekeepers. The owners of Beekeeper Honey in Brackley say the hives could produce 12,000lb (5,500kg) of honey over the year, and moving them would have required expert knowledge. Here are six other farm heists. Bovine bother Cow rustling didn’t die out with the Dandy. In 2016, a New Zealand farmer suffered the largest cow theft the country has ever seen, when 500 cows disappeared from his milking herd of 1,300 on South Island. New Zealand is home to around 10 million cows – twice its human population – but the dairy industry said the NZ$1m theft wasn’t taken seriously. The cows were most likely stolen a few at a time over a number of months. Fruit salad No one likes to be caught red-handed, but that’s just the trap one Jamaican farmer set for her adversaries after a spate of banana thefts in 2013. She spray-painted her bananas red, an approach the Ministry of Agriculture confirmed was safe, and the thieves stayed away. At the time, bananas were selling for a premium after Hurricane Sandy had wiped out much of the crop the previous October. Pine in the neck After poor harvests, pine nut prices rocketed in 2015, leading to a chain of thefts from factories, and one gang managed to drive off with £300,000 of the tiny kernels – seven tonnes. Wholesale prices had climbed to £40/kg, and supermarkets were even tagging jars of pesto with anti-theft devices. Corn bawl Don’t dismiss farm heists as local crimes for local people. In 2013, the FBI accused two Chinese companies of industrial espionage for stealing seeds from US agricultural businesses. In 2016, one of the “corn crawlers”, Mo Hailong, was sentenced to three years in jail for stealing expensively produced hybrid seeds from Monsanto and DuPont. Send in the troops Spain sent its feared Guardia Civil to Valencia during a spike in orange thefts blamed on the financial crisis. In just one month – April 2013 – 50 arrests were made, and the mounted patrol scared off more. Security gourds needed Some thefts need brains, others brawn.

In the wake of Carpetright’s profit warning on Thursday, and the collapse of Toys R Us and Maplin earlier this week, Mothercare became the latest retailer to reveal it was in financial straits as poor trading put it at risk of breaching the terms of its loans. Mark Newton-Jones, the Mothercare chief executive, said it was in talks to raise the funds needed to for a turnaround programme that involves the closure of almost half of its 152 UK stores as sales move online. “Reflecting the more challenging trading environment and our seasonal cashflows, we are working with our financing partners with respect to our financing needs for the 2019 financial year and beyond,” said the company in a statement. “We forecast our borrowings to increase towards the limit of our facilities at various points from the start of the new financial year, and will therefore require waivers of certain financial covenants.” The company added: “We are also exploring additional sources of financing to support and maintain the momentum of our transformation programme.” Mothercare’s shares have lost more than a third of their value this week and are now at an all time low of 21p. With its shares in freefall the company, which has an £80m hole in its pension pot, is now worth just £37m. It is shaping up to be one of the blackest weeks for the high street since the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis with both Toys R Us and Maplin, two of the high street’s best known retailers, entering administration on Wednesday, casting doubt over the future of 5,500 jobs and 300 stores. In January, Mothercare issued a profit warning in the wake of poor Christmas sales with Newton-Jones blaming a softening of demand with fewer visitors to its stores and website. On Friday the retailer said sales had been in line with expectations since its January warning with profits for the year expected to be at the bottom of the £1m-5m range expected by the City. “We are working together with all our stakeholders, including colleagues, franchisees, financiers, suppliers and pensions trustees on this next phase of our transformation and their part in delivering these plans,” said Newton-Jones. “The support already being shown gives us confidence that, despite the challenges, there remains a clear way forward for Mothercare to realise its ambition to be the leading global retailer for parents and young children.” With retail shares coming under pressure this week Sports Direct put out a surprise statement urging Debenhams to stock its brands in more of its UK stores and to work together online and overseas. Sportswear tycoon Mike Ashley has been toying with Debenhams since 2015, but it is now the retailer’s biggest shareholder after increasing Sports Direct’s holding for a second time this week to 29.7%, just shy of the level that would trigger a bid for the company. Debenhams shares are worth 29p, down from 54p a year ago as the chief executive, Sergio Bucher, struggles to turn the business around. “We see huge value for both companies in a strategic partnership between Debenhams and Sports Direct,” said Liam Rowley, the Sports Direct head of strategic investments. “There are obvious synergies that can be achieved through the integration of our respective web operations. We also see opportunities to work together internationally. “Importantly, there is scope for greater collaboration in the UK in order to roll out an elevated offering to consumers.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/mar/02/freezing-britain-and-the-chill-wind-of-austerity","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-02T16:43:47Z","webTitle":"Freezing Britain and the chill wind of austerity | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/mar/02/freezing-britain-and-the-chill-wind-of-austerity","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/mar/02/freezing-britain-and-the-chill-wind-of-austerity","fields":{"headline":"Freezing Britain and the chill wind of austerity","bodyText":"Frank Field (Letters, 2 March) draws our attention to the rise of destitution in the UK today as children from poor families arrive at school hungry and ill-prepared to learn. The impact of the recent snow and sub-zero temperatures on these children’s lives cannot be overestimated. With their schools closed, they must remain in their unheated homes for days on end without the comfort of a warm classroom or a hot meal. Government austerity and welfare cuts are cold comfort indeed to these poor children. Cathy Wood Lichfield, Staffordshire • Pupils may have trudged through 4in-6in of snow in the 1940s to schools that stayed open whatever the weather (Letters, 1 March), but the reality now is that heroically keeping a school open will inevitably add many more cars to icy, snow-bound roads. Spare a thought for the headteachers making the decision, early enough in the morning to alert radio stations and prevent wasted journeys, and without being on the spot to inspect the site. They will be criticised whichever way they decide. Mary Smith Maidstone, Kent • This beastly blast of wintry weather serves to confirm my long-held assertion that spring, meteorological or otherwise, doesn’t start until the equinox on 21 March. Annie Bullen Andover, Hants • We farm in the Scottish Border hills and have a fair idea about what constitutes bad weather (in a British context). Most older people here can remember the winters of 1947 and 1963 when communities were cut off for weeks. However, comparisons with the past – and with other parts of the world – aren’t appropriate. It’s not the amount of snow that matters, it’s the ability to deal with it. So, we’re told that people in Idaho, or Sweden, or Canada etc, cope better with far more snow. However, they expect to experience severe weather conditions in the winter, so their homes are better insulated, their vehicles are adapted to drive on wintry roads and public authorities are better equipped to deal with the conditions. Obviously, regular experience of severe winter weather gives people a better awareness of the potential problems and how to deal with them. Also, in these times of budget cuts, it would be ridiculous to expect local authorities to spend large amounts of money on equipment to deal with a situation which will probably only arise every 20 or 30 years. Much of the chaos can be attributed to the far greater number of vehicles using our roads, the majority of which are driven by people with little experience of driving in even moderate amounts of snow. Once one or two drivers fail to cope, it does not take long for traffic to grind to a halt. Some of your rather condescending correspondents – and the grumbling members of the public I’ve listened to on radio and TV – should accept the fact that spells of weather like this will always cause disruption simply because this isn’t northern Idaho or Sweden or Canada. It is therefore perfectly understandable for the forecasters to issue alerts. Simply issuing them must help to reduce the disruption, though there will always be the gung ho idiots who carry on as normal because they have a granny in Finland who deals with far worse. Lee Davies Selkirk, Scottish Borders • Walking around London over the last two days, I have glimpsed a utopia – albeit a rather cold one. The lack of cars on the streets, and the wonderfully slow speed of those that are on the move, has made the streets unusually appealing. They are quiet and safe; kids have quickly reclaimed them for play; people walk on the carriageway where normally they would not dare. This is how the city’s streets should be all year around. It is proof that most of the cars in our cities are wholly unnecessary. Adam Manolson London • How does a person in an electric car caught in snow for hours keep warm? The battery will run down in no time. Petrol and diesel cars can keep warm by running the engine, assuming they have a full tank. Has anyone thought about this? John Richards Oxford • My grandfather, born 1864 in Cambridge, used regularly to skate from Cambridge to Ely (Fens’ residents ready to get their skates on, 28 February): I still have his boots with skates, the latter with vicious, serrated leading edges. I used them in the winter of 1962-63 to play ice hockey on the gravel pits near Oundle School after Mr Harris, the physics master, checked the thickness of the ice with a brace and bit (minimum eight inches at the edge).

They chanted “Jews will not replace us!” and “Blood and soil!” and fought with counter-protesters in the streets. The footage and photographs from the far-right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, left people around the world shaken. These were white nationalists and neo-Nazis marching proudly in public, faces bare, in support of an openly fascist ideology. For months before the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, news outlets had been profiling the emboldened racist extremists who had celebrated the election of Donald Trump. The coverage had often sparked backlash, with readers across the political spectrum arguing that fringe racists were being given too much of a platform, and that media coverage was blowing their influence out of proportion. Charlottesville made clear that far-right groups were a serious, violent threat. But it did not put an end to the debates over media coverage of these groups – and the fierce criticism when news organizations produced coverage that readers saw as too “normalizing”. Guardian US and WNYC’s On the Media have collaborated on a radio episode looking at these debates over the coverage of America’s emboldened racist extremists. How should news organizations cover neo-Nazi and white nationalist groups? What does it take to cover them accurately – without simply giving them a platform for their ideas? The episode brings together historians of American racism with seven reporters who have covered the far right over the past year. Together, they weigh in on the common mistakes journalists and editors make – and the false assumptions about racism at the root of many of these errors. “I found myself at this fancy party in New York and there were all these fancy liberals and they wanted to talk to me about Charlottesville,” said Elle Reeve, a correspondent for Vice News Tonight, which produced the acclaimed 2017 documentary Charlottesville: Race and Terror, documenting the August Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia. “No matter how many times I told them that these guys were not poor, they kept saying: ‘Well, you know, whatever economic suffering has caused them to adopt racism, that’s unfortunate.’ No, these guys are like you. They are like you. They are from New Jersey. They went to prep school. They live on the Upper East Side. And it’s very hard for white liberals to accept that.” Dr Ibram X Kendi, the founding director of the Anti-Racist Research and Policy Center at American University and author of Stamped from the Beginning: The Definitive History of Racist Ideas in America, said the assumption that racism grows out of ignorance is an old trope – and a false one. “The reality is actually quite the opposite. Those who are producing racist ideas were doing so to justify existing policies that typically benefited them,” Kendi said. But blaming racism on ignorance has continued to be a popular move – even for some anti-racist activists. “When you make it about ignorance, you’re also making it about individual people and you’re not making it about power and policy and structures and systems. That the problem centrally is not America’s institutions. It’s not the American story,” he said. “It allows people to deny how fundamental racism has historically been to America.” There were common threads in the journalists’ advice: coverage of these groups needs a more defensive mindset, with more of an expectation than usual that subjects may lie and deceive; a deeper sense of the history and context of extremist organizing; more acknowledgement of the connections between fringe extremist groups and mainstream racism; and an awareness of how much even critical coverage of these groups can amplify their messages and increase their reach. “The Klan will put some flyers on some cars in a parking lot in Raleigh, North Carolina, and all the journalists go there to cover the Klan, and that’s well and good, but we need to talk about the bigger issue, about how what they say and what they believe has made its way into the mainstream,” said Vegas Tenold, a reporter who chronicles his six years reporting on the American far right in his new book, Everything You Love Will Burn. Almost none of this debate over how to cover racist extremists is new. Dr Felix Harcourt, the author of Ku Klux Kulture, weighs in on how an almost identical debate over how the media should cover racist extremists played out in the early 1920s, after a newspaper’s attempt to expose the KKK ended up inadvertently boosting the organization’s membership by hundreds of thousands of people. Doing this reporting accurately today, according to journalists who cover the far right as a beat, requires an understanding of how neo-Nazis have weaponized irony as a political strategy. “A lot of reporters don’t have a strong internet fluency so they don’t understand things like trolling, and they’re unable to find the places where Nazis are talking to each other,” said Anna Merlan, a reporter for Gizmodo Media’s special projects desk. “I understand the urge to ridicule these guys,” Reeve said. “Absolutely … It’s easier to laugh at them as basement-dwelling losers. But first of all they’re beating you to the punch on that joke and second, basement-dwelling losers vote. Just because they have an ideology that’s morally bankrupt does not mean they’re stupid. “White male journalists are particularly vulnerable to the idea that these guys are fighting for free speech,” she added. “Understand that they don’t actually believe in free speech. They’re truly fascist. If they were in charge there would be no bill of rights. They make fun of that. They know how to manipulate you. Don’t be a sucker to that.” Lois Beckett, who covers the far right for Guardian US, guest-hosts the episode, which also features the Guardian’s Gary Younge; Al Letson, the host of Reveal, a public radio show from the Center for Investigative Reporting; and Josh Harkinson, who wrote a series of articles on the alt-right for Mother Jones, including the profile of Richard Spencer trailed on Twitter as being about a “dapper white nationalist”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/mar/03/women-liberation-movement-first-march-remembered","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-03T17:30:24Z","webTitle":"The day that feminists took ‘women’s lib’ to the streets","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/03/women-liberation-movement-first-march-remembered","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/mar/03/women-liberation-movement-first-march-remembered","fields":{"headline":"The day that feminists took ‘women’s lib’ to the streets","bodyText":"It snowed and sleeted on the day members of the women’s liberation movement took to the streets to march for equal pay and equal rights for the first time. “It was extremely cold,” Sheila Rowbotham recalls, as the 47th anniversary of the historic London march she helped to organise nears. “But there was an atmosphere of joy. It was exhilarating.” From all over the country, on 6 March 1971, an estimated 4,000 women, men and children braved the weather to march from Hyde Park to Trafalgar Square. They held banners demanding everything from equal education, wages and job opportunities to free contraception and 24-hour state-funded nurseries. Many had marched before, against the Vietnam war and against apartheid. But never for women’s liberation. “What was really vital for us was to recognise we actually had a presence – that we could mobilise on the streets,” said Rowbotham. “Before then, we’d had conferences, which several hundred people had attended – but this was on a bigger scale. We were visible to people, physically, as a movement.” It was deliberately an ostentatious spectacle – there was music, street theatre, singing and dancing – and also a friendly call to arms, with many women who were shopping on Regent Street successfully invited to join the march. “We were deliberately trying to pull people in,” says historian Sally Alexander, then a mature student at University College London. “By 1971 we had a sense of the tradition of feminist demonstrations from the suffrage era, as spectacle and street theatre.” With heavy irony, the song Keep Young and Beautiful– an outrageously sexist song from the 1930s that advises women “It’s your duty to be beautiful” and “exercise all the fat off … if you want to be loved” – was broadcast from a gramophone pushed in a pram. Many of the demonstrators, including Alexander, were young mothers. “It was particularly when women had children and tried to enter the labour market that they encountered sexism and male chauvinism, as we called it then.” She remains friends with some of her fellow marchers to this day. “Going on the demo was just one thing we did, and we didn’t have a choice but to go on it. I am sure that’s how young women feel today as well. When it’s an issue of social injustice you don’t even think about it. You just get out there and march.” Sue Sheridan Professor of women’s studies (retired) I can’t remember how I heard about the march, but as soon as I did, I knew I wanted to go and be a part of the women’s liberation movement. I knew it was important. My female friends and I had been reading books like Sexual Politics and The Feminine Mystique, and we’d figured out we didn’t want our marriages and our careers to be like our mothers’– but we had no idea how much women’s liberation was going to change the way we saw ourselves and our relationships, as well as our personal and public lives. My whole life changed as a consequence of that day. I became totally involved with women’s lib and all my work has been about women and women’s rights. It felt heroic and exciting to be out there, marching in the snow. We felt that things would be different for us. We thought then, perhaps wrongly, women would be able to create the lives that they wanted. And we felt strongly we should be part of a broader movement, that this wasn’t just about us as individuals. Unfortunately, women still face a struggle to achieve the sort of liberation we had in mind that day. But I think it’s fantastic that with #MeToo there’s been another mass movement and a renewal of public solidarity among women. Sue Crockford Feminist film-maker I decided to film the march because I felt it was important. That film, A Woman’s Place, was the first I ever made. We all pooled our skills and worked on it for nothing. The atmosphere was exciting, good humoured and fun. We had a satirical beauty pageant with women dressed up as, for example, Miss Behave or Miss Stress, wearing minimal clothing in the snow. There was an amazing mix of people there, including men. We wanted men involved. Many of our partners supported us and we wanted to show that in the film, so I interviewed a lot of them. My son was three months old at the time so I brought him with me in a pram and everyone helped look after him while I was filming. That march marked the start of feminism being something I engaged with publicly, and making A Woman’s Place made me realise why I wanted to make films. I wanted to see whether other people could be engaged by what I believed in. I’ve been on hundreds of women’s marches since 1971 and I’ve noticed the women’s marches post-Trump have been particularly powerful, and the women’s movement has gained momentum in the past year. I think the #MeToo movement is supporting a new wave of feminism. Marian Brain Trade union activist I was an 18-year-old working-class girl without any qualifications in 1971. I saw a leaflet about the march and thought: that’s for me. The demands for equal education opportunities struck a chord. I felt that working-class women were at the bottom of the pile, and things needed to change. I remember hearing May Hobbs, who led the night cleaners’ strike, give a speech at the march about the lives of ordinary working women and improving our pay and conditions. I was so impressed by the way she was standing up for what was right. It was the first time I had seen a woman do that in public. That day changed my outlook for ever. It crystallised my understanding of myself as a feminist, and showed me that women could organise and be strong and fight for a better world. I made friends with people on the march who recommended feminist literature to me and that widened my horizons. I decided to join in the fight. I got a job working for BT and joined the union on day one. I’m retired now, but I’ve spent the last 30 years of my life as a trade union activist, supporting female communications workers in particular. I remember fighting sexual harassment in the workplace 20 years ago. It’s so good to see another groundswell on the issue, and it’s inspiring to feel a women’s liberation movement is happening again."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2018/mar/04/carillion-lenders-secret-report-fti-consulting-aggressive-accounting","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-04T00:05:32Z","webTitle":"Revealed: Carillion lenders alerted to concerns months before collapse","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/mar/04/carillion-lenders-secret-report-fti-consulting-aggressive-accounting","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/mar/04/carillion-lenders-secret-report-fti-consulting-aggressive-accounting","fields":{"headline":"Revealed: Carillion lenders alerted to concerns months before collapse","bodyText":"Directors of the collapsed government contractor Carillion masked its financial ill-health with aggressive accounting, according to a secret report written last year for banks that were considering lending the company more money to survive. MPs published the report on Sunday as part of a continuing inquiry into the collapse of a company that provided a host of vital public services, including catering in schools, prison maintenance and construction of new NHS hospitals. Frank Field, chair of the Commons work and pensions committee, said the document was evidence of “gross failings of corporate governance and accounting” at Carillion. The lenders – RBS, Barclays, HSBC, Santander and Lloyds – commissioned the business advisory group FTI Consulting to analyse Carillion’s finances last September after agreeing to lend it £140m. A draft version of the report detailed a litany of concerns about the finances of a business that hoped to secure another £360m from the five banks in order to revive its fortunes. FTI warned that Carillion was facing a financial crisis after suffering major losses on key projects in the UK, Canada and the Middle East, accusing it of “overstatement” of profits on the contracts. Less than four months later, Carillion collapsed into liquidation, a process that has so far cost taxpayers £50m, triggered 1,400 redundancies and threatened the survival of thousands of firms in the company’s supply chain. The Pension Protection Fund, which uses a levy on healthy businesses to rescue the retirement schemes of stricken companies, is expected to pick up its largest-ever liability of £900m, with some of the 28,500 scheme members facing cuts to retirement payouts. FTI’s report highlighted accounting practices designed to “enhance the reported profitability and net debt position” of Carillion, rather than dealing with its underlying practices. These included deferring payments, bringing forward receipts from contracts and accepting short-term loans from joint ventures it was involved in. “The group has been poorly managed for a considerable period during which time significant underperformance and contract issues have been masked by aggressive accounting,” FTI said. It accused the company of accepting large contracts too quickly and on “inappropriate” terms, in order to secure upfront payments and report large contract wins. And it said Carillion compensated for its failure to convert its reported profits into genuine cash by racking up ever higher debts. When confronted with FTI’s findings, the company’s management said they believed the assessment was too harsh, according to the report. But FTI insisted its report was balanced and did not even represent a “worst case” scenario, adding that lending Carillion any more money would be “extremely high risk”. Field, who is leading a joint inquiry with the business committee chaired by Rachel Reeves, said the report provided further evidence of poor management at Carillion. “There are many losers from the Carillion calamity: employees, pensioners, suppliers and the well-run businesses that pay the PPF levy. Many of those face an anxious wait to see what the consequences of the gross failings of corporate governance and accounting will be for them, their businesses and their families.” Details of mounting concern in 2017 about Carillion’s finances follow reports that investors were “running for the hills” long before the company’s collapse. Further evidence of the scale of its problems is likely to ramp up pressure on the government over its monitoring of a company that had issued a huge profits warning in July last year. The government continued to award it major public works, including a schools building contract in November 2017. The inquiry is set to take evidence from former investors in Carillion on Wednesday, while the business minister, Greg Clark, and the work and pensions minister, Esther McVey, will be called to a hearing on 21 March."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/mar/02/deontay-wilder-luis-ortiz-heavyweight-boxing","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-02T19:05:27Z","webTitle":"Deontay Wilder will do well to find a way past Luis Ortiz undamaged","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/mar/02/deontay-wilder-luis-ortiz-heavyweight-boxing","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/mar/02/deontay-wilder-luis-ortiz-heavyweight-boxing","fields":{"headline":"Deontay Wilder will do well to find a way past Luis Ortiz undamaged","bodyText":"By accident or design there is only one exit from Camagüey, the ramshackle city in central Cuba where Luis Ortiz was born nearly 39 years ago. Myth has it the confusing web of alleyways leading nowhere in particular was designed to trap raiding pirates, luring them on to hopelessness and destruction. True or not, the story is an apt metaphor for Ortiz’s career. A heavyweight southpaw with educated power, he is the ultimate boxing nightmare and is as hard to avoid as he is to find. Of the 28 opponents who have tried to corner him only four have finished the assignment standing up, none with a victorious hand raised. On Saturday night at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn Ortiz hopes to entice Deontay Wilder into a web from which he cannot escape – because, for all his knee-knocking presence and achievements, the WBC champion retains some of the rawness he brought with him from the briefest of amateur careers. This is the seventh defence of his title; it could prove the most difficult. Ortiz is cut from different cloth. As a Cuban amateur he was as accomplished as many of his compatriots, although he could not get the better of the then estimable Odlanier Solís in five attempts. As a professional he soon became the ogre nobody wanted or needed and he toiled anonymously until two years ago when, in sight of challenging the winner of the world title fight between Wladimir Klitschko and Tyson Fury, he failed a drugs test. Then another. In stepped Anthony Joshua. Out went Klitschko. On foraged Ortiz. On Saturday night he emerges from the shadows again in his 29th paid outing, indignant still at what he regards as a slur on his reputation and ready for a more physical examination of his spirit. Between them the champion and the challenger have 67 unblemished performances, with a bone-chilling 38 and 24 knockouts respectively. At the final press conference in New York they exchanged the usual pleasantries, as well as an inordinately long stare-down, and it was generally agreed Wilder, younger by six years even if callow in boxing terms, was the rightful favourite. In a schedule that has rarely taken him far from his home state of Alabama Wilder has ventured across the Atlantic occasionally – to spar with David Haye among others – and was scheduled to fight Dereck Chisora at Wembley in 2013 but was arrested in Las Vegas for domestic assault. When he did visit he knocked out Audley Harrison in a round. Thereafter he steadily built an aura of fear, winning 19 of his fights in the first round. Others, probably, were won before his opponent set foot in the ring. He was not quite Mike Tyson but he was wild and free-wheeling in the ring. “Bomb squad!” became his loud and funny calling card. And now he meets an almost equally respected foe, an undefeated veteran who, like the streets of Camagüey, is going nowhere, if he does not emerge with the biggest scalp of his career. They will play to their known strengths. If Wilder can find a way around Ortiz’s artful right-hand lead and avoid his left hook he should prevail by stoppage. If not, he will lose on points. Something else besides an ability to render opponents unconscious binds them: personal sorrow. Wilder took up boxing at 18 only to earn money for his ailing daughter, Naieya, who was born with spina bifida. Contrary to the defection script Ortiz turned professional not to escape communism but to pay for medical care for his daughter, who was born with a necrosis of the fingers. Amputation was considered. Ortiz said in a 2016 interview with seensportmagazine.com that he would have had his fingers removed, too, if that happened, “so that, when she was born, she could say I am just like my daddy”. There are not many like her daddy; nor are there many like the man he will try to knock out on Saturday night. It should be some fight."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"books/2018/mar/12/raw-my-journey-into-the-wu-tang-review-lamont-u-god-hawkins","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-12T08:00:05Z","webTitle":"Raw: My Journey Into the Wu-Tang review – poignant, insightful memoir","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/mar/12/raw-my-journey-into-the-wu-tang-review-lamont-u-god-hawkins","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/mar/12/raw-my-journey-into-the-wu-tang-review-lamont-u-god-hawkins","fields":{"headline":"Raw: My Journey Into the Wu-Tang review – poignant, insightful memoir","bodyText":"The first memoir out of the ranks of the Wu-Tang Clan – a sprawling hip-hop organisation who lit up the 90s with their martial arts-themed works – is not that of their mastermind, RZA. It is not by Raekwon or Method Man, two of its bigger personalities. It is by U-God – a core, if minor, member of the original nine-strong Staten Island outfit. And there are reasons for that. Back in 2015, the latterday Wu recorded an album – Once Upon a Time in Shaolin – and pressed only one single copy. In a flurry of publicity, it was sold for $2m to the disgraced pharmaceutical entrepreneur Martin Shkreli. U-God – AKA Lamont Hawkins – duly sued the rest of the group for $2.5m in unpaid royalties in 2016. Last year, Shkreli stuck his album on eBay where, after the price zigzagged, it was eventually sold for $1,025,100. The lawsuit remains unresolved. The final chapters of Hawkins’s eye-popping memoir attempt to explain why he broke fealty and sued his colleagues. At their height in the 90s, the Wu-Tang bristled with threat and exotic philosophy. Hip-hop’s love affair with martial arts movies reached an exquisite peak with the Wu, who took their name, and more than a few samples, from the 1983 film Shaolin and Wu Tang. Hawkins didn’t figure much on the Wu’s debut, Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers), because he was in jail – although his place in the lyrical hierarchy was later confirmed by his solo track, Black Shampoo, on the group’s second album, Wu-Tang Forever. On one level, the issues are grindingly familiar from every other band lawsuit and memoir: wrong-headed business decisions. U-God is particularly aggrieved that the Wu’s booking agent was no pro, but worked out of her house. While acknowledging the RZA as the prime motor of the Wu, Hawkins cites his control freakery as the root cause behind the group’s poor management and lack of transparency. Hawkins – it transpires in the preceding chapters – is especially fed up because he was once rather good at running things, having operated a large business organisation that happened to sell illegal drugs. In his teens, he was turning over hundreds of thousands of dollars’ worth of product and employing handfuls of people while keeping a low profile in high-school classrooms and, later, at college, studying mortuary science. (Sadly, he was never in Gravediggaz, a particularly excellent Wu offshoot.) Those hungry for an insight into the Wu’s lifestyles or their inner creative processes will get a few peeks into the mansions and the recording booths here. Hawkins’s fight to get his bars up to scratch after coming out of prison is strangely poignant, even in this context. The bigger story, though, is his life. He writes with a mixture of braggadocio, insight, pride and weariness about the years leading up to the Wu-Tang, with the occasional laugh (“I’m the ninja squirrel”) to break up the litany of horror. The product of rape, he grows up in a series of unforgiving projects where physical violence is omnipresent, and a future studded with crack, guns and tragedy pretty much inevitable. He and the rest of the Wu were absolutely desperate to leave the charnel pit that was Park Hill behind, and most of Raw is a catalogue of how, why and where Hawkins dealt drugs and survived. Reading between the lines, Hawkins’s biggest contributions to the Wu were not, perhaps, his own rhymes, but forcing Method Man to give up dealing and concentrate on his verses, supporting him financially. A “team player”, he is – categorically – no angel, but the hells that befall him are appalling. His two-year-old son is used as a human shield by another drug dealer and is shot in the kidney. No one from the Wu betrays much sympathy as Hawkins abandons his duties to rush to his hospital bedside. A breakdown, sobriety and therapy have had a role in the making of this memoir, which should have an audience in hip-hop fans and policymakers alike. • Raw: My Journey Into the Wu-Tang by Lamont ‘U-God’ Hawkins is published by Faber (£14.99).

It is all about what the authorities in Beijing call “social credit”, and the kind of surveillance that is now within governments’ grasp. The official rhetoric is poetic. According to the documents, what is being developed will “allow the trustworthy to roam everywhere under heaven while making it hard for the discredited to take a single step”. As China moves into the newly solidified President Xi Jinping era, the basic plan is intended to be in place by 2020. Some of it will apply to businesses and officials, so as to address corruption and tackle such high-profile issues as poor food hygiene. But other elements will be focused on ordinary individuals, so that transgressions such as dodging transport fares and not caring sufficiently for your parents will mean penalties, while living the life of a good citizen will bring benefits and opportunities. Online behaviour will inevitably be a big part of what is monitored, and algorithms will be key to everything, though there remain doubts about whether something so ambitious will ever come to full fruition. One of the scheme’s basic aims is to use a vast amount of data to create individual ratings, which will decide people’s access – or lack of it – to everything from travel to jobs. The Chinese notion of credit – or xinyong – has a cultural meaning that relates to moral ideas of honesty and trust. There are up to 30 local social credit pilots run by local authorities, in huge cities such as Shanghai and Hangzhou and much smaller towns. Meanwhile, eight ostensibly private companies have been trialling a different set of rating systems, which seem to chime with the government’s controlling objectives. The most high-profile system is Sesame Credit – created by Ant Financial, an offshoot of the Chinese online retail giant Alibaba. Superficially, it reflects the western definition of credit, and looks like a version of the credit scores used all over the world, invented to belatedly allow Chinese consumers the pleasures of buying things on tick, and manage the transition to an economy in which huge numbers of people pay via smartphones. But its reach runs wider. Using a secret algorithm, Sesame credit constantly scores people from 350 to 950, and its ratings are based on factors including considerations of “interpersonal relationships” and consumer habits. Bluntly put, being friends with low-rated people is bad news. Buying video games, for example, gets you marked down. Participation is voluntary but easily secured, thanks to an array of enticements. High scores unlock privileges such as being able to rent a car without a deposit, and fast-tracked European visa applications. There are also more romantic benefits: the online dating service Baihe gives people with good scores prominence on its platforms. Exactly how all this will relate to the version of social credit eventually implemented is unclear: licences that might have enabled the systems to be rolled out further ran out last year. There again, Ant Financial has stated that it wants to “help build a social integrity system” – and the existing public and private pilots have a similar sense of social control, and look set to feed the same social divisions. If you are mouldering away towards the bottom of the hierarchies, life will clearly be unpleasant. But if you manage to be a high-flyer, the pleasures of fast-tracking and open doors will be all yours, though even the most fleeting human interaction will give off the crackle of status anxiety. It would be easy to assume none of this could happen here in the west. But the 21st century is not going to work like that. These days credit reports and scores – put together by agencies whose reach into our lives is mind-boggling – are used to judge job applications, thereby threatening to lock people into financial problems. And in the midst of the great deluge of personal data that comes from our online lives, there is every sign of these methods being massively extended. Three years ago Facebook patented a system of credit rating that would consider the financial histories of people’s friends. Opaque innovations known as e-scores are used by increasing numbers of companies to target their marketing, while such outfits as the already infamous Cambridge Analytica trawl people’s online activities so as to precisely target political messaging. The tyranny of algorithms is now an inbuilt part of our lives. These systems are sprawling, often randomly connected, and often beyond logic. But viewed from another angle, they are also the potential constituent parts of comprehensive social credit systems, awaiting the moment at which they will be glued together. That point may yet come, thanks to the ever-expanding reach of the internet. If our phones and debit cards already leave a huge trail of data, the so-called internet of things is now increasing our informational footprint at speed. In the short term, the biggest consequences will arrive in the field of insurance, where the collective pooling of risk is set to be supplanted by models that focus tightly on individuals. Thanks to connected devices, insurers could soon know how much television you watch, whether you always obey traffic signals, and how well your household plumbing works. Already, car insurance schemes offer lower premiums if people install tracking devices that monitor their driving habits; and health insurance companies such as the British firm Vitality offer deals based on access to data from fitness trackers. In the near future, as with Sesame Credit, people will presumably sign up for surveillance-based insurance in their droves because of such simple incentives, and those squeamish about privacy may simply have to pay more. Many people, of course, will simply be deemed impossible to protect. Personal data and its endless uses form one of the most fundamental issues of our time, which boils down to the relationship between the individual and power, whether exercised by government or private organisations. It speaks volumes that in Whitehall responsibility for such things falls uncertainly between the culture secretary, Matt Hancock, whose “digital” brief includes what the official blurb limply calls “telecommunications and online”, the Treasury and an under-secretary of state in the business department, Andrew Griffiths, whose portfolio takes in “consumers”. That is absurd, and it may yet play its part in our rapid passage into a future that could materialise in both east and west, in which we do what we’re told, avoid the company of undesirables – and endlessly panic about how the algorithms will rate us tomorrow."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"football/2018/mar/02/jurgen-klopp-liverpool-coutinho-firmino-mane","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-02T22:38:00Z","webTitle":"Jürgen Klopp says Roberto Firmino deserves a new Liverpool contract","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/mar/02/jurgen-klopp-liverpool-coutinho-firmino-mane","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/mar/02/jurgen-klopp-liverpool-coutinho-firmino-mane","fields":{"headline":"Jürgen Klopp says Roberto Firmino deserves a new Liverpool contract","bodyText":"Jürgen Klopp believes Liverpool and Roberto Firmino will reap the benefits should the club secure the Brazil international on a new long-term contract. Firmino’s deal runs until June 2020 but Liverpool have opened talks with the forward’s representatives over an extension that reflects his increased importance. Negotiations over a new contract for Sadio Mané are also under way. The 26-year-old Firmino, who has scored 22 goals this season for Liverpool, recently claimed he wanted to spend “many years” at Anfield having seen Philippe Coutinho, the best man at his wedding last summer, leave for Barcelona. Klopp is determined to avoid another Coutinho saga and insists a new contract would help club and player given how Firmino has flourished under his tenure. “It is very important for both sides,” the Liverpool manager said. “Everything we are doing, the way we play, the way we give him the opportunity constantly to play, he deserves that. He deserves that because his work rate is outstanding but it helped him a lot to step up. “He became a different player here. Other teams can say: ‘Hmmm, he’s really good’ but it is not sure they will play the same way and use him as a nine or a 10 or they’ll use him out on the wings. It is never sure but it is important to keep these players who are at a good age and when there is still space for improvement.” Klopp believes Liverpool have become more unpredictable since Coutinho’s departure as other players have taken responsibility for breaking down opponents, with Firmino chief among them. He said: “You saw our games when Phil came deep in centre-mid. We didn’t want him to come deep all the time to be honest – it was more of a natural thing. If you play with three midfielders, you need two sixes and one who is more of a 10. With Phil we were giving him a four-yard pass and you don’t need that. Now we don’t have this dominant player – ‘Give it to me, give it to me, give it to me’ – that’s how it is. “I don’t want this to be misunderstood. It was really good, that’s why Phil is the player he is, but now we play differently and not only because he is out. It is because the boys do so well. “Roberto was always a dominant player; that’s why he drops into midfield and gets the ball and loses a few balls where you have a heart attack, but then he wins it back and starts an attack. It is not the biggest difference but there are a few decisive differences in the last few games. Maybe the biggest compliment is that nobody thought in the last few games: ‘With Phil it would have been different.’ “I really don’t want to throw dirt after Phil because there is no need and everything is fine, but it’s just normal. We played fantastic football with Phil as well. The team needed to step up without him.” Klopp has promoted Andrew Robertson’s claims to become the captain of Scotland following Scott Brown’s retirement from international football. “Scotland cannot make a mistake choosing Robbo,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/mar/04/no-benefits-landlords-rosie-keogh-sex-discrimination","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-04T00:05:31Z","webTitle":"Taking ‘no DSS’ landlords to court was a real social service | Rebecca Nicholson","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/04/no-benefits-landlords-rosie-keogh-sex-discrimination","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/04/no-benefits-landlords-rosie-keogh-sex-discrimination","fields":{"headline":"Taking ‘no DSS’ landlords to court was a real social service","bodyText":"After paying her rent in full and on time in the same place for 11 years, Rosie Keogh found herself unable to rent a new property in Birmingham when a lettings agent discovered she was receiving housing benefit and rejected her application. Keogh, a cleaner, former legal worker and modern-day hero, took the agency to court and won an out-of-court settlement of £2,000, after arguing that the ban on benefits indirectly discriminated against women, who are more likely to be claimants as they are more likely to be caring for children. I have relatively few responsibilities, a decent enough income, no dependents, and my experience of the private rental market over 15 years has been around 20% fine, 10% good and 70% hellish. I can only imagine the added complication of facing the cruel and now potentially discriminatory “no DSS” rule. According to Shelter, almost half of all private landlords have an outright ban on letting to people on benefits. I moved again recently, and from my own search for a new place, noticed that “no DSS” popped up most often on private, non-agency ads. Ironically, going through those private ads is one of the only ways of grasping at some relief from astronomical estate agency fees, which, despite government promises to ban them, are hanging around like a persistent patch of damp, and will continue to do so until at least 2019. In some respects, seeing “no DSS” did have its uses, in that it marked out which landlords to avoid, and it joined “shared bathroom”, “shower in kitchen” and “door broken from recent burglary” on our list of things that meant it probably wasn’t going to be our dream home. When Keogh took her case to court, she was insisting that people looking for homes be treated as such, not as potential risks to profit margins. As I said, she’s a modern-day hero. • Rebecca Nicholson is an Observer columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/mar/03/consume-culture-evolved-ed-sheeran","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-03T05:59:09Z","webTitle":"How we consume culture has changed, but our tastes haven’t | Simon Parkin","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/03/consume-culture-evolved-ed-sheeran","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/03/consume-culture-evolved-ed-sheeran","fields":{"headline":"How we consume culture has evolved, but our tastes haven’t","bodyText":"The people most interested in bestsellers are those doing the selling. No surprise, then, that a new list of the top-selling entertainment products in the UK last year was compiled by the Entertainment Retailers Association, a trade organisation representing vendors of music, video and video games, who have a vested interest in arranging their physical and digital shop windows. For the rest of us, the list provides an intriguing snapshot of the spire-tip of the cultural zeitgeist. Intriguing, that is, if it weren’t all quite so familiar. So recognisable are the names (or more precisely, the brands, as the late-capitalist machine refers to artists once they’ve been passed though its cultural sausage-maker) that your eyes slide, unsnagged, down from Ed Sheeran in the top spot, past the annual, incrementally tweaked update to the Fifa soccer video game series, and on through Star Wars and Harry Potter to trip only on the final rung, the soul singer with the voice of an archangel and the hunch of a doorman at a 24-hour Greggs: Rag’n’Bone Man. If the list is superficially dispiriting it’s not because of a lack of craft. Many bright eyes and minds – the writers, producers, musicians, script-editors, 3D modellers and games designers – are represented in the top 10. Besides, there is a particular kind of vanity in automatically dismissing that which is popular in favour of that which is niche. As the 19th-century critic William Hazlitt put it: “What is popular is not necessarily vulgar.” (Moreover, he added, in a hipster-skewering aside, “That which we try to rescue from fatal obscurity had in general much better remain where it is.”) But aside from the relative novelty of Moana, this cavalcade of remakes, sequels, and cover versions is tear-jerkingly routine. Where did it all go wrong, when it comes to the nation’s stagnated palate? Well, if the most popular dish at a hamburger restaurant is a hamburger, who is to blame: customer, chef, marketer, owner or investor? It’s difficult to learn much about the shifting winds of culture from bestseller lists, even medium-straddling ones such as this. Low art – that is, anything that is made to be sold – exists because someone, somewhere wants to make money. Today, blockbuster films and video games usually cost many times more to create than in previous decades, and therefore carry greater risks for their backers. It follows that the most widely produced and heavily marketed films and games are sequels to established hits. If the diet seems predictable, it’s because capitalism favours the predictable – until, of course, an unexpected hit comes along, and the rules change again. The second and third spots in the chart belong to the video games Fifa 18, with 2.69m sales, and Call of Duty: WWII, with 2.44m. But today the most popular games are given away as free downloads in an effort to amass as many players as quickly as possible (profit is made through the sale of tiny digital costumes for their on-screen avatars. Scoff all you like, but the makers of League of Legends reportedly made $1.7bn in 2015 from these in-game purchases). In February, Fortnite, a free-to-play game based on the premise of the Japanese cult film Battle Royale, had 3.4 million players concurrently online. Every day scores of popular YouTube streamers upload videos of their Fortnite matches, many of which secure millions of views within 24 hours. Money helps quantify the unquantifiable qualities of art and entertainment, but in this era of streaming, it’s an increasingly anachronistic way to measure not only cultural success, but also, counterintuitively, commercial success. Some 1.48 million people paid to watch Beauty and the Beast, making it, according to the Entertainment Retailers Association, the fourth best-selling piece of entertainment in 2017. But 2.83 million British people watched the Game of Thrones season premiere, many of whom paid for a NowTV pass specifically to do so. Which had the greater impact? Among the under-20s the dominant cultural artefacts have not only switched medium, but also shape-shifted into formats unrecognisable to previous generations and unquantifiable by traditional charts. Bestseller lists are struggling to incorporate changing viewing, playing and reading habits into their increasingly arcane calculations. But while the way in which we access entertainment is changing, that which we find appealing remains reassuringly, humanly resolute. Ed Sheeran sings songs about one-night stands and broken hearts. Fifa 18 and Call of Duty are arenas for competitive showboating and name-calling as old as the football field and chess board. Beauty and the Beast gives men hope that a beautiful woman may one day see the good in them, and women a flash of frisson as they wonder what it would be like to have sex with a monster. Don’t be too hard on yourself, Rag’n’Bone Man comforts: we are only human, after all. The traditional notion of a bestseller may be crumbling, but the themes that draw a crowd stand resolute. • Simon Parkin is the author of Death by Video Game"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"money/2018/mar/03/is-it-worth-buying-a-studio-flat-or-is-it-better-to-save-for-a-one-bed","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-03T14:01:34Z","webTitle":"Is it worth buying a studio flat, or is it better to save for a one-bed?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2018/mar/03/is-it-worth-buying-a-studio-flat-or-is-it-better-to-save-for-a-one-bed","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2018/mar/03/is-it-worth-buying-a-studio-flat-or-is-it-better-to-save-for-a-one-bed","fields":{"headline":"Is it worth buying a studio flat, or is it better to save for a one-bed?","bodyText":"Every week a Guardian Money reader submits a question, and it’s up to you to help him or her out – a selection of the best answers will appear in next Saturday’s paper.

Yes, but when a writer dies that family’s troubles have only just begun. Wills may be contradictory and instructions to literary executors confused. Works left behind on computers or in desk drawers may be of uncertain status: were they intended for publication or not? And if the writer is famous enough, there’ll be biographers to deal with: can they be trusted to paint a kindly portrait? In their lifetime, authors have a measure of control. Once they’re gone, it’s left to others to guard their reputations. The vigilance can be fierce, with the appointed custodians (whether spouses, children, lawyers, agents, editors or friends) not so much keepers of the flame as dragons guarding a cave. Posterity is rarely kind to them: however they act, they will be accused of acting badly. If they deny the author’s wishes, as those acting for the French philosopher Michel Foucault have recently done by consenting to the publication of a book he hadn’t finished and didn’t want to come out, they will be called treacherous. And if they are overly loyal, destroying work the author disowned but that deserves to be saved, they will be called philistine or just plain stupid. Either way, they can’t shirk the role allotted them. They have an estate to manage: an acreage of words. Literary management is back in the news because the will left by Harper Lee has been made public. It was signed only eight days before her death in 2016 and, while naming as heirs her niece and three nephews, appointed the lawyer Tonja Carter as her literary executor. Lee’s sister, Alice, used to perform that role, but after Alice’s death in 2014 at the age of 103, Carter assumed control. It was she who discovered the “lost” manuscript of Go Set a Watchman in a safe deposit box and, two months after Alice’s death, arranged for it to come out, despite Lee having maintained for 55 years that To Kill a Mockingbird was the only novel she would ever publish. There has since been talk of a possible third book, though Carter – who opposed the unsealing of the will – hasn’t shed much light on that. There are some in Monroeville, Alabama, Lee’s hometown, who questioned how competent the writer was when she signed the will (“poor Nelle can’t see and can’t hear and will sign anything put before her by anyone in whom she has confidence,” Alice once said). A state of Alabama investigation found that she was not a victim of elder abuse. However, there are many outside Alabama who question how responsibly Lee’s legacy is being managed. The worst mismanagement in literary history was of Byron’s unpublished memoirs, which became an issue as soon as the news of his death in Missolonghi reached London. The three key players – or culprits – were his friend John Hobhouse (politician and pamphleteer), his publisher John Murray (in whose house in Albemarle Street they gathered) and the Irish poet Thomas Moore (to whom Byron had given the memoirs some years before). Hobhouse was for destroying the memoirs at once. He deeply resented Byron entrusting them to Moore rather than to himself, and he’d heard they were obscene: for the sake of Byron’s reputation, and to spare the feelings of his half-sister Augusta and estranged wife Annabella, they should never see the light of day. Moore disagreed. He’d not only read them but had arranged for a second copy to be made (the original having become dog-eared after passing through so many hands); they were far less offensive than rumour suggested, he said. Murray sided with Hobhouse: he’d made a handsome profit from publishing Byron’s poems but had had a deal of trouble over them (threats, libel suits, angry complaints) and feared the memoirs would bring more. A possible compromise was discussed – to preserve the manuscripts but lock them away for many years. But when this was ruled out, Moore, outflanked, lost heart. And when Murray’s son appeared, by prior arrangement, to help with the burning of the manuscripts, Moore’s protests went unheeded. Within minutes, both the original and the fair copy were ash. If book burning stems from anger, however misguided or orchestrated, manuscript burning stems from fear. Better to destroy the evidence than to allow it to get into the “wrong” hands. Even now, in a supposedly confessional age, the potential for vicarious outrage is enormous; it’s only the list of offences that has changed. Where illegitimacy, alcoholism, humble social origins or a history of mental illness might once have been cause for shame, these days it’s racism, misogyny, political extremism and sexual abuse. Günter Grass was attacked when it emerged, in his late 70s, that he’d once been a member of the SS, a fact he’d carefully hidden for decades. To his credit, it was he who came clean. The controversy would have been greater (doubtless with calls to strip him of his Nobel prize) if a journalist or biographer had been responsible for the exposure. In January, the ugly politics of the French novelist Louis-Ferdinand Céline came under similar scrutiny, more than half a century after his death, when his widow’s lawyer gave permission for his notoriously antisemitic pamphlets from the 1930s to be reissued, with Gallimard set to publish them. Only after protests from Jewish groups and historians, who said that republication “risked sanctifying incitement to murder”, has Gallimard since backed down. Texts have an immense power to cause pain. As Stephen Fry likes to say: “Sticks and stones may break my bones, but words will always hurt me.” In recent years, many a victim has come forward to complain of injuries inflicted on them, or their family, by a novel or memoir: Karl Ove Knausgaard’s uncle, Michel Houellebecq’s mother, the pianist James Rhodes’s former wife, Hanif Kureishi’s sister, the family at the centre of Åsne Seierstad’s The Bookseller of Kabul – all have complained or sought legal redress. The rights of the written about have never been so angrily asserted. Sometimes whole communities claim victimhood. The residents of Hallencourt in France are unhappy about the portrayal of them in Édouard Louis’s The End of Eddy, with Louis’s mother leading the charge. “It’s not right, what he’s done,” she told a reporter. “He presents us like backward hicks.” Even authors who are stalwart in defending their right to freedom of expression may change camps when they are the one in the headlights. “No biography,” writers sometimes tell their executors. George Orwell and WH Auden are among the many who (unsuccessfully) made that request. With old age comes an urge to tidy up one’s affairs – both the business kind (by making a will) and the amorous (by obliterating evidence of indiscretions). Thomas Hardy’s solution to the prospect of an unflattering biography was to write his own “authentic” version before he died, under the authorship of Florence, his second wife. He set out the terms for her in a private memorandum, stipulating that any facts that were “indiscreet, belittling, monotonous, trivial, provocative, or in other ways inadvisable” should be omitted. A few intimates were in on the deception. At one point, Florence (worried she was not up to the task) showed TE Lawrence what she had written, with a view to getting his help. But the truth didn’t fully emerge until a decade after her two-volume Life had appeared. In the meantime, immediately after Hardy’s death, Florence burned whatever letters and notebooks he hadn’t burned himself. When their gardener, Bertie Stephens, offered to help, “she insisted on doing it herself, and after all the papers had been destroyed, she raked the ashes to be sure that not a single scrap or word remained”. With the primary source material destroyed, Hardy’s semi-fictional autobiography/biography could have the status of definitive truth. “What he wished to be remembered would be remembered,” Philip Larkin wrote, and “what he wished forgotten would be forgotten.” Larkin was fascinated by the precedent that Hardy set, imagining “how the smoke billowed across the garden at the back of Max Gate”. When he was dying in 1985, he followed Hardy’s example, asking his companion, Monica Jones, to destroy his diaries, which he called “a kind of great grumble-book”; too ill to do it, she handed the job to his secretary, Betty Mackereth, instead. The instrument of destruction was a shredding machine; more than a dozen A4 diaries went into it, before being incinerated in Hull University’s boiler house; only the covers survived. “I couldn’t help seeing little bits and pieces,” Mackereth confessed to Larkin’s biographer Andrew Motion. “They were very unhappy. Desperate, really.” Henry James was another who made “a gigantic bonfire” of his archive, thereby observing what he called “the law of not leaving personal and private documents at the mercy of any accidents, or even of my executors!” His sole wish, he said, was “to frustrate as utterly as possible the post-mortem exploiter”, the kind of figure he writes about in his novel The Aspern Papers, in which a “publishing scoundrel” goes to Venice to get his hands on the literary remains of a famous American poet, Jeffrey Aspern, and cons his way into Aspern’s aged former lover’s house. James took up the theme again in his story “The Real Right Thing”. This time, the post-mortem exploiter is less unscrupulous, having been invited by the widow of a famous novelist, Ashton Doyne, to peruse her husband’s papers. As Doyne’s ghostly presence turns disapproving, both widow and acolyte back away, convinced he’s warning them off: the life mustn’t be raked over in a Life. That authors can exert their influence from beyond the grave is no fiction; just because they are past doesn’t stop them tampering with their future. In his lifetime, Samuel Beckett was careful to police new productions of his plays: stage directions had to be followed to the letter. Since Beckett’s death, his nephew Edward Beckett has done the same. In 1994, he prevented Deborah Warner’s production of Footfalls at the Garrick theatre in London from touring. And he has since opposed the use of music, casting of women and “injection” of race in Waiting for Godot, or imposed bans on them. As Edward Beckett sees it, he’s doing the right thing by his uncle. But writers are often poor judges of their own work or how to preserve their legacies. Eugene O’Neill doubted the value of several plays he had written; it was only through the efforts of his third wife and literary executor, Carlotta Monterey, that many manuscripts survived – and that his masterpiece Long Day’s Journey into Night (on which he’d placed a 25-year embargo) was produced shortly after his death. And then there’s Foucault, the fourth volume of whose major work The History of Sexuality existed only as a first draft when he died in 1984, but has just been released under the title Confessions of the Flesh. “The rights-holders of Michel Foucault considered that the time and the conditions had come to publish this major unreleased work,” the philosopher Frédéric Gros writes in his introduction, though Foucault was clearly opposed. “Pas de publication posthume,” he used to tell friends. “Don’t pull the Max Brod-Kafka trick on me.” It may have been Foucault who was playing a trick, since Brod is the most famous example of an executor serving posterity by denying the author’s wishes. “Dearest Max,” Kafka wrote when he was dying of TB, “Everything that I leave behind in the way of diaries, manuscripts, letters of my own and from others, sketches, etc … should be burned, completely and unread.” But Brod had already told Kafka he wouldn’t oblige him. Throughout their “unclouded friendship”, Brod “never once threw away the smallest scrap of paper that came from [Kafka], no, not even a postcard”, and he wasn’t about to start now. Without Brod, The Trial, The Castle and Amerika would never have been published. Slavish obedience is one route for an executor, defiance for the sake of literature another. When several parties are involved, each jealously possessive of the author, things get trickier. The afterlife of Emily Dickinson was especially vexatious. Her sister, Lavinia (to whom she left her estate), was asked to destroy her private papers, but not her poems, many of which Emily had sewn into booklets and locked in a chest. To get them published, Lavinia first turned to Susan, their brother Austin’s wife, who had been a confidante, adviser and muse to Emily over many years. But Susan dragged her heels on the matter, so Lavinia approached Mabel Loomis Todd, who idolised Emily (despite never having met her) and whom Susan, for understandable reasons, detested – Mabel was Austin’s lover. The edition of the poems that Mabel co-edited with Thomas Higginson helped establish the myth of Emily as a recluse and concealed her close friendship with Susan. The feud – akin to a property dispute (which party had the better claim to own Emily?) – continued through the next generation, with the daughters of Susan and Mabel producing rival collections. In effect, the poems Dickinson left behind were divided between two households. It was 1955 before they were brought together in a single edition. Similar rivalries afflicted the afterlife of Robert Louis Stevenson, though much of the blame lies with him. He originally intended his biography to be written by his friend WE Henley. Then he added a codicil to his will, requesting that his wife, Fanny, do it instead. Later, he changed his mind again, and asked that the critic Sidney Colvin take over. The work was eventually completed by Graham Balfour, a cousin of Stevenson, whose tactful biography was well received – except by Henley, whose scathing review called the portrait of Stevenson “a barley-sugar effigy of a real man”. What might be revealed about her husband’s life before they married was a sensitive matter for Fanny Stevenson, as it was for Florence Hardy. It’s a dilemma faced by many biographers as they negotiate between the duty to be candid and the presence of a widow who would prefer certain facts to be played down or withheld. However open-minded, a bereaved partner may take umbrage when a previous partner is given primacy as lover or muse. But if they don’t cooperate, perhaps because private and interview-shy, they will be even more sidelined. Adam Begley’s excellent biography of John Updike acknowledges the help of Updike’s first wife, Mary (“an inspiration to me from the day of our first interview”), but makes no mention of being helped by his second wife, Martha. Where a bereaved spouse is also a literary executor, the problems multiply. When TS Eliot’s second wife, Valerie, forbade Peter Ackroyd to quote from Eliot’s work, “except for the purposes of fair comment in a critical context”, the message was clear: nothing about the man was to be inferred from the poems. In declining to cooperate, Valerie wasn’t just observing her husband’s expressed wish that there be no biography but holding back material for her own project, a multi-volume edition of the letters, still incomplete when she died in 2012. What riled her as much as Ackroyd’s biography was Michael Hastings’s play (and later film) Tom and Viv, and the beliefs to which it gave rise: that Eliot had incarcerated his first wife, Vivienne, in a mental institution; that he’d taken credit for lines in The Waste Land that Vivienne had written; and that he was cold, ruthless and self-absorbed. Perhaps she also minded any suggestion that Vivienne was the woman her husband loved most passionately and “for ever”, when that honour, she felt, rested with her. When Jonathan Bate researched his Ted Hughes: The Unauthorised Life, the poet’s widow, Carol, seemed more willing to keep her distance. But when she saw that his work-in-progress wasn’t the biography she hoped for, she and Faber withdrew their cooperation, leaving Bate to publish with HarperCollins instead. Would it have been better for her to stay on board and eliminate the perceived errors and misreadings that so distressed her when the book appeared? Maybe. But managing a literary estate is difficult even for relatively disinterested parties, and if the author is someone you love it’s hard to get things right. Hughes got them wrong when he burned the diary Sylvia Plath had written in her last months: however harsh it was about him (they’d recently separated), the greater damage was done by him in destroying it. Still, in his mind the journal wasn’t something that anyone (least of all their two children) should read – unlike the poems, which were intended for publication. And for all the criticism of his handling of Plath’s posthumous reputation, he’s not responsible for the recent repackaging of her work. The cover of last year’s UK edition of her letters features a photo of her in a bikini; the 2013 anniversary edition of The Bell Jar depicts a woman checking her makeup; the 2004 edition of Hughes’s selection of her poetry shows Plath bare-shouldered in a swimsuit. There have been protests against this sexualisation of Plath. However appealing to a wider audience, the covers risk trivialising the seriousness of her subject matter and the importance of her work: it’s doubtful Hughes would have endorsed them. The original 1985 edition of his selection from her poems, when he was still alive, had a plain cover. “I am dead,” Hamlet tells Horatio. “Thou livest. Report me and my cause aright.” For most literary executors doing right by an author is humdrum work: keeping the books in print, looking after royalties, answering letters, selling manuscripts, charging permission fees, and generally ensuring that the authorial brand name goes on even though the author has been discontinued. But it’s not a job to take lightly. The duties are at best thankless (the person who appointed you isn’t around to show gratitude) and at worst it’s an ethical nightmare. Authors are difficult enough to deal with when alive. And things don’t get any easier when they are dead • • Blake Morrison’s The Executor, a novel with poems, will be published by Chatto on 15 March.

The 34-year-old, who will run his first race for nearly six months at Sunday’s Vitality Big Half in London, is rumoured to have agreed a large six-figure package with London marathon organisers, which includes running in the 2018 and 2019 races. But Farah, who will race 13.1 miles against his fellow Briton Callum Hawkins and last year’s London marathon winner, Daniel Wanjiru, said that his desire to prove himself over 26.2 miles matters far more than anything else. “I wouldn’t be competing if I didn’t enjoy running,” he said. “You have to set yourself a target. If you look at every great athlete, like Haile Gebrselassie, they have succeeded when they have stepped up to a marathon.” Farah, who finished a disappointing eighth in his only completed marathon, in 2014, said he was in good condition after arriving in London from his training camp in Ethiopia on Thursday and that he was not concerned about switching from running in temperatures in the high 20s to close to freezing. “Coming down from 10,000 feet, I should have an advantage,” he said. “I’ll wear some good layers – it should be all right. And you can’t pull out because of bad weather. I’m going to race no matter what.” Farah also said his relationship with his new coach, Gary Lough, was going well, despite his fiery reputation. “Gary is a great coach. The last six weeks we’ve got to know each other.” Farah, who has been running more than 120 miles a week in training, also said he had had no contact with his former coach Alberto Salazar, who remains under investigation by the United States Anti-Doping Agency. Salazar took Farah from a good athlete to a dominant one but Farah seems confident that under Lough, the husband and former coach of the women’s marathon world record holder, Paula Radcliffe, he can improve as a marathon runner. “I’m not going to give away secrets,” Farah said. “But training for 5,000m and 10,000m is different to marathon. But I’m happy with what we’ve done – it’s exciting. I’m definitely more confident now. “I ran 2:08 in 2014 and the aim is to improve on that. I definitely want to continue running and getting medals for my country.” When asked what it would take to run at Tokyo, Farah said: “Mainly mixing with the guys. If you’re not mixing with the guys and being close to winning medals, it would be hard to just turn up and make up the numbers. “But over the next couple of years the aim is to learn about the marathon and get better at it. On the track, I started building and coming up with tactics and ways to win – in the marathon, you have to work on your weakness and get stronger.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2018/mar/02/arsenal-players-arsene-wenger-meeting","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-02T18:59:15Z","webTitle":"‘We need more help’ – how Arsenal players feel about Wenger situation","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/mar/02/arsenal-players-arsene-wenger-meeting","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/mar/02/arsenal-players-arsene-wenger-meeting","fields":{"headline":"‘We need more help’ – how Arsenal players feel about Wenger situation","bodyText":"The speech was delivered by one of the senior players in the Arsenal dressing room but he did not finish it. He was too choked up as he reflected on how such a talented squad had come to resemble a bunch of drifters. He said his children were asking him why Arsenal were so bad. That was the moment when the tears welled in his eyes. Another Arsenal player stepped in. “We are a big club,” he said, tapping into the rallying cry theme. “But we need more help from the coaches.” That was when the damning judgment was articulated. It had actually been the motivation for the players to gather in the first place – without Arsène Wenger. “It’s not going to happen,” one of them said. “We need to find the answers ourselves.” It was Tuesday of this week – the day of the first training session after Sunday’s Carabao Cup final humbling against Manchester City. The meeting of the players at London Colney was not aggressive in its tone, even if there were frank exchanges. It was more plaintive; coloured by soul-searching and a certain helplessness. It shone a glaring light on why Wenger’s time as the manager is up. It is too easy in times of crisis to say the lavishly rewarded modern footballer does not care. The Arsenal squad do care; they beat themselves up over how they have slipped from Champions League to Europa League level. It embarrasses them that the fans have been so unhappy with so many of their performances. This is their livelihood. They have professional pride. Wenger has always said he will step aside when he feels he can no longer draw the maximum from his players. Right now, he cannot get through to them at all and the frustration on all sides is overwhelming. It is causing the club to implode. The weird thing about Thursday night’s Premier League fixture against City was that Arsenal played well during the first half. And yet they trailed 3-0 by the end of it and only a Petr Cech block from Sergio Agüero on 40 minutes stopped it from being worse. At that point only the hardest of hearts could feel no sympathy. Arsenal’s heads did not go down after the first City goal – despite Wenger’s dire pre-match warning that in 85% of the big games the team that broke the deadlock came out on top. But things turned sharply upon the second and third goals. There were boos from the home support when the half-time whistle went, a chorus of “You’re not fit to wear the shirt” from a small section and, also, something new and darker – the team were booed out for the second half. It was excruciating to see how City sliced through Arsenal on the counterattack, although it was not entirely surprising given the lack of defensive midfield balance in Wenger’s lineup. Arsenal gamely tried to play forward; City simply picked them off. The no-shows had felt telling; the Emirates Stadium was only half-full. Never mind the horrible weather – this was one of the prestige matches of the season. The official attendance was given as 58,420 based on tickets sold, which drew the usual derision. Only at Arsenal can people get angry at something like that. But this is the climate, one of volatility and extreme emotion, and Wenger remains the lightning rod. Whether he limps on into next season or is gently ushered off the premises is the all-consuming issue (again) and it is difficult to see how it cannot affect performances. Wenger admitted the uncertainty over his future had done so last season. The City manager, Pep Guardiola, was asked on Thursday night whether he felt any sympathy towards Wenger and he talked generously about how he could “understand the situation”. Guardiola accepted it could happen to him or any of his peers, even if this rather overlooked the sheer scale of the Wenger Out saga. But a throwaway line stood out. “I’m sure he’s going to take the right decision, for the club, for him, for the players, for everybody,” Guardiola said. As far as Wenger is concerned there is no decision to take. He intends to remain in charge for next season and honour the final one on his contract. To hear Guardiola buy into the narrative and, essentially, validate it was revealing. Perhaps Guardiola has a little inside information. His coach, Mikel Arteta – the former Arsenal captain – has been touted as a potential successor to Wenger. There were mitigating factors for Arsenal’s second 3-0 loss to City in the space of five days; namely that it was City. They have greater resources and better players. But it still felt like a damaging setback; a point of no return. Even Wenger’s patented knack of bouncing back from a bad defeat had deserted him. On the other hand, we have been here before – most recently at Crystal Palace last April. After the 3-0 defeat that night, the notion of Wenger continuing for another season felt outlandish. He somehow stabilised and ended up winning the FA Cup. This time out he has his sights on the Europa League. Wenger talked the fighting talk before Sunday’s trip to Brighton &amp; Hove Albion, albeit in a weary way, and he admitted that his players’ confidence levels were low. He looked shot to pieces although, as ever, he trooped through his various media obligations with stoicism and dignity. Nobody likes to see this gentleman under such fire.

The government is convinced a revolution has taken place. Culture secretary Matt Hancock has now scrapped any further Leveson inquiry into the press and its relationship with the police force: “The world has changed,” he said. In the years since the press standards inquiry was launched, the News of the World has closed down, many people have gone to jail, and millions have been paid out to victims of press intrusion. But the industry still looks and feels essentially the same. For a start the same people are in charge: the Murdochs and Rebekah Brooks at News International; and Paul Dacre and Viscount Rothermere at the Daily Mail. The prime minister hosted a private dinner for the Mail editor-in-chief within six months of moving into Downing Street, and managed to “bump into” Rupert Murdoch during her first trip to New York after taking office. No one was surprised when Hancock jettisoned not only any further inquiry but also section 40 of the Crime and Courts Act – which obliges media organisations to pay the legal costs of libel cases whether they win or not – because Theresa May’s team had put the pledge to do so in her hastily assembled Conservative manifesto last year. While the relationship between the press and power – in essence what Judge Leveson wanted an inquiry into – is remarkably unchanged, the market itself is not. Not only have newspaper circulation falls continued but so has the loss of advertising revenue to online media giants such as Facebook and Google. Yet the biggest sign of the changing tectonic plates in the media industry could well have come last week with the first sign that Murdoch’s own ambitions have been stymied not by government and regulators but by an even bigger rival. Just two days before Hancock’s announcement, the Murdoch family’s long-held ambitions to own the whole of Sky faced a far mightier opponent than a government with a wafer thin majority. Comcast, a telecoms and entertainment giant valued by the market at some $184bn (£130bn) – more than twice the value of 21st Century Fox – looks set to outfox the man who started Sky in 1989 and built it into Europe’s most significant satellite television platform. By offering 16% more to Sky shareholders, who have been waiting for over a year while competition regulators agonise over the possibility of increasing Murdoch’s dominance, Comcast has highlighted that market economics can trump media power. The appearance of a huge US business, the owner of NBC television and Universal Studios, to spoil Murdoch’s takeover plans, shores up his argument for a merger with Disney. Despite the local power held by his newspapers – which is largely unchanged – the Murdoch media empire is relatively small compared with the Apples and Amazons of the world. Comcast makes a fortune from telecommunications in the US but revenues from the rest of its business are just 9% of its total. In this game of superscale, Murdoch’s desire to control Sky has twice been held up by regulatory questions over the behaviour of his employees: first through phone hacking, then with sexual harassment allegations. It’s worth pointing out that Comcast, like so many media groups, has been tarnished by the latter: its television network NBC fired its best known presenter Matt Lauer amid harassment allegations last year. Competition may have led to global expansion but, as the battle with online news sources has intensified, newspapers such as the Mail have doubled down on their power over politics by sticking pictures of their Brexit “enemies” on their front cover. The thing about the newspaper market is that increased competition and the race for more readers led to increasingly salacious stories of the rich and famous or the powerless. The endgame was a culture of excess which allowed illegal acts such as phone hacking to go unchecked. The saga is not over, of course. Hancock’s announcement to parliament was met with jeers, and there will be a showdown with the House of Lords, which backed pro-Leveson amendments. But few believe the next phase of Leveson will happen, even in the face of further legal threats. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn appeared to threaten media owners with his view that “change is coming” in a video last month. The irony will be that, if Comcast wins, which analysts believe possible, it will be the market which has done for Murdoch, not the people or politicians. This week has also shown that the victims of some of the worst press abuses deserve better supporters. It may be fair enough that celebrities are sick of having details of their private lives splashed over the front pages or of being hounded in the street, but it still feels like a failure for the Dowler and the McCann families that their hero should come in the form of a man who once held despicable racist views. The Mail this week produced a pamphlet from 1961 linking “coloured immigrants” with the spread of disease, an election leaflet “published by Max Mosley”. Whatever the coincidental timing of this ahead of the Leveson announcement, Mosley made a pretty appalling fist of excusing his behaviour this week on Channel 4 News. He couldn’t remember the pamphlets and so, of course, had not perjured himself. Were the leaflets even real or just made up by the Mail; was that really his name at the bottom of an election document calling for “coloured immigrants” to be sent back to Jamaica? On it went. The allegations are awkward not just for the victims of press abuse Mosley has supported with his large fortune and his time, but for Impress, the Leveson-compliant regulator which he funds, and for the deputy Labour leader, Tom Watson. The MP has refused to give up the £500,000 or so donated by Mosley to his campaign team, and said essentially that Mosley was a changed man from the one who allegedly supported his fascist father’s far right Union Movement. “If I thought for one moment he held those views contained in that leaflet of 57 years ago, I would not have given him the time of day.” There have been many genuine victims of press abuse – from grieving parents to the relatives of the Hillsborough disaster. They deserve better. Trinity Mirror has more than 110 regional newspaper titles, over 60 websites and seven national newspaper titles. And just the one female editor. Its £200m takeover of the Express, the Star and several celebrity magazines and websites prompted the departure of the longest serving female national newspaper editor, Dawn Neesom, editor of the Daily Star for 15 years. In a new roster of six national newspaper editors, Alison Phillips became the sole woman as the newly-appointed editor of the Daily Mirror. Neesom may have been the longest serving female editor but her paper, like others in the stable, did little to challenge sexism. The irony is that Phillips is also the head of the group’s Women Together network at the now enlarged group. A better moniker might be “A woman alone at the top”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2018/mar/12/street-philosophy-garry-winogrand-geoff-dyer-review","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-12T07:00:05Z","webTitle":"The Street Philosophy of Garry Winogrand by Geoff Dyer review – supremo of the 60s sidewalk","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/mar/12/street-philosophy-garry-winogrand-geoff-dyer-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/mar/12/street-philosophy-garry-winogrand-geoff-dyer-review","fields":{"headline":"The Street Philosophy of Garry Winogrand by Geoff Dyer review – supremo of the 60s sidewalk","bodyText":"Garry Winogrand was an obsessive New Yorker with attitude who, in the 1960s, defined street photography to such a degree that nearly every example of the genre since looks like imitation. For all the apparent spontaneity of his images, Winogrand was acutely attuned to the ways in which a photo altered what it captured, often imposing a formal, and thus transformative, symmetry on the unruly drama of the everyday. “Photography is not about the thing photographed,” he once said. “It is about how that thing looks photographed.” In many ways, Winogrand’s work is the perfect conceptual starting point for a series of short essays by Geoff Dyer, whose nonfiction writing merges discursive scholarship with personal flights of fancy. The Street Philosophy of Garry Winogrand takes its cue not from Dyer’s previous book on photography, The Ongoing Moment, but the late John Szarkowski’s wonderful book on Eugene Atget (Atget), the great flâneur-photographer of Victorian Paris. Szarkowski, a brilliant curator and incisive writer, selected 100 of Atget’s images and wrote mini-essays on each. Dyer has done something similar with Winogrand, “weighing up”, as he puts it, “the often competing claims of word and image”. The result will disappoint anyone looking for a rigorous, comprehensive appraisal of Winogrand’s work, which, as Dyer points out, can be found elsewhere. Instead, the images allow Dyer to range far and wide through photography, literature, art, theory, architecture, design and music as he teases out his own offbeat associations. When it works, it works beautifully: an image of a lone young girl, lost in thought at a bus stop in London, “reminds us that the swinging 60s was a highly localised epoch” in that “there is no sign that any of the associated tentacles – psychedelia, op art, flower power – reached from Carnaby Street or the Kings Road to this part of London, let alone the rest of England”. Dyer also picks up on an ominous pile of rugs in a shop window, “which lie there like an octopus” (the photograph within a photograph being a characteristic of Winogrand’s work). Dyer is astute, too, on Winogrand’s key tropes: people waiting, looking, lost in thought, arriving and departing; crowds, big and small, calm and chaotic; the various striking females he shot on the street for his series, Women Are Beautiful, which, in our current moral climate, may well be read as a damning example of the predatory male gaze. Dyer artfully deconstructs a shot of a woman in a phone booth, one leg raised, her hand cupped over the receiver. It is an image that blurs the thin line between public and private, a line photographers have walked since the invention of the medium and that is now blurred to such an extent that this photograph seems almost quaint. Almost. At least two male passers-by in the frame are aware of Winogrand’s presence, the woman possibly so, though her eyes are concealed by a horizontal bar. As Dyer notes: “The ballet of the glimpsed and the unseen, the concealed and revealed, is present at several levels, including the aural.” Like several of Winogrand’s best photographs, it distils the ongoing momentum of modern city life into a single stolen moment. There are a few instances when Dyer’s flights of fancy become too fanciful. A nun tending a prone woman surrounded by sidewalk gawkers is compared to a scene from a film by Alain Resnais, but Winogrand was too much of a New Yorker to ever approach the clinical formalism of Last Year at Marienbad. Even his stillest moments have an unmistakable Winograndian energy. Most of the time, though, Dyer’s riffs are both playful and illuminating, and will make you look anew at the work of a man who once said: “I’m a photographer, a still photographer. That’s it.” As this book reminds us, it isn’t. • The Street Philosophy of Garry Winogrand by Geoff Dyer is published by University of Texas Press (£46)"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2018/mar/05/mondays-best-tv-imagine-philip-pullman-the-kyle-files","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-05T06:20:07Z","webTitle":"Monday’s best TV: Imagine – Philip Pullman; The Kyle Files","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/mar/05/mondays-best-tv-imagine-philip-pullman-the-kyle-files","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2018/mar/05/mondays-best-tv-imagine-philip-pullman-the-kyle-files","fields":{"headline":"Monday’s best TV: Imagine – Philip Pullman; The Kyle Files","bodyText":"Philip Pullman does not consider himself a fantasist. “I think of myself as a realist,” he says, “because my interest as a storyteller is what it really means to be a human being.” In this beautiful little film, Alan Yentob meets the literary heir of CS Lewis and Tolkien, whose writing and worldview repeatedly stress the “necessity of growing up, and a refusal to lament the death of innocence”.

The prime minister used her third major speech on what Britain wants after leaving the EU, delivered to ambassadors and business figures at London’s Mansion House, to hit back at critics who say the government is pursuing a “cake and eat it” strategy. May’s decision to double down on red lines on immigration and trade while also opening up areas of potential compromise was welcomed by Tory remainers and Brexiters, whose relationship has become increasingly fractious in recent months. However, the speech triggered a muted response from Brussels, with some high-profile figures accusing May of failing to go beyond “vague aspirations”. The Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, said it simply piled confusion on top of complication. The European commission’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, welcomed the intervention, but his suggestion that “recognition of trade-offs” would inform EU guidelines, to be published on Tuesday, was described as an ominous warning by some observers. In a speech that was relocated from Newcastle as a result of the bad weather, May said: “I want to be straight with people – because the reality is that we all need to face up to some hard facts. “We are leaving the single market. Life is going to be different. In certain ways, our access to each other’s markets will be less than it is now. How could the EU’s structure of rights and obligations be sustained, if the UK – or any country – were allowed to enjoy all the benefits without all of the obligations?” But she suggested the EU had pushed too hard, adding: “So we need to strike a new balance. But we will not accept the rights of Canada and the obligations of Norway.” Among the hard choices listed by May were less access to EU markets, the UK still being affected by the European court of justice after Brexit, and the country being constrained in its ability to lower regulatory standards for some goods. She said she accepted there was a balance to strike between obligations and rights, but insisted that Britain’s desire for a deep and ambitious partnership was not the same as cherrypicking. “The fact is that every free trade agreement has varying market access depending on the respective interests of the countries involved. If this is cherrypicking, then every trade arrangement is cherrypicking,” May said. The prime minister’s vision was described by some as the softest Brexit possible outside the single market and customs union, but she pleased pro-leave MPs by hinting that future parliaments could opt for a harder form of Brexit. One source close to the European Research Group of pro-Brexit politicians insisted they were not going to quibble about details around regulatory questions at the border, and said they saw this speech as simply a staging post on the way out of the EU. They also welcomed the language on Northern Ireland. May said Britain must take responsibility for avoiding a hard border, but warned the EU that she would not accept anything that would “damage the integrity of our precious union”. She insisted the UK would be leaving the EU customs union, but called for a new agreement that would secure “as frictionless a border as possible”. May also set out her hopes to remain part of EU agencies, including those involved in chemicals, medicines and aerospace, which would require Britain to abide by the rules and make an “appropriate financial contribution”. However, despite setting out some areas in which the UK accepted ongoing obligations, May was unswerving about Britain’s red lines, around ending free movement and being able to strike trade deals with third countries. She rejected a customs union with the EU – in contrast with the Labour party – by arguing that such an arrangement would be asymmetrical and prevent the UK from striking new trade deals after Brexit. Instead, she argued for two potential alternatives: a “customs partnership” in which the UK would mirror EU requirements on imports at its borders; and a “highly streamlined customs arrangement” using technology to minimise friction on the border. The first option has been described as unrealistic by EU officials, and even dismissed as blue-sky thinking by the Brexit secretary, David Davis. May said there would need to be a “strong commitment” that regulatory standards would remain as high as within the EU – a phrase watered down by Brexit supporters in her cabinet from a binding promise. Overall, she said, the Brexit process would be governed by five tests: “Implementing the decision of the British people; reaching an enduring solution; protecting our security and prosperity; delivering an outcome that is consistent with the kind of country we want to be; and bringing our country together, strengthening the precious union of all our people.” And she set out five foundations: “reciprocal binding commitments” to fair and open competition; an independent arbitration system; ongoing dialogue with the EU; ensuring the EU and UK have the means to consult each other regularly; and arrangements for data protection and links so British and EU workers could travel to each other’s countries within a new system. Guy Verhofstadt, the former prime minister of Belgium who is the European parliament’s Brexit coordinator, said: “Theresa May needed to move beyond vague aspirations – we can only hope that serious proposals have been put in the post. “While I welcome the call for a deep and special partnership, this cannot be achieved by putting a few extra cherries on the Brexit cake.” The director of the Resolution Foundation thinktank, Torsten Bell, said the prime minister was essentially laying out “as soft a Brexit as she can outside the single market and customs union”, but allowing future prime ministers to take a harder stance if they wished. Senior leave campaigners in parliament seemed satisfied with the speech. Iain Duncan Smith, a former Tory leader, described it as “upbeat and clear” and called on the European commission to “stop playing games” and treat Britain as an equal partner. He said the prime minister wanted to secure a special relationship that seemed “reasonably and wholly achievable”. Remainer Nicky Morgan, the Conservative chair of the Treasury select committee, said this was “recognition at last of the complexity involved in Brexit”, including the hard choices ahead and need for compromise. Sam Lowe, a trade expert at the Centre for European Reform, said: “Reality is starting to seep in. It is positive that she has come clean on the fact that we won’t be able to get everything we want. And indeed that there are trade-offs. “It remains a shame that while May has correctly identified that remaining close to the EU is economically in the UK’s best interest, she was seemingly otherwise unable to put forward a palatable [to the EU] means of doing so.” Arlene Foster, leader of the Democratic Unionist party, welcomed the speech, but former remainers were disparaging, with the Labour MP Peter Kyle calling it “meaningless soundbites”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/mar/05/italys-election-poses-more-questions-than-it-answers","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-05T01:01:28Z","webTitle":"Italy's election poses more questions than it answers","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/05/italys-election-poses-more-questions-than-it-answers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/mar/05/italys-election-poses-more-questions-than-it-answers","fields":{"headline":"Italy's election poses more questions than it answers","bodyText":"When Italians wake up on Monday morning it is very likely that they will have no idea who their next prime minister will be, even after every ballot has been counted. While analysts said yesterday they were prepared for surprises, most anticipated that the results would end in deadlock, and set off a period of intense negotiations in Rome that would aim to cobble together a government by the end of March. Sergio Mattarella, the Italian president who is supposed to play a neutral role and must give his blessing to the new government, would lead the talks. Traditionally, a grand coalition – like a forced marriage of rivals – could be brought together relatively easily by joining the country’s two big traditional parties, the centre-left Democratic Party led by Matteo Renzi, and Forza Italia on the right led by Silvio Berlusconi. But those traditional parties are not expected to have enough support on their own to create parliamentary majority, according to early results. Exit polls and early projects on Monday morning revealed that as many as 50% of Italian voters supported populist parties. The Five Star Movement, once laughed off as merely a protest party, is expected to emerge as the single biggest party, with up to 33% of the vote. La Lega, previously known as the Northern League, also appeared to have performed better than expected. Those parties, once seen as fringe movements, will likely have to play a role in whatever coalition is created for the new government in order for it to look reflective of the election results, analysts say. The calculation is complicated in large part because the Five Star Movement has always traditionally said it would not take part in a coalition government.“The biggest question in a deadlock is about the M5S. It’s like a sort of graduation. Do they want to be an isolationist party, or do they want to play a real game and strike a deal?” said Wolfango Piccoli, an analyst. Piccoli believes that while the M5S and La Lega have the most in common since they are both populist and eurosceptic, many M5S voters are politically on the left, and would abhor any move to join forces with Salvini’s party. If there is a deadlock after the election, the next government will have to represent each major national party in order to maintain Italy’s social fabric, said analyst Francesco Galietti. “It is one of the few set-ups that can pacify the country. If we end up seeing low turnout, people voting anti-establishment, it means something has been disrupted,” Galietti said. In that case, the government could be run by technocrats while party leaders stay in parliament, Galietti says. Another option would see the centre-right bloc headed by Berlusconi, which as a coalition is expected to win the most votes, take the lead in negotiations and seek to win over politicians who could join them to get over the finish line. “I am cautious but if the polls are more or less confirmed, then it looks like the centre-right could pull people from other parties and convince them to come on board,” said Giovanni Orsina, a politics professor at Luiss University in Rome. One thing seems evident, Orsina added: “It is not going to be easy.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/mar/03/katarina-johnson-thompson-world-indoors-gold","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-03T22:30:02Z","webTitle":"Katarina Johnson-Thompson believes world indoors gold will banish demons","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/mar/03/katarina-johnson-thompson-world-indoors-gold","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/mar/03/katarina-johnson-thompson-world-indoors-gold","fields":{"headline":"Katarina Johnson-Thompson believes world indoors gold will banish demons","bodyText":"Katarina Johnson-Thompson believes her first world title shows she has mentally toughened up and can put her on the path towards Olympic glory. The 25-year-old has long been the bridesmaid but never the bride in global competition. But her gold medal in the world indoors on Friday has erased many of the mental demons she suffered after falling short at the 2016 Olympics and 2015 and 2017 World Championships. “It’s been a difficult couple of years for me, especially in Rio and in London last year,” said Johnson-Thompson, whose score of 4,750 was 50 clear of the Austrian Ivana Dodic. “While I know Friday wasn’t my best performance, I fought to the end and I’m very proud.” The popular Liverpudlian also admitted for the first time that she has succumbed to pressure in the past. “I knew it was mental in the fact that sometimes in my training I was a lot better than I was in competition,” she said. “And it’s still the case. But it’s about not giving up after one throw, and knowing I can work on this and I can get better. Now I want more. I just want this to be the start.” Johnson-Thompson’s next step will be the Commonwealth Games in April, which is an almost certain gold given the weakness of the field. That will take her into the European Championships in Berlin in August, then next year’s World Championships in Doha and the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo. “Every sports person wants that Olympic title,” she said. “I’ve got two years to get myself up to that standard. I believe in myself. I just need one of those performances where I get it all together and I’m capable of being competitive at the highest level.” Johnson-Thompson believes that her move to France at the end of 2016 had transformed her career. “ At first everything was up in the air,” she said. “I didn’t have a place to live properly for a long time. I was unsettled learning new techniques, not really understanding anything, people talking French, and being completely on my own after being mothered all my life. “But I have really grown up. I also had a full winter of training, building on what I had learned and it has really paid off. I can see a path now.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"environment/2018/apr/04/weatherwatch-march-was-rather-chilly-but-not-a-record-breaker","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-04T20:30:29Z","webTitle":"Weatherwatch: March was rather chilly but not a record-breaker","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/apr/04/weatherwatch-march-was-rather-chilly-but-not-a-record-breaker","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/apr/04/weatherwatch-march-was-rather-chilly-but-not-a-record-breaker","fields":{"headline":"Weatherwatch: March was rather chilly but not a record-breaker","bodyText":"Just as we were getting used to fine warm springs, with bumblebees and butterflies appearing as early as February, spring 2013 managed to surprise us – a bit like this year!

It was initially thought he would not be available until the final weekend of the tournament due to a shoulder injury but he will join the squad on Sunday and will be assessed by England before it is determined whether he is ready for Saturday’s match in Paris. Simmonds is part of a 33-man squad – named a day early by England, who arranged an additional training session at Twickenham on Saturday for 25 players after last week’s camp in Oxford had to be cut short due to the adverse weather. The Exeter back-row, who injured his shoulder in the 12-6 victory over Wales last month and the following week, Eddie Jones said that he “won’t be available for at least the next two matches”. Simmonds has been named on Exeter’s bench for their top of the table Premiership clash with Saracens on Sunday however, and he would not be the first player to return to England duty ahead of schedule. His availability would be a boost for Jones after his eye-catching start to the tournament, scoring two tries against Italy on the opening weekend. He would also bolster Jones’s options in the back row after Nathan Hughes went straight into the side for the 25-13 defeat by Scotland, despite limited game-time following a knee injury. Simmonds is among a raft of players added to last week’s squad, who trained at different camps across the country. The Bath back-row Zach Mercer, Sale’s Denny Solomona and the Saracens fly-half Alex Lozowski have been called up, as well as the Harlequins apprentice players Marcus Smith and Gabriel Ibitoye. Only 25 trained at Twickenham on Saturday with Kyle Sinckler, George Kruis, Charlie Ewels, Lozowski, Solomona, Smith, Mercer and Simmonds all due to arrive on Sunday after their involvement with their clubs in a weekend disrupted by the weather.

Not when our social fabric is in tatters","bodyText":"George Osborne, cheered on by the Institute for Fiscal Studies, basked in self-admiration last week. With a tweet, Osborne joined in celebrations around the elimination of the deficit on Britain’s current budget – used for day-to-day spending on, for example, the NHS, housing, education and local government. The cheerleaders ignored the consequences of that “achievement”, not least of which is the threat to Britain’s economy and social fabric caused by the turmoil of Brexit. The impact of balancing the current budget has fallen most severely on women and low-income groups, as the Women’s Budget Group has shown. They are the nurses, carers, teachers and lecturers who deliver the civilisational services that make our society decent and stable; a place you want to live in. Cuts fell hardest on them, and on those who depend on their services. But there has been another long-term and deeply damaging impact: the decline of Britain’s local democracy and accountability. Osborne, the most political and cynical of chancellors, shifted the worst impact of current budget cuts away from ministers and MPs and on to the shoulders of local politicians in every part of the country. It is doubtful that Britain’s local governments will ever recover. There is growing consensus among economists that Osborne’s post-crisis austerity programme deepened and lengthened Britain’s post-crisis recession, causing public and private investment to fall further and real wages to decline. Making large reductions to government spending is itself a major reason why the economy has been so slow in recovering. (Consider the multiplier effect where an injection of public money helps generate income and tax revenues.) In his first budget (June 2010) Osborne told parliament: “We are on track to have debt falling and a balanced structural current budget by the end of this parliament” (ie March 2015). He slashed welfare as promised, but the economy slowed further. While employment revived, jobs have been recast as part-time, temporary and insecure. As a result, productivity stalled. These declines will cause permanent damage to the British economy. Convinced that a chancellor should “never let a crisis go to waste”, Osborne used the opportunity to shrink the state, as cuts to government spending tore into welfare provision and public services. Real spend per head of population fell, and the real spend per head was particularly felt by the vulnerable citizen, as the population grew older and more fragile. Under his watch, total managed expenditure was cut in real terms by £14bn (2016-17 prices). These cuts were made worse by a 3-4% rise in population, and by the increasing needs of an ageing population. Public sector net investment was allowed to fall from £60bn in 2010 to £35bn in 2016. It caused intense suffering to small and large firms and suppliers, many of which went and are going bust, laying off staff. The insistence on balancing the current budget also hurt millions of individuals innocent of the causes of the crisis. The public anger at the time of the Brexit referendum was palpable. The former chancellor’s tweet, therefore, was nothing if not hubristic. But George Osborne has every reason to be cocky and audacious. Like Ian Dury’s favourite brickie, Tricky Dickie from Billericay, “He’s doing very well”. Thanks to the largesse of a Russian oligarch and ex-KGB agent, he has a platform (and generous salary) at the Evening Standard and has used it to attack the politicians and party that raised him to high office. He’s no slouch, and, in addition to making lucrative speeches, has a second job. For just £13,000 a day, he stands fearlessly between a US global corporation – BlackRock – and Britain’s regulatory democracy. BlackRock manages $5.1trn of savings largely accumulated by, among others, the world’s pensioners or would-be pensioners – and Osborne’s appointment will no doubt help to keep policymakers and regulators at bay. He has form on this count. After the catastrophic economic failure that was the great financial crisis, he protected the City of London from the wrath of the British public and politicians and from the threat of restructuring and reform. He and his allies did this by reframing political debate away from the City’s reckless self-regulation and risky behaviour, and focused attention instead on the public finances – in particular the current budget. These were out of kilter largely because the City makes up the biggest, riskiest and most lightly regulated share of the economy. Osborne was so effective at blaming the Labour party and not the City for the state of the nation’s finances that his permanent secretary to the Treasury, Sir, now Lord, Nicholas Macpherson, was forced into a belated rebuttal in 2015. The financial crisis was “a banking crisis pure and simple” Macpherson had to argue, and was not caused by Labour overspending. Quite so. But Osborne’s ploy worked. By asserting the policy of “monetary radicalism and fiscal conservatism”, Osborne and his colleagues ensured that those responsible for the crisis benefited from the Bank of England’s quantitative easing programme, which inflated asset prices largely owned by the more affluent. Simultaneously, the Conservative government, aided by Orange Book Liberal Democrats like Danny Alexander, used austerity to shift the burden of the financial crisis away from the shoulders of those responsible and on to those least responsible. It is hubristic to celebrate that “achievement”. Nemesis – that dark, punishing female spirit and goddess – is already at work. • Ann Pettifor is director of Prime: Policy Research in Macroeconomics and a fellow of the New Economics Foundation"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"us-news/2018/mar/03/roy-moore-donations-lawsuit-alabama","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-03T14:01:01Z","webTitle":"Beaten Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore asks for money to fight lawsuit","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/mar/03/roy-moore-donations-lawsuit-alabama","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/mar/03/roy-moore-donations-lawsuit-alabama","fields":{"headline":"Beaten Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore asks for money to fight lawsuit","bodyText":"Roy Moore, the former judge who lost a special US Senate election in Alabama in December, is appealing for financial help as he fights a lawsuit brought by a woman who says he molested her when she was 14. A number of women have accused Moore of inappropriate behaviour. The suit brought by Leigh Corfman, who accused Moore of touching her when she was a teenager and he was in his 30s, says he and his campaign defamed her. Moore has denied all allegations. Despite such controversy, Moore was backed by Donald Trump and his former adviser Steve Bannon. He nonetheless lost in a deep-red southern state to the Democratic candidate, Doug Jones, after being abandoned by most senior Republicans. Write-in votes for other candidates – among them Mickey Mouse and Jesus – helped tip the balance against Moore, who initially refused to concede defeat. A Christian conservative hardliner, Moore has said homosexual conduct should be illegal and Muslims should not be allowed to serve in Congress. He has twice been removed from the Alabama state supreme court, first for refusing to remove a monument to the Ten Commandments outside the court building and then for refusing to follow the US supreme court ruling that made same-sex marriage the law of the land. During the campaign, Moore attracted controversy after he told the Guardian “maybe [Russian president Vladimir] Putin is right” to condemn same-sex marriage. In a post to his campaign Facebook page this week, Moore thanked supporters who he said “helped me fight over $50m from Washington insiders who did not want me to bring the truth about God and our constitution to Washington DC”. But, he said, he now faced “another vicious attack from lawyers in Washington DC and San Francisco who have hired one of the biggest firms in Birmingham, Alabama to bring another legal action against me and ensure that I never fight again”. Moore added: “I will trust God that he will allow truth to prevail against the unholy forces of evil behind their attack. “I have lawyers who want to help but they are not without cost and besides their fees, legal expenses could run over $100,000. I have had to establish a legal defense fund, anything you give will be appreciated.” On Saturday morning, a secure donation page had raised a little over $32,000 of a $250,000 target. Moore said: “The liberal media, in association with some who want to destroy our country, do not want my influence in the 2018 elections and are doing everything they can to stop me. “Gays, lesbians, and transgenders have joined forces with those who believe in abortion, sodomy, and destruction of all that we hold dear. Unless we stand together we will lose our country.” Moore laid blame for his defeat by Jones on “the Washington establishment, the Republican party, the Democrat party, the ultra-liberal media and people such as George Soros, Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, and many others who fear the truth.” He added: “My resources have been depleted and I have struggled to make ends meet, but I have not lost my faith in our God, who is our true source of strength and will never leave or forsake us.” In December, an Alabama state board approved an annual pension for Moore of $135,845."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/mar/03/swansea-city-west-ham-premier-league-match-report","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-03T17:17:25Z","webTitle":"Swansea leap out of the relegation zone by thrashing feeble West Ham","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/mar/03/swansea-city-west-ham-premier-league-match-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/mar/03/swansea-city-west-ham-premier-league-match-report","fields":{"headline":"Swansea leap out of the relegation zone by thrashing feeble West Ham","bodyText":"By the end it had turned into an ordeal for just about everyone associated with West Ham United as André Ayew, the player they sold to Swansea City in January, inspired Carlos Carvalhal’s team to an emphatic victory that lifts the Welsh club up five places in the table and above their beleaguered opponents. David Moyes had given the impression the day before the game that he was not overly keen on making the journey to south Wales because of the weather and it looked as though his West Ham players felt the same way. West Ham were awful, totally outplayed in the first half in particular and unable to come to terms with the intensity of Swansea’s approach. André Ayew, almost inevitability, revelled in the occasion. The £18m club-record signing was involved in three of Swansea’s four goals and left the field to a standing ovation when he was withdrawn 12 minutes from time. Ki Sung-yueng, who was outstanding in the centre of midfield, opened the scoring, Mike van der Hoorn added the second and Andy King marked his first Swansea start since joining on loan from Leicester with the third. André Ayew then won the penalty that led to Jordan, his brother, scoring the fourth. Although Michail Antonio pulled a goal back for the visitors 11 minutes from time, that was little consolation for Moyes on a hugely disappointing afternoon for the West Ham manager. This was a second successive 4-1 defeat and leaves his side only three points above the relegation zone. To compound a miserable afternoon for the club, Winston Reid left the pitch on a stretcher with a potentially serious knee injury and David Gold, the club’s co-owner, was confronted by an angry supporter as he tried to leave the Liberty Stadium. “A day of embarrassment,” said Moyes. “It was the worst performance since I’ve been at West Ham. We just never really looked at any time as if we were in control. From a throw-in we lost the first goal – one that I think we should save. We conceded two goals from corner kicks and one from a penalty kick, so from my point of view they were all avoidable. A poor performance and poor all round.” Carvalhal, in contrast, was in buoyant mood on the back of a seventh consecutive home victory. Referencing the need for Swansea to “dance to the music that opponents put to us‚” the Swansea manager described his team’s performance as “rock and roll”‚ and praised the “collective” rather than singling out André Ayew. “It looked like we played with 11 brothers on the pitch instead of two,” Carvalhal said. Swansea got off to a perfect start and, in truth, never looked back. They were ahead within nine minutes after Ki, picking up possession from André Ayew, drilled a low left-footed shot from 22 yards beyond Adrián and into the corner. Although the shot was well-placed, it carried little power and the West Ham goalkeeper should arguably have done better. Carvalhal’s side were denied a second when Declan Rice cleared Federico Fernández’s shot off the line but it was only a temporary reprieve as Swansea continued to pour forward. Adrián repelled André Ayew’s left-footed shot but was powerless to prevent Van der Hoorn from heading in Ki’s corner after Rice allowed the Dutchman to get away from him. Moyes replaced Patrice Evra with Michail Antonio at the start of the second half to try to give West Ham more of an attacking threat, yet it was Swansea who struck again. André Ayew met Sam Clucas’s corner with a twisting header, forcing Adrián into an instinctive save that ended with the ball dropping invitingly for King to stab home. Jordan Ayew’s penalty, after Cheikhou Kouyaté clumsily brought down André Ayew, embellished the scoreline before Antonio drilled a low shot past Lukasz Fabianski late on."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/mar/04/musicals-serial-killers-sheffield-estate-richard-hawley","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-04T00:02:31Z","webTitle":"Make ’em laugh?

Serial killers, suicide and now a Sheffield estate are the grit of musicals","bodyText":"Musical theatre tends to divide public opinion as effectively as the controversial Park Hill estate in Sheffield. Both have admirers who argue for their underrated artistry and equally fervent critics who regard them as an affront to aesthetic sensibility; both have undergone significant reinventions in recent years. So the news that the Sheffield musician Richard Hawley is to create a new musical chronicling 50 years in the life of the estate has been greeted with eager anticipation in some quarters, and raised eyebrows in others. Is the rise and fall and gentrification of a council estate the right material for the heightened and stylised world of a musical? Musical theatre is a strange beast; many people feel passionately averse to it without having seen very much. “I hate musicals,” a friend declared when I suggested going to one at the Edinburgh festival. “Which ones?” I asked. “All of them,” she said, with feeling. For her, as for many musical-intolerant people, the very idea of characters expressing themselves in song, dance and rhyme is the enemy of plausible storytelling. It’s a particular idea of what musicals look like, epitomised by Damien Chazelle’s multi-Oscar-winning 2016 homage La La Land: effete, candy-coloured, heartstring-tugging confections far removed from realism. But this is to miss the quiet revolution taking place in musical theatre in recent years, spearheaded by the extraordinary success of Lin-Manuel Miranda’s Hamilton. By blending hip-hop and show tunes, while examining who gets to write history and whose stories are told, Miranda revitalised and opened up the genre to new audiences in terms of age and background, making musical theatre part of the cultural conversation in ways it hadn’t been for some time. Successful productions on subjects that might once have been supposed “inappropriate” for a medium as light as musical theatre have followed. Alison Bechdel’s Fun Home was originally a graphic novel that told the author’s story of growing up gay in a small-town funeral home with a closeted gay father who committed suicide – not obviously the stuff of song and dance but it was adapted into a Broadway hit. The premise of a feelgood 9/11 musical sounds like “a self-spoofing concept”, as the New York Times wrote of Come From Away, but the Canadian production set in a small Newfoundland town that welcomed 7,000 passengers from stranded planes after the attacks in New York has been hugely popular and transferred to Broadway last year. Closer to home, musical theatre has grappled with grittier political material. The National Theatre’s 2011 production London Road was a musical by Alecky Blythe and Adam Cork about the Ipswich community shaken by the serial murders of sex workers in 2006, later adapted for film by Rufus Norris. Songs were composed around verbatim transcripts of interviews with neighbours of the killer, offering the kind of voices whose stories are rarely told on stage, especially set to music. “I wanted to see if I could make a musical that doesn’t make me cringe the moment they break into song,” Blythe said, echoing the common dread of the form. Since then we have had the “musical tragicomedy” Removal Men at London’s Yard theatre in 2016, set in a detention centre and inspired by the experience of its creator, MJ Harding, of being involved in direct action to prevent the deportation of a woman from Yarl’s Wood. In the same year, the announcement that Daniel York Loh had won the Perfect Pitch award, granting him £12,000 to develop a musical about the drowning of 23 Chinese migrant workers in Morecambe Bay, provoked controversy. The idea was condemned as insensitive and “an insult to the memories of the victims” by locals – although Loh’s intention was to tell the stories of an already marginalised group – and an online petition was set up to have the production banned. Which all leads to the question: who are these musicals for? Norris, Blythe and Cork kept the real residents of London Road involved throughout the development process (some appear as extras in the film version), though they brought in security for the press previews in anticipation of protests, and the show has not had a run in Ipswich. No doubt Hawley’s proposed musical Standing at the Sky’s Edge will also run into objections from Sheffield residents, particularly given that Park Hill generates so much strong feeling in the city. Even now the estate stands as a visual symbol of division, one half expensively redeveloped and no longer principally social housing, the other a brutalist ruin. It will help that the former Pulp guitarist has his roots in the city and that the Sheffield Crucible nurtures close connections with the local community, but it will be a testing exercise in diplomacy, ensuring that those whose stories are being told feel they have been fairly represented and not turned into entertainment for those who can afford the ticket price. Musical theatre is often seen as elitist because of the prices in the West End and Broadway, where top seats can go for three-figures. It’s one thing to expand the range of voices heard on stage, but theatres need to ensure that those being represented are also able to access the experience, otherwise there’s a danger that these stories become voyeurism for the middle class. Musicals are ruinously expensive to stage and the larger venues often can’t afford to take risks on untried work, so it’s all the more important that development support is given to the smaller arts festivals and fringe venues experimenting with new and exciting ideas about what the genre can do, and who it speaks to. Now that is worth making a song and dance about. • Stephanie Merritt is a novelist.

The Department for International Development (DfID) has written to all its contracted private-sector firms, as well as UK and non-UK-based charities, insisting they immediately report any abuse allegations. Last night two big DfID contractors said they were aware of allegations of sexual misconduct or harassment involving their staff over the past three years. A DfID source said the widening of the scope of inquiries reflected the determination of Penny Mordaunt, secretary of state for international development, to “ensure everything is being done to protect people from harm, including sexual exploitation and abuse”. The aid sector is already reeling from allegations that charities including Oxfam, Save the Children and Unicef mishandled claims of sexual misconduct. Oxfam’s work in Haiti was temporarily suspended pending an investigation into how it handled claims of former staff paying for sex. But campaigners have warned that private companies, which are increasingly used to deliver aid and other programmes, should be under equal scrutiny. The amount of DfID aid money paid to contractors has surged from £540m in 2010-11 to £1.34bn in 2015-16. Last year, a report by the international development select committee warned that DfID relied too much on such companies regulating themselves. In her letter to charities and contractors, Mordaunt demands that they “specifically confirm that you have referred any and all concerns your organisation may have on specific cases and individuals to the relevant authorities”. Dyan Mazurana, associate research professor at Tufts University in the US, who has studied the way aid charities tackle sexual abuse between staff members, said there were concerns about some employees of private contractors: “Given that we know there’s a relationship between security providers and people who are harassing and assaulting aid workers, and we know that a lot of the security providers are private contractors, clearly there’s an issue.” Megan Nobert, a human rights lawyer and founder of Report the Abuse, the first organisation to challenge the silence around sexual violence in the aid sector, said: “Vendors and contractors should be held to similar standards as humanitarian organisations, particularly if they are working in or around humanitarian action.” Development Alternatives Incorporated (DAI), a company used by DfID in countries including Nigeria, Ethiopia and Pakistan, said its Europe branch had investigated and reported to DfID a case involving two employees in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The allegations were considered unfounded. Another, Palladium, said it had received allegations of sexual misconduct or sexual harassment and had reported them all to the government or donors involved. Adam Smith International (ASI), which has been embroiled in controversy over its police programmes in Syria, said it was conducting an internal review into historic cases of sexual misconduct. An aid project training a civilian police force in Syria, run by ASI, was suspended last year amid allegations that money was given to jihadists. ASI strongly denied the allegations and the scheme was recently resurrected following a foreign office investigation. Stephen Twigg MP, chair of the international development select committee, said the public had a right to expect the highest standards “whether it comes from a charity, or an individual carrying out work on behalf of a contractor employed by the DfID”. The consulting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers, which led a recent £300m DfID project aimed at improving education for girls, did not comment on the number of cases it has reported. A spokesman said: “DfID has already introduced tough sanctions for human rights abuses including sexual exploitation in all new contracts, and requires all suppliers to have a whistleblowing hotline. Contracts are legally binding and a breach of contract can result in their termination.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/mar/04/the-observer-view-on-theresa-mays-brexit-speech","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-04T00:05:31Z","webTitle":"The Observer view on Theresa May’s Brexit speech | Editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/04/the-observer-view-on-theresa-mays-brexit-speech","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/04/the-observer-view-on-theresa-mays-brexit-speech","fields":{"headline":"The Observer view on Theresa May’s Brexit speech","bodyText":"Be in no doubt. Theresa May’s watershed Brexit speech on Friday was a sobering defeat for the UK. It was a defeat for the Leavers’ vision of a sovereign country freed from the constraints imposed by European politicians, laws and regulations. It was a defeat for those who voted Remain and hoped against hope that Britain would, at the last moment, draw back from this gross act of national self-harm. May’s speech, signalling a fundamental parting of the ways, was a defeat for the business people, trade unionists and community leaders who rightly fear for the country’s future prosperity, cohesion and jobs. It was a defeat for young people, British and European, who, more so than older generations, will perforce inhabit an ugly new world of harder borders, work permits, bureaucracy and pervasive state intrusion. Looked at in a wider context, May’s speech marked a moment of British retreat from the shared ideals and principles of collaborative internationalism that have guided the western democracies since 1945. It presaged a historic abdication of leadership that many in Europe and beyond will neither understand nor quickly forgive. The gaunt post-Brexit future towards which May is stubbornly leading us will make Britain a poorer, meaner, lonelier and shabbier place, hostile to immigrants yet badly in need of their skills, struggling to maintain its trade across the barriers we ourselves erected, and exploited by the world’s big economies whose governments and multinationals, imposing unequal trade treaties, will take what they want and leave the rest. May’s speech was welcomed by hard Tory Brexiters, who imagine that quitting the EU single market and customs union, whatever the consequences, is a sufficient victory for their blinkered, jingoistic cause. It was seen by Tory Remainers as recognition of the need for compromise. And this blurry reconciliation of her party’s schismatic factions, albeit probably temporary, was May’s main achievement. It may be a good deal for the Tories. It is a bad deal for Britain. Bad because, in overall terms, the proposed settlement is neither one thing nor the other. Britain will not have its cake and eat it, in Boris Johnson’s preposterous parlance. It will simply have less cake. May rejected the single market largely because of its freedom-of-movement provisions. Even though employers have been telling her for months that Britain relies on EU workers, the prime minister remains foolishly frit of Daily Mail spectres of invading foreign hordes. Yet even as she rejected it, May recognised the benefits of the single market, sought continued, frictionless, access to it, and lamely admitted that we will all be the poorer for being outside it. What kind of leadership is this? Such self-contradictory thinking would give Descartes a headache. The same applies to her Through the Looking Glass “customs partnership” wheeze that, she said, would “mirror EU requirements”. If she means future customs arrangements will be reversed, back to front and inside out, she may well be right. What a nightmare of red tape is now in prospect from those who promised a liberating bonfire on the cliffs of Dover and will create, instead, a giant lorry-park. Bowing to Brussels, May accepted that post-Brexit Britain would be obliged to observe EU-approved regulatory standards. She agreed with Michel Barnier that competition rules must remain unchanged, to ensure a level playing field. She confessed that, thanks to her, the City of London would lose valuable passporting rights. And she offered to pay cash to stay in selected EU agencies while surrendering any overall say in how the EU is run. May has made previous, reluctant concessions to reality. One is that Britain must pay a large divorce bill fixed by Brussels. Another is that the rights of EU citizens must be upheld during the post-2019 transition. On Friday, her unsustainable position was further exposed to the hard light of day. After all that noisome backbench huffing and puffing about sovereignty and the diktats of foreign judges, May agreed that the European court of justice will continue to have a significant role. Even this prime minister’s special talent for delusional politics cannot conceal the fact that she still has no real clue how to avoid a hard border with the Republic of Ireland. A few cameras and a trusted trader scheme will simply not hack it when the other 27 EU members come to consider their security, migration and trade rules. Nor is there much reason to believe that they will agree a bespoke, pick-and-mix free-trading arrangement that has never been tried and undermines existing practice. Even if they were willing, there is not enough time left before the guillotine falls next March. When May said she wanted to be “straight” with people and that Britain had to face the “hard facts” of Brexit, it seems she was talking first and foremost to herself. For her, finally, it was wake-up time. This sudden dawn of pragmatic realism is welcome. But at this point a basic question becomes unavoidable: what on earth is she trying to achieve? Given the emerging shape of this unfavourable, damaging and overly complex “EU lite” deal, is Brexit, as now envisaged, really worth the trouble? Better, perhaps, to admit we made a mistake in 2016 and humbly ask for time to reconsider."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"film/2018/mar/05/oscars-2018-full-list-of-winners-live","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-05T07:19:14Z","webTitle":"Oscar winners 2018: the full list","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/mar/05/oscars-2018-full-list-of-winners-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/mar/05/oscars-2018-full-list-of-winners-live","fields":{"headline":"Oscar winners 2018: the full list","bodyText":"Best supporting actor Sam Rockwell, Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri – WINNER!

The review raises the possibility that experts conducting it will examine disputed evidence about the cull’s efficacy, potentially paving the way for a change in policy. When the review was announced last month, its terms of reference said it would “not revisit the rationale for current interventions in the strategy. It will take a prospective and not a retrospective view. It is not a review of badger culling.” Rosie Woodroffe, a senior research fellow at the Zoological Society of London, Institute of Zoology, told the Vet Times that the review was “disappointing because its scope excludes badger culling, which is the most controversial and least evidence-led part of the strategy”. The number of badgers culled has risen from 615 animals in 2014 to 19,274 in 2017 as the scheme has been extended. But the number of cows that succumbed to tuberculosis rose from 27,474 to 42,000 as the disease has spread. Launching the review, farming minister George Eustice said early analysis of the first two cull zones suggested that it was reducing the incidence of the disease, a claim disputed by conservationists. Now a spokesman for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) has explicitly confirmed that the badger cull will form part of the review, leading to claims that the government has quietly orchestrated a U-turn. This was denied by the spokesman, who told the Observer: “We have always made clear that this review will consider all areas of our existing bovine TB strategy, including culling.” The badger campaigner, Tom Langton, said the decision to omit the cull from the original scope of the review was proof that Defra had been “running scared of the vet and cattle industry” who believe it is vital for the disease to be eradicated. He called for the terms of reference to be changed so that the review would take both a retrospective and prospective view. “How will the review panel know what to do?” Langton asked. “Is it being asked to ignore crucial aspects of cattle measures and badger killing by ignoring what has gone wrong over the last five years? Is this an attempt to fudge the issue so that the review has no clear remit?”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/mar/04/benjamin-carle-frenchman-sandwich-quest-fulfilment","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-04T00:05:32Z","webTitle":"The sandwich that took 10 months to make (… sow, grow, catch and bake)","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/04/benjamin-carle-frenchman-sandwich-quest-fulfilment","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/mar/04/benjamin-carle-frenchman-sandwich-quest-fulfilment","fields":{"headline":"The sandwich that took 10 months to make (… sow, grow, catch and bake)","bodyText":"If there is an easy way to do something, Benjamin Carle does not do it. So when the Frenchman wanted a sandwich, it was out of the question to buy one from his local boulangerie. Instead, he set out to make one from scratch. From sowing the wheat to produce flour, to baking the bread, to building a vegetable garden on a Paris rooftop and fishing for tuna, to raising chickens for eggs. Ten months later, Carle, 30, had his sandwich, which he insisted tasted all the better for the effort expended to make it. He also claimed the exercise revealed a modern-day existential truth: that the millennial generation is engaged in a desperate search for something to do with their hands. “My girlfriend knits and I saw all around me more and more people who have nice day jobs but spend their evenings doing some kind of manual activity and telling the rest of us about it,” Carle said. “We are all in DIY-mode. It’s as if our intellectual jobs are too abstract and not satisfying enough. People are happier with some kind of material reality.” It is not the first time Carle has made life difficult for himself. In 2013, he set out to live using only French-made products as part of a TV documentary. He was declared 96.9% “made in France” after judges found six Ikea forks, a Chinese-made guitar and wall paint of unknown origin in his Paris apartment. The latest challenge is also the subject of a Canal+ documentary, called Sandwich (or How I Made My Own Snack While Questioning the Manual Capabilities of the French and While Trying to Find Some Personal Pride). In it, we see Carle breaking his back digging a plot to grow wheat, pressing olives for oil and boiling sea water for salt to make a pan bagnat, a speciality sandwich from Nice filled with garlic, olive oil, salt, tomatoes, radishes, spring onions, artichokes, green pepper, tuna, egg and basil. Only a spell on a Basque fishing boat revealed Carle’s limits. Green-faced, he is forced to admit landing a 65kg tuna is a day job “far too complicated for me … and I feel seasick”. Carle believes the mass-produced sandwich, two billion of which are eaten every year in France, is a “symbol of a loss of savoir faire and rampant consumerism”. His generation’s reaction to this was a quest to regain the ability to make things for themselves, he said. In the documentary, Carle speaks to a philosopher, a survivalist, and back-to-nature enthusiasts attempting to reproduce the daily life of prehistoric mankind, including rubbing sticks to make fire. “Work life is less and less satisfying to the point of making us unhappy. It’s almost vital to find something else to do,” Carle said, adding that the increasing distance between the consumer and the point of production had left many frustrated. “The modern world leaves us feeling useless with our hands; we feel a need to do something with them, to get them dirty. It seemed ridiculous to me that I was proud of having planted tomatoes. It’s so much easier to go out and buy whatever we want that the real challenge becomes in actually making it ourselves. I think, in some senses, we are voluntarily going backwards.” Was the sandwich any good? “It was excellent, great,” Carle said. “If I’m being honest, the bread was a bit dry but even if it had been disgusting, I’d have found it absolutely delicious.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/mar/03/football-league-fulham-go-above-derby-after-win-mks-poor-run-goes-on","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-03T17:48:18Z","webTitle":"Football League: Fulham go above Derby after win, MK's poor run goes on","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/mar/03/football-league-fulham-go-above-derby-after-win-mks-poor-run-goes-on","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/mar/03/football-league-fulham-go-above-derby-after-win-mks-poor-run-goes-on","fields":{"headline":"Football League: Fulham go above Derby after win, MK's poor run goes on","bodyText":"Championship Across the country snow was the greatest victor in the Football League as only five games survived in the Championship, three in League One and a mere two in the fourth tier. Derby and Fulham had no problems in making the pitch playable, something the visitors took advantage of as Aleksandar Mitrovic and Ryan Sessegnon scored before the break in their 2-1 victory. It was the Serbian striker’s third goal in as many games, helping his new club leapfrog Derby into fourth place. Tom Huddlestone pulled one back but it was not enough for Derby. Bobby Reid scored a hat-trick, taking his tally to 19 goals for the season, in Bristol City’s 4-0 win over Sheffield Wednesday at Ashton Gate. The striker finished off some precise moves in the first-half to give his side a two-goal lead, before Josh Brownhill angled the ball across the goalkeeper for a third. Reid completed his hat-trick after the break when he converted a penalty after Marlon Pack was fouled. Nottingham Forest had little trouble in beating Birmingham City 2-1, as Joe Lolley set Aitor Karanka’s side on their way when he fired the ball into the bottom corner in the sixth minute. It was not until 11 minutes from time when the lead doubled, as Matty Cash received the ball from Ben Osborn before firing home. Birmingham got a late consolation through Michael Morrison. Preston recovered from going a goal down at Bolton to win 3-1. Mark Beevers scored the opener but Tom Barkhuizen levelled things after the break and two Sean Maguire goals ensured victory. Bryan Oviedo’s stunning strike into the top corner was not enough for Sunderland as they were held 1-1 at Millwall. The Costa Rican put Chris Coleman’s side ahead early on but Shaun Hutchinson forced the ball home after a goalmouth scramble to equalise.

It had been 18 days since Oldham last played a game but they showed no sign of rustiness as they defeated Scunthorpe 2-0 away. Patrick McEleney was attributed a goal on his debut after Jack Byrne’s shot hit him on the back and went in. Eoin Doyle doubled the lead with nine minutes to play, moving Richie Wellens’s team out of the relegation zone. Ellis Harrison’s goal was enough to earn Bristol Rovers a 1-0 win at MK Dons as their woeful form continued, leaving them third from bottom and without a win in 2018.

The parents of winger Kris Twardek who were visiting from Canada helped clear snow from the stands to ensure the game could go ahead. Those were made to the game were treated to goals from Hallam Hope and Mark Ellis. James Collins was the hero and the villain as he gave Luton the lead before was later sent off in their 1-1 draw at Cambridge.

Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein: or the Modern Prometheus was published 200 years ago in 1818, when she was just 21. It was the result of a challenge laid down in 1816 by Lord Byron, when Shelley and her lover – later her husband – Byron’s fellow poet Percy Bysshe Shelley were holidaying at Lake Geneva in Switzerland. The party had hoped for good weather, but the eruption of a volcano in the East Indies in 1815, the greatest event of its kind in recorded history, had ushered in three years of bone-chilling cold that killed crops and cast a shadow across Europe. As they huddled for warmth around a fire one night, Byron suggested each of them should write a horror story. For days Shelley suffered writer’s block until she came up with the idea of a scientist who reanimated a creature stitched together from body parts, only to be horrified by his success. Some believe Shelley was inspired by a trip to Germany, where she is thought to have learned the legend of Frankenstein Castle and one of its 17th-century inhabitants, an alchemist called Johann Conrad Dippel, who was rumoured to have exhumed bodies for experimentation. But it now appears Shelley’s true source of inspiration for Victor Frankenstein’s monster was considerably closer to home. In a foreword to a new edition of the classic, to be published by Oxford University Press next month, Nick Groom, of Exeter University, sometimes referred to as the “Prof of Goth”, suggests it was her husband’s fascination with galvanism – chemically generated electricity – that sparked her imagination. Percy Shelley, one of Britain’s most cherished Romantic poets and author of the celebrated sonnet Ozymandias, was fascinated by science, in particular the creation of electricity. “He was very excited by galvanic apparatus,” Groom explained. “His sister, Helen, would recall that he would, as she put it, ‘practise electricity upon us’. He used to make all the family sit around the dining room table holding hands, and he’d turn up with some brown paper, a bottle and a wire and they’d all get electrocuted.” On one occasion Percy even threatened to electrocute the son of his scout at Oxford University. Mary and Percy enjoyed a symbiotic working relationship. She corrected his proofs and he helped edit Frankenstein. But Groom is clear that the book was, contrary to what some have argued, Mary’s creation. “The work is by her and should be attributed to her.” Sent down in 1811 from Oxford for co-authoring a pamphlet on atheism, Percy attended anatomy classes for a term at St Bartholomew’s hospital in London.. “One of the things she would have got from talking to her husband about laboratories was that they were really filthy places,” Groom said. “The cadavers would be in a state of advanced putrefaction when they arrived. These were not antiseptic places full of chaps in white coats. They were unpleasant. The word filthy turns up a lot in Frankenstein. There was something really disreputable about medical science, which Mary Shelley is fascinated in.” She would have been aware of notorious public experiments involving galvanism. “There was a particularly chilling one in London in 1803 when galvanism was used on the body of an executed criminal,” Groom said. “The very first thing that happened was that the corpse opened its eyes. A very Frankenstein moment.” At the time Mary was writing, the rights of animals had become a concern for many of the intelligentsia. “The being that Victor creates knows he’s not human but still believes that he should have rights,” Groom said. “Part of the conundrum of the novel is, do you afford comparable rights to non-human sentient creatures?” Two centuries on, the novel continues to shape contemporary thinking, Groom suggested, posing questions about matters such as artificial intelligence and genetic modification. But Mary’s astonishing foresight has yet to be fully recognised. “Her reputation has been overtaken by the films, which have oversimplified these questions in ways that don’t really reflect the sophistication of her novel,” Groom said. “Boris Karloff’s monster has none of the subtlety that the being has in the novel. He’s not a zombie, he’s intelligent and sentient. “People need to see this as a novel for today. It’s very much entangled with the pressing questions of humanity, which still concern us.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"politics/2018/mar/03/council-leaders-across-uk-believe-brexit-will-hurt-local-economy","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-03T11:54:41Z","webTitle":"Council leaders across UK believe Brexit will hurt local economies","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/mar/03/council-leaders-across-uk-believe-brexit-will-hurt-local-economy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/mar/03/council-leaders-across-uk-believe-brexit-will-hurt-local-economy","fields":{"headline":"Council leaders across UK believe Brexit will hurt local economies","bodyText":"Council leaders across the UK believe Brexit will damage their local economies, putting them under greater pressure to push up council taxes and cut yet more services. A nationwide survey of all council leaders and local authority chief executives in county, district, unitary and metropolitan and London borough councils found 61% believed Brexit would have a negative or very negative impact on their regions. The survey by the New Local Government Network (NLGN) found only 12% of 185 respondents believed it would have a positive effect on their economies, while 26% felt the impact of leaving the EU would be neutral. It is also uncovered profound dissatisfaction with the level of support and engagement that councils are receiving from central government over Brexit. Only 4% said they were receiving adequate support, while 68% thought it was insufficient. The fact that many of the respondents were from Tory-led councils as well as Labour- and Liberal Democrat-controlled ones, underlines how worries about Brexit – including the loss of £8.4bn of EU regional aid – unites many in control of local government whatever their political persuasion. Conservatives run 71% of all district councils. The response rate to the survey from leaders of all districts to the NLGN survey was 57%. Adam Lent, director of the NLGN, said: “Whatever you think of Brexit, it has to be a concern that the most senior local government figures charged with keeping their local economies buoyant feel so pessimistic. “The government needs to move very rapidly to address this striking loss of confidence by engaging much more closely with council leaders and chief executives as they prepare for the UK’s withdrawal from the EU.” Separate research by the NLGN has shown rising concern among local businesses and in local public services about potential future shortages of workers as a result of changes to immigration rules. There were also worries about the economic effect of a fall in student numbers in universities and colleges. The survey highlighted differences of opinion across the UK. Chief executives and leaders in the south-east, where more people voted to remain than in much of the north, were the least pessimistic about the effects of the UK’s withdrawal, with 48% believing Brexit would have a negative or very negative impact on their local economy. The north-east, however, where theleave vote was above 60% in many areas, proved the most pessimistic with 100% of council chiefs expecting a very negative or negative outcome. While the Conservatives’ 2017 election manifesto included a pledge to create a UK “shared prosperity fund” to replace EU regional aid, little detailed information has been given about how this funding would be allocated. Leaders of the Local Government Association (LGA) have also called for “urgent clarity” over how ministers intend to replace current European Union structural funds. The LGA had said in December that councils were becoming “increasingly concerned”. Councils have suffered cuts to their budgets in excess of 40% since the Tories launched their austerity programme in 2010, leading to savage reductions to a range of services – from social care, to libraries and leisure facilities. Lent added: “Councils continue to face unprecedented financial pressures and growing uncertainty regarding their future funding. Weaker local economies would lead to a lower ability to raise revenue through business rates – something which local services will increasingly come to rely upon. “This means there is a real risk that local taxpayers will be left picking up the bill – either by significant raises to council tax, or the reduction in the services that councils can deliver.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/mar/04/plastic-fashion-houses-catwalk-shows","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-04T00:01:32Z","webTitle":"Plastic is so over.

So why do some fashion houses still treat it as cool?","bodyText":"At the risk of sounding naively optimistic, there have been days when it’s felt like the enthusiasm to push back on avoidable plastic waste is unquenchable. There are moments when it seems possible that we can ward off the day when there are more bits of plastic in the sea than fish – currently slated for 2050 unless we change our ways. Certainly there’s unprecedented interest in uncoupling our lives from plastic. Since the start of the year, I’ve been reporting non-stop on our changing attitudes. I’ve been shuttling between plastic-free aisles and zero-waste shops, assessing supermarket shelves and going through people’s bins. I’m now such a fixture at the nation’s MRFs (materials recovery facility, pronounced “murf”), I’ve been issued with a business card featuring a picture of a rat. This – it was cheerily explained to me – I should hand to my GP in the case of unexplained illness. Obviously we are aeons away from a solution (or even a strategy) in the UK to correct the fact that we’ve been sending off 70% of our plastic waste for mysterious reprocessing overseas for years. Now that China has shut its doors to most of this waste, our plastic addiction and its effects, particularly on the marine environment, have been thrown into sharp relief. Everywhere we’re looking for possible solutions. This week we’ve had an event at Birmingham’s National Exhibition Centre on packaging initiatives (OK, probably one for the enthusiast) and the opening of a zero-packaging aisle in a Dutch supermarket. Still much to discuss; but overall we are in the middle of an epic awakening. But not at Calvin Klein or Chanel. To view their recent catwalk shows, you’d think plastic was the great new hope. These shows were awash with see-through capes and souped-up plastic macs accessorised with cloche hats, all made from the thickest, shiniest plastic that positively oozed fossil fuel. Meanwhile, the cult fashion label Off-White has collaborated with Jimmy Choo on shoes and boots with a crackling plastic outer shell. This is described as a “fresh aesthetic” by the brands in question. But given that almost all the plastic we’ve ever created still exists in unedifying forms, the idea of creating more for use in new applications strikes me as more dumb than fresh. Moreover, those brands who have taken to it seem to have a particular thing for PVC, one of the hardest to handle petroleum-based synthetics of all time. It also suggests a tin ear to trends within the luxury fashion industry and its supply chain. I was tipped off to the plastic fantastic trend by a fashion “influencer” who was aghast that Chanel would show so little responsibility by manufacturing a desire for a demonstrably unsustainable material. Compare and contrast with Gucci, where the brand, partly driven by a younger fanbase known to prize sustainable values, has invested heavily in sustainability and ethics. Possibly I’ve missed the point (always a possibility for those of us who hang around more in MRFs than frows). It has been suggested that plastic fantastic collections are a comment on the forthcoming apocalypse, a sort of reworking of the Hazmat suit. If that is the case, it seems perverse to make that point by using a material that can only contribute to the warned ecological Armageddon. • Lucy Siegle is a journalist who writes about ethical living"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"uk-news/live/2018/mar/03/uk-weather-ice-brings-further-hazards-to-vast-swaths-of-the-uk-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-03T18:03:56Z","webTitle":"Ice brings further hazards to vast swaths of UK - as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/live/2018/mar/03/uk-weather-ice-brings-further-hazards-to-vast-swaths-of-the-uk-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/live/2018/mar/03/uk-weather-ice-brings-further-hazards-to-vast-swaths-of-the-uk-live","fields":{"headline":"Ice brings further hazards to vast swaths of UK - as it happened","bodyText":"Here’s a roundup of all the weather related news today: Police searching for 19-year-old Charlie Pope, who went missing in sub-zero temperatures, have found a body.

The weather is expected to become less cold gradually over the next few days, the Met Office has said. A yellow weather warning remains in place for much of the UK until 11am tomorrow but in some areas in the southwest, the snow has already turned to rain. Temperatures are now a few degrees above freezing, which will mean a slow thaw of the snow over the coming days. Scotland will remain under the influence of the cold easterly airflow and further outbreaks of snow will be possible at times although this won’t be as heavy as in recent days. Met Office Chief Meteorologist, Dan Suri, said: After the severe cold weather and snow we’ve had this week the good news is that temperatures will slowly increase from the south, generally up to around 4 or 5 °C quite widely by the end of the weekend and we could even see up to 9 to 10 °C in southern areas. It will remain coldest in north as well as the east of the UK and over the deepest snow cover. As we head into next week the weather will return to something more typical for the time of year, with any snow showers gradually becoming confined to high ground in northestern Scotland and the Northern Isles. For most of us southwesterly winds will return and we can expect rain at times. An emergency funding scheme has been opened for local authorities in the wake of the severe weather. The Scottish government said it will consider applications for financial assistance through the Bellwin Scheme after Borders council requested help. The discretionary fund is designed to help councils who face an undue financial burden as a result of large-scale emergencies. It was recently activated in the wake of flooding by Storm Frank at the start of 2017, with millions of pounds given to repair damage in the Borders and Aberdeenshire. It is now open for applications from all councils impacted by recent severe weather events, or those at risk from flooding as the snow melts. Finance secretary, Derek Mackay said: We are committed to helping our communities remain resilient and this support will help local councils deal with any immediate and unforeseen costs resulting from the recent heavy snow falls and ongoing cold weather. Although we expect to have seen the worst of the severe weather, we’re aware there remains a flooding risk in some areas as the snow melts. The Scottish government has been holding regular meetings of the Scottish government’s resilience room (SGoRR) to monitor the situation and I would urge people continue to take care and to check for the latest guidance from Police Scotland throughout the day. Cosla president Alison Evison said: Scottish Borders Council requested that the Bellwin scheme be triggered and it is good to see that the Scottish government has responded so quickly and so positively. Financial support for councils who have been worse hit by recent weather events and for those councils who are at most risk from flooding as the snow melts will be crucial, given the challenges already facing council budgets. An independent investigator will carry out a review after frustrated passengers jumped off a stranded train on to the tracks near Lewisham Station, south London, on Friday evening. Southeastern apologised to passengers after the “major disruption” caused by ice affecting the power supply to trains. A Southeastern spokesman said: Southeastern and Network Rail will be appointing an independent investigator to carry out a full review of the events last night. Although events of this nature are extremely rare, we are determined to learn lessons that we can apply at all levels to prevent and mitigate future incidents. We have also informed the independent Rail Accident Investigation Branch of the circumstances and invited them to carry out their own investigation. We also want to hear from passengers who were on the stranded trains last night, we ask that they get in touch with us by contacting our customer services. We will be providing compensation for those people directly affected on those trains. Impressive show of strength by this group who managed to push an Asda truck up a hill in Birmingham last night. The A46 is still partly closed according to Highways England. But the A303 has been re-opened. Sixteen couples managed to tie the knot in Somerset on Friday and Saturday despite the county being blanketed in snow. Eleven other weddings were cancelled but only at the request of the couples involved, according to Somerset County Council. A volunteer driver and a family friend of a staff member used their 4x4 vehicles to transport ceremony officers around to each venue to ensure the services could go ahead. On Saturday, Michael Barker and Nathan Wilder had a white wedding at Taunton’s Municipal Buildings thanks to two registrars who lived nearby and came in on their days off when the original staff could not make it to work. Councillor Anna Groskop, who is cabinet member for corporate and community services at the council, which covers the registration service, said: The registration team have worked incredibly hard and showed great ingenuity throughout to ensure that we didn’t disappoint happy couples despite the extremely difficult conditions. We did expect the worst, so this is a wonderful result. Eight men arrested after two supermarkets were looted in Dublin during Friday’s blizzards have been charged with theft, burglary and trespassing offences, Irish Police have said. The defendants, aged between 24 and 47 years, were due to appear in court on Saturday morning. A number of vehicles were also reported stolen. A ninth man, in his 30s, has been arrested for handling stolen property. Unverified social media footage appeared to show a Lidl store being attacked with a digger before the alleged looters entered. Irish police said the store had sustained substantial damage, while another store had also been damaged. They urged anyone with information to come forward. National Rail have been tweeting some updates about lines. Northern Powergrid has said it hopes to restore power to everyone this afternoon.

In a bid to ensure kids can return to class on Monday, parents and teachers are grouping together to clear snow from school. 100 volunteers turned up to Kinnaird Primary School in Larbert today, after an appeal was put out by the school on social media. Armed with shovels and spades, parents, children and teachers worked to ensure the school is safe to reopen after three days of weather-enforced closure last week. Many local authorities announced last Tuesday that schools would be closed ahead of the weather warnings, with others following suit on Wednesday morning when conditions worsened. Most hope to reopen on Monday. Kinnaird deputy head teacher Laura Swan joked: “I think there’s an element of parents being desperate to get the kids back out the house but it’s also the reality that the school wouldn’t be able to open without this so they’re just pulling together.” Other schools around the country are doing likewise with Abbeyhill Primary in Edinburgh organising a “snow clearing party” for Sunday. A Twitter post said: “Come dressed to impress in your warmest winter clothes and we really could make a difference for Monday morning. Bring a flask of something hot and we will provide some snacks.” Avon and Somerset police dogs are having fun. Greater Manchester Police say the A640 in Denshaw remains closed but all other road closures in the Oldham and Rochdale areas have been lifted. Assistant Chief Constable Rob Potts said: This truly has been a team effort from start to finish and we have been working closely alongside colleagues from the fire and ambulance services, mountain rescue, Highways England, multiple local authorities, the military, other police forces and volunteers. I would like to thank the public for their patience and understanding whilst rescue efforts have been carried out. Their support has been fantastic and we have even had some very thoughtful people coming out to provide hot refreshments to officers working on the ground. He said although the roads were starting to clear of snow in some areas, they were still experiencing very cold and icy conditions, “so I would continue to encourage people to please plan your journeys ahead of time and drive carefully.” Here’s a travel update from Great Western Railway. Many lines remain suspended. Dont try this at home: The British Transport Police has urged people not to leave trains if they become stranded or delayed. A statement said This week we have seen a number of incidents of people self-evacuating from trains stranded due to the exceptional weather. Whilst we totally understand it isn’t pleasant being trapped on a train, you are far safer on board. Self-evacuating from trains is never a good idea as it places you and others at significant risk. You are risking your life trespassing on live tracks. Further delays are also inevitable if people self-evacuate as power has to be turned off for safety reasons. Royal Berkshire Fire and Rescue Service have issued advice for residents in the event of emergency flooding. The force said it responded to a number of incidents caused by frozen pipes bursting. Cumbria police have issued some travel advice: An elderly couple and their two dogs have been dug out of their house in southern Scotland after becoming trapped by 12ft (3.6m) snow drifts around the property. Two police officers and a mountain rescue team managed to dig them out of the secluded farm house near West Linton after they called for help on Friday afternoon. The couple, aged 70 and 71, had run out of firewood for heating and were cut off from their coal shed by the time they were freed. They were found to be in good health and were taken to stay with a friend, along with the two dogs. Dave Wright, from Tweed Valley Mountain Rescue, said: They were perfectly alright when we got them out the house, they were a little bit surprised by how the situation escalated so quickly and I don’t think they had experienced anything like that before, but this type of weather hasn’t been seen for quite some time. We’re obviously used to working in the mountains and hills, but we haven’t seen conditions like this at ground level for a long time, it trumps 2010 and 2001 for the level of snow depth and how the drifts have been piling up. Snow will continue to fall this afternoon but southern England is starting to see rain showers. The West Coast Main Line between Glasgow and Carlisle will re-open this afternoon, Network Rail Scotland has said. The East Coast Main Line between Edinburgh and Newcastle is also open. South Western has said there will be no trains between Southampton and Weymouth on Saturday. A full list of lines is available on the company’s website. A disabled woman who took refuge from the icy conditions in a chemist after her electric wheelchair broke down has been rescued by a fire crew. Fire fighters from South Yorkshire Fire and Rescue put a blanket on the “freezing” woman, who was not wearing a coat, before driving her home after she became stranded in Moorends, Doncaster. It took three fire fighters almost half an hour to push the heavy eight-battery chair a quarter of a mile through ice and snow to her home. Daz Robertson, who drove her back, said the woman had been out doing some errands, but could not use her keys to get into the house when she returned because her fingers were too cold. She went out on the chair to seek help, which was when the batteries went flat and she was taken in by a chemist, which stayed open late to look after her as darkness fell. Gov.uk has issued flood warnings for 14 areas in the UK including parts of Cornwall, Devon and Sunderland. This means there is no danger to life but immediate action is required. There are also flood alerts in place for 32 areas, meaning be prepared. Police searching for 19-year-old Charlie Pope, who went missing in sub-zero temperatures, have found a body. Pope, from West Didsbury, was last seen in Manchester city centre early on Thursday more than two hours after leaving a club. He had left the Zombie Shack in New Wakefield Street at about 2.30am and was later spotted in Whitworth Street at 4.50am. On Friday, an underwater search team was deployed at the canal just off Whitworth Street West and shortly after 3.40pm a body was discovered. A spokesman for Greater Manchester Police said Although formal ID is yet to take place, it is believed to be Charlie Pope. His family have been informed and are being provided with support from specially trained officers at this tragic time. There are believed to be no suspicious circumstances surrounding the death and a file will be passed to the coroner. An emergency funding scheme has been opened for local authorities in the wake of the Beast from the East, the Press Association reports. The Scottish government said it will consider applications for financial assistance through the Bellwin Scheme after Borders Council requested help. The discretionary fun, designed to help councils who face an undue financial burden as a result of large-scale emergencies, is open for applications from all councils impacted by recent severe weather events, or those at risk from flooding as the snow melts. The Dawlish line has partially re-opened. Northumbria Police have said the A1 is now open. Further south, the Highways Agency said the A66 cross-Pennine route remained shut between the A1M at Scotch Corner to the A685 at Brough. Airports are warning passengers to check the status of their flight with their airline. More than 1,250 flights were cancelled across the UK and Ireland on Friday. Most airports, including Edinburgh and Glasgow, are open for “business as usual” on Saturday, for some delays and cancellations still remain. The rail line at Dawlish, Devon, has been closed due to flooding caused by high tides. ScotRail is urging travellers to check journey times as network is facing challenges due to the freezing temperatures. In a series of tweets, it said that snow was drifting on to tracks because of high winds of up to 40mph. Met Office forecasters said temperatures could climb to as high as 7C for parts of Wales and the South West on Saturday, with rain replacing the snow that has blighted Britain for much of the past week. But they warned that as rain begins to fall on snow-covered roads, the potential for ice to form could bring further hazards. A yellow weather warning for ice is in place for much of England until 11am, while snow is still possible for Scotland and North East England, with a warning in force until midnight. Northern parts of the UK saw more snow overnight, with a further 5cm likely to fall by the end of the day. Met Office forecaster Greg Dewhurst said: It won’t feel quite as cold compared to what we’ve seen previously, but the potential for ice could mean roads are very slippery. Overnight, the M62 in Greater Manchester finally reopened after being closed for more than a day. Hundreds of motorists had spent Thursday night trapped in their cars when heavy snowfall and high winds left the road impassable. Some roads remain closed on Saturday as authorities work to clear snow, while flights and trains continue to be affected. However, many transport services are beginning to get back to normal. The UK is counting the cost of extraordinary blizzards that have brought parts of the country to a standstill, leaving death and destruction and bringing misery to tens of thousands of travellers. Forecasters have warned that, as rain begins to fall on snow-covered roads, the potential for ice to form could bring further hazards. A yellow weather warning for ice is in place for much of England until 11am, while snow is still possible for Scotland and north-east England, with a warning in force until midnight. Northern parts of the UK saw more snow overnight, with a further 5cm likely to fall by the end of the day. As the weather starts to ease, local authorities and the government, emergency services, transport companies, retailers, motorists and householders will face hefty bills to restore normality after the dramatic snowfall and gales. Major incidents were declared in Wiltshire, Avon and Somerset, Devon, Cornwall and Hampshire after many hundreds of drivers were stranded in their vehicles. Two more deaths were recorded on Friday, taking the death toll in weather-related incidents to 10. We’ll be posting all of today’s key developments on this liveblog.

This year, Griff – who spent the afternoon in Surry Hills making a giant silver shoe – heard somebody was going to get married at Taylor Square. A lot can happen in a year. But this is just one reason why, for the thousands of people gathering today at the foot of Oxford Street for the 2018 Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras, this year will be special. It is of course also the 40th anniversary of the inaugural march: a night of protest by more than a thousand people along Oxford Street’s bars and clubs that ended with its leaders arrested and brutalised by police. This time around, the Mardi Gras is expected to be one of the biggest yet. For the first time, organisers have placed a limit on the number of floats – 200 floats and 12,000 people – from the 300 applications. They’re also expecting a record half a million attendees. The 78ers – those original marchers – will have the biggest float, 250-strong. For many, the confluence of this historic anniversary and last year’s landmark marriage equality win has made this a particularly special year. Griff, with fellow organiser Mick and float leader Teresa, have spent the day on a side-street in Surry Hills attaching wings to a big shoe for their Evolution Dancers and Divas float. Their float is a musical tribute to the four decades of queer music since the ‘78 march. “We’re tipping our hat to all the venues that have closed, to remind ourselves of what Oxford street culture used to be like,” Teresa said. They have been told that they have the original movie shoe from Priscilla: Queen of the Desert. They’ll be attaching three-metre wings and will have 80 dancers behind it dressed as Madonna and George Michael dancing to Tina Turner, Ce Ce Peniston and Kylie Minogue. All three think this year’s event will have added significance. “It’s going to mean a lot more to people,” said Griff. “This event is never going to happen again, when it’s the 40th anniversary as well as the first Mardi Gras where people can actually get married.” Mick added: “It’s always a celebration, but on top of that, you’re celebrating same sex marriage. It’s exponential celebration.” As part of the festivities, Sydney’s lockout laws have been lifted for tonight, and Cher is headlining the afterparty. Speaking on Saturday morning to the ABC, director Greg Clarke even hinted that she would make a surprise appearance at the march. He also had to face questions about the increasingly corporate nature of the event, which some participants blamed for this year’s cap on floats. “I don’t think it is [fair criticism],” he said. “There are 200 floats and probably nine corporate floats.” In the lead-up, local independent MP Alex Greenwich and others, have kept up the pressure in targeting the next steps in Australian LGBTI rights. “There is more work to be done,” he wrote on Wednesday. “Transgender Australians were disgracefully targeted by the no side in the postal survey and deserve our community advocacy.” Teresa said the memory of that “brutal” postal survey would bring out members of the queer community who otherwise think Mardi Gras isn’t for them. “It’s 40 years on, and everyone fought so hard I think the community will come out, even if its not their thing, just to finally have something to celebrate. Like the cherry on top.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2018/mar/04/opera-female-singers-tenor-roles-cross-gender","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-04T00:05:33Z","webTitle":"A woman’s place … is in the tenors: female singers revel in opera’s looser gender divide","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/mar/04/opera-female-singers-tenor-roles-cross-gender","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/mar/04/opera-female-singers-tenor-roles-cross-gender","fields":{"headline":"A woman’s place … is in the tenors: female singers revel in opera’s looser gender divide","bodyText":"In the world of opera, the question “who wears the trousers?” has suddenly become harder to answer. Looser gender divisions in casting, and a new understanding of the effect of changing hormones on the voice, mean that – for divas in particular – the future looks much brighter. Who is to say only a man should ever sing Puccini’s Nessun Dorma? If a female singer’s vocal range dips with motherhood or age, she can simply switch to a lower voice, such as tenor. And, says Ash Khandekar, editor of the magazine Opera Now, switching categories across gender divides is becoming more acceptable. Women with lower – mezzo-soprano or contralto – voices have always been cast in the cross-gender “breeches” roles of the popular opera repertoire, parts such as Cherubino in Mozart’s The Marriage of Figaro or Octavian in Richard Strauss’s Der Rosenkavalier. But now female singers in professional companies, as well as in amateur operatic societies and choirs, are taking advantage of the end of traditional boundaries to call for women to have the opportunity of lengthening their performing careers. “It would be wonderful to see a relaxing of the rules,” said Lucy Crowe, a soubrette soprano (traditionally with a light, bright voice), this weekend, as she rehearsed for this month’s new English National Opera production of Figaro. “Certainly having children has made a huge difference to me vocally.” Although Crowe, 39, is unlikely ever to find her voice goes low enough for tenor parts, she is now graduating for the first time to roles such as the more powerful soprano Countess Rosina. “My voice was always quite light, but having children has certainly changed it and made it stronger,” she said. “I find it incredibly exciting that I can now sing a wider range of repertoire. I still do Handel and Purcell, but I can sing more of the dramatic repertoire as well. I am loving the journey.” The practice of switching roles across gender divides was first seen in church and amateur choirs, where there is frequently a dearth of male tenors. In the US, writer and amateur singer Roberta Hershenson “came out” several years ago as a woman who enjoys singing tenor roles: “There are at least 10 female tenors in the 200-member chorus I belong to, and most sing as well as the men,” she wrote in the New York Times. “Ballast is why some conductors -- although by no means all -- admit women into their tenor sections. It helps when the men don’t show up.” Meanwhile, the Glyndebourne Academy in Sussex has just helped train the rapidly changing voice of a talented trans singer, Holden Madagame, a 27-year-old Native American. The academy, which seeks out voices that have had difficult routes to the stage, developed Madagame’s new vocal register, which moved from mezzo-soprano to the tenor range, as he moved away from his female birth designation. “My voice has settled more and more with every month and year – and I know it’s simply that the voice needs time to stretch and acclimate itself to my new body and new vocal folds,” he said last autumn.So, just as Michelle Fairley is currently playing the treacherous Roman senator Cassius in Julius Caesar at London’s Bridge Theatre and Tamsin Greig won acclaim for playing the conventionally male comic role of Malvolio in Twelfth Night at the National Theatre last year, so female singers with dark notes to their voices are asking to be considered one day for lead roles such as Rodolfo in La Bohème, or Alfredo in La Traviata. Like Crowe, women singers are beginning to welcome alterations to their vocal range that can come with pregnancy, or as a natural part of the ageing process. Soprano Rhian Lois – who, as the maid Susanna, will join Crowe on stage to perform Sull’aria, the Figaro duet that features in the film The Shawshank Redemption – also experienced voice changes during and after her recent pregnancy. “You really do need to let the change happen. Allow it. And it is great if that is more acceptable now,” said Lois, 31. “Every singer is different. When I was a teenager I actually sang quite low, but then I became a soprano, and since I had a baby last year my voice is actually both higher and stronger. It may even be partly a question of stamina.” Opera voices are traditionally classified on the Fach system. A contralto’s vocal range is almost identical to that of a countertenor, while a woman who sings lower still might be called contralto profundo, equivalent to a male tenor, or even contralto basso, equivalent to a baritone, but all these distinctions are full of variation. “It would be interesting to know how much vocal change is down to hormones or physical change, and how much is psychological,” said Crowe. “There is a greater confidence and loss of inhibitions that can come with becoming a mother, after all – and with ageing, too.” •This article was amended on 5 March to correct spellings of two opera roles: Countess Rosina, and Rodolfo."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"politics/2018/mar/05/scottish-government-urged-to-use-devolved-powers-on-child-poverty-top-up-universal-credit","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-05T00:01:08Z","webTitle":"Scottish government urged to use devolved powers on child poverty","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/mar/05/scottish-government-urged-to-use-devolved-powers-on-child-poverty-top-up-universal-credit","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/mar/05/scottish-government-urged-to-use-devolved-powers-on-child-poverty-top-up-universal-credit","fields":{"headline":"Scottish government urged to use devolved powers on child poverty","bodyText":"The Scottish government is coming under pressure to commit to using its newly devolved powers to top up benefits in order to meet its child poverty targets. Last November, Holyrood passed Scotland’s first child poverty bill, which reintroduced the statutory targets abolished by the UK government a year earlier. The four goals, which include reducing relative poverty from 26% to 10% of children and absolute poverty from 21% to 5% of children, must be met by 2030. But anti-poverty campaigners, supported by research from the cross-party thinktank IPPR Scotland, argue that using the new powers to top up existing benefits, part of an extensive package of welfare devolution going through the Scottish parliament, is the simplest and most effective way of meeting those targets. According to the IPPR Scotland report, which modelled the effects of topping-up the child element of universal credit for the next financial year, a top-up of £50 a month could bring 45,000 children out of relative poverty, at a cost of £390m a year, reducing child poverty in Scotland by just under a fifthThe number of children could increase to 100,000 with a top-up of £150 a month, at a cost of £950m a year, reducing relative child poverty rates in Scotland from 26% to 19%. The Institute for Fiscal Studies has forecast that relative child poverty rates in Scotland could reach 29% by 2021-22 because of slowing economic growth and continued austerity. Russell Gunson, the director of IPPR Scotland, said: “Compared with topping up child benefit, or other existing benefits, our analysis found that topping up the child element of universal credit in Scotland was most effective at tackling relative child poverty. “Using Scotland’s new powers to top up benefits may not be as difficult as creating whole new benefits, and it’s clear that we need some really ambitious action to meet these targets, from government, business and others. We’re keen for us not just to have world-leading targets on reducing child poverty but also world-leading progress.” John Dickie of the child poverty campaign group CPAG Scotland welcomed the findings, saying: “Today sees yet more independent analysis setting out the urgency of using Holyrood ‘top-up’ powers to boost family incomes as part of wider action to end child poverty.” CPAG has made the case for an immediate £5 top-up for child benefit. “What is absolutely clear is that doing nothing is not an option. Ministers must now choose how, not if, to use new social security powers to help end child poverty,” it said. The Scottish government will bring its action plan for meeting the 2030 targets before MSPs by the end of this month. At the most recent meeting of the social security committee, the Scottish government rejected an amendment supported by Labour and the Scottish Greens to write the £5 child benefit increase into the framework bill for the new powers, arguing that enabling legislation was not the appropriate place for such a change. Jeane Freeman, the social security minister, said: “There can be little doubt that using resources in a way that delivers relatively small impacts on child poverty is not the most effective targeted action to take. So it is clear that, whilst a universal £5 top up to child benefit is not a bad idea it is not the best idea.” The Scottish government’s independent poverty andinequality commission published its own advice on meeting the 2030 targets last week, suggesting that social security powers are one of the key levers that will need to be used. While the commission did not recommend topping up a specific benefit, it did note analysis which suggested that topping up the child element of universal credit, combined with removing the two-child limit and removing the benefit cap, is “potentially the most cost-effective way of reducing child poverty”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2018/mar/03/vietnamese-refugees-immigration-us-detention","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-03T12:00:16Z","webTitle":"Detained and divided: how the US turned on Vietnamese refugees","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/mar/03/vietnamese-refugees-immigration-us-detention","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/mar/03/vietnamese-refugees-immigration-us-detention","fields":{"headline":"Detained and divided: how the US turned on Vietnamese refugees","bodyText":"Five-month-old Chari Nguyen banged on the thick plexiglass window and cried. On the other end, her father, Dy, opened his arms and tried to calm her, repeating “Come to daddy” and “Daddy loves you”. The 31-year-old father pressed his hands to the visitation room window at Stewart detention center, in a remote part of Georgia, getting as close as he could to his baby, who could barely hear his voice. “She wants him to hold her, and all they can do is touch each other through the glass,” recalled Tammy Nguyen, Chari’s mother, who drove three hours that day in November to visit her incarcerated husband. “I keep trying to put Chari’s hand to where his hand was so he could feel connected to her.” Four months later, Dy remains jailed with no end in sight. He is one of thousands of Vietnamese Americans now at risk of deportation as Donald Trump’s administration aggressively targets immigrant communities that had previously been protected. Asian Americans Advancing Justice, a group representing Dy in court, has filed a class-action lawsuit against the US government challenging the continuing detention of Vietnamese refugees who fled war, violence, communist “re-education camps” and other forms of political persecution and are now threatened with removal to a country many of them barely know. In March 2017, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) reversed a longstanding practice and began subjecting Vietnamese refugees to lengthy periods of detention under the threat of deportation, despite an agreement between the US and Vietnam that shields this population, the suit said. “The change in policy has been so abrupt and has really pulled the rug out from under a lot of these communities,” said Phi Nguyen, litigation director at Advancing Justice-Atlanta. “These are people who really left everything behind, really risked their lives to come over here. They did it because they wanted freedom, and they wanted to be treated right by their government.” The lawsuit has shone a harsh light on the government’s attack on an immigrant group that has received little attention as Ice has ramped up raids and escalated deportation efforts that were already expansive under Barack Obama. Under a humanitarian agreement between the two countries, Vietnamese American refugees cannot be deported back to Vietnam if they entered the US before 1995, the year the two governments established diplomatic relations. Before Trump, that meant when the refugees, who became lawful permanent residents, faced deportation orders due to criminal convictions, Ice would not remove them or detain them indefinitely – it would instead release them under orders of supervision, the suit said. The class-action suit seeks to represent all Vietnamese nationals who arrived pre-1995, are facing deportation and have been detained by Ice for more than 90 days. Attorneys are aware of nearly 40 refugees in that category, and about half of them have been detained for more than six months, the complaint said. An Ice spokesman, Brendan Raedy, declined to comment on the lawsuit but told the Guardian that more than 8,600 Vietnamese nationals were currently subject to a “final” deportation order, and that more than 7,800 of them had criminal convictions. “You cannot treat people like this,” said Lisa Dotson, sister of Hoang Trinh, a 41-year-old plaintiff who entered the US as a refugee at the age of four in 1980 and has been detained since last summer. “Tearing families apart and taking away members of the family, especially a father, it’s very hard. This doesn’t do any good for anybody.” Trinh, whose family built a neighborhood bakery in California after fleeing Vietnam, is married with two teenage children and has no family in Vietnam. He is facing deportation due to a drug charge for which he served one year in prison, according to the suit. Trinh has told his sister and attorney that he has been locked in a small cell for 23 hours a day, which has taken a toll on him: “You’re going to end up crazy if you stay there long enough,” said Dotson, 39, adding: “He’s missed a lot of big milestones. He missed his daughter’s graduation from high school.” It was terrifying to think about what would happen if he were ultimately deported, the sister said: “I don’t know how the government in Vietnam would treat people like him.” Dy Nguyen, who was working as a technician installing security systems when he was detained, fled Vietnam when he was three years old. His wife, Tammy, said three Ice agents had showed up to their Georgia home in November and initially made it seem as if they were taking him in for a minor paperwork issue. The officers asked Tammy to get her husband a pair of socks and other belongings and told Dy, who was holding his daughter, to hand the baby to his wife, she recalled. Tammy said she was shaking as she held Chari while Ice took her husband away. Dy is facing detention and deportation due to a 2010 burglary conviction. Tammy noted that he has already served his time and has since turned his life around – becoming active in church and youth groups and giving talks about his criminal past to help others learn from his mistake. “Everybody deserves a second chance,” said Tammy, a 31-year-old medical assistant who came to the US from Vietnam when she was seven years old. “He’s a completely different man.” She said she could not fathom a life for them in Vietnam: “Honestly, I think it would be a death sentence if he gets deported. We would have no way of living our lives.” Raedy, the Ice spokesman, did not respond to questions about the specific cases, but he noted that Ice deported 71 Vietnamese nationals in 2017, double the number deported in 2016. Ice has transferred Dy to a detention center even further away from his wife and daughter, who can no longer visit him in person. Now, they do video calls, which have become increasingly common in US jails and prisons. Chari crawls to the computer when she hears her father’s voice and bangs on the keyboard: “She gets very excited every time she sees her dad.” She doesn’t cry like she did inside the detention center. Chari, now nine months old, has gotten used to seeing her father on a screen."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/mar/04/fake-homeless-vigilante-ashley-sims-torquay","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-04T00:01:32Z","webTitle":"Outing of Torbay’s ‘fake’ homeless is a new low for DIY vigilantes | Lucy Siegle","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/04/fake-homeless-vigilante-ashley-sims-torquay","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/04/fake-homeless-vigilante-ashley-sims-torquay","fields":{"headline":"Outing of Torbay’s ‘fake’ homeless is a new low for DIY vigilantes","bodyText":"I feel duty bound to defend Torquay. Its charms are misunderstood and I have links. I once even worked in the English Riviera centre – the essence of the bay distilled into a municipal sports complex. But defending Torquay is getting tough. First there was Torquay-born Georgia “Toff” Toffolo, the Made in Chelsea alumna. Her less objectionable utterances include the assertion that Jacob Rees-Mogg is a sex god. Now we have the “millionaire businessman” (a description that still carries peculiar cachet in Torquay) Ashley Sims. He’s taken it upon himself to weed out the town’s “fake homeless”. His style is to photograph rough sleepers and beggars in the town, threatening to expose those he deems “fake” on social media unless they leave. While he sees his service as invaluable, the local police do not. “The dangerous practice of ‘outing’ people as professional criminals, based on often unverifiable information, fails to acknowledge the very complex vulnerabilities and chaotic lives of those concerned,” said Torbay police. A local newspaper columnist who accompanied Sims on one of his sorties said the vigilante reminded him of the child catcher in Chitty Chitty Bang Bang. Still, Sims elected to give his regional campaign a nationwide airing last week, appearing on This Morning. In Devon he went down like a tonne of penguin guano. While he was pontificating on Holly and Phil’s sofa, Torbay stared down an impending red weather warning and the area’s dedicated rough-sleeper charities scrambled to try to protect the community’s most vulnerable, the very ones that Sims likes to photograph. • Lucy Siegle is a journalist who writes about ethical living"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"sport/2018/mar/03/saracens-exeter-premiership-preview","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-03T22:00:01Z","webTitle":"Saracens head to Exeter with more than just revenge on their minds","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/mar/03/saracens-exeter-premiership-preview","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/mar/03/saracens-exeter-premiership-preview","fields":{"headline":"Saracens head to Exeter with more than just revenge on their minds","bodyText":"For Jackson Wray and his Saracens team-mates, Sunday’s trip to Exeter could be viewed as an opportunity for payback against the team that knocked them out in May’s play-off semi-finals with a last-minute try. But after last Sunday’s 28-20 defeat by Leicester at Allianz Park, the team’s focus is more in the moment. “We were not on it as we usually are, for some reason,” the No 8 says. “The emphasis in the week was not on technical stuff but making sure we deliver the performance we need. “What happened in the semi-final has not been discussed. It was a long time ago and both teams are different. We are coming to the end of a run of four Premiership matches before a break for the Anglo-Welsh Cup and we want to go into it on a high.” Should Saracens lose to the leaders at a sell-out Sandy Park on Sunday, they will concede only a third Premiership double this decade, following November’s 20-18 defeat at Allianz Park. Exeter were the last club to achieve the double over Saracens in the regular season back in 2014-15, one month after Northampton achieved the feat. The champions have not had things all their own way recently: the Chiefs ended a run of three league defeats last Saturday only by pipping Northampton with Thomas Waldrom’s last-minute try. The top three clubs have all lost five matches in 16 rounds and whoever finishes first is on course to equal Gloucester’s record of most defeats for a side finishing top at the end of the regular season, seven in 2007‑08. Every team has suffered a blip in a race for the congested play-off positions. “The standard in the Premiership is very high,” Wray says. “In the past you could be off your game and still win but that is no longer the case. London Irish and Worcester may be at the bottom of the table but they can cause you problems. “It shows how competitive it is and every team has suffered a blip at some point in the season. It is always a challenge when the international players are away and we have suffered badly from injuries this season, but we back ourselves every week to get a result and it will be no different on Sunday. “I enjoy playing at Sandy Park. There is always a good atmosphere and you know you have to be at your best to get anything out of the game. The fact they are going for the double over us does not change anything. It is not about revenge but putting right what went wrong against Leicester.”With six league matches left before the play-offs and a Champions Cup quarter-final against Leinster to come, victory over Exeter would leave Saracens well placed when their international players return. “The big games will be flying around,” Wray says. “Every one is crucial now. There are times this season when we have been very good and that is the form we have to find in the run-in.The returning players will give us a boost but we have to make sure they are really excited when they get back to the club.” Wray has been a mainstay of Saracens this season, appearing in every league match except one. “I have played a lot but at this club it is all about getting better,” he says. “You never stop learning.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2018/mar/02/berta-caceres-death-murder-ex-honduran-military-intelligence-officer-arrested","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-02T20:40:41Z","webTitle":"Berta Cáceres murder: ex-Honduran military intelligence officer arrested","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/02/berta-caceres-death-murder-ex-honduran-military-intelligence-officer-arrested","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/mar/02/berta-caceres-death-murder-ex-honduran-military-intelligence-officer-arrested","fields":{"headline":"Berta Cáceres murder: ex-Honduran military intelligence officer arrested","bodyText":"Honduran authorities have arrested a former military intelligence officer for masterminding the murder of the indigenous leader Berta Cáceres, who was shot dead exactly two years ago today. David Castillo Mejía, the executive president of the company building a dam which Cáceres campaigned against, is the ninth person arrested for the murder, and the fourth with ties to the Honduran military. Castillo Mejía is accused by arresting authorities of providing logistical support and other resources to one of the hitmen already charged. He is the first person to be charged as being the “intellectual author” of Cáceres’s murder and the attempted murder of Mexican environmentalist Gustavo Castro. Cáceres was shot in her bedroom just before midnight on 2 March 2016, a year after winning the prestigious Goldman Prize for leading a campaign against the Agua Zarca dam on the Gualcarque river considered sacred by the indigenous Lenca community. The dam was licensed to the company Desarrollos Energéticos SA (Desa) without the legally required community consultation. Cáceres had led a campaign of peaceful community resistance against the dam which triggered a wave of repression including smear campaigns, violent evictions, sexual harassment, false criminal charges, and ultimately her murder. Before her death, Cáceres had said that she was scared of Castillo Mejía because of his military intelligence background. She told close friends and family that Castillo Mejía hounded her with texts, phone calls, and in person, appearing without warning at her home, work events and even the airport. He was arrested at San Pedro Sula international aiport trying to leave the country, the public ministry confirmed in a tweet alongside a photo of Castillo Mejía in custody. The US ambassador to Honduras Heidi Fulton praised investigators for capturing Castillo Mejía in a series of tweets. Last September, Castillo Mejía used the same platform to thank the embassy for inviting him to a solar energy conference in Las Vegas. Castillo Mejía attended the event in his capacity as president of the energy company PEMSA (Desarrollador de Proyectos de Energía Eléctrica) – one of two major shareholders in Desa. A Guardian investigation into the murder found that Cáceres appeared on a military hitlist given to US-backed elite forces just months before she was murdered. The murder was carried out like a “well-planned operation designed by military intelligence”, a legal source told the Guardian last year. Desa’s board also includes a former justice minister and several members of the Atala Zablah family, part of one of the richest and most powerful clans in Honduras. The company vice-president, Jacobo Nicolás Atala Zablah, is president of the BAC Honduras bank. His cousin Camilo owns the country’s biggest bank, Banco Fichosa. In a statement Desa said neither it nor its president Castillo Mejía had anything to do with the murder. “The company rejects this decision that is the result of international pressure and smear campaigns from various NGOs towards the company,” the statement said. Other suspects charged in connection with the murder are Sergio Ramón Rodríguez Orellana, a Desa manager; Douglas Geovanny Bustillo, a former infantry officer and close friend of Mariano Díaz Chávez, a special forces major who fought with coalition forces in Iraq; and former soldier Henry Javier Hernández Rodríguez, the suspected point man on the night of the murder. The accused hitmen are brothers Edilson and Emerson Duarte Meza, Elvin Heriberto Rápalo Orellana and Óscar Aroldo Torres Velásquez. News of the arrest broke while protests took place across the country to demand justice for the slain leader – who is one of at least 130 environment and land defenders murdered in Honduras since the 2009 coup. The Cáceres family has repeatedly condemned authorities for their secrecy and slow progress on the case. In a statement, the Council of Popular and Indigenous Organizations of Honduras (Copinh) – the organisation co-founded by Cáceres 25 years ago and now led by her second eldest daughter Bertita Zúñiga Cáceres – said: “The arrest is thanks to the work and pressure by national and international organisations. No thanks is due to the attorney general’s office, who have tried everything possible to cover up the truth in this case … Copinh will continue to denounce the entire murderous, criminal structure behind the assassination of our sister Berta Cáceres, of which David Castillo is just one piece.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/mar/03/chris-hughton-brighton-premier-league-sidwell","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-03T10:01:15Z","webTitle":"Chris Hughton’s honest approach strikes a chord at Brighton | Amy Lawrence","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/mar/03/chris-hughton-brighton-premier-league-sidwell","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/mar/03/chris-hughton-brighton-premier-league-sidwell","fields":{"headline":"Chris Hughton’s honest approach strikes a chord at Brighton","bodyText":"To the outside world, a manager’s decisions are the only way to judge their work. But to the inner circle, to the players and staff that make up the daily life of a team, it is not just the decision but the way it is imparted that tells you so much about a person’s true management style. Steve Sidwell was hitting his 35th birthday, with a long and varied career behind him, when he was called in to have a chat with Chris Hughton. Sidwell’s frustrating season – he broke an ankle in a freak accident just as he was almost fully recovered from surgery on a prolapsed disc – was about to take another hit. Hughton sat down with the midfielder and began to talk. “He pulled me in before the transfer window shut and said: ‘I am looking to bring a striker in and if I do there might not be a space for you,’” Sidwell recalls. Being withdrawn from the Premier League’s 25-man roster, in effect cutting off any chance to play once he finished his latest rehab, was an obvious blow, even if Sidwell fully understood the logic behind a decision in the club’s best interests. The midfielder responded with the honesty and courteous professionalism that Hughton had shown him. “The way you get treated determines how you react,” he explains. “In those meetings there was truthfulness and he confided in me. It might have been easy to throw toys out of the pram if I had been treated badly, but that wasn’t it. So I offered to do anything off the pitch, in the dressing room, around certain individuals, going to watch matches for him. It is just about playing your part as best as you can.” The exchange gives an insight into the atmosphere at Brighton under Hughton. Having been out of English football’s top flight for decades, having fought for their very existence, it would have been understandable for Brighton to have got a bit too excited, or felt a bit too anxious, about this season in the big time. But Hughton likes his football environment to be as measured as possible. According to Liam Rosenior it has served Brighton extremely well. “The manager sets the tone for the culture of a football club,” he says. “As a person he is just a very consistent guy. He is very honest and humble. When you have those qualities they automatically transfer to your work. He doesn’t treat everybody the same but he treats everyone with the same amount of respect – whether that is tactical, off the field things with our lives, how we conduct ourselves. “Throughout the week he will speak to people one-to-one, that is one of his strengths. When you are playing for someone like that you don’t want to let them down. The way he motivates is not to shout or single players out for mistakes or having a bad game. He has the foresight to know he can lose a player. He is always looking at it from an improvement point of view. He never gets too upset if we lose a game or too happy if we win. There is a real calmness throughout the squad and that is down to him.” Brighton take on Arsenal on Sunday on the back of their most upbeat sequence of the season – four wins and two draws in all competitions have helped them to move upwards after a difficult couple of months. They feel buoyant but also cautious, knowing that their run-in brings a series of high profile opponents. This period of the season is key to survival. Everything is well organised and confidence is being maintained. Sidwell is impressed with how Brighton have adapted to Premier League life. “When we got promoted there was a lot of excitement, a lot of nervous energy,” he says. “The first handful of games was a mixed bag and it hit the lads how hard the Premier League is. They took picking up wins most weeks for granted in the Championship. “The steadiness all comes from the manager. He never lets us get above our station or lets us panic or worry when things get tricky. While the majority of the time he is very calm, when he needs to give us a kick up the backside we have seen that. It is not the chucking of teacups but it is not nicey-nicey either. It is a controlled aggression. “For a small person he puffs his chest out and lets you have it. When he does, because it isn’t commonplace, you sit back and think: ‘Wow.’ You know you have to buck your ideas up. His honesty is fantastic. His door is always open – and I have been at other clubs where the manager says the door is open and you go to knock on it and it’s ‘come back another day’. ” The combination of human and footballing qualities has struck a strong chord. Sidwell argues that Hughton is underrated because he does not like to make a managerial noise. Having played for the likes of Arsène Wenger, José Mourinho, Martin O’Neill and Gérard Houllier, Sidwell regards Hughton’s match‑day preparation as the most enjoyable he has come across. “I have been lucky to work under some of the best managers this country has seen, and I would put him up the top with them. Because he doesn’t scream and shout from the rooftops and doesn’t like the spotlight on him that goes against him. People are starting to take note. If he continues at the top level who knows if a bigger job, or even the England job, will come?‚“ Whatever does come will be treated with the same measured, thorough, understated values."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"environment/2018/mar/02/dakota-access-pipeline-russia-congress","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-02T21:37:07Z","webTitle":"Republican-led committee says Russia funded 'useful idiot' environmentalists","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/mar/02/dakota-access-pipeline-russia-congress","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/mar/02/dakota-access-pipeline-russia-congress","fields":{"headline":"Republican-led committee says Russia funded 'useful idiot' environmentalists","bodyText":"A powerful US congressional committee has alleged that Russia financed major environmental organizations and used social media to support opponents of the Dakota Access pipeline, fracking and fossil fuels. The Republican-controlled committee claimed in a new report that the Kremlin is attempting to make “‘useful idiots’ of unwitting environmental groups and activists” to further its global agenda. “US energy exports to European countries are increasing, which means they will have less reason to rely upon Russia for their energy needs,” said Lamar Smith, the Republican chairman of the House committee on science, space and technology, in a statement. This helps explain “why Russian agents attempted to manipulate Americans’ opinions about pipelines, fossil fuels, fracking and climate change”. A close reading of the report, however, reveals that many of the committee’s claims rely on meager evidence, not least its assertion that Russia has backed land and wildlife conservation organizations including the Sierra Club and the League of Conservation Voters. In the report, the committee said: “Russian-sponsored agents funneled money to US environmental organizations in an attempt to portray energy companies in a negative way and disrupt domestic energy markets.” Drawing on data provided by Twitter, Facebook and Instagram, the committee also contended that Russian agents have exploited US social media platforms to upend domestic energy markets and suppress the use of fossil fuels such as natural gas. It asserted, for instance, that between 2015 and 2017, more than 9,000 Russian-backed posts or tweets regarding US energy policy circulated across the three major social media platforms. On average over a three-year period, this amounted to fewer than three Russian-backed energy-related posts on each of Facebook, Twitter and Instagram per day. The committee offered several examples of alleged Russian trolls spreading memes that are critical of US fossil fuel producers and pipeline projects, including the Dakota Access pipeline. Many of the examples the committee cites are drawn from a single Facebook and Instagram page titled “Born Liberal”, whose posts averaged very few shares on Facebook. Smith, who has taken more than $700,000 in career oil and gas industry campaign contributions, has long maintained that US green groups are beneficiaries of Kremlin-linked largesse. In a letter to the treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, last June, for instance, Smith claimed that shady shell companies and private foundations were passing “money originating in Russia to various US 501(c)(3) organizations such as the Sierra Club, League of Conservation Voters Education Fund, and others”. Smith requested that the treasury department investigate the matter. The League of Conservation Voters denounced the allegation that Russian-backed agents have funded it. “This is false,” says David Willett, the organization’s senior vice-president of communications. “We have no connections to Russia and have been an effective advocate for environmental protection for nearly 50 years.” In a statement, the Sierra Club legislative director, Melinda Pierce, called the accusations of Russian-backed financing “absurd, false smears” that “were invented by the same deceitful front groups getting paid to do the dirty work of big polluters and big tobacco”. Footnotes supporting the congressional report’s funding claim lead back to a single 2015 publication, From Russia With Love?, that was compiled by an organization called the Environmental Policy Alliance, an industry front group created by the Washington DC public relations operative Richard Berman. In 2014, the New York Times obtained an audio recording of Berman advising fossil fuel executives at an industry summit that they should envision their struggle against environmentalists as “an endless war”. He then asked the gathered executives to finance the Environmental Policy Alliance’s “Big Green Radicals” campaign, an effort to sully the reputation of major American environmental groups. Berman’s organization published From Russia With Love? as part of that continuing campaign. Its claims hinge on guilt by association and focus on a private foundation called Sea Change that donated millions of dollars to environmental organizations like the Sierra Club and the League of Conservation Voters at the beginning of the decade. It then describes financial links between Sea Change and a Bermuda-based corporation that in turn has ties to a law firm whose employees are associated with Russian oligarchs and energy interests. The congressional committee did not respond to multiple requests for comment. In its study the committee noted that alleged Russian trolls also promoted pro-fossil-fuel and pro-industry social media content as part of a broader effort to foment discontent. “Many posts highlighted other viewpoints about the energy sector from across the political and ideological spectrum,” the committee wrote, “and attempted to divide Americans based on geographic region.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2018/mar/02/warren-beatty-faye-dunaway-present-best-picture-oscar-again","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-02T20:06:42Z","webTitle":"Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway to present best picture Oscar again","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/mar/02/warren-beatty-faye-dunaway-present-best-picture-oscar-again","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/mar/02/warren-beatty-faye-dunaway-present-best-picture-oscar-again","fields":{"headline":"Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway to present best picture Oscar again","bodyText":"At the 90th Academy Awards on Sunday, Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway are getting a mulligan: the Bonnie and Clyde pair will present the Oscar for best picture again, one year after they infamously announced La La Land, instead of the actual winner, Moonlight. Last year Beatty and Dunaway presented the night’s top honor to mark the 50th anniversary of Bonnie and Clyde. When Beatty hesitated to announce the winner, visibly confused by the contents on the card, Dunaway read off La La Land as best picture. The mistake was attributed to the accountants at PricewaterhouseCoopers, who mixed up the envelope for best actress, won by La La Land’s Emma Stone, with that of best picture. For several minutes the mistake went unaccounted for, as the cast of La La Land gave speeches on the stage. Then, producer Jordan Horowitz corrected the record, telling the the audience there had been a mistake and that Moonlight had won the award. This year, the Academy has streamlined its processes to prevent another mistake. But Beatty and Dunaway, evidently, will get a second chance to announce the prestigious award. On Thursday evening, TMZ learned that the two were spotted rehearsing at the Dolby Theatre in Los Angeles, where Dunaway said “presenting is better the second time around”. Beatty replied: “The winner is Gone with the Wind.” Other confirmed presenters during this year’s telecast include Sandra Bullock, Lupita Nyong’o, Emily Blunt, Armie Hammer, Tiffany Haddish, Jodie Foster and Gal Gadot, while the ceremony will again be hosted by Jimmy Kimmel.

Pep Guardiola reached his 100th game in England, the 3-0 victory at Arsenal on Thursday meant his players have now recorded more league wins than they managed in the whole of last season, and City will reach an unassailable 90 points if they can win just half their remaining 10 games. The likelihood based on the season so far is that City will win more than that proportion of games and Chelsea’s record Premier League points total of 95 in 2004-05 could be in danger. José Mourinho stands to see a personal benchmark from his previous club swept aside in addition to finishing some distance behind his Manchester rivals at his present one, though Vincent Kompany insists no one in the City team is spending any time looking at what might be statistically possible. “After we played at Arsenal I was asking around in the dressing room about how many games were left and no one knew the answer,” the City captain says. “That goes to show how much we are all living in the here and now and not thinking about things like breaking records. If we keep doing what we are doing then we will break records, that isn’t rocket science, but we have got ourselves into this position by taking it step by step. Getting record points and record goals isn’t in our minds, just winning the next game.” The next game is one of the tougher challenges of the remainder of the league programme, even if Antonio Conte’s defending champions are a long way off the thrilling pace they set last season. Their title defence has not been quite as shambolic as the one Mourinho attempted to supervise in 2015, though the eventual upshot could be just the same. Chelsea are fifth in the table and Conte has admitted that finishing outside the Champions League places is a possibility. It is hard to believe now that 15 points separated the sides at the end of last season. City are 22 points ahead of last season’s runaway winners, which is a whopping swing of 37 – more points than some teams at the bottom of the table are likely to end up with. That is the extent to which Guardiola and his players have turned things around this season, though as Kompany explains, the process began a year ago. “Last season we won our last few games and we have been able to carry that on,” he says. “When we won the league in 2012 it was on goal difference and I said: ‘Please, never again like this.’ “This has been a special week for us, lifting a trophy at Wembley, but this team has enjoyed a lot of special weeks this season. We have had some great moments and we have had three or four late wins, injury-time wins, and you can’t explain what that does for your confidence. “I can’t remember the last time I looked around and thought we have played badly today, and I can honestly say you can’t wish for anything better in football than a feeling like that. We have been brilliant this season, but now, when it matters most, I don’t want the level to drop because there is still so much to do.” Kompany does not just want to keep the concentration high against Chelsea – “They have too much quality for us to think it will be easy; if Chelsea turn it on against us it will be tough” – he is already thinking of how to prepare for next season. “If we do end up winning the title this season, and I really hope that happens from the position we are in, I will be the first one in the dressing room to put the emphasis on how we approach the next campaign,” he says. “I am talking about how people come back from their summer holidays, how they should approach training, everything. We have won two titles at this club and both times when we came back there was an edge missing. “That is why it is so difficult to retain titles. Only special teams can do it, and we have to become that special team this time. If we do end up winning the title, and I still say ‘if’ out of respect to the other teams, then just watch me in pre-season. “I will be looking into people’s eyes to check if they have the same intensity. Our strength this season has been preparing for every game believing the team we are playing are going to hit us with everything they have. I want that to continue right through summer. In the past when we have won the title the intensity has been missing the following season.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/2018/mar/02/katarina-johnson-thompson-pentathlon-gold-world-indoor","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-02T22:16:32Z","webTitle":"Katarina Johnson-Thompson takes pentathlon gold at World Indoors","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/mar/02/katarina-johnson-thompson-pentathlon-gold-world-indoor","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/mar/02/katarina-johnson-thompson-pentathlon-gold-world-indoor","fields":{"headline":"Katarina Johnson-Thompson takes pentathlon gold at World Indoors","bodyText":"Finally she delivered. For too long the expectation surrounding Katarina Johnson-Thompson has acted as a dragnet on her body and mind but, urged on by a boisterous home crowd, the 25-year-old powered away to claim her first world title and then promised it would be a springboard for an even brighter future. “It’s been a long time coming but I am finally a world champion,” she said, her voice hoarse after the exertions of a day spent sprinting, jumping and throwing, before sealing the pentathlon gold medal with victory in the 800m. “It means the world to me. This is something I have been trying to do since 2012 when I stepped into the international scene.” Admittedly it was a moderate field, with none of the heptathlon medallists from last year’s world championships in Birmingham. And Johnson-Thompson’s winning score of 4,750 was also 250 points below her best. But the popular 25-year-old could do no more than deal with what she was up against – and she won with something in hand over the Austrian Ivona Dodic, who took silver 50 points behind her. Johnson-Thompson now hopes that an unprecedented treble of world indoor, Commonwealth and European heptathlon gold medals is on the cards in 2018. “I have a busy year and this gives me confidence I can compete at a certain level and come away with a medal and not screw it up,” she said, smiling. It would take a heart of stone not to be happy for her. There have been too many screw-ups in the past – most famously in the 2015 world championships when she fouled three times in the long jump when favourite, and then again in London last year when her chances for a medal ended when she cleared only 1.80m in the high jump – 18cm below her personal best. “After the last couple of years there was no pressure on me because I have not done too well,” Johnson-Thompson said. “I am just happy I can kickstart this year as a gold medallist. I will have to step up my game in the European Championships in the summer but I think I can do that.” The secret to success was her consistency – with solid results in the 60m hurdles (8.36sec) and high jump (1.91m), followed by an indoor personal best of 12.68m in the shot put, her weakest event. Another solid performance in the long jump, where she jumped 6.50m, put in her command and victory in the 800m (2:16.63) ensured the gold medal was hers. It meant Britain had their first gold medal at the world indoors since Richard Kilty shocked everybody by taking the 60m in Sopot in 2014. Johnson-Thompson admitted a move to Montpellier last year to be coached by the Frenchman Bertrand Valcin had made the crucial difference. “He has so much belief in me and that I can grasp my opportunities,” she said. “It’s very lonely out in France. I’ve left my family. There’s the language barrier but it’s worth it for this.” Meanwhile, Murielle Ahoure of the Ivory Coast ran away from the field to 60m gold in 6.97 sec - the sixth fastest time in history. Her compatriot Marie-Josee Ta Lou took silver in 7.05, the same time as the Swiss athlete Mujinga Kambundji, who won bronze. Earlier in the evening there was a surprise in the men’s long jump as the 19-year-old Cuban Miguel Echevarria took gold with a leap of 8.46m. It made him the youngest male field event champion of all time. The outdoor world champion Luvo Manyonga took silver with a jump of 8.44m, while the 2016 indoor champ Marquis Dendy had to settle for bronze."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/mar/04/letters-universities-deans-lake-district-churchill-ed-sheeran-impress","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-04T00:01:31Z","webTitle":"Universities are cathedrals of public relations not learning | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/04/letters-universities-deans-lake-district-churchill-ed-sheeran-impress","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/04/letters-universities-deans-lake-district-churchill-ed-sheeran-impress","fields":{"headline":"Letters: universities are cathedrals of public relations not learning","bodyText":"The Observer is right that universities are not run by those who teach in them (“Academics are right to fight poor pension deal”, Editorial, last week). Most of our highly paid deans and pro-vice-chancellors have not conducted an undergraduate tutorial in years, and many more highly paid staff neither teach students nor carry out academic research. Deans, heads of department and promotion committees were elected, but now they are appointed from above. Teaching is often hourly paid. Decision-making is centralised and remote from both the academic and administrative staff who interact with students, so policies to improve efficiency cause disruption and waste. Student fees are being spent on consultations and surveys, and the generation of benchmarks and targets. Countless documents record strategic visions no poet would immortalise. The corridors echo with the banal hyperbole of public relations. Our cathedrals of learning worship metrics that do not measure anything of value. Professor James Ladyman Department of philosophy University of Bristol Impress is independent Nick Cohen is right (“We need a special court for free speech, delivering justice to all”, Comment, last week) to call for an inexpensive court, but if he looks at the inquiry report he will see that is precisely what Leveson has proposed. Leveson also came up with a measure for newspapers to use, rather than insist on using the high court. A newspaper did not have to belong to a recognised regulator, and thus an inexpensive arbitration scheme, but if it didn’t, and insisted on using the courts, it could be ordered to pay the costs of both sides if this were “just and equitable in all the circumstances of the case” (section 40 of the Crime and Courts Act). Is that not fair? If you and I are going on a journey together and I can only afford the bus, surely you should pay if you insist that we both travel in a Rolls-Royce? Section 40 would also protect a small local newspaper threatened by a rich individual. A large part of the national press hated this. The last thing they want is to eliminate the financial barrier that prevents most people challenging them. So they decided to ignore the royal charter and set up a virtual copy of their old, wholly discredited Press Complaints Commission, but with a slightly more credible chairman. In response, a small group led by Jonathan Heawood set up a royal charter-compliant regulator, Impress, with the intention of securing recognition. He has since been joined by others with impeccable credentials, including Harold Evans, David Leigh and the Impress chairman, Walter Merricks. But Impress had a financial problem. With the help of lawyers, a structure was set up to enable money from our family charitable trust to reach Impress in a way that gave me no influence or control. This was challenged by the major newspapers. Eventually, it reached the high court where two judges said there was “nothing” in the newspapers’ claim that Impress was not fully independent. Max Mosley London SW3 More zip for the Lake District I always find any description of Thirlmere as “unspoilt” misplaced (Mark Townsend, “Notebook... The Lake District”, News, last week). The lake is a reservoir and is flanked by Forestry Commission plantations. As such, it is an extreme example of the centuries of human intervention that has given the Lake District its current appearance. It seems too that the “sound violence” threatening the tranquillity of the valley is neither the “thrum of the A591” (which actually passes within yards of Wythburn church) nor the brief ear-splitting cacophony of low-flying jets, but that of people enjoying themselves. Perhaps visitors should be required to progress through the Lake District in reverential silence, thereby demonstrating they are the “right sort”? The Lake District is an area blighted by low-skill, low-wage employment, high living costs, a dearth of affordable housing, and poor internal and external transport links. The energies of the protesters against the zip wire, and the interest of the correspondents of this newspaper, would be better placed if they were directed towards improving the lot of the people who live here and who often earn a living from people enjoying themselves. Dr Andrew Finch Ambleside, Cumbria The irony of Ed Sheeran Jonathan Romney’s revelatory review of Songwriter, the documentary film about Ed Sheeran (“Ordinary bloke, ordinary songs”, Focus, last week), informed us that it takes up to six people to write some of Sheeran’s songs and a full nine in the case of Galway Girl. I have no issue with collaborative working but, unless it is meant to be ironic, surely the title of the documentary is a tad misleading. And I trust that any future pieces about Mr Sheeran will no longer refer to him as one of the most successful singer-songwriters of our time. Mike Pender Cardiff No whisper of Churchill fling As a Churchill biographer, I was most intrigued by your piece quoting Sir John “Jock” Colville in an interview taped two years before his death, claiming that between 1933 and 1937, Churchill had conducted a “brief” affair with Doris Castlerosse (“Revealed: secret tryst with socialite that threatened Churchill’s career”, News, last week). Colville was not at Churchill’s side during the 1930s, though he did serve as Churchill’s assistant private secretary during the war and in the early 1950s. Did Winston confide in him? I think we can safely rule that out. So it would be beneficial to learn a few more facts about the source of Colville’s last-minute revelation, as well as more convincing evidence to justify a Churchillian liaison dangereuse. An alleged “brief” affair, lasting four to five years (do we need a new definition of the word “brief”?), between a famous – some would claim notorious – politician and a flighty socialite, and we hear not the faintest whisper in the hyperactive gossip columns of those days. Nor even the gentlest of hints in the Channon diaries, or the Nicolson diaries, or the “Baffy” Dugdale diaries? It seems highly unlikely. Of course, anything’s possible (or almost anything). But before we draw any sensational conclusions we must be certain of the validity of our sources and evidence, something that seems curiously lacking in this case.

It is eight years since England lost more than one match in a Six Nations and their conquerors then are the remaining two teams they face in the tournament – France in Paris on Saturday followed by the leaders, Ireland, at Twickenham on St Patrick’s Day. The champions’ crown is slipping and the head coach is looking for hands to keep it in place on a weekend when the Irish could seal the title. “Losing creates that little bit more hurt,” Jones says. “You’re driven to find how to get better and you look at the players to see who is hurting. Our selection policy is always to pick the best 23 and we will definitely have a look to see how we can improve the team. I’ve spoken to the players: sulking, worrying about what the media says or whether they are going to get picked is not productive. “I have told them that they do not need to worry about selection because the only person who selects the team is me. They have to put themselves in a position where they say to me that they are ready to play against France and I have to pick them. We’ve got to play better in Paris. The best teacher is the lesson. There is a great deal of determination in the squad. You lose; that’s life. You react.” A significant factor behind England’s success last season was the impact made by replacements; finishers as Jones dubbed them. England trailed in the last quarter against France and Wales in their opening two matches, but recovered to win both, prompted by Danny Care at scrum-half, and then overcame a half-time deficit at home to Italy. This year, they failed to score in the final hour against Wales, who blew two prime try-scoring opportunities, and did not muster a point in the last 37 minutes in Scotland, although they had a try disallowed. Excluding the win in Italy, England have scored 34 points and three tries in their last three Six Nations games, including last year’s defeat by Ireland. While they have won 24 out of their 26 Tests since Jones took charge, the two defeats have come in their five away matches in the Six Nations, again factoring out the Azzurri. It shows how more competitive the Six Nations has become and how much more meaningful it is as a means of building to a World Cup. Jones has come under pressure to drop his captain, Dylan Hartley, along with another thirtysomething in Mike Brown but both were off the field in the final 25 minutes at Murrayfield when England failed to close the gap on Scotland. The injury suffered by the scrum-half Ben Youngs on the opening weekend has been telling because Care’s impact from the bench has not been replicated by that of Richard Wigglesworth, an entirely different player. Jones did not groom a third scrum-half because he wanted to devote maximum training time to Youngs and Care but it means his bench has lost its catalyst. “We are always assessing to see if there’s anyone better than what we’ve got at the moment,” says Jones, “but they have to have experience and they are going to have to be able to come up to Test match quality quickly. We are appraising all the players who are available to us, but the reality is there are not too many who are outside the squad. The likes of Denny Solomona, Marcus Smith and Zach Mercer have the potential to play Test rugby but it is how quickly they mature.” Win or lose, Jones braces himself for the Hartley question. England’s last two matches have highlighted the leadership issue the head coach constantly refers to because problems were not solved. But when players have to be briefed before facing the media and given a lists of points to make, why should they be expected to show initiative on the pitch? Should it be a surprise that they become derivative? France will not play with the frenzy of Scotland. They will not be roared on by such a passionate crowd: the days of noise echoing around the concrete corridors of the Parc des Princes and reverberating with a boom on the pitch are long gone. Multiple away days for players in the European tournaments have stripped away the rarity factor of playing in France, and removed any fear. Since 2010, Les Bleus have achieved only one victory in the fixture: in 2014 when England found a way of losing in the closing minutes (a match after which the then head coach, Stuart Lancaster, was criticised for taking off Hartley and Care too early). “France are a big physical team and I do not think they will play any differently,” says Jones, “trying to punch the ball up with their big forwards, create an offload and then play their more traditional French game. “Mathieu Bastareaud gives them a different dimension in the midfield, able to work his way through a tackle and offload as well as giving them defensive strength. He reminds me of Lloyd Walker [the former Australia fly-half or centre] who also used to waddle around the field but had an incredible influence. “After a defeat, you need strong people, ones who do not come in and kick stones. You do not need any who are feeling sorry for themselves; you want them to set an example of how we will go forward and Dylan has done that. The intensity of the game now means it is very difficult for a front-rower to play 80 minutes: they tend to go 60 because the amount of work they have to do is three times what it was 10 years ago.” Whatever changes Jones makes, England will need to secure quicker possession than they did against Scotland, when the lack of a Billy Vunipola or a Manu Tuilagi, who can make ground from a standing start, hurt them. The head coach stopped off on his way back from Edinburgh to watch Manchester United play Chelsea and chat to Sir Alex Ferguson, a manager who oversaw some dramatic finishes. At least he will not encounter a flying Scotsman in the French capital but it is a day when his players will need to wing it."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"environment/2018/mar/10/country-diary-bill-condry-saxifrage-cadair-idris-gwynedd","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-10T05:30:04Z","webTitle":"Country diary: Bill Condry had hoped to see the saxifrage in flower","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/mar/10/country-diary-bill-condry-saxifrage-cadair-idris-gwynedd","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/mar/10/country-diary-bill-condry-saxifrage-cadair-idris-gwynedd","fields":{"headline":"Country diary: Bill Condry had hoped to see the saxifrage in flower","bodyText":"On foot from Dolgellau, up Cader Road, a wind biting my cheek cold as government social policies. “Gwynt y dwyrain, gwynt o draed y meirwon” (East wind, wind from the feet of the dead)! I flinched before it, turned aside for the Foxes’ Path that climbs a great slope of red scree to the east of the summit. It was 1992 when I last came this way. That scree slope is the simple explanation – one of the most unpleasant ascents on any British mountain, fraught and unstable even in descent. I remember running down it in 1961, and turning a complete somersault as the block I’d landed on chose to career off downhill. No harm done when you’re young, but at the age of worn knees and torn ligaments , it’s best avoided. My last visit was with the friend and mentor from whom I inherited this diary. On a fitfully bright January day, Bill Condry lured me down to Cadair, with a scheme to be earliest that year to record the flowering of purple saxifrage. I was scolded about keeping away from rocks and summits, and he taught me to use my eyes and brain; told me he’d not been all the way up this path since 1923. He confided that our mutual friend Dewi Jones of Penygroes had recorded purple saxifrage flowering on Snowdon on 26 January. He wanted to beat him. I hooted with laughter, suggested that his tribe of botanists were every bit as competitive as my rock-climbing clan. Gunmetal impasto of Llyn Gafr joggled the reflections. We circled to bluffs beyond. Among tangles of thyme, purple saxifrage in profusion, not yet in flower. His hands, like a lover’s, caressed the leaves and then parted them to view. It was St David’s Day, the centenary of Bill’s birth: I recalled his ecstatic expression; recited examples of his informed, unadorned style; remembered his wryness, humour, self-effacement, immersion in contemplation of the object. Snow flurried past, obscuring all. The saxifrage was not in flower. I turned back into the bitter wind.

The Norman central tower of Ely Cathedral had collapsed, and the architect of its replacement chose to bridge the gap not with stone, but with wood. To this day, the Octagon Tower has Bedfordshire oak timbers holding up its roof to heaven. Not so long ago, another forester came into Chicksands Wood to take out the tallest, straightest trees. He cut them down on either side of the ride, the aisle of this cathedral. Buttressed stumps a metre wide were as fluted pillars brought low in the ruins of a church building. On the flat top of an orangey-brown stump, I ran my finger down the timeline towards another catastrophe. Sixty-three annual growth rings took me to the centre of the tree and the period when owners of this wood and thousands of others like it lost patience with the old ways. In postwar Britain, two-thirds of Chicksands was cleared and replanted with conifers, including the trees like this one, which had just met its end. Further down the ride, a shaft of sunlight enticed me to a place where the wood’s medieval heart beat still. Scrambling through sedges, I came to what was evidently the remnant of a coppiced ash, a moss-covered eye socket betraying where a stem of the same tree had been cut long ago and the base had rotted into a hollow. A little way behind it was another ash of gigantic proportions – 10 trunks as thick as my waist rose from a stool about three metres in diameter. This tree, maybe 500 years old, had sprouted from the humped bank over a sinuous ditch. And since the bank had to pre-date anything growing on it, I guessed this trench had been dug in days when a woodland boundary would be marked from tree to tree, a twisting line that had outgrown its logic. The ditch was surely there on that day in the 1320s when woodsmen came here in search of oaks to fell."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2018/mar/03/magic-light-animated-films-oscars-revolting-rhymes","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-03T11:56:33Z","webTitle":"Touch of British magic as Roald Dahl classic is tipped for Oscar","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/mar/03/magic-light-animated-films-oscars-revolting-rhymes","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/mar/03/magic-light-animated-films-oscars-revolting-rhymes","fields":{"headline":"Touch of British magic as Roald Dahl classic is tipped for Oscar","bodyText":"The list of British talent contending for Academy Awards in Los Angeles on Sunday night is topped by some illustrious names: Daniel Day-Lewis, Sally Hawkins, Dunkirk director Christopher Nolan, Gary Oldman and newcomer Daniel Kaluuya. Yet a handful of other characters will not have their moment of red-carpet glory, despite having played starring roles in an Oscar-nominated British film already enjoyed by millions. Little Red Riding Hood, Snow White, Prince Charming and the wolf are a few of the much-loved fictional heroes and villains of Revolting Rhymes, the acclaimed movie of Roald Dahl’s quirky selection of fairytale yarns tipped to have a strong chance of winning the best animated short film award. “A nomination is a prize in itself,” said producer Michael Rose, speaking from West Hollywood. “It is the biggest honour in our industry, to be out here this weekend, so we are enjoying our time, staying next to Sunset Strip.” His co-founder at Magic Light is also delighted. “It really is tremendous,” said Martin Pope. The two producers should be taking it all in their stride by now. After all, this is Magic Light’s fourth Oscar nomination, making them among the most publicly lauded members of the British film industry. The popular animations of the Julia Donaldson and Axel Scheffer children’s hits The Gruffalo and Room on the Broom are also from their stable, as is Chico and Rita, a romantic full-length 2010 feature for grown-ups. “We are never blasé about any of it,” said Rose, who began his producing career with Aardman Animations. “We take a lot of time choosing our projects and we make them very carefully. We’ve focused mainly on children’s titles, but Chico and Rita was also Oscar-nominated, so the only link really is that we want to do things at very high quality.” Magic Light’s children’s films are regularly shown on Christmas Day on BBC One and are often drawn from Donaldson and Scheffer’s work, including The Highway Rat last Christmas. “What is so lovely about the film is the way they have kept true to the story and the look of the [Room on the Broom] book,” Donaldson said in 2012. The Gruffalo went out to a television audience of 9.8 million on Christmas Day 2009, while The Gruffalo’s Child was shown on Christmas Day 2011. In an extraordinary festive coup, all of Magic Light’s children’s films featured across the 2017 BBC One Christmas and New Year schedule, including Donaldson and Scheffer’s Stick Man and Dahl’s Revolting Rhymes, pulling in a total of 19 million viewers. The Dahl film, which features marionette-style characters instead of drawings in the style of the book’s illustrator, Quentin Blake, was watched by 10 million on its first TV outing, in December 2016, and has just launched on Netflix in North America. Made in two parts in a specially created Magic Light studio in Berlin and in Cape Town, South Africa, it stars the voices of Dominic West, Gemma Chan and David Walliams. It has already won several major awards and been bought by 37 countries. “We go where the talent that we want to work with is, but we are very much British,” said Pope. “We set up our own studio in Berlin for this film but the essence of the project is absolutely British. Our name may not be well known and we may not be the size of a great company like Aardman, but we want to do work on a smaller scale and of the highest quality,” he added.

Shelvey – who despite requiring pain-killing injections in an unrelated groin problem has impressed in recent weeks - will miss Saturday’s game at his old club Liverpool as well as next Saturday’s home fixture against fellow strugglers Southampton. “Jonjo knocked his knee at Bournemouth last week,” Rafael Benítez said. “We don’t yet know how serious it is. The doctors say we have to check exactly what he has and then decide what to do.” Like Shelvey, Islam Slimani is sidelined for at least the next two games.

As the nation took shelter from the beast from the east, this was intended to be May’s “reality bites” speech. Ten times she used the word “recognise” to underline she no longer believed Britain could have it all. “We recognise that we cannot have exactly the same arrangements with the EU as we do now,” she said. “We recognise this would constrain our ability to lower regulatory standards. We need to face up to facts. Our access to each other’s markets will be less”. Little wonder that by the time it came for questions, and a German newspaper asked: “Is it all worth it?” The prime minister had to pause awkwardly before replying: “We are not changing our minds.” Much attention will focus on the remaining chasm between Downing Street’s hopes and the increasingly intransigent position adopted in Brussels. There was little to explain how they might solve the current crisis over Northern Ireland in the three weeks allotted. It would be churlish though not to acknowledge creeping realism from a politician whose heart has never really seemed in it. The weary call for “pragmatic common sense” was directed at both her own party and Europe. They seemed receptive. “I welcome [the] speech,” the EU’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, said. “Clarity about leaving the single market and customs union and a recognition of trade-offs.” Jacob Rees-Mogg’s European Research Group was said to be “very relaxed”. So the Mansion House speech deserves a thought experiment. What if the prime minister pulls off the compromise she now admits is the best on offer? What do the bright colours and red lines look like when they have been through the wash a few times? Her first admission was that much of Britain’s reclaimed sovereignty would remain theoretical. In order to maintain market access for industrial goods, any future Westminster government would need to apply almost identical trading rules. Yes, they could decide not to, one day, much as Brexit itself is proof of parliament’s ultimate veto already, but it would swiftly bring the borders crashing down. Secondly, May’s convoluted proposals for avoiding a customs union would rest on the most intrusive and bureaucratic system of government monitoring yet devised. Imports would need to be tracked long after entry in order to make sure they were destined for UK or EU customers. If the Irish border is solved, it will be by turning a blind eye to thousands of small acts of smuggling and law-breaking. This would also be a fragile truce. Despite promising any solution had to be permanent, the system of mutual recognition that May envisages for sectors such as banking and television could break down at any moment. Industries such as medicines, aviation and chemicals would remain largely under Brussels’ control, but farming, fishing and computing would remain outside its reach – for now. There is the potential for many further climb-downs too. Where before there were promises, May now offers tests. Among others, Brexit would only be a success if it “protected prosperity”. The unspoken threat being that if this looks in jeopardy, it might be time to revisit more red lines. “There will be ups and downs,” May said. “But we will not be buffeted by demands to talk tough ... or accept the counsel of despair that this cannot be done.” An endurance test without end, she might have said, for a purpose only in itself."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2018/mar/02/sinn-fein-can-be-no-saviours-of-ireland","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-02T16:42:46Z","webTitle":"Sinn Féin can be no saviours of Ireland | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/mar/02/sinn-fein-can-be-no-saviours-of-ireland","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/mar/02/sinn-fein-can-be-no-saviours-of-ireland","fields":{"headline":"Sinn Féin can be no saviours of Ireland","bodyText":"Polly Toynbee (Come to parliament, Sinn Féin, as saviours of Ireland – and Britain, 1 March) aggrandises the former political wing of a paramilitary group.

We wouldn’t give any credence to anyone who advocated that the UK’s trade policy should depend on the say-so of a group of far right extremists threatening death if they didn’t get their way, would we? That’s the situation, mutatis mutandis. (That the potential terrorists might get aid and comfort from some elected representatives makes no difference.)

In recent years I’ve started feeling that my nationality resembles a nasty skin disease that I want to scrub off. When I’m abroad, I hide my accent and I call myself a “world citizen”. I’ve vowed never to have a Hungarian boyfriend, or even to settle down in my own country. I hate the fact that much of the world now believes Hungarians to be intolerant and longing for authoritarianism. Not that long ago we were barely ever mentioned in the international media. Now, we’re a primary example of illiberalism in Europe. Perhaps what I hate most is the way the Hungarian government tries to define what a “real” Hungarian should be. Orsolya Lehotai, an activist blogger and a high-school friend of mine, puts it this way: the prime minister, Viktor Orbán, has tried to force on us – the younger generation – a vision in which being Hungarian means “white, heterosexual, Christian or at least non-Muslim”. Orsolya likes to say she only comes from Hungary but isn’t Hungarian, because the word has been hijacked. I’ve started doing much the same. It’s an irony that the government flirts with white nationalism, but then celebrates our Hungarian-Asian roots as a way of demonstrating ethnic uniqueness. “When we go to Brussels we do not have any relatives there. But when we come to Kazakhstan, we have close people here,” Orbán said on a 2015 visit to central Asia. The government has also allotted 300m forint (£850,000) to the Kurultáj festival, held every other summer to celebrate a “tribal assembly of Hun-Turkic nations”, with participants from 27 ethnic groups. Hungarians are said to originate from somewhere east of the Ural mountains, beyond the line separating Europe and Asia. Experts still debate the location of our exact roots, but most agree that we came from somewhere in central Asia. Our ancestors were nomads, moving across large territories, shooting arrows backwards on horseback and practising shamanism. Towards the end of the ninth century we ended up settling in the Carpathian basin in central Europe. What Hungarians call the Honfoglalás, or the conquest of the homeland, was essentially a migration-led process. That’s no small paradox when set against Orbán’s rabid anti-immigration rhetoric. In a recent speech he said: “We do not want to be a diverse country, we want to be how we [were] 1,100 years ago.” My country’s relations with the EU have become dangerously fraught. Studies show that a majority of Hungarians trust the EU. Yet Orbán casts us as central Europeans under assault from Brussels. He accuses the EU of wanting to transform our region into “a migrant destination”. He’s suggesting that we single-handedly have the power to decide what is European and what isn’t. I recently became more aware of the complexities that surround identity when I met Norbert Kulcsar, a manager in an agricultural store in the small south-eastern town of Kiskunmajsa. His brand of Hungarian patriotism comes with an enthusiastic nod to the distant Asian past. His wife, Bulgana, is Mongolian. Their home is decorated with objects that blend cultures: handmade leather quivers; an engraved plaque depicting horses; and a T-shirt Norbert likes to wear depicting a map of pre-world war one “Greater Hungary”. “People in the west see Hungarians as easterners,” he says, “but in the east we are westerners.” A regular visitor to the Kurultáj festival, Norbert says he wouldn’t be surprised if some of his ancestry traced back to Mongolia. Perhaps how we define ourselves is something that evolves constantly. Hungary is in fact a diverse nation. A cocktail of German, Slav, Turkish and other Eurasian cultures surely runs through most of us. Many of our most treasured traditions – such as the Busó carnival marking the end of winter, or the kürtőskalács, a cake made of sweet yeast dough and roasted over charcoal – are inherited from peoples we interacted with throughout our history. Just as during our migration from Asia, different cultures, people and languages today form a melting pot, one that the government denies even exists. Hungary is heading towards elections on 8 April. Its politics have been made toxic as a result of manipulations over identity. Ours is a multicultural past, one of long-distance migration and the mixing of people that came with successive empires. In the 19th and 20th century, large numbers of Hungarians uprooted themselves to seek better fortunes elsewhere in Europe or in America. None of this has prevented the government from erecting barbed fences to ward off asylum seekers in 2015, nor from plastering giant billboards across the country proclaiming what “real and good” Hungarian citizens should be, with the rest being depicted as “traitors”. Extreme nationalism revolves around exclusion and scare tactics. It is not only making Hungary a pariah in Europe, it is also scaring away the progressive part of the younger generation. Many are tempted to simply pick up their bags and leave. Some studies show that more than 370,000 young Hungarians are planning to emigrate in the coming years. Most young Hungarians have a positive image of the EU, not the paranoid vision presented to us by government propaganda. Many of us are fed up with watching the current regime portray us as a nation that’s victimised and which needs to stand up to the European “system”. Young people need to get more involved in politics, so others don’t make all the decisions for them. They should also become more aware of how human rights and democracy – not just job opportunities and freedom of movement – are deeply intertwined with Hungary being part of the EU. After the borders opened in Europe in 1989, our parents’ generation embraced the transformations that became possible. Now we are watching walls being erected again. I refuse to believe this is what we are about. One day we will acknowledge that we ourselves are a mixture of accumulated identities – we will break out of the siege mentality and accept differences. We can be proud again of being Hungarian. • Kata Karáth is a freelance journalist based in Hungary"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"fashion/2018/mar/02/loewe-aspires-thinking-womans-favourite-paris","type":"article","sectionId":"fashion","sectionName":"Fashion","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-02T14:10:32Z","webTitle":"Loewe aspires to be the thinking woman's favourite in Paris","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2018/mar/02/loewe-aspires-thinking-womans-favourite-paris","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/fashion/2018/mar/02/loewe-aspires-thinking-womans-favourite-paris","fields":{"headline":"Loewe aspires to be the thinking woman's favourite in Paris","bodyText":"Into the gap left at Paris fashion week by the departure of Phoebe Philo from Céline, enter Loewe. Philo’s successor, Hedi Slimane, is soon to begin work on his new-look Celine, to be unveiled in September. But in Paris another British designer, Jonathan Anderson – born in Northern Ireland, based in Dalston, feted in Paris – made a decisive grab for the hallowed ground occupied by Céline, the fashionista’s favourite label. This Loewe collection had the same spare, high-level sophistication that enabled Philo’s Céline to punch above its commercial weight and become a key influencer on the clothes real women wear. “It’s winter, so it has to start with the coat,” said Anderson backstage after the show. Neat tweed checks with contrast leather collars, laid-back trench coats and wool blazers with elegant waists were perfectly executed. All of this season’s cool-girl tropes were present and correct – oversized earrings, ankle boots, long skirts trailing ribbon ties, polka dot silks – but there was an energy and attitude that elevated the collection beyond the tracing-paper versions of Céline that have become a catwalk cliche. Spoken word is taking the place of music at many catwalk shows this season. On Thursday evening, the much-hyped Off-White collection by Virgil Abloh opened with the voice of the essayist Susan Sontag in conversation with the art critic John Berger, talking about storytelling as mediated by images. The Loewe show was accompanied by audio of a flat-toned discussion on the topics of mindfulness and virtue. The idea of the soundtrack was to “take out noise”, said Anderson, who shows his own label, JW Anderson, at London fashion week, and was named designer of the year at the British fashion awards in December. “I want it to be about the confidence to do what is right for this brand, blocking out everything else.” On every seat was a hardback copy of either Madame Bovary, Don Quixote, Heart of Darkness or Dracula, each in their original language but with new sleeves designed by the American fashion photographer Steven Meisel. “I like the idea that you can stay with the classics, but change the cover and make it relevant today,” said Anderson. The subtext of gifting each guest a hardback work of classic literature rather than, say, a lip gloss is that this is a thinking woman’s fashion brand. That message was reinforced by the surroundings: laid out within the Unesco headquarters in Paris, the Loewe catwalk also served as a gallery for artefacts which Anderson chose to complement the clothes, including neo-Dada sculptures by the Japanese artist Tetsumi Kudo. The silk bras that were stitched to the outside of a few outfits were a Paris fashion week version of a joke; the softly sculptural bags, panelled in leather and houndstooth wool, looked set to do serious business."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"us-news/2018/mar/03/jared-kushner-ivanka-trump-business-problems","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-03T13:49:36Z","webTitle":"Jarvanka out?

Kushner’s business problems add to talk of DC exit","bodyText":"Life at the White House for Donald Trump’s senior adviser and son-in-law Jared Kushner and his wife, Ivanka Trump, may be rapidly losing its appeal as conflict of interest claims against the couple mount and the president himself is said to be cooling on continuing their roles in the administration. Kushner, who this week was stripped of his top-level security clearance, faces intensifying scrutiny on a number of fronts, including loans on his family’s real estate assets agreed with creditors who stand to gain from White House economic policy, and from special counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation. Meanwhile, the FBI has reportedly been examining Ivanka Trump’s negotiations over the financing of Trump International Hotel and Tower in Vancouver. Like many Trump-badged properties, the company receives licensing and marketing fees from the developer, in this case the wealthy Malaysian Joo Kim Tiah. Peter Mirijanian, a spokesman for Ivanka Trump’s ethics counsel, told CNN that no “hurdle, obstacle, concern, red flag or problem has been raised with respect to Ms Trump or her clearance application”. In both cases law enforcement officials are concerned that the couple’s foreign dealings leave them vulnerable to pressure from foreign agents. Seemingly, Kushner’s inability to receive security clearance stems from his family’s real estate dealings and the business’ pressing need for investment, often from foreign lenders. Kushner had to make more than 100 revisions to his security-clearance application; his financial filings had to be amended 39 times in four months after he “inadvertently omitted” millions of dollars in assets. According to the Washington Post, US intelligence agencies have learned that numerous foreign government officials discussed how to exploit his business interests. These include four countries: Israel, China, Mexico and the UAE. The paper also reports that the president has told aides it might be preferable if the couple returned to civilian life in New York. These are some of the business problems plaguing Kushner. 666 Fifth Avenue The flagship of the Kushner empire, Jared Kushner’s first big deal is looking increasingly like a potentially ruinous burden. The $1.8bn property was purchased at the top of the market in 2007 before prices for commercial real estate crumbled. The property is facing $1.2bn refinancing at the end of this year and the search for lenders has reportedly, at various times, led to contacts with Putin ally and head of Russian state investment bank Vnesheconombank (VEB) Sergei Gorkov, as well as Anbang, the Chinese insurance giant, and members of the Qatari Investment Authority. Chicago skyscraper The company has reportedly taken out loans totaling $509m from lenders with whom Kushner has held White House meetings. These are reported to include a $184m loan on a Chicago skyscraper – the midwest headquarters for AT&amp;T – from private equity firm Apollo Global, a company that stands to benefit from the Trump administration’s infrastructure spending as well as the decision to leave carried-interest provisions so beloved of private equity investors in place. Brooklyn development The $509m also reportedly includes a $325m Citigroup loan on a Brooklyn development, soon after the Citigroup CEO, Michael Corbat, met with Kushner at the White House. Spokespeople for Apollo and Citigroup denied that the meetings had anything to do with the loans. “Stories like these attempt to make insinuating connections that do not exist to disparage the financial institutions and companies involved,” a Kushner Companies spokeswoman, Christine Taylor, told the New York Times. Deutsche bank loan A $285m Deutsche bank loan to Kushner Companies is reportedly the focus of New York banking regulators. According to Reuters last week, the New York state department of financial services (DFS) made the requests to Deutsche Bank, Signature Bank and New York Community Bank for information on loans and other financial arrangements including lines of credit and loan guarantees. Taylor said the company had not received a copy of any letter from regulators. “Prior to our CEO voluntarily resigning to serve our country, we never had any type of inquiries,” Taylor said in an email. “These types of inquiries appear to be harassment solely for political reasons.” EB-5 visas In addition, the Securities and Exchange Commission is reportedly looking into Kushner company’s promotion of White House ties to pitch EB-5 visas to Chinese investors. Kushner’s use of EB-5, a congressionally approved visa-for-investment system, came under renewed scrutiny last year after the Kushner family members conducted sales pitches in Shanghai and Beijing seeking investment in a New Jersey project One Journal Square. According to reports in the Washington Post and the New York Times, the pitch included a photograph of the president in a slideshow that described him as a key decision-maker on the fate of the EB-5 program. A Kushner spokesman said the photograph was included by the Chinese organizer of the event."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2018/mar/05/churchills-secret-affair-review-we-shall-frolic-on-the-beaches","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-05T09:53:25Z","webTitle":"Churchill’s Secret Affair review – we shall frolic on the beaches","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/mar/05/churchills-secret-affair-review-we-shall-frolic-on-the-beaches","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2018/mar/05/churchills-secret-affair-review-we-shall-frolic-on-the-beaches","fields":{"headline":"Churchill’s Secret Affair review – we shall frolic on the beaches","bodyText":"Hands up who wants to see Britain’s greatest ever leader, the nation’s saviour, in his trunks (quite high, quite tight), sliding headfirst and on his back down a big slippery slide into the sea? You’re in luck, finally, here in Churchill’s Secret Affair. His least dark hour, by the look of it, if not his finest one. Here he goes, weee … splash! Like an aerial torpedo fired across the Mediterranean. We shall frolic on the beaches, we shall frolic on the landing grounds. When? Where? Why? We’re on the French Riviera in 1933, at the seaside pleasure palace of a glamorous actress who knew simply everyone, darling, and threw extravagant summer house-parties. Churchill, in the political wilderness at the time, often attended. Once with his wife, Clementine, a few times without. That part is crucial, because it was in her absence that the affair started. Yes, I’m afraid so (to be fair, there is a clue in the title); cheat, cheat, cheat. Long rumoured, now confirmed in a recently-revealed 1985 interview with Churchill’s private secretary, Jock Colville. “This is a somewhat scandalous story and therefore not to be handed out for a great many years,” Colville said. Now those years are up, and the tape has been discovered by an American historian, Dr Warren Dockter. Doctor, Dockter, can’t you see I’m burning, burning … No? Thompson Twins? Maybe not your era. In which case he probably just sounds like the beginning of a joke. Anyway, he and the Churchill scholar Prof Richard Toye set out to get to bottom of this whole sordid business. The affair is confirmed by the family of Doris Castlerosse. She, the lady in question, a high-society socialite whose favourite saying was: “There’s no such thing as an impotent man, only an incompetent woman.” Such was her own competence that she managed to have an affair with Cecil Beaton, who was gay. She was notorious for the skill with which she slept her way up the social ladder of London; she had already had Randolph Churchill before graduating from son to father. We needn’t feel too sorry for Clemmie. While Winston was sliding about with Doris on the Riviera (and painting her, three times, once reclining seductively), Clemmie was cruising the far east with an urbane man named Terrance, with whom she may or may not have had an affair. Those were the days, eh? This wasn’t the finest hour for Winston and Clemmie’s relationship, then: D-day was even mentioned, as in divorce. But then an unlikely saviour came to rescue the marriage: Adolf Hitler. Winston realised that the threat from Nazi Germany might be more important than cavorting about in the south of France. Clemmie wanted to be at his side as he battled to wake the world up to the danger and later, when he took it on, they became a unit again. So, big deal; powerful man has brief affair with serial mistress before going back to his wife – hardly the first time that’s happened. True, and Churchill’s reputation probably won’t suffer too much as a result, even if his marriage might have to be seen in a different light. It becomes more momentous when you start thinking about the what-ifs. What if the affair had carried on, and Winston’s eye had been more on Doris than what was going on in Berlin and Europe? What if Clemmie hadn’t returned to his side to be his rock? Would he have been able to summon up the same blood, toil, tears and sweat? Then we start to get into The Man in the High Castle territory. Plus, it’s a bloody good story. Outrageous toffs, adultery, fascists – what more could you want? Blackmail? It almost has that as well; the portrait Churchill painted of Castlerosse reclining suggestively always raised that possibility. And she’s such an alluring character – beautiful, ambitious, manipulative, then tragic. She died young, alone and lonely, of an overdose. The slide is my favourite detail. I wonder if it’s still there and, if so, whether the King of Saudi Arabia, who now owns the house, uses it. Of course he does. It gets better: on closer inspection, I think you can see Churchill’s trunks floating after splashdown. Ha, they’ve come off – he’s naked in the water. It’s certainly a different image from cigar and victory sign. Maybe history does need to be rewritten after all."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"technology/2018/mar/04/will-2018-be-the-year-of-the-neo-luddite","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-04T15:14:50Z","webTitle":"Will 2018 be the year of the neo-luddite?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/mar/04/will-2018-be-the-year-of-the-neo-luddite","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2018/mar/04/will-2018-be-the-year-of-the-neo-luddite","fields":{"headline":"Will 2018 be the year of the neo-luddite?","bodyText":"One of the great paradoxes of digital life – understood and exploited by the tech giants – is that we never do what we say. Poll after poll in the past few years has found that people are worried about online privacy and do not trust big tech firms with their data. But they carry on clicking and sharing and posting, preferring speed and convenience above all else. Last year was Silicon Valley’s annus horribilis: a year of bots, Russian meddling, sexism, monopolistic practice and tax-minimising. But I think 2018 might be worse still: the year of the neo-luddite, when anti-tech words turn into deeds. The caricature of machine-wrecking mobs doesn’t capture our new approach to tech. A better phrase is what the writer Blake Snow has called “reformed luddism”: a society that views tech with a sceptical eye, noting the benefits while recognising that it causes problems, too. And more importantly, thinks that something can be done about it. One expression of reformed luddism is already causing a headache for the tech titans. Facebook and Google are essentially huge advertising firms. Ad-blocking software is their kryptonite. Yet millions of people downloaded these plug-ins to stop ads chasing them across the web last year, and their use has been growing (on desktops at least) close to 20% each year, indiscriminately hitting smaller publishers, too. More significantly, the whole of society seems to have woken up to the fact there is a psychological cost to constant checking, swiping and staring. A growing number of my friends now have “no phone” times, don’t instantly sign into the cafe wifi, or have weekends away without their computers. This behaviour is no longer confined to intellectuals and academics, part of some clever critique of modernity. Every single parent I know frets about “screen time”, and most are engaged in a struggle with a toddler over how much iPad is allowed. The alternative is “slow living” or “slow tech”. “Want to become a slow-tech family?” writes Janell Burley Hoffmann, one of its proponents. “Wait! Just wait – in line, at the doctor’s, for the bus, at the school pickup – just sit and wait.” Turning what used to be ordinary behaviour into a “movement” is a very modern way to go about it. But it’s probably necessary. I would add to this the ever-growing craze for yoga, meditation, reiki and all those other things that promise inner peace and meaning – except for the fact all the techies do it, too. Maybe that’s why they do it. Either way, there is a palpable demand for anything that involves less tech, a fetish for back-to-basics. Innocent Drinks have held two “Unplugged Festivals”, offering the chance of “switching off for the weekend ... No wifi, no 3G, no traditional electricity”. Others take off-grid living much further. There has been an uptick in “back to the land” movements: communes and self-sustaining communities that prefer the low-tech life. According to the Intentional Community Directory, which measures the spread of alternative lifestyles, 300 eco-villages were founded in the first 10 months of 2016, the most since the 1970s. I spent some time in 2016 living in an off-grid community where no one seemed to suffer mobile phone separation anxiety. No one was frantically checking if their last tweet went viral and we all felt better for it. Even insiders are starting to wonder what monsters they’ve unleashed. Former Google “design ethicist” Tristan Harris recently founded the nonprofit organisation Time Well Spent in order to push back against what he calls a “digital attention crisis” of our hijacked minds. Most of the tech conferences I’m invited to these days include this sort of introspection: is it all going too far? Are we really the good guys? That tech firms are responding is proof they see this is a serious threat: many more are building in extra parental controls, and Facebook admitted last year that too much time on their site was bad for your health, and promised to do something. Apple investors recently wrote to the company, suggesting the company do more to “ensure that young consumers are using your products in an optimal manner” – a bleak word combination to describe phone-addled children, but still. It’s worth reflecting what a radical change all this is. That economic growth isn’t everything, that tech means harm as well as good – this is not the escape velocity, you-can’t-stop-progress thinking that has colonised our minds in the past decade. Serious writers now say things that would have been unthinkable until last year: even the FT calls for more regulation and the Economist asks if social media is bad for democracy. This reformed luddism does not however mean the end of good, old-fashioned machine-smashing. The original luddites did not dislike machines per se, rather what they were doing to their livelihoods and way of life. It’s hard not to see the anti-Uber protests in a similar light. Over the past couple of years, there have been something approaching anti-Uber riots in Paris; in Hyderabad, India, drivers took to the streets to vent their rage against unmet promises of lucrative salaries; angry taxi drivers blocked roads last year across Croatia, Hungary and Poland. In Colombia, there were clashes with police, while two Uber vehicles were torched in Johannesburg and 30 metered taxi drivers arrested. Imagine what might happen when driverless cars turn up. The chancellor has recently bet on them, promising investment and encouraging real road testing; he wants autonomous vehicles on our streets by 2021. The industry will create lots of new and very well-paid jobs, especially in robotics, machine learning and engineering. For people with the right qualifications, that’s great. And for the existing lorry and taxi drivers? There will still be some jobs, since even Google tech won’t be able to handle Swindon’s magic roundabout for a while. But we will need far fewer of them. A handful might retrain, and claw their way up to the winner’s table. I am told repeatedly in the tech startup bubble that unemployed truckers in their 50s should retrain as web developers and machine-learning specialists, which is a convenient self-delusion. Far more likely is that, as the tech-savvy do better than ever, many truckers or taxi drivers without the necessary skills will drift off to more precarious, piecemeal, low-paid work. Does anyone seriously think that drivers will passively let this happen, consoled that their great-grandchildren may be richer and less likely to die in a car crash? And what about when Donald Trump’s promised jobs don’t rematerialise, because of automation rather than offshoring and immigration? Given the endless articles outlining how “robots are coming for your jobs”, it would be extremely odd if people didn’t blame the robots, and take it out on them, too. Once people start believing that machines are a force of oppression rather than liberation, there will be no stopping it. Between 1978 and 1995, the Unabomber, Ted Kaczynski, sent 16 bombs to targets including universities and airlines, killing three people and injuring 23. Kaczynski, a Harvard maths prodigy who began to live off-grid in his 20s, was motivated by a belief that technological change was destroying human civilisation, ushering in a period of dehumanised tyranny and control. Once you get past Kaczynski’s casual racism and calls for violent revolution, his writings on digital technology now seem uncomfortably prescient. He predicted super-intelligent machines dictating society, the psychological ill-effects of tech-reliance and the prospect of obscene inequality as an elite of techno-savvies run the world. The American philosopher John Zerzan is considered the intellectual heavyweight for the anarcho-primitivist movement, whose adherents believe that technology enslaves us. They aren’t violent, but boy do they do hate tech. During the Unabomber’s trial, Zerzan became a confidant to Kaczynski, offering support for his ideas while condemning his actions. Zerzan is finding himself invited to speak at many more events, and the magazine he edits has seen a boost in sales. “Something’s going on,” he tells me – by phone, ironically. “The negative of technology is now taken as a given.” I ask if he could forsee the emergence of another Unabomber. “I think it’s inevitable,” he says. “As things get worse, you’re not going to stop it any other way,” although he adds that he hopes it doesn’t involve violence against people. There are signs that full-blown neo-luddism is already here. In November last year, La Casemate, a tech “fab lab” based in Grenoble, France, was vandalised and burned. The attackers called it “a notoriously harmful institution by its diffusion of digital culture”. The previous year, a similar place in Nantes was targeted. Aside from an isolated incident in Mexico in 2011, this is, as far as I can tell, the first case since the Unabomber of an act of violence targeting technology explicitly as technology, rather than just a proxy for some other problem. The French attackers’ communique was published by the environmentalist/anarchist journal Earth First! and explained how the internet’s promise of liberation for anticapitalists has evaporated amid more surveillance, more control, more capitalism. “Tonight, we burned the Casemate,” it concludes. “Tomorrow, it will be something else, and our lives will be too short, in prison or in free air, because everything we hate can burn.” If the recent speculation about jobs and AI is even close to being correct, then fairly soon “luddite” will join far-right and Islamist on the list of government-defined extremisms. Perhaps anti-tech movements will even qualify for the anti-radicalisation Prevent programme. No one wants machines smashed or letter bombs. The wreckers failed 200 years ago and will fail again now. But a little luddism in our lives won’t hurt. The realisation that technological change isn’t always beneficial nor inevitable is long overdue, and that doesn’t mean jettisoning all the joys associated with modern technology. You’re not a fogey for thinking there are times where being disconnected is good for you. You’re just not a machine.

American medicine, though famously litigious, protects its residents (trainees), who work as hard as their British counterparts, and often make critical decisions, sometimes unsupervised, but rarely unsupported. I’ve trained in both systems, as a surgical senior house officer in Britain and a radiology resident in the US, and the difference between the two systems for trainees is stark. In the US residents must gradually earn their independence; in Britain independence isn’t earned but assumed. I was on call overnight, unsupervised in a busy A&amp;E in London 18 months after qualifying from medical school, with no consultant or registrar on site. This would be unthinkable in the US. I never complained because I enjoyed the independence and felt supported by the nurses. In hindsight, I feel goosebumps knowing that I was only one catastrophic error from facing the same fate as Hadiza Bawa-Garba, the paediatric registrar convicted for manslaughter for missing sepsis. In the US, training programs are monitored by the Accreditation Council of Graduate Medical Education (ACGME). If several residents complain that they are shortchanged by a training program – ie they are not taught well or are unsupported – the ACGME disqualifies the program and the hospital loses residents. As a resident I had protected time to attend lectures. I was amazed by how invested the attendings (consultants) were in my education – they took my knowledge, or lack of it, personally. A big difference between the US and Britain is that residents usually stay in the same hospital in the US and know the system and its idiosyncrasies and the consultants monitor their progress. Sometimes I found the degree of supervision intrusive, having worked so independently in the NHS. Now that I’m an educator, I understand. I have one major educational responsibility: making sure radiology residents don’t miss emergencies of the vascular system – some potentially fatal ones – while on call overnight. When residents detect them and save patients’ lives, credit goes to them. However, if they miss them and the patient experiences an adverse outcome because of the miss, the blame falls on me. I’m aware of this asymmetry, but I think it’s only fair – the resident works when I sleep. Also, it motivates me to put in that extra effort making sure they’re competent in dealing with emergencies. When I tell American physicians the plight of Bawa-Garba, they’re incredulous that she was unsupported by her consultant. The US medical system has many faults, but it does not throw the trainee under the bus. Dr Riordan, Bawa-Garba’s consultant, must share some blame when Jack Adcock tragically died from sepsis. Had Jack died from delayed diagnosis of sepsis in the US, it is likely that the hospital would have been sued, but Bawa-Garba would have been dropped from the lawsuit. The lawsuit would probably not have gone to jury trial because the hospital would have settled, potentially for millions of dollars. The fiscal punishment would have forced the hospital to make systemic changes and use resources so that another child didn’t die from sepsis. A year after Jack’s death, Rory Staunton, a 12-year-old boy, was seen in the emergency department of New York University (NYU) hospital complaining of vomiting and fever, a day after scraping his arm playing basketball. His doctors sent him home with paracetamol and fluids, thinking he had flu. His condition deteriorated and he returned to the hospital, and three days later he died from septic shock in the intensive care unit. No one went to jail for Rory’s death. NYU was found negligent for systemic errors – notably that a blood test for white blood cells, cells that fight infection, which are not normally raised in a flu but were raised in Rory’s blood, was obtained but never reviewed. Rory’s parents lit a sweeping fire of awareness. The mainstream media publicised Rory’s death. The media did not blame incompetent doctors, but inadequate systems, for his death. A private charity in Rory’s name raises awareness of sepsis. Realising that sepsis is a deadly deceiver that can easily be missed, after Rory’s death American hospitals developed protocols for potential sepsis. At my institution, anyone with suspected sepsis must have a chest x-ray to look for pneumonia, and the x-ray must be reported by a radiologist within 30 minutes. It took 90 minutes to perform Jack Adcock’s chest x-ray but it was never read by a radiologist. When we see pneumonia on a chest x-ray, we call the physician straight away. Had Bawa-Garba worked in a hospital in the US, she would have been alerted by a radiologist within 30 minutes of the x-ray being done that Jack had pneumonia. Jack would have received his antibiotics sooner. I don’t blame British radiologists – there aren’t enough of them to read chest x-rays, let alone read them in 30 minutes. It is ironic that in the deeply individualistic US, medical errors are blamed on systems but in the collectivist NHS, individuals are blamed for errors. Rory Staunton’s death saved thousands of lives as hospitals learned from NYU’s systemic errors and became safer. Bawa-Garba’s conviction for manslaughter, and erasure from the medical register, will not make the NHS any safer.

What’s on the menu at the all-new Noma?","bodyText":"The last of 16 courses from the debut seafood menu at the born-again restaurant Noma in Copenhagen is a plankton cake: a Kermit-green hockey puck, dusted with a reddish powder. Perhaps it was the cognitive dissonance of “plankton” and “cake”, but even now I don’t even know if I liked it or not. Before that, there had been venus clams, dried sea cucumber ovaries, ant sauce and sea snail broth – not as discombobulating as the plankton, but Instagram-pretty and cunningly delicious; a triumph of fresh thinking, immaculate technique and great suppliers. Noma is perhaps the most influential restaurant of the past decade, responsible for all the foraged, pickled and dried stuff you see on menus everywhere. But in February last year, its head chef, René Redzepi, decided to close, throw all the pieces up in the air and see where they landed. His united nations of chefs has landed on a former patch of wasteland on the edge of the city, where the Danish starchitect Bjarke Ingels has designed a complex of buildings inspired by the traditional Scandinavian sæter, or farmstead. The kitchen has glass ceilings so that chefs get to see daylight; the main dining room is a soothing oak cocoon accented with dried fish and seaweed. Eventually, there will be greenhouses, rooftop gardens, a sauna and vegetable plots. It is what El Bulli might have become had Ferran Adrià not tired of hospitality. As Redzepi serves us a sea urchin, beach rose and pumpkin-seed dish that sends flavour memories hadron-colliding round my mind, the man’s restless energy is almost tangible. Days after reopening, he is already talking about where the next pop-up may be. The usual caveats apply: some of the food is challenging and much is tweezered, but if you’re not keen on opera, you don’t go to see Parsifal. This isn’t comfort food. You may want to plan for a Copenhagen hotdog an hour or so afterwards. My Danish companion and I argue whether it is “hyggelig”. I say not – there are no candles or bread and butter. She says the staff and natural materials make it so. Has Noma done it again? Can it reach the heights which saw it crowned the best restaurant in the world a record four times? No question, should it wish to, but this feels to me like the beginning of a whole new journey."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"education/2018/mar/03/six-of-the-best-apps-for-e-learners","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-03T09:00:14Z","webTitle":"Six of the best apps for e-learners","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2018/mar/03/six-of-the-best-apps-for-e-learners","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/education/2018/mar/03/six-of-the-best-apps-for-e-learners","fields":{"headline":"Six of the best apps for e-learners","bodyText":"Pomodoro timers “Pomodoro” refers to a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 80s (not a pasta sauce). While studying at university, Cirillo often struggled to use his study time efficiently. So he had an idea – he grabbed the tomato-shaped kitchen timer the method is named after, set it for a few minutes and focused solely on studying. He then rewarded himself with a break. It worked: by breaking the task into bitesize chunks, he found he was able to better focus on the task at hand and ultimately get more done. This simple-but-effective method has spawned many an app, from the Marinara Timer (iOS, Android) to the PomoDone (Android). Many are free to download. For distance learners who struggle with motivation and scheduling, it’s worth a try. Trello Since e-classmates may be scattered around the country (or the world), it would be a logistical nightmare for students to physically meet for a group assignment. Project management apps such as Trello (iOS, Android) solve the problem. Online students can use the app to work on assignments in teams. It’s a very visual tool. Classmates can upload videos of themselves and there’s an inbox in which you can monitor the progress of study tasks. Wunderlist Like Trello, this app is available to download from both iTunes and Google Play stores and is another great little tool for self-motivation. It allows users to keep track of coursework, from setting deadline reminders to organising lists of assignments. You can share your lists in order to collaborate with other students on your course. Moodle and Blackboard If you’ve just enrolled on a distance learning course and haven’t already come across these two apps, you’ll want to download soon. Many online courses use Moodle or Blackboard as a tool for students to access learning resources. The Moodle app allows students to read materials on the move; check deadlines; engage in course activities; keep up to date with messages; track their progress and even submit assignments. Mendeley Wherever you’re studying, you’ll need to reference your assignments properly. Mendeley (iOS, Android) is a useful tool for organising and citing sources in coursework and essays. Like many apps, you can install Mendeley on your phone and sync it with your computer for when you’re working on that device. Hold The trouble with a guide like this is that apps can be a distraction in themselves. A 2017 study by the University of Texas found that having a smartphone within eyeshot alone can reduce productivity and students’ grades. But before you take a pomodoro, hunt down the Hold app (iOS, Android), which launched in Norway two years ago and received 50,000 downloads in its first three months. The Hold app could help allay your phone addiction – at least long enough to finish an essay. Users can accumulate points for every 20 minutes they don’t use their mobile phone. Points continue to accumulate until a student interacts with their device and they can then exchange these goods and services within the app’s marketplace.

For starters, it featured a whole lot of Negan, who oscillates between a layered and threatening villain and rootin’ tootin’ doofus. It picked up straight after Carl’s burial, so there was a danger it could be one 44-minute close-up of of Rick’s bottom lip wobbling. And it also brought the Trash Pandas back, who, and let’s be fair to them, are more stupid than most geese. But it didn’t go wrong. Zipping between various characters’ points of view kept it brisk. It had some great moments and climaxed with a nice chat between Rick and Negan which, while hardly the diner scene in Heat, raised the stakes nicely. Rick and Michonne’s decision to deal with Carl’s passing by indulging in a cathartic zombie-killathon was definitely more engaging to watch than a load of snot and weeping. (Top marks to the makeup team too for the poor zombie who managed to rip his entire face off on Alexandria’s gate.) Perhaps not having the two of them sobbing in a heap for the whole episode was a slight emotional cop-out, considering the magnitude of what they’ve been through. But one of the major criticisms hurled at this show’s recent seasons is pacing that makes glaciers look like sports cars. I for one was pleased this episode had Rick and Michonne actually doing things as opposed to quietly telling each other how sad they were. They did that too, of course, but doses of it were kept mercifully small. The title cards used to segment the narrative into various characters’ points of view allowed the episode to hop around various timelines, and it’s a technique the show should use more often. Yes, Enid’s chunk was duller than an insurance conference PowerPoint slide, but the rest zinged along nicely. A small part of me always lights up when it looks like we’re in for a Simon-heavy episode, and this one was a peach. Having seen that the Trash Pandas were now Zombie Trash Pandas, you knew exactly what was coming when he confronted Jadis: Pandamonium. Yet, here, Simon’s penchant for mass murder, at the risk of sounding like a monster, felt justified. When he suggests to Negan that it would be easier to simply wipe out the troublesome elements and start again, you have to grudgingly agree with him. Based on the nascent signs of discord here, I’m intrigued by the proposition of Simon and Negan coming to blows. Now, of course, Simon’s gone directly against Negan’s wishes, so it’s inevitable. Simon clearly never had any intention of getting away with it, given his clear wish to repeat the action at the Hilltop and Kingdom. So he’s either taking the initiative, making a decision he thinks Negan will come to realise is the right one, or Simon’s maneuvering for power. Whichever it is, I’m eager to see how it plays out. Plaudits must once again go to Steven “Simon” Ogg. He seems to be having a swell old time cranking everything up to 11 without it boiling over into parody. Jeffrey Dean Morgan, take note. I also – and brace yourself – enjoyed my time with the Trash Pandas. It wasn’t just because they got their comeuppance for being quadruple-crossing goons, either. It was compelling to see Jadis’s power get snatched away in increments: first, the guns; then Jadis’s authority when Simon made her apologise; and, finally, her followers themselves. The fact that Jadis’s “Me Jane, You Tarzan” style of speaking was an act didn’t make it any less annoying at the time, but at least when she no longer had need for it Jadis got some much-needed fleshing out. She was understandably broken after being forced to grind all her friends into doner meat, in the episode’s gory highlight. Up to this point, Pollyanna McIntosh has been a much better actor than the Rizla-thin character of Jadis has deserved. This episode, at last, allowed her to flex her thespian muscles, and now she’s abandoned her ludicrous Trash Panda lexicon, I hope we end up seeing more of her. Whether Jadis will seek revenge on Rick for abandoning her is yet to be seen, but Simon had definitely better watch his back. I’ve owned paperclips that I care more about than the woodland clan, so I’m not going to dwell on Enid and Aaron’s brief and fairly pointless internment. One has to hope these arboreal oafs have a huge part to play in future episodes, because any all all time spent with them is both boring and intensely irritating. So the last thing I want to touch on before I go away is the gradual softening of Negan. I’m enjoying it quite a lot. It seems like he genuinely does want to “save” people, even if his methods for doing so are “a bit killy”. He seemed genuinely deflated at the news of Carl’s death, and it’s interesting that, when Negan and Rick eventually face off, they’ll both be doing so, in their minds, to avenge him. For me, Negan going in guns blazing and blaming Rick for Carl’s not-aliveness was a little heavy-handed after the apparently genuine concern he’d shown. But I’m definitely warming to him. This season’s efforts to make him a more rounded character are working. Though let’s not get carried away – it’s taken the best past of two seasons to accomplish even a fraction of the depth The Governor had managed in five episodes. All in all, I thought The Lost and the Plunderers was pretty good. While far from perfect, the show’s producers seem to have learned from lessons of the past. As we hurtle towards the opener-finale perineum, classically the saggiest part of any season of the show, let’s see if the quality can stay this high."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/mar/02/i-cant-afford-to-go-to-my-friends-parties","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-02T12:35:07Z","webTitle":"I can’t afford to go to my friends’ parties","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/mar/02/i-cant-afford-to-go-to-my-friends-parties","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/mar/02/i-cant-afford-to-go-to-my-friends-parties","fields":{"headline":"I can’t afford to go to my friends’ parties","bodyText":"Over the next year, a lot of my close friends are getting married, turning 30 or having hen parties.

That’s why we wrote our open letter","bodyText":"The landscape of television is changing rapidly – and so are the faces in front of the camera. We have a female Doctor Who. Undercover and Guerrilla placed black protagonists front and centre in prime-time drama, while Chinese Burn explores the lives of young East Asians in London. Streaming services bring us subtitled drama not only from Europe, but from Asia and South America. And yet, check the writers who are considered important and reliable enough for a 9pm prime-time slot “from the writer of …”, and you’ll find the vast majority are men. Female screenwriters have been aware of this for a long time. We all have our war stories. The exec who said “We already have a show written by a woman”, or the commissioner who felt that a female lead wouldn’t appeal to a wide audience. The times we’ve been the only woman in the writing team, routinely talked over and ignored. Like everyone else, we love to grumble … but add our personal experiences to the available facts and figures, and it’s clear that British television has a genuine problem. When an article listing one major channel’s commissions for 2018 was published, with only one woman’s name on it, the grumbling coalesced into a protest. We sent an open letter written to commissioners and to the industry in general. I’ve been relatively lucky: I’ve worked with many talented women, some of whom were writing television for the first time. I signed the letter not in anger, but in hope. Because I don’t believe there is conscious or deliberate prejudice against women writers. The problem is a web of interlinked issues, all of which threaten the industry’s survival in this multiplatform age. It lies in the commissioners’ preference for an informal A-list of writers whose names guarantee viewers and awards – but who can’t possibly write everything, and whose dominance prevents other writers from rising through the ranks. It lies in the reduced funding for smaller channels, where up-and-coming writers would once have cut their teeth on lower budget commissions. In a lingering subconscious belief that men’s stories are universal and women’s are not, that anything written by a woman will be for a niche audience. In a writers’ room culture that often rewards the loudest voices, or encourages competition instead of collaboration. In the rise of “authored series” by a single writer, which reduce the opportunities available for writers moving up the ladder. A firm that trains no apprentices may get fantastic work from its current workforce, but in the long term, it’s doomed. These problems threaten far more than the livelihoods of women writers. They threaten the quality and the relevance of everything the industry creates. And it’s not just about us. In publishing this letter, we’re very aware that there are many others who also never make it on to that hallowed list of “safe pairs of hands”. We’re aware that there are no black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) screenwriters with the reputation to land a prime-time authored series. That, where working-class writers once moved through the training ground of the soaps to single plays and then series, money and geography now exclude them from networking, training, and the unpaid or underpaid “shadow schemes” that lead to regular writing work. That disabled writers face physical and financial challenges even getting to meetings. That women in their 40s and above find work drying up, while male writers the same age are hailed as experienced professionals. These categories are not exclusive. The letter was signed by BAME, working-class, older, disabled, lesbian and queer women. Our interests intersect, and the change we seek must benefit everyone. So what can we do to bring television writing into the 21st century? I can’t speak for all writers, but I’d appeal to commissioners and executives to look beyond the obvious. There are new stories out there, told by new voices, that will attract new audiences – as well as existing ones. A writer from the soaps or from daytime television has a fantastic training in storytelling and economical production. A writer from children’s television or a digital platform has imagination, passion, and an understanding of future audiences’ interests and needs. We’re not asking for anything we don’t deserve. We’re ready to learn and develop our skills. We’re not charity cases – we’re untapped resources.

The revelations are the biggest sexual harassment scandal to date in a country that has mocked the #MeToo movement as political correctness run amok. The women both accused Leonid Slutsky, the chairman of the State Duma’s foreign affairs committee, of attempting to force himself on them while they negotiated with him for interviews. One of the women, Ekaterina Kotrikadze, said that Slutsky locked her in his office in Russia’s lower house of parliament when she approached him for an interview seven years ago. “He asked me to come without a camera,” she said in a live broadcast on the RTVI television station, where she is now deputy editor. “He brought me into his office, locked the door and tried to pin me against the wall and somehow kiss and touch me. I got away and ran.” Kotrikadze made her accusation against Slutsky after others from anonymous women appeared in the press. He brushed them off. “Attempts to make Slutsky into the Russian Harvey Weinstein just look like a cheap, shoddy provocation,” Slutsky wrote on Facebook. On Thursday evening another young woman, Darya Zhuk, a producer for the Moscow-based television station Dozhd, said Slutsky had “tried to kiss me by force, tried to touch me” when he came to the station’s studios for an interview in 2014. “Now I have just one question for you: will you still deny all of this?” she said in a video broadcast by the station. Slutsky could not be reached for comment on Zhuk’s accusations, his spokeswoman told the Guardian on Friday. There has been a strong backlash in Russia to the #MeToo movement, which has been derided as a liberal conspiracy. Prompted by the media and signs of official support, rejecting accusations of sexual harassment has been adopted into a larger cultural war with the west. “We don’t live in America or in Europe, why should we copy everything they do?” said Tamara Pletneva, the head of the Duma’s committee on family affairs, who came to Slutsky’s defence, as reported by the Russian-language site Meduza. “If a woman doesn’t want [attention], then nobody will harass her.” Slutsky also intoned that the accusations were a foreign plot. “Odd that they couldn’t find some Ukrainians or Americans to accuse me of this,” he said in a nod to Kotrikadze’s Georgian heritage. “Instead of taking away my authority, this will add to it.” There have been prominent public campaigns against sexual assault and domestic violence in Russia. The largest was #Янебоюсьсказать, or #IAmNotAfraidToSay, a campaign popularised by a Ukrainian activist named Anastasia Melnichenko that encouraged thousands of women in Ukraine and Russia to share stories of assault widely viewed as shameful or taboo in the public eye. But the social media campaign peaked in 2016 and then passed. In 2017, the Duma passed new legislation to decriminalise domestic abuse, downgrading assaults of spouses or children that result in bruising or bleeding but not broken bones to just 15 days in prison or a fine, if they do not happen more than once a year. Previously, they carried a maximum jail sentence of two years. Recently, Vladislav Surkov, a powerful Kremlin aide, wrote in a magazine column that he was worried about “the matriarchy” in the west managing sensitive political issues like Brexit or the migration crisis. “Our fatherland, protected by God, hasn’t been affected by feminism that much,” he wrote in the Russian Pioneer on Valentine’s Day. And on Russian state television earlier this week, a clownish presidential candidate named Vladimir Zhirinovsky called a female rival, Ksenia Sobchak, a “whore”. Sobchak doused him with a glass of water. Two allegations against Slutsky have now been lodged in the Duma’s ethics committee. So far, he has mainly treated the accusations as a joke. “I’m prepared to take a couple of journalist girls myself,” another member of parliament wrote on Facebook earlier this week. “Slow down colleagues.

Despite the hazardous weather conditions, Tottenham Hotspur are preparing to bid for perma-knacked Borussia Dortmund winger Marco Reus, who last month returned from an eight-month spell on the sidelines and has already scored two goals in his five appearances. Reus is contracted to Dortmund until the end of next season, and is also wanted by Liverpool. Jan Oblak has a buyout clause of €100m (£86.m) that ought to keep him in the Spanish capital until 2021, but Liverpool, Arsenal, Juventus and Paris Saint-Germain are all in the market for a man of his talents and could make Atlético Madrid an offer they quite literally cannot refuse. French sports daily L’Equipe report that Mario Lemina is the latest Southampton player to have caught the eye of Liverpool. The midfielder pitched up at St Mary’s from Juventus for £18m last summer and has scored one goal in 20 games, but now looks set to follow a path to Anfield recently trodden by Rickie Lambert, Adam Lallana, Dejan Lovren, Sadio Mané, Nathaniel Clyne and Virgil van Dijk. “Just take the scouts, it’ll be cheaper,” joked Saints legend Matthew Le Tissier on Twitter. David Moyes is doing his best Terminator impression and will not be bargained with, can’t be reasoned with, won’t feel pity or remorse or fear, and absolutely will not stop ... ever, until he has signed Harry Arter from Bournemouth. The West Ham manager has already had two bids for the Republic of Ireland midfielder turned down but is not prepared to take “no” for an answer. West Ham also plan to shovel more and more money at Manuel Lanzini in the hope it will prevent his head being turned by Liverpool. Tottenham midfielder Victor Wanyama is in talks with with his employers over a new and improved deal, while representatives from Liverpool and Manchester United are standing in the next room listening through glass tumblers pressed up against the wall, preparing to intervene if the talking stops. And finally, hipsters’ favourite and Hoffenheim manager Julian Nagelsmann is the latest name to be added to an increasingly long short-list of contenders to succeed Arsène Wenger. Last night, Arsenal lost 3-0 against Manchester City for the second time in five days in front of four men and a dog (official attendance: 58,420) at a snow-and vitriol-saturated Emirates Stadium."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/mar/02/panel-to-study-impact-of-coalmining-on-sydney-drinking-water","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-02T02:44:27Z","webTitle":"Panel to study impact of coalmining on Sydney drinking water","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/mar/02/panel-to-study-impact-of-coalmining-on-sydney-drinking-water","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/mar/02/panel-to-study-impact-of-coalmining-on-sydney-drinking-water","fields":{"headline":"Panel to study impact of coalmining on Sydney drinking water","bodyText":"Coalmining in Sydney’s drinking water catchment will be scrutinised by water experts, the New South Wales Department of Planning and Environment has announced. Enviroment groups, which have been warning for years of the impact of coalmining on drinking water welcomed the move but called for a moratorium on any expansion of mining activity until the conclusion of the review. The department announced that a new independent expert panel on mining in Sydney’s drinking water catchment would be established, and headed by the yet-to-be appointed NSW chief scientist and engineer. In the interim, emeritus professor Jim Galvin will be the acting chairman. The deputy secretary of planning services at the Department of Planning and Environment, Marcus Ray, said the panel would provide advice to the government on mining operations in protected areas near Sydney’s main water catchments such as the Avon, Cordeaux, Cataract and Woronora dams. The panel has been directed to consider recommendations from an audit conducted last year, which warned: “The cumulative, and possibly accelerated, impact of mining on flow regimes in the catchment is likely linked to the increased prevalence of the current longwall methods of underground mining.” The terms of reference include providing advice on specific proposals for expansion at the Russell Vale, Dendrobium, Metropolitan and Wongawilli mines. “There are proposals for a significant expansion of coal mining under the catchment special areas,” said the Lock the Gate Alliance NSW coordinator, Georgina Woods. “Consideration of these project must be halted while the panel considers the long-term damage these operations are inflicting on Sydney’s catchment and water security. “This is the time to choose. Do we want to safeguard Sydney’s drinking water, or let it be jeopardised for more coal mining?” The Coolong Foundation, which has campaigned on the issue for years, while welcoming the move, said Ray was wrong in declaring that mining had taken place so far without any big impact on water supply. “There clearly have been significant impacts, if major impacts include the drying out of upland swamps and streams due to widespread cracking of surface rocks,” the director of the Coolong Foundation for Wilderness, Keith Muir, said. “So the department needs independent advice on what should define ‘major impacts’. “I encourage the independent expert panel to get lots of exercise walking the areas that have been mined. Too often inquiries become mired in expert reports, when the truth is out there in what should be our pristine drinking water catchments.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/postcolonial-blog/2018/mar/04/pressure-builds-for-a-national-keeping-place-for-indigenous-remains","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-04T17:00:01Z","webTitle":"Pressure builds for a national keeping place for Indigenous remains | Paul Daley","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/postcolonial-blog/2018/mar/04/pressure-builds-for-a-national-keeping-place-for-indigenous-remains","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/postcolonial-blog/2018/mar/04/pressure-builds-for-a-national-keeping-place-for-indigenous-remains","fields":{"headline":"Pressure builds for a national keeping place for Indigenous remains","bodyText":"The commonwealth’s National Heritage List has finally recognised a symbolic part of central Melbourne where the bones of many Indigenous elders lay buried. For Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians the incorporation into the list of the Melbourne Domain Parkland and Memorial Precinct (including the Kings Domain Resting Place where the elders are buried) represents long overdue official acknowledgment of the injustice and disrespect shown to Indigenous dead. It is a moment of profound symbolic note, and perhaps a spark of hope emerging from a dark past, that Australia’s appalling historic and extant treatment of the Indigenous dead may finally be addressed. It is a move that should, ideally, be harnessed as the impetus for a long overdue national “keeping place” for displaced Aboriginal and Torres Strait islander ancestral remains. We should, perhaps, keep a lid on the optimism in this space where progress has been pitifully slow. The 109-hectare parkland and memorial precinct, south of the central business district between St Kilda Road and the Yarra River, is a peaceful parklands area of trees and water, and monumental structures including the Shrine of Remembrance, the observatory and Government House. Modern urban landscapes, not least in former or current capitals in outreaches of the old British empire, will often reflect and implicitly acknowledge the tensions of colonial history. The landscape of the Melbourne Domain Parkland and Memorial Precinct is an exemplar of this. For tens of thousands of years Aboriginal people camped and gathered in what is now the Royal Botanic Gardens on the Yarra banks, and around the lagoons and wetlands of the greater current city. As Melbourne City Council points out: The lakes of the Royal Botanic Gardens, while modified, are noted as some of the last surviving remnant wetlands within the Melbourne district which were present prior to European settlement ... they remain (with the Yarra River) as significant landscape markers of a pre-European landscape. A Victorian landscape has been imposed on the original Kulin Nation country of rich, almost perfect hunting grounds, with the river, lakes and lagoons. Government House with its totemic belvedere tower stands as a monument to colonial imposition and dispossession. The shrine opened in 1934 in response to Australia’s participation in the first world war, the conflict that so defined postcolonial non-Indigenous Australian identity. From a population of five million some 416,000 Australian men enlisted. About 60,000 died and more than 155,000 were physically wounded. The losses of the first world war and the narrative around national “sacrifice” and Anzac “spirit”, has always eclipsed in national consciousness and narrative the devastation of those other wars on the colonial frontier which also resulted, according to some estimates, in the deaths of at least 60,000 Indigenous people. So, the Kings Domain Resting Place with its modest monument speaks to more than just the 38 Indigenous people – from various parts of the continent – who have been buried there since 22 November 1985. That was when Indigenous activists, having successfully taken legal action to remove the bodies (many stolen from ancestral burial grounds by bone collector Murray Black) from the University of Melbourne, ceremonially proceeded to rebury them in Kings Domain. The reclaiming and repatriation of Indigenous remains coincided with a new generation of Indigenous land rights and social justice activism in the wake of the 1967 “citizenship referendum” and the 1972 establishment of the Aboriginal Tent Embassy. Gary Foley, a leading activist who was central to the land and civil rights, and repatriation, struggles is referenced in the commonwealth’s statement of the broader historical significance of Kings Domain Resting Place. It quotes him: This ... generated a major cultural, artistic and intellectual revival in Aboriginal Australia which led to a challenge of all institutions that Indigenous people regarded as involved in the cultural oppression of the Indigenous community. And, so, in the mid-1980s Museum Victoria started to become custodian for remains that were (often reluctantly) surrendered by the university, Freemason’s lodges, the state coroner and members of the public. The 38 interred in the domain are representative of those thousands that remained in the museum – and the thousands still held elsewhere – until provenance of country could or can be determined. The federal government has long been shamefully remiss in establishing a permanent keeping place, having turned its back on the urgent need for a structure of national significance in which to respectfully inter the bodies of many thousands of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people whose remains were stolen or displaced. It is a disturbing fact that so many Indigenous ancestral remains are still kept in cardboard boxes at major Australian collecting institutions. Some were stolen from traditional burial sites, morgues and other state institutions to meet demand for a gruesome 19th and 20th century international markets for Indigenous remains, especially skulls. Others were displaced during the construction of roads and buildings, and through mining. The South Australian Museum, for example, has the remains of some 3,000 to 5,000 individuals stored in cardboard boxes in a room in its overflow storage warehouse. Similarly, the National Museum of Australia stores about 500 sets of Indigenous remains at its warehouse in outer-Canberra. It emerged last week that in Fitzroy Crossing, Western Australia, the remains of about 50 Aboriginal people, their bones uncovered by erosion, are being stored in boxes inside a shipping container. Those currently kept in museums, some having been repatriated from medical and collecting institutions overseas, often can’t be provenanced to specific country. Indigenous belief holds that a spirit will be restless until the body to which it attaches is reconnected with country upon death. It’s more than three years since the commonwealth’s committee on Indigenous repatriation recommended the government invest in a keeping place in Canberra for the remains that can’t, for various reasons, be reunited with country. The government has not yet formally responded. A simple but telling point must be made: no government in Australia would act with such flagrant disregard and disrespect to the dead if they were other than Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders. The way supposedly civilised societies treat the dead is surely a window onto how they view the living. The official acknowledgment of the historical import of the Indigenous repatriation tragedy as symbolised in Melbourne’s landscape is an important moment. But the commonwealth is decades – some would say centuries – overdue when it comes to bringing dignity and more permanent closure to the sad and shameful issue of this continent’s stolen Indigenous dead.

This mightily impressive display was only a start – acid tests against Germany and the United States follow in the remaining games of the SheBelieves tournament. Then the real work of preparing for an assault on the World Cup begins in earnest. “I was a little bit nervous before the game, I had a few butterflies, but my players didn’t. That’s the most important thing,” said Neville. “There is great expectation and I love that expectation. On the bus, on the way to the ground, it felt right. It felt right standing in the technical area and the most important thing is the players are enjoying the raised expectations and the higher profile.” Such an emphatic result, even if Neville’s confidence was brimming in the buildup, was a surprise, especially considering this win over France was only the second time England have beaten them in 44 years. The rain had been teeming down all day here ensuring the wide open stands at the Mapfre Stadium were a sea of yellow seats and very few spectators. The hardy souls who braved the elements, however, were treated to a new dawn breaking. Neville has retained most the squad which reached the semi-finals of last year’s European Championships although there were some notable inclusions. Chelsea’s Anita Asante, who fell out of favour under former manager Mark Sampson in 2015, earned a recall while Manchester City’s highly-rated midfielder Keira Walsh, 20, earned just her second cap. With just a minute on the clock Fran Kirby almost opened the scoring when a close-range effort was saved by the France goalkeeper Karima Benameur. It was an encouraging start made even better on six minutes when Toni Duggan brilliantly curled in following good work by Nikita Parris and Kirby, the 20th international goal for the Barcelona forward. Asante’s afternoon sadly ended soon after, the Chelsea defender catching her leg in the turf and appearing to hurt her knee, allowing Abbie McManus to win her first cap. Jodie Taylor’s audacious chip hit the bar and was unfortunate not to rebound in off Benameur who was by the far the busier of the goalkeepers. On reflection, she will realise her effort to keep out Jill Scott’s strike on 27 minutes should have been better, though no one could argue Neville’s side did not deserve it when the industrious Taylor latched on to a Parris through-ball to put the dispirited French out of sight after 39 minutes. Two minutes after the break, Scott crossed for Kirby who scored with aplomb. Gaëtane Thiney’s deflected consolation off Millie Bright on 77 minutes mattered not."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"us-news/2018/mar/02/blacktip-sharks-in-sharp-decline-off-florida-coast-and-trumps-not-helping","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-02T15:00:06Z","webTitle":"Blacktip sharks in sharp decline off Florida coast – and Trump's not helping","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/mar/02/blacktip-sharks-in-sharp-decline-off-florida-coast-and-trumps-not-helping","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/mar/02/blacktip-sharks-in-sharp-decline-off-florida-coast-and-trumps-not-helping","fields":{"headline":"Blacktip sharks in sharp decline off Florida coast – and Trump's not helping","bodyText":"Blacktip sharks that journey down the Florida coast have declined in number so sharplythat researchers warn one of the largest migrations in US waters could grind to a halt because of the rapidly warming ocean. A stretch of coastal south-eastern Florida is usually thick with as many as 15,000 blacktip sharks on any given day in February and March as the animals forge southwards from the Carolinas region in search of agreeably warm waters in winter. However, aerial surveys of the migration last year found this number had slumped by around two-thirds, to 4,000 sharks. Researchers are still collating the 2018 tally but warn it is likely to match or even fall below last year’s level. “Last year we had very warm waters and very few sharks, and 2018 so far has been exceptionally warm,” said Dr Stephen Kajiura, a shark researcher at Florida Atlantic University. “We just aren’t seeing the numbers; there are remarkably few sharks. It really indicates that their migration is tied closely to temperature and if this trend continues we may not see sharks here any more.” For the past eight years, Kajiura and his team have used a light aircraft to video the migration of the sharks along a section of Florida coast stretching from Miami Beach to Jupiter Bay. He said that years with unusually warm waters have consistently resulted in sharks choosing not to move south, instead remaining in areas further north that match their ideal temperature of around 69F to 77F (21C to 25C). This trend may also be experienced by other sharks, such as the great white, which also migrate south in winter but do not hug the coast like blacktips and have not had their movement as closely studied. While the eight-year survey period is too short to draw definitive conclusions over the influence of climate change, previous research has shown that some sharks are likely to be pushed polewards as the ocean warms. The world’s seas are around 1.8F degrees (1C) warmer than a century ago, mainly due to a sharp increase in temperature over the past three decades. Sharks are ectothermic and cannot generate their own body heat, meaning they have to travel to find suitable temperatures. They are also reliant on prey fish that move for similar reasons. The loss of the sharks from Florida could lead to a series of knock-on consequences for a marine ecosystem that has developed with them as major predator. “Sharks have been coming down here for millennia, so a rapid shift in migration could result in a dramatic change to the ecosystem,” Kajiura said. “It could disrupt the balance of things, you could have an explosion in prey fish numbers, which could cause problems elsewhere.” Kajiura has faced an additional challenge in his research this year – the election of Donald Trump as president. When Trump makes one of his regular visits to Mar-a-Lago, his Florida resort, air traffic is shut down in the area, leaving shark-counting researchers grounded. Trump has a known aversion to sharks. Stephanie Clifford, a pornographic actor who goes by the stage name Stormy Daniels, said in a recently published interview that Trump is “terrified” of sharks and would never donate to a charity that helps the marine predators. “He was, like, obsessed,” said Clifford, who claimed she had an affair with Trump. “It’s so strange, I know.” Kajiura said he found Trump’s distaste for sharks “amusing” despite his research being hindered by the frequent flying bans. “When I’m flying I can see the sharks right off his beach, they are everywhere around there,” he said. “Blacktips bite more people than any other shark in Florida. I’m half tempted to let them know about all the sharks there but then I thought it’s probably best not to.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2018/mar/03/flint-town-netflix-docu-series-shines-light-on-the-harsh-reality-of-us-policing","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-03T10:00:15Z","webTitle":"Flint Town: Netflix docu-series shines light on the harsh reality of US policing","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/mar/03/flint-town-netflix-docu-series-shines-light-on-the-harsh-reality-of-us-policing","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2018/mar/03/flint-town-netflix-docu-series-shines-light-on-the-harsh-reality-of-us-policing","fields":{"headline":"Flint Town: Netflix docu-series shines light on the harsh reality of US policing","bodyText":"In the new Netflix documentary series Flint Town, city police officers are called to respond to a drug incident: patrol lights flash, the camera convulses and police are shouting and drawing their weapons. A split second later, the chaos stops and an officer is telling the suspect he’s cuffing: “Boy, you look just like your daddy.” The officer, Scotty Watson, checks the suspect for drugs and weapons while telling him how long he’s known his father. When Watson needs to inspect the boots of his friend’s son, the suspect, he offers him a seat in the police car so his socks don’t get wet on the damp ground. “It’s probably not unfair to say that these are some of the things that are happening in other departments, we just don’t really see these stories or hear these stories, there’s never been access in this way,” said the series co-director Drea Cooper. While the world might know Flint best as the city where the water crisis happened, the eight-part series unravels that snapshot description to show what happens when corruption, violence and poverty gnaw a city to its bone. Episodes are stacked with local and personal dramas tied to the series’ main characters – about a dozen police officers in Flint’s understaffed and underfunded force. Given the renewed scrutiny placed on police since demonstrators in Ferguson took to the streets to protest against police violence in August 2014, these armed officers are an unlikely vehicle for showcasing systemic issues. “It was our intention to do something that added additional layers to that,” said series co-director Jessica Dimmock. “It felt important to us that we go home with officers, we learn about their personal lives or personal struggles, we understand the emotional toll when someone’s mother dies or they are having relationship troubles. But also show that policing doesn’t exist in a bubble in this city.” The episode where Watson arrests his longtime pal’s son is loosely focused on the uptick in crime at Halloween, but also features Donald Trump’s visit to Flint while running for president. Lazier documentarians could have stuffed the episode with Trump’s quotes, but this trio, which is rounded out by co-director Zackary Canepari, instead train the camera on the people that surround Trump: the police officers nestled between Secret Service agents; the reverend who interrupts Trump mid-speech to explain they invited him to the city to thank him for his water donation, not to campaign; and the packed crowds of cameramen and community members. As the now-president smiles and waves, a black woman asks: “What did you mean by African Americans have nothing to lose if they vote for you?” (Trump’s full quote, from a 2016 campaign rally, was: “What do you have to lose by trying something new, like Trump? You’re living in your poverty, your schools are no good, you have no jobs, 58% of your youth is unemployed, what the hell do you have to lose?”) Trump tells the woman: “They have nothing to lose, believe me.” As Trump exits the room, a man shouts: “So will you admit President Obama is an American?” Then, the episode moves on. On to police officers canvassing neighborhoods ahead of a local vote that could lead to job cuts; to the arsons that plague the city every Halloween holiday and to officer Keith Urquhart’s response to a woman who says her children can’t walk down their own street because it’s infested by drug dealers. Urquhart heads to the neighborhood and takes apart a shoddy bench the woman said had been the site of drug deals. “The little bit we’re doing, maybe her son can walk down the street, clean, for two weeks,” Urquhart says. These glimmers of hope appear throughout the eight episodes, a punchy reminder of Flint’s resilience. “The show is about the people in this community that are fighting for it,” Canepari said. “These people are still there and they are still trying to make it work. They continue to try and make it work with nothing. And that’s an impossible situation.” Canepari and Cooper wanted to explore Flint more after spending time in the city to film a documentary, T-Rex, about the Olympic gold-medal winning boxer Claressa Shields. After completing the film, they continued to work in Flint and eventually convinced the police department to let the documentarians into their work and home lives. This includes police roll call the day after the Dallas police shooting in July 2016, when a black army veteran killed five police officers during an anti-violence demonstration. Officers take their turns explaining how this affects them before the lens focuses on their wives, fiancees and girlfriends, including a fellow officer. These women speak directly to the camera about what it means to be with a police officer: how they all have a plan for the worst, how they worry about being out with their partners off-duty, because someone they arrested might recognize them and how they are constantly on alert. “Whether it’s morning, night, while you’re sleeping, while you get your coffee, it never stops,” says Latoya Urquhart. In a news cycle dominated by outrage, the documentary’s unprecedented access to a police department pierces through snarky tweets and 24-hour news network arguments to present the complicated web that has left Flint one of the poorest cities of its size in the country.

A blink-and-you’ll-miss-it moment 43 seconds into the video animation that Putin presented to an enthusiastic audience in Moscow shows nine nuclear-tipped missiles descending on Tampa, St Petersburg and Clearwater on Florida’s west coast. The city of Tampa is home to the headquarters of the US military’s central command (USCentcom), situated at the MacDill air force base. Bob Buckhorn, the mayor of Tampa, watched the video on Thursday at the Guardian’s invitation and declared himself unimpressed. “I have the utmost confidence in our national security, military and intelligence community to secure our borders and protect our country,” he said. “It’s unfortunate that Mr Putin chose to include Tampa Bay in his threat but at this point we’ll write it off as overheated rhetoric designed to prop up his failing regime.” The mayor of neighbouring St Petersburg, Rick Kriseman, sounded equally chill. “We trust the inclusion of our region in that video was simply random,” he said. Military analysts have long considered Tampa Baya prime target for any nuclear attack on the US. Last year, the Tampa Bay Times published a lengthy analysis about the potential effects of a nuclear strike on MacDill and USCentcom. According to Alex Wellerstein, a nuclear weapons analyst at the Stevens Institute of Technology in New Jersey, USCentcom and US special operations command would be destroyed and everybody in a half-mile radius killed by the detonation of a 20-kiloton device over MacDill. George Cretekos, the mayor of Clearwater, said: “While Mr Putin may be implying that Florida is a target, MacDill has long been recognised as a critical component of the country’s national defence and I remain confident in our national security capabilities. “Because the video only shows one of the 50 states, ours, I don’t attach any special threat to the Tampa Bay area.” Donald Trump’s self-styled “winter White House” in Palm Beach, Mar-a-Lago, is far enough away to escape annihilation but would probably be rendered uninhabitable by nuclear fallout."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/mar/01/ruben-loftus-cheek-england-ambitions-injury-setback-crystal-palace","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-01T22:30:32Z","webTitle":"Ruben Loftus-Cheek’s England ambitions suffer injury setback","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/mar/01/ruben-loftus-cheek-england-ambitions-injury-setback-crystal-palace","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/mar/01/ruben-loftus-cheek-england-ambitions-injury-setback-crystal-palace","fields":{"headline":"Ruben Loftus-Cheek’s England ambitions suffer injury setback","bodyText":"Ruben Loftus-Cheek’s hopes of proving he merits inclusion in England’s World Cup squad have been dealt another blow after the midfielder suffered discomfort in a knee after his first full training session since recovering from ankle trouble. The Chelsea academy graduate, who had impressed for Gareth Southgate’s senior side in November’s friendlies, is on loan at Crystal Palace but has not featured since limping out of a defeat by Arsenal in late December. The 22-year-old has undertaken his rehabilitation back at his parent club and, with the Premier League champions opting against operating on the ankle, finally responded positively to non-invasive treatment after two months out. Loftus-Cheek trained fully with Chelsea’s under-23s at Cobham on Monday and, with a couple of follow-up sessions pencilled in, was due to return to Palace on Saturday with a view to working with the first team next week. However, he suffered knee pain immediately after that first run-out and, although the injury is considered to be a knock-on from his lengthy period out, his comeback has been delayed again. “The news had been very positive because the session, in which the ankle was being tested, had gone very well,” said the Palace manager, Roy Hodgson. “But he managed to pick up another very minor injury which now, of course, has to be treated before we get him back here. The good news is that the injury which kept him out for a long period of time – the ankle – seems to be much better. He is on the mend from that. But they now have to look at the minor injury [to the knee]. We are hopeful we see him back at Selhurst Park very soon.” Palace are hopeful they may have Loftus-Cheek available for the visit of Liverpool on 31 March but that would be dependent upon him not suffering any further setbacks. Martin Kelly and Jeffrey Schlupp have recovered from hamstring and knee ligament injuries respectively to train with Hodgson’s squad this week. Yet Palace, who have signed the former Liverpool goalkeeper Diego Cavalieri until the end of the season, will still have 11 first-team players unavailable against Manchester United on Monday, including Mamadou Sakho who is suffering pain from scar tissue in a calf. “His is not a mental problem,” said Hodgson of the France defender, who has featured only once since 9 December. “It’s a genuine injury, with the scar tissue related to an earlier injury.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"travel/2018/mar/24/20-best-campsites-europe-camping-greece-france-spain","type":"article","sectionId":"travel","sectionName":"Travel","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-24T07:00:16Z","webTitle":"20 of the best campsites in Europe","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2018/mar/24/20-best-campsites-europe-camping-greece-france-spain","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/travel/2018/mar/24/20-best-campsites-europe-camping-greece-france-spain","fields":{"headline":"20 of the best campsites in Europe","bodyText":"Le Clos du Lac, Provence, France Setting Mountains Pitches 50 Activities Fishing, swimming Perched at 1,485 metres on the edge of Écrins national park, this mountain site offers Instagrammable views from the tent door and a range of picture-perfect outdoor experiences.

Ahead of three days of talks on the issue this weekend, EU officials said the British government would have to reconsider the possibility of Northern Ireland effectively staying in the customs union and single market, a position it has previously rejected. The warning was echoed by the Northern Ireland affairs committee in Westminster, which published a report saying there was no evidence that a hi-tech alternative to a fortified border could be made to work in the time available. Two years ago the then Northern Ireland secretary, James Brokenshire, told the Guardian that goods and services could be allowed to flow freely across the Irish border by using hi-tech checks at crossing points similar to toll booths. This year the foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, repeated this suggestion, saying the crossing the border would be as frictionless as travelling between two London boroughs. But the members of the Northern Ireland affairs committee, comprising Conservative, Labour and Democratic Unionist (DUP) MPs, said the government had so far failed to find any technical means to avoid a hard border with customs checks, and there was “no evidence to suggest that right now an invisible border is possible”. They wrote: “The UK government has repeatedly underlined that the free movement of people across the border will not be affected and that no physical infrastructure will be put in place. However, the committee was unable to identify any border solution currently in operation across the globe that would enable physical infrastructure to be avoided when rules and tariffs diverge.” EU diplomats agreed at a meeting on Thursday that May needs to soften her stance on the “backstop” solution for avoiding a hard border if the EU is to agree on terms for the transition period and start discussing trade at a European council summit next week. Without agreement at the summit, the next point at which leaders would focus on the issue would be in June, creating huge time pressure on wider negotiations, EU sources said. Without agreement “then we are heading closer to the UK crashing out”, one diplomat said. Hopes are high that an agreement can be struck this time around, with diplomats seeing signs that the UK is willing to concede over previous sticking points on the draft withdrawal agreement, including on the status of people arriving during the 21 months of the transition period. “They are desperate for their implementation period,” one diplomat said. The EU is not insisting May accepts the withdrawal agreement’s protocol on Northern Ireland in its entirety, given the political bind she is in with the DUP, whose 10 MPs provide her with a working majority in the Commons. Brussels remains open to working on the two other options: a trade deal or bespoke technological solution that will be as effective in avoiding border infrastructure – notwithstanding the British report on the plausibility of a hi-tech option. However, the EU’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, told diplomats for the bloc that Ireland needed to see sufficient movement towards acknowledging that the “backstop” is a faithful translation of the December agreement in which the UK accepted that full regulatory alignment was an option. The EU published its draft withdrawal agreement on Thursday with barely any changes to the protocol on Northern Ireland. Talks between EU and UK officials will take place on Friday and through the weekend.The Brexit secretary, David Davis, is due to visit Brussels on Sunday and it is hoped he will sign off on an agreed formulation of words to allow for a successful European council summit. As well as playing down the prospects of a hi-tech alternative to a hard border, the British MPs’ report rejected Irish government suggestions that there could be a customs border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK after Brexit. They called for the government to publish “detailed proposals, without any further delay” on an “open and invisible border”. The pro-EU pressure group Open Britain said the report should “mark the end of ministerial flights of fancy” over the Irish border. The Labour MP Stephen Doughty, a supporter of the Open Britain campaign against Brexit, said: “The only way to avoid a visible border on the island of Ireland, and to also avoid an economic border across the Irish Sea, is for the whole of the UK to stay in the customs union and the single market.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2018/mar/24/country-diary-moment-when-spring-becomes-unstoppable-force-kirkham-abbey-north-yorkshire","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-24T05:30:15Z","webTitle":"Country diary: the moment when spring becomes an unstoppable force","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/mar/24/country-diary-moment-when-spring-becomes-unstoppable-force-kirkham-abbey-north-yorkshire","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/mar/24/country-diary-moment-when-spring-becomes-unstoppable-force-kirkham-abbey-north-yorkshire","fields":{"headline":"Country diary: the moment when spring becomes an unstoppable force","bodyText":"There’s a view I’m fond of, and it’s worth a short diversion up a steep, anthill-studded pasture to spend a while taking it in. Looking out over the sidewinder course of the Derwent, and the equally sinuous rail line to Scarborough with its toytown signal box, it takes in wooded valley flanks, a ruined priory, and the genteel Georgian doll’s house and sweeping parkland of Kirkham Hall. On this day, however, something felt wrong, though I had to close my eyes to realise what it was. It was the sounds. A peppery rash of shotgun fire had already made me tetchy, and now some trick of atmospherics, perhaps the layering of air in a clear, cold sky, meant that the other noises reaching my ear were coming from above. The murmurs of subsong, building for several weeks, were gone. Instead, a single goading crow barked over a funk rhythm emanating from a radio half a mile away where two hi-vis figures were working on the old river bridge. Behind that was the pulsed white hiss of traffic on the A64. From across the river, but seeming unnervingly close, the yowl of a chainsaw and the ratcheting chug of some arboreal torture device precipitated a scream of splitting wood, a sound of such violence that I cringed. Then two fighter jets streaked up the valley, pursued by their own raging sonic wake. It was as though a branch from the butchered tree had snagged a tear in the membrane of the sky, a split that ripped and crackled ferociously over my head. It took a few seconds for the air to still, and as it did, there was something new. Threading down fine and golden from the brutalised air, it expanded in my chest and behind my eyes. A skylark, lauding the light. A day or two later more snow came, but the genie was out, and the dawn chorus continued even as the flakes swirled – a Disney combination, too pretty to be real. When it melted, there was not one lark but five, letting down their Rapunzel song, and drawing hedgebound responses from chaffinches, dunnocks and the first yellowhammers of the year."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/lostinshowbiz/2018/mar/15/real-story-behind-kates-fingers-duchess-cambridge-cher-stephen-hawking","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-15T17:46:00Z","webTitle":"Digital manipulation: the real story behind Kate’s fingers","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/lostinshowbiz/2018/mar/15/real-story-behind-kates-fingers-duchess-cambridge-cher-stephen-hawking","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/lostinshowbiz/2018/mar/15/real-story-behind-kates-fingers-duchess-cambridge-cher-stephen-hawking","fields":{"headline":"Digital manipulation: the real story behind Kate’s fingers","bodyText":"This week, the makers of Netflix’s The Crown admitted that Claire Foy had been paid less for her portrayal of the Queen than Matt Smith had been for his go as Prince Philip. This is dismal news for a number of reasons, of course, but The Crown’s showrunners would be well-advised to cut as many costs as possible moving forward, because by the time they get to depicting 2003 they’ll need every penny they’ve got for Kate Middleton’s CGI hands. “Why are Kate’s fingers all the SAME length?” bellowed the front page of Monday’s Daily Mail, with the cute mixture of confusion and fury more routinely reserved for contentious subjects such as human beings generally trying to get on with their lives. Inside, two full pages (rather than this publication’s dignified one full page) were dedicated to the hot topic. Coverage included the dramatic revelation that bodily development begins in the mother’s womb, photographs of the Queen and Prince Philip holding up their own hands, placed on facing pages so that it looked a bit like they were waving at each other, and an impressive volume of cobblers pertaining to palmistry. This involved Johnny Fincham, who you’ll recognise as being the author of Palmistry: From Apprentice to Pro in 24 Hours, popping up with the not-remotely-alarming claim that Kate’s middle finger should be 2cm longer – which is quite a lot longer, really – than its neighbours. The Mail website actually ran a similar article six days earlier, which led to pickup the next day from the Sun and Mirror – with the latter reporting the finger-related news in more sombre fashion, noting that Kate’s fingers “are almost all the same length – and some people think that’s unusual”. Less sweeping, certainly, than the Mail’s “Why are Kate’s fingers all the SAME length?”. But before we move on to the Mail’s demand for an explanation (how was this allowed to happen?), Lost in Showbiz must briefly address the central conceit here: that Kate’s fingers are indeed all the same length. Before the concept of identically lengthed digits sends the nation’s royalists into a mad scramble, some bad news. The Mail’s smoking gun was a recent photo of the duchess holding a black purse, with a handy box drawn around Kate’s hand to show readers how freakishly uniform those fingers really are. Sadly, and this may well have been a coded cry for help by someone on the paper’s art desk, in drawing a straight line across Kate’s fingertips the Mail actually showcased how “all” of Kate’s fingers are obviously not the same length, and that, in fact, they are all very clearly different lengths. In the 2000s, Heat magazine pioneered the circle of shame as a way of highlighting egregious celeb crimes such as perspiration, but in 2018 there’s a new accusatory simulacrum in town, and it’s the rhombus of wrongness. Sure, rhombus obsessives may wish to point out that all the sides of the Mail’s misinformed quadrilateral weren’t actually equal, but we’re through the looking glass now. Equality is, apparently, subjective; not an absolute, but an optical illusion to be debated. Intriguing. Whether or not these hand shenanigans fall under the bracket of bodyshaming is a tricky issue as we are in uncharted waters, but with liberal killjoys having taken all the fun out of upskirt photos, perhaps fingers will become the last refuge of the paparazzi. Nature finds a way. And for photographers, a pivot to finger-based news is absolutely perfect. Historically, celebrities have frequently held up magazines and newspapers to hide their faces – but what if the face is no longer the target? To hide their fingers, A-listers would need to hold magazines backwards, and then you’re into thumb territory. Equally, the classic manoeuvre of holding out a palm to obscure a pap shot will now, ironically, give photographers exactly what they’re after. And photographers know that young, smartphone-addicted celebrities, dismayed as we all are by slow advances in the stylishness of touchscreen-compatible gloves, will do anything they can to avoid covering their fingertips. Maybe famous people will stop using smartphones altogether, inspiring a generation to ditch mobile devices, consume less news and therefore bring about the end of journalism. Perhaps celebrities will wear gloves and carry sausages around. Only time will tell. Back in the present, let’s celebrate this week’s brave and interesting experiment in redefining the parameters of news reporting. It goes without saying that if all the Duchess of Cambridge’s fingers were indeed identical that would be absolutely incredible and definitely worth two pages in any newspaper (caveat: this would need to include thumbs), but the concept of being able to make a statement while providing clear photographic proof to the contrary opens many journalistic doors. Perhaps we should expect, for instance, stories such as “Why has Jeremy Corbyn’s head fallen RIGHT off?” next to an annotated picture of Jeremy Corbyn’s head not having fallen off, or “Finally Theresa May takes action on Grenfell” next to literally any photograph of Theresa May. Sure, there’s that old problem of people bellowing “fake news”, but perhaps this is the perfect loophole? How can anyone quibble with your statement when you have included contrary evidence – a sort of pre-emptive apology – in the article itself? If nothing else, this could become a bold test of libel law: it might seem unwise to publish a false claim even if it comes with an instant retraction, but what does it really mean if one publishes a thing, but also the opposite of that thing, at the same time? Does it mean neither, in fact, exists? Does this create some sort of journalistic vortex? Did Cher get Stephen Hawking to turn back time? As well as displaying above-average competence vis-a-vis the whole space and time business, Stephen Hawking was very good at being famous and seemed to have a lot of fun with it. The last two days have seen social media flooded with photos of Hawking with the likes of Harry Styles, Barack Obama, the cast of The Big Bang Theory and Peter Stringfellow, but the week’s most intriguing celebrity tribute comes from Cher. “Will Remember Our luncheon Forever,” she wrote on Twitter. “It was amazing.” She followed this with a praise-hands emoji: understandable in the circumstances. But then comes the revelation that Hawking told the singer over lunch: “Cher, when time travel is perfected, history will [be] obsolete.” How did the topic come up? There’s only one conclusion to draw from all this: that Cher and Hawking held a lunchtime summit to discuss the real-life ramifications of If I Could Turn Back Time, the triumphant 1989 balladbanger in which Cher blended her quest for love with concepts of time travel and, with the line “If I could reach the stars I’d give ’em all to you”, the redistribution of celestial objects. One only hopes that Hawking’s comment didn’t put Cher off any hopes of bringing the song to life: time travel’s not ideal because if humanity has ever needed Cher, it’s right now in 2018, but a performance of Believe in outer space would be absolutely ideal."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"books/2018/mar/26/thrillers-while-you-sleep-stephanie-merritt-tangerine-christine-mangan-come-find-me-sarah-hilary","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-26T06:59:18Z","webTitle":"Thrillers review: While You Sleep; Tangerine; Come and Find Me","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/mar/26/thrillers-while-you-sleep-stephanie-merritt-tangerine-christine-mangan-come-find-me-sarah-hilary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/mar/26/thrillers-while-you-sleep-stephanie-merritt-tangerine-christine-mangan-come-find-me-sarah-hilary","fields":{"headline":"Thrillers review: While You Sleep; Tangerine; Come and Find Me","bodyText":"If Stephanie Merritt’s While You Sleep (HarperCollins, £12.99) were a horror film, its protagonist, Zoe Adams, would have you shouting at the screen as she repeatedly refuses to take seriously the signs of approaching peril. Zoe arrives on a remote Scottish island to find some peace, and to paint, as her marriage falls apart. She’s rented the McBride house, and owner Mick Drummond is strangely reluctant to let her learn anything about its past. On her first night on the island a barmaid tells her: “Staying out there on your own. In the middle of nowhere. That’s brave.” As the whispers and rumours coalesce, she learns its history – how a widow is said to have gone mad there a century ago, and killed her son; how a local boy vanished there on a dare the previous year. On her first night at the house, Zoe hears scratching sounds, mournful laments, and wakes from a strange, sexual dream with bruises like teeth marks. She keeps on dismissing events as mere “night terrors”, even when she learns that the house was built on the remains of a ruined chapel, itself built on an ancient pagan site. Merritt, who writes historical crime as SJ Parris, tells an alarmingly unnerving story here, shrewdly avoiding turning Zoe into a damsel in distress as she piles on the deliciously gothic chills. Christine Mangan’s debut, Tangerine (Little, Brown, £13.99), gives us another woman in danger to add to the current surfeit. Alice Shipley is living with her husband in the “still, arid heat” of 1950s Tangier, troubled by the “vaporous sheen” of her memories, and never leaving their apartment. These disturbing memories are packed “in boxes secure enough to ensure they would never let loose the secrets held within”. Mangan’s narrative flips between two perspectives – Alice’s and that of a former college roommate, Lucy Mason, who features darkly in Alice’s backstory and who now turns up in Tangier to see her. With the time shifting between the present and the past, each of the women recall their version of an event that took place “in the cold, wintry Green Mountains of Vermont”. The novel has been optioned for a film by George Clooney, with Scarlett Johansson set to star. It is an accomplished, ominous, evocative tale of spiralling obsession, skilfully pulled off – although next month I might put a temporary moratorium on unreliable female narrators before I become one myself. Come and Find Me (Headline, £18.99), the latest Marnie Rome novel, is a typically expert outing from Sarah Hilary. This time her detective, Rome, who is also in no way a damsel in distress despite her tragic past, takes on the escape from jail of one Michael Vokey. Horribly creepy, Vokey was imprisoned for an attack on a woman; it was “the perfect place for him to escalate to full-blown murder”, and he leaves a scene of unspeakably foul devastation behind him as he flees. Twisty and full of dead ends, Come and Find Me leads the reader on a merry dance as Rome and her crew try to track him down, dealing with everyone from the women who wrote disturbing letters to Vokey in prison, to his former cellmate, now hospitalised. Rome is as pleasingly astute as ever, and it is good to see the continued travails of her supporting cast.

I suspect he is deaf to requests. Framed by the vehicle’s split front windows, a landscape unfolds before us, two abstract planes of blood-dimmed sky and bone-white earth. It is a journey without end and one that seems to go nowhere. Are we even moving? His upper arms are invisible, as if his hands were fixed on the unseen steering wheel. Or is it that they have been chopped off at the elbows and there are no controls at all? Blue Chauffeur is one of the great and earliest works of the Polish painter Andrzej Wróblewski’s tragically brief career. It was produced in 1948, when he was just 21 and coming of age in a world that demanded its inhabitants take a position. Literally so, in the case of the Soviet-sanctioned social realism that would soon dominate the early 50s, with clearcut stories of war’s heroes and villains and newly empowered workers. More acutely, as his friend and posthumous champion, the director Andrzej Wajda once explained, this was a generation that felt they “were the voice of the dead”. Aged 14, Wróblewski himself had witnessed his father die of a heart attack while Nazis searched their home. As the tantalising, but at times frustratingly limited, first UK solo exhibition of his work makes clear, his answer to these pressures was, in a way, to give no answer. In place of ideological certainties, Wróblewski pursued an art of ambivalence, doubt, even helplessness. That makes his work very contemporary – he doesn’t tell us what to think or feel and it’s all the more troubling for it. Liquidation of the Ghetto – painted, perhaps pointedly, on the chauffeur canvas’s underside – includes a parent holding a lifeless child and bodies trampled underfoot. Yet it’s without drama or emotion: faces are hidden, eyes closed, gazes turned inwards. This didn’t win him many advocates in newly communist Poland. When he died at 29 in a mountaineering accident, he had only participated in two group exhibitions, though he produced around 150 paintings and 800 works on paper. And while his interrogative stance has since marked him out as one of Poland’s major visionaries, he remains little-known outside his home country. This looks set to change. His international fans include Luc Tuymans, master of muted studies in what painting can and can’t say, whose gallerist, David Zwirner, is staging this show. The double-sided canvas takes centre stage in the gallery’s first room. Upstairs are two more of Wróblewski’s best-known paintings, including Mother With Dead Child, another provocatively affectless treatment, where blue signifies death. These big loans are here to give context and heft to what dominates: watercolours, ink drawings and gouaches. There are many studies mixing up heads and figures with geometric abstraction, while suggesting the human cost of its utopian ideals. Two works depict Zampanò, the strongman from Fellini’s La Strada, who morphs from a Christ-like sad clown into a musclebound cipher, his body composed of coloured planes, his head tiny. Though in far shorter supply, some of the most riveting inclusions are bleak little landscapes in barely-there washes of paint. Their interest for Tuymans, an artist whose response to 9/11 was an anaemic still life with fruit and a pitcher, or the apparent influence on the younger, leading Polish art star Wilhelm Sasnal, is striking. Wróblewski once wrote that he wasn’t interested in making one-off masterpieces, but “a succession of works”. Moving from extermination to stunted everyday scenes, culled from life, memories and photos, it’s hard not to read his entire project as one of cultural trauma, infecting everything, tangible everywhere. In one memorable image of surreal domestic horror, the evening meal is a woman’s head on a plate. Where are we and when are we? This is the question that recurs. Is the chauffeur, for instance, on the way to a concentration camp, or trapped in the limbo between the communist aspirations and everyday shortfalls of postwar Poland? Executions were the subject of another landmark series, yet in all but one image, included here, the aggressors are absent, the victims standing quiet and meek. These figures are not so different from those left hanging, in what might be an ordinary Polish waiting room. A well-known ink drawing from a group made on the streets, recording reactions to announcements of Stalin’s death, is similarly pensive. No one cries or cheers, instead wondering, surely, what will happen now? The show’s final painting is the second and only other chauffeur that Wróblewski realised in oil, resurrected, after the thaw, in 1956. He’s back on the road, still blue, travelling through a broken-up, abstract world, chasing questions that won’t go away. Andrzej Wróblewski is at David Zwirner, London, until 14 April."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/mar/16/skripal-attack-talk-war-vladimir-putin-theresa-may","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-16T06:00:01Z","webTitle":"After the Skripal attack, talk of war only plays into Vladimir Putin’s hands | Simon Jenkins","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/16/skripal-attack-talk-war-vladimir-putin-theresa-may","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/16/skripal-attack-talk-war-vladimir-putin-theresa-may","fields":{"headline":"After the Skripal attack, talk of war only plays into Vladimir Putin’s hands","bodyText":"Do we really want war with Russia? Do we want to risk one, even a tiny one? The prospect has certainly taken British minds off Brexit. It has exhilarated the press. It has given Theresa May an immense boost and helped the defence lobby in its campaign for more money. There is nothing democracy seems to enjoy so much as contemplating war, to unite it and raise its spirits. It is never unpopular – beforehand. The official British response to the attempted killing of the Skripals has been precipitate but measured. We do not know the mix of greed, vendetta and shambles that may have fuelled the Salisbury outrage, but it is hard not to treat Moscow as guilty until proved innocent. May’s portfolio of expulsions and ostracisms is the traditional diplomatic ballet. It has received welcome support from the US, France and Germany. Matter closed? Sadly not. History warns us to distinguish the banality of a single incident from its wider contribution to an emerging crisis. When Archduke Franz Ferdinand was shot in Sarajevo in 1914, the killer was not a state agent but a terrorist with a gun. It could have been settled by a mediating conference. Instead, a continent roused to war fever craved escalation. Soon Austria declared war on Serbia, Germany on Russia and France on Germany. As AJP Taylor wrote afterwards, nothing “caused” the first world war. “Statesmen miscalculated and became prisoners of their own weapons.” At a certain point armed conflict was unavoidable, as nations raced to re-enact some primitive tribal rivalry. Russia’s method of settling its internal feuds is obscene and archaic. The BBC’s vivid profile of Vladimir Putin this week depicted a paranoid, money-obsessed bully who, in an international context, needed handling with firmness and clarity. But even if the Skripal poisoning was “state sponsored”, it was clearly a specific act against an individual, like the Litvinenko killing. Why elevate it, as May did this week, to the “unlawful use of force by the Russian state against the UK”? Parliament parroted the same nonsense. The Tories’ Tom Tugendhat said the poisoning “if not an act of war, was certainly a warlike act”. Labour’s Chris Leslie and John Woodcock worked themselves into a lather over “our country under attack” and “the gravity of the threat Russia poses to this nation”. In these bidding wars of exaggeration, words lose all meaning. Attacking people with poison is detestable. So are Russia’s infantile cyber-attacks and crude fake news trolls. They are unfriendly acts, but they are not war. Why be driven by some fiendish yearning for them to be so? Ever since the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1989, the west has revelled in the humiliation of Russia. Every act of the EU and Nato after 1989 was to the same destructive end. Russia’s neighbours were welcomed into the EU. Nato extended its defensive border to the edge of the Russian Federation, despite then president Boris Yeltsin (and to an extent Germany) pleading with the west “not to play with fire”. As Yeltsin plunged into his botched privatisations in the 1990s, London egged them on by opening its banks to handle Russia’s stolen billions. Britain was complicit in creating the world’s greatest kleptocracy, brazenly and for a quarter of a century. Even this week, the prime minister lacked the guts to face down the City of London and call a halt to Russian money laundering. All this is a grim echo of how the allies treated Germany after Versailles in 1919. They rubbed its nose in defeat, occupying its territory, destroying its dignity and stripping it of its flimsy wealth. Germany eventually found refuge in dictatorship. When in 2000 Russia found in Putin a leader capable of asserting a degree of order staging a nationalist revival, the west and Nato seemed almost to sigh with relief. Devoid of ideology or creed, Putin was a cynical autocrat of the old school. He was eager to liberate his country from the stain of cold war defeat. He wanted to reassert tsarist supremacy over Russia’s “space”, its Russian-speaking neighbours in parts of Georgia, Ukraine and possibly the Baltics. Nato had a recognisable enemy. Putin duly feasted on an image created for him by the west, of a Russia rising alone above a sea of misunderstanding, encirclement and ostracism, a country with little to be proud of but pride itself. His every misbehaviour seemed to invite an over-response. The the west kept them coming – as if wanting to strengthen him. Even on its own terms, the west can have no interest in declaring cold war 2.0. It may indeed be that Putin only understands power in an enemy, and when he clearly oversteps a mark, as now, he needs to be “sent a firm message”. But he is not another Stalin. He is not Napoleon eager to bestride Europe. Russia is not the Soviet empire. It is rather a dangerous bundle of insecurities. Putin is riddled with what Freud called “the narcissism of small differences”. Nothing could be more calculated to exacerbate them as western confrontation, denying contact and engagement with Russia and its people. May is thus playing Putin’s game by exploiting each incident as a statist threat – as she does threats from Isis and “world terrorism”. It is the oldest trick in the populist book. It “nationalises” a crime. It summons patriotism to the suppression of reason. It gets in the way of proportionality. It raises the risk of mistakes. Camus wrote that “plagues and wars take people equally by surprise”. The idea that Skripal may be the Franz Ferdinand of the next European conflict may seem ludicrous. Yet the west’s responses to post-Soviet Russia, however reasonable in the short term, have been disastrous in general. A war with Russia would be the west’s fault. • Simon Jenkins is a Guardian columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/2018/mar/15/saudi-arabia-iran-nuclear-bomb-threat-mohammed-bin-salman","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-15T21:11:50Z","webTitle":"Saudi crown prince warns it will build nuclear bomb if Tehran does the same","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/15/saudi-arabia-iran-nuclear-bomb-threat-mohammed-bin-salman","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/mar/15/saudi-arabia-iran-nuclear-bomb-threat-mohammed-bin-salman","fields":{"headline":"Saudi crown prince warns it will build nuclear bomb if Tehran does the same","bodyText":"Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman has set out plans for Saudi Arabia to develop nuclear weapons if Tehran makes the same move in the event of a collapse of the international nuclear deal signed in 2015. The prospect of a Middle East nuclear arms race will unnerve European leaders who are urging Donald Trump to retain the Iran nuclear deal which imposed strict curbs on the Iranian nuclear programme in return for sanctions relief. The Saudi crown prince is due in Washington on Monday, and is pressing the US to give it the reserved right to enrich uranium in return for Saudi Arabia choosing American nuclear technology. “Saudi Arabia does not want to acquire any nuclear bomb, but without a doubt, if Iran developed a nuclear bomb, we will follow suit as soon as possible,” bin Salman told CBS television. Saudi Arabia wants initially to build two nuclear stations as part of its medium term program to wean itself off oil. It plans to build 16 civil nuclear stations over 20 to 25 years generating 16 gigawats of nuclear energy. Although Saudi Arabia stresses it wants nuclear technology only for peaceful uses, it has left unclear whether it also wants to enrich uranium to produce nuclear fuel, a process which can be used in the production of atomic weapons. US administration officials have already met bin Salman in London to discuss the terms of a deal. Iran immediately hit back at the prince’s comments. “These words are worthless ... because they come from a simple mind full of illusions who speaks only bitterness and lies,” said Iranian foreign ministry spokesman Bahram Ghasemi. Saudi Arabia, like Trump is a fierce opponent of the Iran nuclear deal, and US officials were due to meet their EU counterparts in Berlin on Thursday to discuss how to resolve their differences over whether the deal can be rescued. Trump has given the EU until 12 May to come up with revisions to the deal, or see him pull out, reimposing full blown economic sanctions and provoking a full scale crisis with Tehran. The EU signatories to the deal – UK, France and Germany – want to retain the deal, but are willing to discuss a supplementary memorandum that would seek to contain Iran’s ballistic missile program, one of Trump’s criticisms of the deal. Iran insists its ballistic program is separate to the 2015 deal. A range of countries including Russia, the US, the UK, France and Japan have been offering to partner with Saudi’s nuclear plans, putting the crown prince in a position to negotiate with the US on any restrictions covering uranium enrichment rights in exchange for US nuclear support. Reactors need uranium enriched to around 5% purity but the same technology in this process can also be used to enrich the heavy metal to a higher, weapons-grade level. Simon Henderson, a Saudi expert at the Washington Institute for Near East said: “Can Saudi Arabia be persuaded to forsake, perhaps even temporarily, enrichment and reprocessing in return for choosing US technology for its ambitious nuclear power plans? The wrong business deal could undermine the current fragile status quo and elevate regional antagonisms to a new level”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"travel/2018/mar/27/peoples-history-museum-manchester-family-uk-day-trip","type":"article","sectionId":"travel","sectionName":"Travel","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-27T09:30:02Z","webTitle":"Take the kids to … People’s History Museum, Manchester","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2018/mar/27/peoples-history-museum-manchester-family-uk-day-trip","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/travel/2018/mar/27/peoples-history-museum-manchester-family-uk-day-trip","fields":{"headline":"Take the kids to … People’s History Museum, Manchester","bodyText":"In a nutshell In a beautiful russet-hued, steel-clad pumphouse on the banks of the river Irwell, in the regenerated Spinningfields district of the city centre, this free museum charts the history of working people from the Industrial Revolution to the present day. The main exhibition begins by examining the 1819 Peterloo Massacre (the site of which is just down the road). Visitors are led through colour-coded galleries, which celebrate radical thinkers, reformers and activists on the journey to universal suffrage. There is also a focus on ordinary people’s lives: the chance to play a board game in an early 20th-century kitchen, operate a till in a co-operative shop, as well as play a protest song on a 1950s jukebox. Explorer packs and regular children’s events add to the family-friendliness. Fun fact To help democratise access to the news, early 19th-century publications such as The Poor Man’s Guardian would ignore the fourpence stamp duty that was levied on all newspapers and pamphlets. Instead, it was sold illegally for just a penny. To evade the authorities, copies would be smuggled around the country in coffins. Best thing about it? Its multi-generational appeal. The chance to rifle through a “life in a box” – containing personal effects telling the story of a historical figure’s life – was welcomed by curious adults and fidgety little hands. There are dressing-up opportunities, looping around a central (if small) play area. It was the family trail, though, that particularly engrossed my six-year-old, spurred on by the promise of a badge. The whole family enjoyed the challenge of trying to match the work rate of 19th-century child labourers when put to the task of making boxes. Turns out, other than dexterous granny, we all would have starved. What about lunch? At the Left Bank cafe and bar you can serve yourself with a bowl of soup or stew (£4.50, £6.15), (children’s portions £2.40, £3.25). Alternatively, there are sandwiches and salads (from £3.50) as well as a children’s five-a-day packed lunch (£3.25). Freshly baked scones and the chance to chalk on the tables will make this a popular spot with kids, and parents might like the idea of a craft beer (from £4.20) on the terrace. Otherwise, bring a packed lunch and head to the indoor picnic area. Exit through the gift shop? Definitely worth a browse. Alongside political books, Tolpuddle Martyr tea-towels and Manchester mugs, you can celebrate the centenary of some woman getting the vote by purchasing a copy of Pank-a-Squith – an early 20th-century board game where players lead their suffragette from her home to the Houses of Parliament (£12.99). Cross-stitch protest banner sets (from £7.50) and bags of rhubarb and custard sweets (£2.50) are also bound to raise a smile. Value for money It’s free – donations are welcomed.

In May, it will be 50 years since the eminent biologist published his most famous and controversial book, The Population Bomb. But Ehrlich remains as outspoken as ever. The world’s optimum population is less than two billion people – 5.6 billion fewer than on the planet today, he argues, and there is an increasing toxification of the entire planet by synthetic chemicals that may be more dangerous to people and wildlife than climate change. Ehrlich also says an unprecedented redistribution of wealth is needed to end the over-consumption of resources, but “the rich who now run the global system – that hold the annual ‘world destroyer’ meetings in Davos – are unlikely to let it happen”. The Population Bomb, written with his wife Anne Ehrlich in 1968, predicted “hundreds of millions of people are going to starve to death” in the 1970s – a fate that was avoided by the green revolution in intensive agriculture. Many details and timings of events were wrong, Paul Ehrlich acknowledges today, but he says the book was correct overall. “Population growth, along with over-consumption per capita, is driving civilisation over the edge: billions of people are now hungry or micronutrient malnourished, and climate disruption is killing people.” Ehrlich has been at Stanford University since 1959 and is also president of the Millennium Alliance for Humanity and the Biosphere, which works “to reduce the threat of a shattering collapse of civilisation”. “It is a near certainty in the next few decades, and the risk is increasing continually as long as perpetual growth of the human enterprise remains the goal of economic and political systems,” he says. “As I’ve said many times, ‘perpetual growth is the creed of the cancer cell’.” It is the combination of high population and high consumption by the rich that is destroying the natural world, he says. Research published by Ehrlich and colleagues in 2017 concluded that this is driving a sixth mass extinction of biodiversity, upon which civilisation depends for clean air, water and food. The solutions are tough, he says. “To start, make modern contraception and back-up abortion available to all and give women full equal rights, pay and opportunities with men. “I hope that would lead to a low enough total fertility rate that the needed shrinkage of population would follow. [But] it will take a very long time to humanely reduce total population to a size that is sustainable.” He estimates an optimum global population size at roughly 1.5 to two billion, “But the longer humanity pursues business as usual, the smaller the sustainable society is likely to prove to be. We’re continuously harvesting the low-hanging fruit, for example by driving fisheries stocks to extinction.” Ehrlich is also concerned about chemical pollution, which has already reached the most remote corners of the globe. “The evidence we have is that toxics reduce the intelligence of children, and members of the first heavily influenced generation are now adults.” He treats this risk with characteristic dark humour: “The first empirical evidence we are dumbing down Homo sapiens were the Republican debates in the US 2016 presidential elections – and the resultant kakistocracy. On the other hand, toxification may solve the population problem, since sperm counts are plunging.” Reflecting five decades after the publication of The Population Bomb (which he wanted to be titled Population, Resources, and Environment), he says: “No scientist would hold exactly the same views after a half century of further experience, but Anne and I are still proud of our book.” It helped start a worldwide debate on the impact of rising population that continues today, he says. The book’s strength, Ehrlich says, is that it was short, direct and basically correct. “Its weaknesses were not enough on overconsumption and equity issues. It needed more on women’s rights, and explicit countering of racism – which I’ve spent much of my career and activism trying to counter. “Too many rich people in the world is a major threat to the human future, and cultural and genetic diversity are great human resources.” Accusations that the book lent support to racist attitudes to population control still hurt today, Ehrlich says. “Having been a co-inventor of the sit-in to desegregate restaurants in Lawrence, Kansas in the 1950s and having published books and articles on the biological ridiculousness of racism, those accusations continue to annoy me.” But, he says: “You can’t let the possibility that ignorant people will interpret your ideas as racist keep you from discussing critical issues honestly.” More of Paul and Anne Ehrlich’s reflections on their book are published in The Population Bomb Revisited. This week, the Overstretched Cities series examines the impact of the rush to urbanisation, which has seen cities around the world explode in size.

Heather Wheeler said she did not accept the suggestion that welfare reforms and council cuts had contributed to the rise. On a visit to a housing project in Glasgow, Wheeler said she remained “totally confident” she would not have to act on her pledge to resign should she fail to meet the Conservative manifesto commitment of halving rough sleeping by 2022, and eradicating it by 2027. “We’re going to move heaven and earth to get that done,” she promised. In a recent interview, the Guardian spoke to Jon Sparkes, chief executive of the homelessness charity Crisis, who sits on Wheeler’s new rough sleeping advisory group for England. He expressed his frustration at the Westminster government’s failure to recognise the influence of welfare reforms – such as the housing benefit freeze, the household benefit cap and the universal credit rollout – on homelessness. Wheeler was asked on Thursday about the reasons for the rise in rough sleeping, which has increased in England for seven consecutive years; official figures show 4,751 people slept outside overnight in 2017. The MP for South Derbyshire said: “In truth, I don’t know. That’s one of the interesting things for me to find out over the last eight weeks that I’ve been doing the job. We’ve looked at the different cohorts, and in London the number of veterans who are rough sleepers is down to about 2%.” Commending the “amazing job” done by armed forces charities, she went on to describe a second “classic” reason for rough sleeping: coming out of prison with no support. “It’s very difficult. We also have a real problem in London with people coming over [mainly from Europe] for jobs, sofa surfing with friends, and then the job changes and they have a problem.” Wheeler was visiting Turning Point Scotland’s Housing First project, part of an internationally successful model that places the most entrenched rough sleepers in permanent housing before they deal with addiction, mental illness or other challenges. It works on the assumption that people make the most progress when in a stable home, rather than a hostel or shared temporary accommodation. In November, the Conservative government pledged £28m for similar pilots in the West Midlands, Manchester and Liverpool. A government-funded study in Liverpool concluded that Housing First could save £4m compared with current homelessness services in the area. Describing the appeal of Housing First, Wheeler asked: “What does ‘good’ look like? Having 80% of tenancies renewed. Drug rehab, booze rehab, mental health issues ... they can get sorted so much better when the wraparound care is there.” Scotland, which had almost eliminated homelessness after pioneering legislation was passed by Holyrood in 2003, has recently experienced a similar increase, with an estimated 5,000 rough sleepers across the year. The homelessness and rough sleeping action group, commissioned by the Scottish government and chaired by Sparkes, set out its first recommendations in November, which were immediately implemented. They included giving credit cards to frontline workers who need to make emergency purchases for rough sleepers, and rapid rehousing in settled accommodation rather than leaving people for months or years in temporary placements. Wheeler said she was “mulling over” the action group’s recommendations and their applicability south of the border: “I want to come up here and learn about what goes on.” Asked whether she perceived a difference in attitude to homelessness between Holyrood and Westminster, Wheeler said: “Actually, no. I think that maybe England is a tad more cautious in that we are very keen that we have proper pilots and we assess it. “And I regret to say that the problem with the supply of affordable housing in England is much, much, much larger than Scotland. I find it fascinating that there is no private-sector rental used at all to place people up here – it’s all local authority and housing association, because you have supply.” Asked whether she had heard from Glasgow service users that welfare cuts were leading to greater domestic insecurity, and if she felt at odds with other government departments in her mission, she said: “I didn’t hear that, which is refreshing. “This is about supply. If you don’t sort out supply of affordable housing, there’s another million people living in our lovely country, we need to have greater supply of affordable housing. We are spending £9bn on affordable housing [by March 2021] because we recognise that’s what we have to do.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2018/mar/15/scrap-northampton-county-council-inspectors-say","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-15T15:45:05Z","webTitle":"Scrap Northamptonshire county council, inspectors say","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/mar/15/scrap-northampton-county-council-inspectors-say","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/mar/15/scrap-northampton-county-council-inspectors-say","fields":{"headline":"Scrap Northamptonshire county council, inspectors say","bodyText":"Northamptonshire county council (NCC), which declared effective bankruptcy last month, should be scrapped, a devastating inspectors’ report into widespread financial and management failures at the authority has recommended. The council’s leader, Heather Smith, stood down after the report’s publication, writing in her resignation letter that she blamed “vicious public insults by four local MPs”, adding “you cannot win” if the “machinery of government is turned against you”. A government-appointed investigator’s report said the problems at the council were so deep-rooted that it was impossible to rescue it in its current form, and to do so “would be a reward for failure”. It recommends that ministers send in a team of external commissioners to take over the day-to-day running of the council until it can be broken up and replaced with two new smaller authorities. The lead inspector, Max Caller, said NCC had ignored a growing financial crisis at the authority, which he said had been beset by poor management, lack of scrutiny and unrealistic budget-setting. Explaining why he advised breaking up the council, Caller’s report says: “The problems faced by NCC are now so deep and ingrained that it is not possible to promote a recovery plan that could bring the council back to stability and safety in a reasonable timescale.” He added: “To change the culture and organisational ethos and to restore balance, would, in the judgment of the inspection team, take of the order of five years and require a substantial one-off cash injection. Effectively, it would be a reward for failure.” It was unlikely councillors and the officers had the strength of purpose to bring the council back into line, he said. “A way forward with a clean sheet, leaving all the history behind, is required.” Responding to the report, Northampton North MP Michael Ellis called the management of the authority a national scandal. All seven local Tory MPs criticised the council last month saying they had no confidence in its leadership. In her resignation letter, Smith blamed four of the MPs who had requested the inspection report for her departure. “The personal pressure of vicious public insults by four local MPs seeking to make me the scapegoat has not been pleasant for anyone to witness,” she wrote. “I have continued to fight for fairer funding for Northamptonshire residents in spite of the personal attacks but, as I was told a few days ago, ‘If the machinery of government is turned against you then you cannot win.’” The communities secretary, Sajid Javid, said the report raised “considerable concerns” about financial management and governance at the council. “My priority is ensuring that local people receive the high-quality services they deserve and I will be considering the report in detail before outlining the action I intend to take,” he said. The report rejected the council leadership’s claim that it had been disadvantaged by government funding cuts and underfunded given the pressure of a growing and elderly population. Similar councils had coped with these pressures and Northamptonshire “was not the most disadvantaged shire council”, the report says. It excoriates the disastrous attempt to restructure services by outsourcing them to private companies and charities – the Next Generation programme. Poor design, chaotic management and a lack of controls and oversight meant budgeting was “an exercise of hope rather than expectation”. It drily notes that it was not clear whether the programme was still in existence, saying: “It would appear to have been abandoned but that is not clear.” The council had lost control of its budgeting in 2013 after a critical Ofsted report into its children’s services forced an expensive overhaul of child protection services, and never recovered, the report says. It said the council’s approach to financial management came across as “sloppy, lacking in rigour and without challenge”. There was a lack of realism in business plans, and savings targets were frequently not met. Senior councillors and officials ignored or evaded criticism and challenge, it says, and budgets were set by without regard to need, demand or deliverability. “Living within budget constraints is not a part of the culture at NCC,” the report concludes. Although financial officials had raised the alarm about the council’s financial problems in 2015, this had been ignored by senior management and councillors. There was a culture in NCC where “overspending is acceptable and there are no sanctions for failure”, the report says. The council continually patched up financial holes with one-off uses of reserves, or by selling off assets and using the proceeds. The report concludes: “This is not budget management.” By the end relationships with public sector partners such as the NHS has deteriorated so much that there is a “significant level of distrust that NCC will ever be able to deliver against its promises and undertakings”. It noted that the councils’ staff were not to blame for the fiasco. “NCC employs many good, hardworking, dedicated staff who are trying to deliver essential services to residents who need and value what is offered and available. The problems the council faces are not their fault.” Last month the council issued a section 114 note – the local government equivalent to bankruptcy – because it said it could not set a balanced budget for 2018-19. A statement from the council said: “We accept the findings and we will now be acting accordingly and responding directly to the secretary of state. “While the report accepts the figures we use in arguing our case for fairer funding, it states we are in no worse position than other councils. We would argue that the sector as a whole does face significant financial challenges and we will continue to work with our local government partners to present our case.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2018/mar/15/russia-sanctions-energy-sector-cyber-attack-us-election-interference","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-15T16:46:37Z","webTitle":"US accuses Russia of cyber-attack on energy sector and imposes new sanctions","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/mar/15/russia-sanctions-energy-sector-cyber-attack-us-election-interference","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/mar/15/russia-sanctions-energy-sector-cyber-attack-us-election-interference","fields":{"headline":"US accuses Russia of cyber-attack on energy sector and imposes new sanctions","bodyText":"The US has accused Russia of a wide-ranging cyber-assault on its energy grid and other key parts of its infrastructure, as it stepped up sanctions on Russian intelligence for its interference in the 2016 elections. US officials said that malware had been found in the operating systems of several organisations and companies in the US energy, nuclear, water and “critical manufacturing” sector, and the malware as well as other form of cyber-attacks had been traced back to Moscow. “Russia’s behaviour continues to trouble us and we are continuing to push back in meaningful ways,” a senior national security official said. The FBI and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) issued an alert, urging other firms in the industry to review their cybersecurity. The alert said the concerted cyber-attack on US infrastructure began in March 2016. “It is the judgment of the DHS than Russian government cyberhackers were behind the hacking of organisations in the energy sector,” a senior official said, adding that it was clear that the cyber-attack was coordinated and “deliberately targeted”. Officials added that the motive of the attack was initially surveillance, to gather information on computer management systems in the US energy grid. The cybersecurity alert said: “DHS and FBI characterize this activity as a multi-stage intrusion campaign by Russian government cyber actors who targeted small commercial facilities’ networks where they staged malware, conducted spear phishing and gained remote access into energy sector networks.” “After obtaining access, the Russian government cyber actors conducted network reconnaissance, moved laterally, and collected information pertaining to industrial control systems,” it added. At the same time, the US treasury announced new sanctions against Russian individuals and entities, including the FSB and GRU intelligence agencies, as well as the Internet Research Agency in St Petersburg, for interference in the 2016 elections. As a result of Russia’s election interference, officials said that thousands of Russian-planted stories reached “millions of people online” during the US presidential campaign. The new sanctions represent the broadest set of US punitive measures against Russia since the start of the Trump administration, and many of their targets are the same as those identified by an indictment by Robert Mueller, the special counsel investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election and possible collusion with the Trump campaign. Mueller’s investigation has been denounced as a politically motivated witch-hunt by the president and his supporters, and the new measures represent the latest example of dissonance in attitudes towards Russia between Trump and other parts of the administration. Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House intelligence committee, said the sanctions did not go nearly far enough in view of the scale of the Russian attack on the 2016 election. “The sanctions today are a grievous disappointment, and fall far short of what is needed to respond to that attack on our democracy, let alone deter Russia’s escalating aggression, which now includes a chemical weapons attack on the soil of our closest ally,” Schiff said in a statement. He pointed out that many of the sanctions targeted had already been designated by the Obama administration, and claimed that the new designated targets did not reflect “new work within the administration” but were selected on the basis of the Mueller’s indictment. “It appears that Mr Mueller is doing more to place consequences on Russia’s behavior than the rest of the administration,” Schiff said. The sanctions were also imposed for the role of Russian intelligence in distributing the NotPetya malware and ransomware which US officials attributed to Moscow in February. Officials said it was initially targeted at Ukraine but was allowed to “propagate recklessly without bounds” and caused an estimated $10bn in damage around the world, making it the most damaging cyber-attack in history. The treasury announced it had sanctioned five entities and 19 individuals for cyber-attacks, including during the election. “The administration is confronting and countering malign Russian cyber-activity, including their attempted interference in US elections, destructive cyber-attacks, and intrusions targeting critical infrastructure,” Steven Mnuchin, the treasury secretary, said in a statement. “These targeted sanctions are a part of a broader effort to address the nefarious attacks emanating from Russia. Treasury intends to impose additional … sanctions, informed by our intelligence community, to hold Russian government officials and oligarchs accountable for their destabilising activities by severing their access to the US financial system.” Among those directly targeted are six senior officers of the military intelligence service, the GRU, including its chief, Igor Korobov, and three of his deputies."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/mar/16/parsons-green-tube-bomber-convicted-of-attempted-murder","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-16T15:44:40Z","webTitle":"Parsons Green tube bomber was referred to Prevent programme","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/mar/16/parsons-green-tube-bomber-convicted-of-attempted-murder","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/mar/16/parsons-green-tube-bomber-convicted-of-attempted-murder","fields":{"headline":"Parsons Green tube bomber was referred to Prevent programme","bodyText":"A teenage Iraqi asylum seeker who planted a bomb on a crowded London underground train had been involved in the government’s Prevent deradicalisation programme for more than a year, it emerged at the end of his Old Bailey trial. Ahmed Hassan was found guilty on Friday of attempted murder after his homemade device partially detonated at Parsons Green in west London during the morning rush hour in September. Hassan stared at the ground as the jury returned its verdict after less than a day of deliberations. The judge, Mr Justice Haddon-Cave, said he was convicted on “overwhelming evidence”. He will be sentenced next week. Thirty people were injured in Hassan’s attack. The explosion sent a fireball through the tube carriage and burned passengers’ skin, hair and clothing. Survivors spoke of feeling their faces being both burned and lacerated by flying glass. Hassan, 18, who had been living with foster parents in Sunbury-on-Thames, Surrey, admitted making the bomb by mixing a powerful but unstable explosive using hydrogen peroxide. He also made an initiator using a kitchen timer. He told the London court that he had made the device because he was “very bored, very depressed, very confused” and wanted to draw attention to himself. The disclosure that Hassan had been referred to the Prevent programme will heighten concerns over the effectiveness of the government scheme, which aims to stop young Muslims from being radicalised. The security minister, Ben Wallace, acknowledged that there were “lessons to be learned” from the case while Surrey county council issued an apology after the verdict was returned. The Surrey police and crime commissioner also said there were “opportunities missed” to thwart the attack. David Munro told the BBC: “It is obvious we were too slow.” A review of Surrey’s Prevent scheme has been commissioned. Hassan had denied attempted murder and also denied an alternative charge of causing an explosion, maintaining that he had mixed the explosive in a way that would ensure the device burned rather than exploded – a claim that the jury unanimously rejected. The court heard that both Hassan’s parents were dead by the time he was six, and that he blamed Britain for his father’s death in an airstrike on Baghdad. He was also upset by ongoing airstrikes, sending a text message to one of his lecturers: “Your country continues to bomb my people daily.” Alison Morgan, prosecuting, told the jury that Hassan had been motivated by “anger and hatred” against Britain. The London court heard that Hassan had told Home Office immigration officials that he had been abducted by Islamic State in Iraq and had spent three months “being trained how to kill”. Hassan later said that he had fabricated this account in an attempt to win sympathy. He said that he did not want to admit that since his father’s death he and his elder brother had been raised by an uncle in a relatively safe and prosperous town north of Baghdad. Nevertheless, he was referred to the Prevent programme in Surrey, and then subjected to the Channel counter-radicalisation initiative, which was intended to drawn him away from terrorist impulses. After the verdict, Commander Dean Haydon, the head of Scotland Yard’s counter-terrorism command, said that Hassan – a “devious and cunning” young man – had given every impression that he was engaging positively with the deradicalisation initiatives. “It’s only good fortune that it did [only] partially detonate,” he said. “If it had detonated properly it would have killed many people on that tube and seriously injured many others. Wallace said there were “lessons to be learned” from the case but praised authorities for their work in the investigation. Surrey county council issued an apology, saying that its deradicalisation work had fallen short. “‘Our work with other agencies in this case wasn’t as good as it should have been and we’re sorry for our part in that,” a spokesman said. The council also apologised to the foster parents Penelope and Ronald Jones, acknowledging that they had taken Hassan in under “tough circumstances”. On the day of the attack, Hassan travelled by train to Wimbledon, south-west London. He boarded the District Line train and alighted at Putney Bridge, one stop before Parsons Green, leaving the bag containing the bomb on board. The bomb partly detonated shortly after the train arrived at Parsons Green station, but most of the explosive did not go off. There were 93 people inside the carriage: the jury was shown CCTV images of the moment they were engulfed by the fireball. Survivors told the court of the attack’s lasting impact. One woman, identified in court only as Miss S, wept as she described having suffered severe burns on her legs, as well as burns to her hands and face. She is still being treated six months after the explosion. She told the jury she heard a bang, followed by screaming. “I had burns. My knees were bad, my face was all burned. My coat was burning, my tights melted.” Victoria Holloway, another passenger, said: “I heard a really loud bang and then I heard a whoosh – like the sound of a Bunsen burner when you light it. The flames were around my legs, and then they seemed to be sucked away from me.” Hassan changed his clothes four times as he made his way to the port of Dover, where he was arrested 24 hours after the attack. He told his lawyers that after watching the Tom Cruise action film Mission: Impossible he harboured a fantasy of being pursued across Europe by Interpol as he made his way back to Iraq. The court heard that Hassan had spent three days in hospital in 2016 being treated for depression. A report prepared by a psychologist on behalf of his defence, which suggested that he may have Asperger’s syndrome, was ruled inadmissible and not read to the jury."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/live/2018/mar/15/ncaa-tournament-2018-day-one-latest-scores-college-basketball","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-16T04:50:08Z","webTitle":"NCAA tournament: Arizona stunned by Buffalo; Villanova and Kansas win – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2018/mar/15/ncaa-tournament-2018-day-one-latest-scores-college-basketball","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/live/2018/mar/15/ncaa-tournament-2018-day-one-latest-scores-college-basketball","fields":{"headline":"NCAA tournament: Arizona stunned by Buffalo; Villanova and Kansas win – as it happened","bodyText":"And so the first day of the NCAA tournament is in the books. How are everyone’s brackets doing? (14 out of 16, here.) We saw major upsets (No13 Buffalo, No11 Loyola Chicago) and dominant favorites (No1s Villanova and Kansas) and a former US president even throwing his hat in the ring. And we’ll do it all again tomorrow as the first round concludes with 16 more games. See you then! The final game of today’s 16-game slate is in the books as third-seeded Michigan overcomes a sluggish start to win 61-47 over a stingy Montana side. The Grizzlies scored the game’s first 10 points, perhaps taking advantage of a Wolverines team who had been inactive since the end of the Big Ten tournament nearly two weeks ago. But Michigan bounced back behind Charles Matthews’ game-high 18 points and will face sixth-seeded Houston in Saturday’s second round. The sixth-seeded Gators, who have reached the Elite Eight in their past five trips to the tournament, got the best of an exhausted St Bonaventure two days after the Bonnies won their first NCAA tournament game in 48 years. Well, that got out of hand in a hurry. SUNY Buffalo, the No13 seed in the South, wounded Arizona early and dragged them over the finish line in the upset of the tournament so far. At least one No13 seed has beaten a No4 in 24 of the last 34 tournaments. Alabama – in the NCAA tournament for the first time in six years and second in 12 – has held off a stubborn Virginia Tech squad to advance to the second round, where they will face top-seeded Villanova for a trip to the Sweet 16. Collin Sexton led the way for the Crimson Tide with a game-high 25 points while John Petty added 20 off the bench. Everything is going right for Buffalo, who have stretched their lead to 72-58 with eight minutes left in regulation. Arizona’s seven-foot stud DeAndre Ayton has been frustrated by Buffalo’s smaller frontcourt and been left to look completely disinterested. Meanwhile, No9 Alabama are fending off a furious push by No8 Virginia Tech: the Crimson Tide lead 75-72 with 1:56 left. No13 Buffalo are giving No4 Arizona all they can handle in Boise. The Bulls’ Wes Clark twisted and contorted his way to the rim to open a 60-52 lead with 12:42 left in regulation, but Arizona’s Parker Jackson-Cartwright answered with a much-needed three-pointer to close it to 60-55 at the under-12 timeout. Buffalo aren’t the only double-digit seed making noise during Thursday’s late shift. Montana, the No14 seed in the West regional, are out to a 17-10 lead over No3 Michigan midway through the first half in Wichita. Elsewhere, No8 Virginia Tech and No9 Alabama are knotted at 52-all with 13:53 left in regulation, while No11 St Bonaventure have fought back to a 21-21 tie with No6 Florida after trailing 20-9 in the first 10 minutes. The Gators have missed their last 11 shots from the floor over more than seven minutes of game time. We’re on upset alert in Boise. Buffalo, the No13 seed in the South regional, lead 40-38 over fourth-seeded Arizona in a result that could incinerate millions of brackets. Jeremy Harris and Wes Clark are leading the way for the MAC champions with 14 and 13 points respectively, while the Wildcats’ freshman stud DeAndre Ayton, quite possibly college basketball’s best player, has been held to seven points (on 3-for-7 from the floor) and four rebounds. No13 seed Buffalo are out to an early 19-12 lead over No4 Arizona in the first of tonight’s late games. Junior guard Jeremy Harris is leading the way for the Mid-American Conference champions with a game-high nine points. Elsewhere, No8 Virginia Tech leads 43-38 over No9 Alabama just before halftime behind Justin Bibbs’ 11 points. The winner there advances to face Villanova, the top seed in the East regional, in Saturday’s second round. Houston survived a white-knuckle finish against the always-tough Aztecs to go through to the second round in the West regional. The frenetic final sequence kicked off when San Diego State’s Devin Watson hit a clutch three-pointer from the top of the key to tie it at 62 apiece with a minute left. Houston’s Rob Gray answered with a three on the next trip down, before Watson came back with another on the ensuing trip for 65-all. That left Houston with a chance for the final shot where Gray slashed and slalomed into the lane for an acrobatic go-ahead lay-up: his career-high 38th and 39th points of the night. The Aztecs were left with 1.1 seconds to pull off a miracle and Trey Cook had a clean look at one after coming down with a perfectly thrown pass, but the shot was off target and Houston could finally exhale having won their first NCAA tournament game since 1984. They’ll face either No3 Michigan or No14 Montana, who face off next, in Saturday’s second-rounder. No14 seed Stephen F Austin, who sprung memorable first-round upsets in the 2014 and 2016 tournaments, nearly did it again tonight in Dallas as they led 30-27 over Big 12 runner-up Texas Tech at halftime and 53-52 with around eight minutes left. But the Lumberjacks’ offense sputtered badly down the stretch – one field goal in the last 10 minutes and none in the last 4:57 – as the third-seeded Red Raiders roared back for the victory. Texas Tech advance to face the winner of the nightcap between No6 Florida and No11 St Bonaventure. John Calipari’s Wildcats were expected to get a stiff fight from the No12 seed in the South regional and that’s exactly what happened as Davidson were touch-and-go with the eight-time NCAA champions for most of the night. But after the Atlantic 10 champs narrowed it to 61-59 with three minutes left, Kentucky peeled off 10 straight points – just enough cushion to absorb a last-gasp rally. They advance to face the winner of tonight’s second game in Boise: No4 Arizona v No13 Buffalo. Not since 2008 has Kentucky lost in the first round of the NCAAs. Interestingly, Kentucky finished 0-for-6 from three-point range to end their record streak of consecutive games with a three-pointer. Not since a loss to Seton Hall on 26 November 1988 – when Bon Jovi’s Bad Medicine was the No1 song in America – had Kentucky last finished a game without a three. That’s a span of 1,047 games. And with that, I leave you in the capable hands of Bryan Graham for the Davidson-Kentucky and Stephen F. Austin-Texas Tech thrillers. Villanova stat of the night ... Yes, but he also missed a 3-pointer. Surely Villanova has now replaced Duke as the object of everyone’s scorn. They’re simply too good. Jalen Brunson had 16 points to lead SIX players in double digits. Another player had nine. Double upset alert. Stephen F. Austin has come out on fire in the second half. The 14th-seeded Lumberjacks lead Texas Tech 39-33. That’s on top of this Davidson-Kentucky barnburner. Meanwhile, Villanova leads Radford by 29 points with 1:50 to play. Davidson scored 24 points in the first half. They’ve scored 28 in the first 11 minutes of the second, and it’s tied. Davidson 49-50 Kentucky. Make that 0-for-5, and make that a one-point lead. Quick check of other scores: Stephen F. Austin 30-27 Texas Tech San Diego State 29-39 Houston Radford a little-a lot Villanova Kentucky is 0-for-4 on 3-pointers, nearly 30 minutes into this game. They still lead by three. So with two games at the half and another (Radford-Villanova) now a 30-point game, we switch to a suddenly compelling Davidson-Kentucky game, where the Wildcats are within three points of the Wildcats. (The Kentucky Wildcats are the ones in front. For now. Davidson will have possession after a timeout.) Halftime: Houston 39-29 San Diego State. Can’t win if you don’t score in this sport, and the Aztecs scored only one point in the last 3:21 of the half, allowing the Cougars to turn a three-point lead into a 10-point cushion. Halftime: Stephen F. Austin 30-27 Texas Tech. Kevon Harris dribbles near the top of the arc, then takes a step back and calmly drills a 3-pointer at the buzzer to put the Lumberjacks back in front. This would be the biggest upset of the day if they can keep it up for 20 more minutes. Houston storms out to an eight-point lead over San Diego State. But the Aztecs respond with five free throws sandwiched around a defensive stop and an offensive rebound, and just like that, it’s three points again. When can you get elbowed in the face and get called for a defensive foul? When you’re too close to the attacking player. Texas Tech’s Niem Stevenson just learned that lesson in most painful fashion. Meanwhile, Villanova has doubled up Radford, 58-29. Do we hate them more than we hate Duke now? Nearly identical scores: Stephen F. Austin 23-19 Texas Tech Houston 23-20 San Diego State The Lumberjacks are starting to hit some shots. But they’re also committing a few silly fouls and letting the Red Raiders get some points at the line. (At least, they would, if Texas Tech could shoot free throws.) Halftime: Davidson 24-34 Kentucky. Actually the third most interesting game at the moment. Villanova and Radford are now playing out the formality of the second half. These other two games are intriguing. The visual ... But stop the presses (do we do that any more?) ... Stephen F. Austin hit a 3-pointer. It’s 18-17 Lumberjacks. Texas Tech claims the lead in spectacular fashion. An alley-oop with a twist. Literally. Keenan Evans lobs the ball from just beyond the 3-point line. Zhaire Smith catches the ball in the air with his back to the rim, then turns around in midair to slam it home. One of those weird calls in which a team scores while fouling. A Texas Tech player touches the net while the ball bounces on the rim, all while a Stephen F. Austin player commits a foul going for a rebound that has become a moot point. So, technically, the Lumberjacks have scored from the floor for the first time in quite a while. Two lower seeds hold the lead ... No11 San Diego State is up 11-9 over Houston. And No14 Stephen F. Austin maintains its lead, 13-12 over No3 Texas Tech, even without a field goal in the last 6:33 and counting. A highlight ... Meh. But the Lumberjacks show a transition game after another suffocating defensive stand, racing down the court and drawing a foul. A team is finally in double digits, 7:25 into the game. Meanwhile, we have FOUR GAMES in action. That’s right, the NCAA quadruple is in effect again. And as Kentucky pulls away from Davidson, let’s check in on those Lumberjacks ... Hmmm. This is looking like the basketball equivalent of “parking the bus” in soccer. Stephen F. Austin hits a free throw to double the lead. Now 9-7. Upset alert. Well, it’s very early, but 14th seed Stephen F. Austin leads No. 3 Texas Tech at the first timeout. Most of Twitter conflates the college with the wrestling star, but then we have a Monty Python reference ... Maybe I should’ve stuck with Radford-Villanova ... Three games in progress ... Kentucky with a slim lead over Davidson. Villanova with a massive lead over Radford. Stephen F. Austin and Houston have gone scoreless through 100 seconds of play. In 10 minutes, make it four games. Kentucky is young. Even younger than Duke. The Wildcats have no seniors. Their two juniors combined to play seven minutes this year. Are they rattled? Davidson has tied it up, 17-17. We have a game. Davidson 8-10 Kentucky after nearly five minutes. Villanova is rather unsportingly crushing Radford, 34-10. Davidson and Kentucky are underway. This game will probably trounce Villanova-Radford in the ratings. Villanova now up by 17. Radford 7-18 Villanova. OK, maybe not. So do we have any momentum yet for hating Villanova instead of Duke? We’re only halfway through Day 1, and still, everyone’s brackets have red ink. I’m off to a stellar start, having picked three of the first eight games correctly. Radford 3-0 Villanova. Yeah, this is going to happen. Freeman scores 36 points in his final college game, but he had very little help. The Pirates advance for the first time since 2004. Just in time for tipoff. Radford wins the tip against Villanova. Will we finally get a 16-over-1 upset? Seton Hall expects N.C. State to go to Freeman, which they do. They contest the shot. He misses. Rebound to Seton Hall, two more made free throws and it’s a 10-point game in the last minute. The good news for N.C. State: Allerik Freeman now has a majestic 34 points. The bad news: It’s an eight-point Seton Hall lead with 1:02 remaining. It’s not just Bryan who has an issue with my alma mater ... At what point can we move on to hating Villanova? Meanwhile, Seton Hall leads by eight with 1:30 left. Just nine minutes until the aforementioned Villanova takes on Radford. I know where it is, but I’m not telling you. Allerik Freeman, a senior guard for N.C. State, has 32 points, thanks in part to his six 3-pointers on seven attempts. Maybe get him the ball again? Two minutes left, seven-point game. N.C. State 75-82 Seton Hall. If you like missed free throws and an ugly missed dunk, you enjoyed the last minute of this game. Now 3:06 remaining. Here’s how we got here: N.C. State 66-77 Seton Hall. The Wolfpack cut it to 3, but they’ll probably get no closer than that. The ACC team calls timeout with 5:46 left. The next games on the agenda (all time ET): 6:50 p.m.: No16 Radford vs. No1 Villanova 7:10 p.m.: No12 Davidson vs. No5 Kentucky 7:20 p.m.: No11 San Diego State vs. No6 Houston 7:27 p.m.: No14 Stephen F. Austin vs. No3 Texas Tech Davidson is a popular upset pick because the 5-12 game is legendarily tricky and because Stephen Curry played there several years ago and surely left some magic formula in the gym. Things you didn’t know about the ageless Syracuse coach ... The women’s curling World Championships start Saturday, so if he wants to have time to check out the action, Syracuse must lose tomorrow to TCU. The No. 8 vs. No. 9 games are theoretically the most evenly matched, but Seton Hall has led this one throughout. Still, N.C. State are within four with 8:45 to play. After this game, we’ll hit a lull for a few minutes before building up to another four-game frenzy, so email me at beau.dure.freelance@theguardian.com or just yell at me on Twitter @duresport. We’re told this tied a record for 3-point attempts in a tournament game. Ohio State tried 40. South Dakota State tried 31. Meanwhile, N.C. State has made it a close one against Seton Hall, so let’s all change the channel together, shall we? South Dakota State 71-79 Ohio State. 31.3 seconds left. The Jackrabbits had the ball with a chance to tie if they could get a 3-pointer, a stop and another 3-pointer. So, naturally, they raced into the lane for a wild off-balance layup. Ohio State got the rebound and hit two free throws, so the fifth seed looks set to escape the entertaining but erratic 12th seed. South Dakota State 70-77 Ohio State. Another bad foul on a 3-pointer, and the Buckeyes will take a seven-point lead into the final minute. And by the way, Bryan, I did hear what you said about Duke, and I should point out I have two degrees from that esteemed institution. (I’ve also picked them to lose to Rhode Island. March Madness isn’t for freshmen.) South Dakota State 70-74 Ohio State. Well, that’s a momentum-killer. The Jackrabbits reel off 10 in a row, then let Kam Williams score four on one possession. He netted the free throw after an ill-advised foul as he sank a 3-pointer. Thanks Bryan. We have two games in progress at the moment -- Seton Hall is pulling away from N.C. State in the second half, and South Dakota State has ... wait for this free throw ... erased a deficit and is now tied with Ohio State 70-70. South Dakota State 66-70 Ohio State. Not so fast. The Jackrabbits have just cut the deficit to four points on back-to-back three-pointers from Brandon Key and – who else? - Mike Daum. And with that, I’ll hand it off to the esteemed Beau Dure for the next few hours. South Dakota State 60-70 Ohio State. The Jackrabbits are getting a lion-sized effort from talismanic power forward Mike Daum (a game-high 23 points), but the Buckeyes have slowly pulled away in the second half and just opened up a double-digit lead with Kam Williams’ lay-up with 4:40 left in regulation. It’s been some day for graduates of Simeon Career Academy. Gonzaga’s Zach Norvell hits the biggest shot of the game for the Bulldogs and Loyola Chicago’s Donte Ingram hits the biggest shot of the tournament to lift the Ramblers to the upset. The pair were team-mates at the famed Chicago Public League powerhouse whose alumni include Derrick Rose, Jabari Parker, Nick Anderson and Bobby Simmons. March Madness is here. The first major upset and first buzzer-beater of this year’s tournament came just moments ago in Dallas as Donte Ingram, the MVP of the Missouri Valley Conference tournament, hit a go-ahead three pointer as time expired to lift Loyola Chicago to a dramatic 64-62 victory over the sixth-seeded Hurricanes. The officials placed 0.3 seconds left on the clock after a video review, but when Miami’s desperation heave was broken up the Ramblers could celebrate. Loyola Chicago 60-60 Miami (Fl). Clayton Cluster, the Missouri Valley Conference player of the year, has just canned a three-pointer to tie the game at 60 apiece with 1:17 left in regulation. A barn-burner afoot in Dallas. It’s a final in Pittsburgh as the Blue Devils go through behind a game-high 22 points from Marvin Bradley III. That sets the stage for a delicious 2-7 clash on Saturday between Duke and Rhode Island. South Dakota State 43-43 Ohio State. Reed Tellinghuisen bangs a game-tying three pointer for the Jackrabbits and No12 seed South Dakota State will head to the locker room on level terms with the favored Buckeyes. Loyola Chicago 45-47 Miami (Fl). The Ramblers of Loyola Chicago, the No11 seed in the South regional and Missouri Valley Conference champions, were a trendy upset pick against the sixth-seeded Hurricanes and they’re very much living up to advance billing with under 10 minutes to go. Clayton Custer’s lay-up moments ago cut Miami’s lead to two points. South Dakota State 29-34 Ohio State. The fifth-seeded Buckeyes are on top but Jackrabbits star Mike Daum has just canned a three-pointer to close it to five points with 5:52 left in the first half. Daum, who has a game-high 15 points so far, is more than the tournament’s best nickname (‘The Dauminator’): he may be the best NBA prospect you’ve never heard of. Iona 41-62 Duke. We’re less than two minutes into the second half and the second-seeded Blue Devils have already tacked on to their 14-point halftime lead over the Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference champions. Wendell Carter Jr’s basket just now off a Grayson Allen assist marked Duke’s 10th consecutive made field goal. Loyola Chicago 28-28 Miami (Fl). And Miami have things tied up into halftime and we have… no basketball at this moment. So I guess this is a good time to hand things over to Bryan Graham who will take you through the next few hours of NCAA tournament action. Loyola Chicago 26-24 Miami (Fl). And we just have one game going here. And only for a moment. Miami cut it to a two point game with 90 seconds to go. And a Number1 seed has still yet to fall to a Number 16 seed. I feel like this last hour has been something of a tease. Oh well. It’s halftime and Duke are up 53-39 over Iona. So you’re telling me there’s a chance. Penn 56-69 Kansas. And it’s looking like we’re not going to see the first upset from a No16. Things look pretty nice for Kansas who are up by 13 points with less than four minutes to go and they definitely look like they’re in complete control here. The Quakers are just playing this out but congrats to them for making the Jayhawks uh, well, quake there for a long stretch of time. Bad news for Duke haters. They’ve got a 40-25 lead over Iona with 5:51 left in the first half. Meanwhile Loyola Chicago has a 18-15 lead over Miami, 7:40 left in the half. Penn 51-60 Kansas. Meanwhile, Kansas looks in control in the second half of their game with Penn, with a 9 point lead with 7:31 remaining. Josh Perkins ties the game for Gonzaga. On the other end, freshman Zach Norvell hits a three! And an offensive foul on UNCG looks like it will pretty much put an end to their upset bid but Gonzaga misses both free throws. UNCG go for the three-pointer that would tie the game but it just doesn’t go down. Gonzaga make one out of two free throws and that manages to seal the deal. UNCG 64-62 Gonzaga. 1:39 remaining. UNCG with the lead! On their first put-back points of the half! Upset brewing? Double barrel action! Okay, UNCG and Gonzaga are tied 60-60 with 3:22 to go. Meanwhile, Kansas are only up 50-45 over Penn with 12:33 to go. Could the Jayhawks be in danger? UNCG 56-57 Gonzaga. UNCG cut it to a single point. We’re definitely in Potential Upset Territory here. 5:40 to go. And hey, we’re back to four-games-going-at-once! No11 Loyola Chicago is tipping off against No6 Miami (Florida). Oh hey, it’s Iona-Duke! They’re already 5-5 with lithe more than a minute into the game. Action has resumed in the Impossible Dream Battle between Penn and Kansas and… things remain interesting. Penn are keeping it close. Kansas have a 42-35 lead with 16:52 to go. So both games have a seven point difference at the moment, when Gonzaga up 57-50 with 7:54 left. That’s unusual (and short-lived, UNCG immediately scores twice to cut it to 57-54.) UNCG 42-47 Gonzaga. Old (well, older) school basketball on display here between the Spartans and the Bulldogs, with either team only making three three-pointers apiece. Definitely more physical than Oklahoma/Rhode Island. It’s definitely cool to see so many different types of basketball on display throughout the day. UNCG cut Gonzaga’s lead to 5 points with 11:46 to go. At some point shortly, we’ll have No14 Iona vs No2 Duke tipping off, with the winner going on to face Rhode Island. That game has been delayed a tad bit thanks to that whole overtime thing. Gonzaga have a 44-36 lead over UNCG, who are starting to put in a little fight here. We have 14:00 to go. Order has been restored. Kanas have a 33-26 lead over Penn at the half, but still that’s a fairly tight halftime score for a No16/No1 matchup. Worth monitoring. Our only live game at the moment features Gonzaga with a 26-28 lead over UNCG with 17:19 remaining in the second half. We apparently missed absolutely nothing here, drama-wise. The Volunteers with a statement win. Everybody’s trying to hit the big three in this overtime and nobody seems to be hitting it until E.C. Matthews nails his to give Rhode Island a 74-72 lead, part of a 12-2 run, and they don’t look back. Trae Young’s college career is probably done. Meanwhile, Tennessee retains a comfortable 54-35 lead over Wright State with 7:13 left. Gonzaga has a 32-23 lead over UNCG at the half. Penn has a 19-11 lead over Kansas with 8:32 remaining in the first. Will we see our first upset by a No16 in tournament history? (No but it’s fun that they have an early lead.) Oklahoma 69-69 Rhode Island. Oklahoma give the ball back to Rhode Island, who… miss. And Trea Young gets fouled with a chance to tie things up on the line. Which he does. Rhode Island has a chance to hit the last shot, two chances actually, and THEY CAN’T GET IT IN. We’re heading to overtime. Rhode Island 69-67 Oklahoma. Young cuts it to two points with 2:10 and then nails a three for the lead. However, a three-point play gives the lead right back to Rhode Island. Oklahoma have the ball and are down by two with less than a minute left. Oklahoma is keeping close, but Rhode Island has stayed on top 66-62 with 3:45 left to go. It’s going down to the wire. I am already sick of these Charles Barkley/Samuel L. Jackson/Spike Lee CapitalOne commercials. It’s going to be a long march through, uh, March. Not a great second half from Trae Young, He scores his first point of the second half on the free throw line with 6:43 to go. Rhode Island have a 59-53 lead. And we’re almost in keeping-the-plates spinning portion of the evening, with No16 Penn about to tip off against No1 Kansas. Oh hey, they’re finally out of halftime, Tennessee has a 40-27 lead over Wright State. Pretty healthy, but not entirely insurmountable with 17:18 to go in their game. Gonzaga have a 17-13 lead over UNCG with 8:03 to go. And wisely so, back-to-back three pointers give Rhode Island a 55-50 lead! Oklahoma is up 50-47 on Rhode Island with 10:36 to go in the game while UNCG and Gonzaga are all tied up at 8-8 with 13:30 to go in the first half. I’m gonna stick with Oklahoma/Rhode Island for the moment I think. The tournament is really all about second halves, however and we’ve got an interesting one here with Oklahoma and Rhode Island all tied up with 15:00 to go. This is always one of the greatest days on the sports calendar. Or really just on the calendar in general. There’s always the chance for an upset, buzzer beater, furious comeback or just plain old wackiness when you have games going all day, sometimes four at a time. Hopefully we’ll have a few of those over the course of the next few hours. Don’t want the other guys to have all the fun today. Alright things are really starting now, with Game Number 3, No. 13 UNC-Greensboro vs. No. 4 Gonzaga, tipping off. This is UNC-Greensboro’s first tournament appearance since 2001. It’s halftime at Wright State/Tennessee, with Tennessee enjoying a 34-23 lead. The shock-o-meter is edging up towards “mild” with Oklahoma leading Rhode Island 35-31 at the half. Not that it would be a HUGE shock, given that Oklahoma have the magnificent Trae Young. Some had picked Tennessee to struggle to live up to their No3 seeding but they’re doing OK so far. They have a healthy 17-8 lead over Wright State with around 10 minutes left in the first. And we’re off, with Oklahoma taking on Rhode Island in out first game. No10 seed Oklahoma are 24-21 up in the early stages. They have guard Trae Young, who leads the nation with averages of 27.4 points and 8.8 assists. If Oklahoma lose this one that could Young’s college career done as a freshman - he’s projected to go in the first round if he decides to enter the NBA draft. Hunter will be here shortly, in the meantime here’s our writers on who they think will win the tournament: Villanova over North Carolina. Why not a repeat of 2016? However, this time the Wildcats won’t wait to win on a buzzer-beater. Instead, they will coast through the second half and establish a new dynasty on the Main Line and send Wright to the Hall of Fame. Les Carpenter Villanova over Gonzaga. Jay Wright has quietly strung together a five-year run at Villanova that any program in history would happily take: 159 wins, four Big East regular season titles, three conference tournament titles and a national title. Cutting down the nets again this year will give his program the national respects it deserves. DJ Gallo Villanova over Virginia. Make it two national titles in three years for Wright, whose tiny Catholic school powerhouse on Philadelphia’s Main Line will make the jump to dynasty status after cutting down the nets in San Antonio.

It is a play the former RSC artistic director and Russianist has waited half a lifetime to direct. The sound of trees being felled at the end of the evening doubles as the ticking of a clock. And as the play evolves the costumes become subtly more contemporary as though to hint that this is a Chekhov for all time. When Madame Ranyevskaya leaves her beloved house en route for Paris and likely destitution, she steps away in modern high-heeled boots and flared coat. She could, almost, be one of us. And when she leaves, it is not a house nor a beloved cherry orchard from which she parts. The set is the theatre itself – in its indestructible scarlet and gold – stunningly extended by designer Tom Piper and his team down to the last 18th-century gilded moulding. The nearest we get to an actual orchard are the outsize pieces of cherry blossom that float down from on high to join ripped-up telegrams from Ranyevskaya’s lover on the ground. I approve of this non-literal vision and its way of dissolving the frontier between players and audience, even if there are occasional moments when the work’s emotional impact is compromised by our being unable to forget we are in a theatre. Kirsty Bushell’s Ranyevskaya treats tragedy as a party at which one must make an effort to be bright. She has a caffeinated restlessness about her. In a play about being, on the domestic level, paralysed by circumstance, she jogs hectically to and fro, animatedly greeting furniture as an old friend, her face mobile as her feet. She wears, in the first half, a cherry-coloured dress, as though to match the fruits of the orchard we cannot see. And when she thinks of her drowned son, seven-year-old Grisha, she buckles in pain and comes into new focus. It is a fabulous performance. The cast is diverse and outstanding. Jude Owusu is especially compelling as Lopakhin, upcoming man and entrepreneur, proposing holiday cottages in the cherry orchard – an idea Ranyevskaya shrugs aside. When he speaks about his parents as serfs, one feels Russia nod at the American south and at Bristol’s historic involvement with the slave trade. A Chekhov for all time then – and for every place. There is splendid support from an earnest Enyi Okoronkwo as Pyotr the tutor and from Hayden McLean as audacious manservant Yasha. Simon Coates gives a vintage performance as Uncle Leonid, one of Chekhov’s lively bores, a man incapable of stilling his own tongue. Varya – love’s casualty, another essentially Chekhovian figure – is played with delicate yearning by Rosy McEwen: a slight figure in grey, keys dangling from her belt yet with all doors, metaphorically, closed to her. And as Charlotta, Hungarian performance artist Eva Magyar is sensational as a conjuror with half a cucumber stowed in her pocket. When Ranyevskaya says, “Coming” – they are calling for her – just before she leaves for ever (Rory Mullarkey’s translation is supple and authoritative), I found I had a lump in my throat. It is overwhelmingly powerful to hear that one ordinary word work so hard for its keep. She leaves behind little Grisha and old Firs (excellent Japanese actor Togo Igawa) to haunt the place – youth and age together in a long sleep. It does not take much for the gothic to capsize into kitsch. The Rocky Horror Show milked – or bled – that liaison and made an indestructible hit of it. In Frankenstein, a sprightly new version by April De Angelis, there is an attempt at playing Mary Shelley’s extraordinary novel, written 200 years ago, mostly straight. Even so, there are laughs in some of the wrong places. Captain Walton, although attractively played by Ryan Gage, has a talent for comic pauses into which our laughter naturally pours. And De Angelis introduces wisecracks for a northern audience about, for example, the merits of Derby over Switzerland. But I was content to be more entertained than freaked out. Besides, for those who require gore, designer Ben Stones has come up with a tremendously satisfying set complete with creepy charnel house, boxes of spare limbs, forked lightning, the works. I particularly admired Frankenstein’s laboratory/study with its decanters of blood and other fiendish props. But what is most interesting – and serious – about director Matthew Xia’s hugely enjoyable production is its revelation that Frankenstein and his monster – for all their bluster and the latter’s loud yells – are, in their different ways, weak. It leaves us with a puzzle: who is the creature here – the monster or Frankenstein himself? And who, in this story, might be considered strong? Shane Zaza has a challenge as Frankenstein because, emotionally, it is a one-tone part: he is stuck, like the Ancient Mariner, inside the caul of his story, remorse mixed with alarm. Zaza looks dashing in black tails and white collar – perfectly cast as a romantic figure – and scurries about with persecuted haste, a nervous twitch of a man. His monster (intrepid Harry Attwell) is suitably misshapen: a bald, croaky Caliban, greased with his own blood, who cannot walk competently and makes a self-pitying din when he isn’t busy killing people. Perhaps Elizabeth, the woman to whom Frankenstein is briefly wed, could be a candidate for the strength in the piece? She is played with illuminating intelligence by Shanaya Rafaat – a star in the making. The action moves at a restless pace, as though blown by an ill wind, and the theatre in the round works magnificently: there is no escape for Frankenstein within its vicious circle. Josh Azouz’s new play, Buggy Baby, is about three refugees in a room with a pink carpet and a cupboard – seemingly a portal to their old life. But it is not clear where they have come from, and the khat leaves they chew deepen doubts about everything. At the centre of director Ned Bennett’s violently exuberant, high-decibel production is Baby Aya. Jasmine Jones must have done some serious baby-watching as her brilliant portrayal of this baby is comically spot on – especially its gormlessly knowing glances. But this baby can also talk, like a disillusioned adult. Noof McEwan, as enigmatic Jaden, and Hoda Bentaher as Nur keep faith with this weird play, as do gun-toting rabbits Tom Clegg and Abrahi Jarman. However, I would have liked more context and character to make sense of this surreal limbo mixed with flashes of what one might almost call genius.

The gender pay report from the UK’s largest bank, published on Thursday, reveals that less than a quarter of its most senior staff are female, while more than two-thirds of those in junior roles are women. That disparity means HSBC Bank’s pay gap is 59%, according to the mean average measure, which is calculated by taking all male and female wages and dividing them by the number of workers. The group gives a provisional mean pay gap of 60% for 2018. The gender pay gap refers to the difference in hourly earnings between men and women working for an organisation regardless of their roles, rather than men and women in the same role. Under a new government scheme, all companies with more than 250 employees must report their pay gap under an initiative designed to reveal the greater prevalence of men in top-paying jobs and encourage action for change. HSBC said that it had increased the proportion of senior posts held by women to nearly 27% last year from 22% in 2012, but added: “We recognise that that there is more work to do to address our gender balance at senior levels.” The median gap, which takes the mid-point when all wage rates are lined up from the biggest to smallest as a way to reduce the impact of one-off outliers, remained steady at 29%. That compares to a 43.5% median gap at the Barclays International banking group, a 32.8% gap at Lloyds and a 22.6% gap at the Co-operative Bank. On a mean basis the gaps were 48%, 32.8% and 30.3%. HSBC said it wants women to hold 30% of senior roles by 2020 and it would request gender diverse shortlists when hiring new leaders and would ensure gender balance in its workforce development programmes. It has also expanded opportunities for mentoring for women in well-paid global banking and markets roles and said it was encouraging flexible working and shared parental leave. It said it was “confident in its approach to pay” and if it identified pay differences between men and women in similar roles which could not be explained by performance or experience, it made “appropriate adjustments”. “We are making progress. Improving our gender balance will take time and require sustained focus over the long-term,” the company said. All private and public sector organisations and charities with more than 250 employees are required to submit their pay figures to the government by April under the new scheme. About 2,250 have filed figures so far, but the legislation is expected to affect about 9,000 companies, which collectively employ more than 15 million people. EasyJet and Virgin Money are among those that have revealed a gap of more than 30% in the mean hourly pay rates between male and female workers. On Thursday, British luxury brand Burberry revealed that its female staff earned an average 25.9% less per hour, despite making up the majority of employees at every pay quartile. The company said the disparity was the result of employing more men than women in senior roles immediately below its executive team. Marco Gobbetti, chief executive of Burberry, said: “With women making up 70% of our 3,500 employees in the UK, we are committed to narrowing this gap as we work to develop more women leaders to drive the growth and success of our business.” Until Thursday, the travel group Tui held the dubious crown for the largest gender pay gap reported by a major UK company under the new scheme. Its male employees paid more than double the female staff. Women at the group’s Tui Airways UK unit earn on average 56.9% less in hourly pay. The company said the gap stemmed from low representation of women in highly paid roles such as pilots, engineering, technology and senior management. This article was amended on 29 March 2018 to clarify that 60% is HSBC’s provisional mean pay gap for 2018."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2018/mar/15/new-oil-threat-looms-over-englands-national-park-land-campaigners-warn","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-15T16:21:07Z","webTitle":"New oil threat looms over England's national park land, campaigners warn","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/mar/15/new-oil-threat-looms-over-englands-national-park-land-campaigners-warn","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/mar/15/new-oil-threat-looms-over-englands-national-park-land-campaigners-warn","fields":{"headline":"New oil threat looms over England's national park land, campaigners warn","bodyText":"More than 71,000 hectares (177,000 acres) of protected countryside, including national park land, in the south-east of England are at risk from a new wave of oil drilling, environmental campaigners have warned. Under threat are areas of outstanding natural beauty in the Weald, which runs between the north and south downs, and the South Downs national park, Greenpeace said. A mapping analysis by the group found that around 71,000 hectares of protected areas overlap with oil and gas exploration licenses awarded by the government for the south-east, across an area stretching from the Surrey Hills in the east to the Isle of Wight to the west. The warning comes as campaigners in Surrey prepare to deliver a petition with more than 100,000 signatures against plans for an oil well at Holmwood, south of Dorking. While high profile efforts to frack in the north of England and the Midlands have been stalled and delayed, several companies are preparing to drill conventional onshore wells later this year in the south of the country. The big prize is the oil within and around the Kimmeridge formation, which has been likened by the industry to major fields in the US. The plans do not involve fracking, but in some cases will use a technique known as acidisation, where diluted hydrochloric acid is put down a well to dissolve limestone, releasing the oil trapped within, as well as oil within adjacent shale formations. Hannah Martin, Greenpeace UK head of energy, said: “Energy firms have got their eyes on the shale oil buried under some of the best-loved nature sites in the south-east. Fracking operations are banned within these sensitive areas, but the industry is now planning to get the oil out by pumping acid into the ground.” One of the most promising oil wells is the Horse Hill site near Crawley, dubbed the Gatwick Gusher after encouraging initial tests by UK Oil &amp; Gas Investments PLC (UKOG). The company is undertaking a 150-day testing programme ahead of commencing drilling of a well at the site towards the end of summer. UKOG hopes to be commercially producing oil by spring next year. UKOG’s licences for the Horse Hill work included protected areas known as sites of special scientific interest, but the company said it had no plans to drill in protected areas and was fully aware of their sensitivity. “Rather than importing essential resources from potentially untrustworthy foreign sources, we believe that this country’s energy security is an issue of paramount importance and that indigenous oil has a key role to play in this regard,” the company said. Other prospects include a site near the village of Balcombe in West Sussex, which is licensed to fracking firm Cuadrilla but will be operated by another company, Angus Energy. Cuadrilla recently won a planning green light to test for oil flows at an existing well there. To the west of Horse Hill is Holmwood, which Europa Oil and Gas plans to drill during the second half of this year. The site is in an area of outstanding natural beauty, which the company said planners had concluded would not be impacted by oil drilling. Hugh Mackay, the company’s chief executive, said the well was similar to a dozen other discoveries made in the Weald over the last three decades. “There’s no new technology here, it’s a typical Weald basin oil prospect.” The company has planning permission, and the Environment Agency has said it is minded to approve the project. On Thursday night at 7pm, campaigners against the drilling will hand in a petition signed by 102,000 people to the government body, urging the EA to block the drilling. The petition’s organiser, who did not want to be named, told the Guardian: “We are deeply concerned for the pollution risks this drilling proposal presents to our water supply.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"global-development/2018/mar/22/i-saw-aid-for-starving-people-spent-on-staff-salaries-through-inept-planning","type":"article","sectionId":"global-development","sectionName":"Global development","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-22T07:00:00Z","webTitle":"I saw aid for starving people spent on staff salaries through inept planning | The Secret Aid Worker","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2018/mar/22/i-saw-aid-for-starving-people-spent-on-staff-salaries-through-inept-planning","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2018/mar/22/i-saw-aid-for-starving-people-spent-on-staff-salaries-through-inept-planning","fields":{"headline":"I saw aid for starving people spent on staff salaries through inept planning","bodyText":"I recently resigned from my job with a non-governmental organisation in Africa. After years of working in the sector, I have been left disillusioned with the ethos and impact of these organisations. The sector is filled with the wrong people with the wrong motivations and the wrong agenda. It is, after all, a business enterprise worth $27.3bn, at least in 2016. Missions in country are incentivised by money. The more you can raise, the happier your colleagues in the region and in headquarters because some of that money goes into paying their salaries and office rents – and your performance in the country is linked to that, rather than the quality of the programmes you are running. In the eyes of senior management, a successful humanitarian operation is based on two key indicators: how much money you raise with the donors and how many beneficiaries you have reached with the aid money you have been given. However, in my experience, what is not measured is how well you have managed projects in addressing the real needs of the intended recipients, how accountable you have been to them, and how quickly you have been able to address their urgent needs in humanitarian emergencies. For example, little to no progress was made with one project for months, even though emergency funding had already been secured to address the food and water requirements of people in desperate need. For months on end, the project was dormant. No aid was delivered. No families were helped. Mismanagement meant that most of the funding that was given for alleviating the pain and suffering caused by food insecurity was already spent to pay staff salaries and benefits. No cash for the purpose of buying food was given, and no buckets and no soap were provided. However, most alarmingly, no one at the organisation felt compelled to implement this project. There was no sense of urgency, no sense of responsibility and no obligation to assist people on the brink of famine. Months passed before anything happened. The project seemed to just fall through the cracks. More shockingly, one senior member of staff – who is responsible for the quality of delivery of such programmes – only seemed to take notice that the project was failing because the donor deadline for the completion of the project was fast approaching, and we had zero achievements to report back. More energy was then directed into saving the NGO’s image in the eyes of the donor, and concocting unrealistic justifications for how we spent all the money allotted to staff salaries and field trips. Yet we had no concrete results to justify these expenses. Furthermore, creative thinking is not encouraged. The best way to survive is to play internal politics and tow the party line. Get more money and run programmes the way they have always been run. There is little room to work on improving their quality. Proposed plans towards accessing areas where humanitarian needs are high, and which have been largely left untouched by most humanitarian organisations are discouraged. Trying to review and change the methodology we use to assess vulnerability of displaced people is discouraged. The best policy is to carry on with the way programmes have been run regardless of how dysfunctional they have been. How is “dissent” dealt with? Quite simply, by character assassination. Once you have fallen foul of the game of internal politics – a sad reality in a sector that is supposed to leave that behind and be united in its work reaching the same simple objective – energy of senior staff is directed to undermining your reputation with your colleagues. I have had my own experience of this: when I contradicted one senior member of staff over a particular approach he wanted to take, he yelled at me in front of some of my team. When I escalated this incident as a breach of our code of conduct, no action was taken. In short, the industry is largely overrun by narrow-minded, power-hungry individuals who are more interested in leading a comfortable, well-paid life based in the capital cities of these conflict-torn places than in working to uphold humanitarian principles towards beneficiaries and staff. They dominate the industry. Those few in between who try to implement more accountable projects will have a constant fight ahead of them.

It’s a stupid thing to say and I’m not quite sure what prompts it, except that Mears is so slight and vulnerable looking that you can’t quite believe he is already director of opera at this famous, glitzy, occasionally poisonous place. His appointment in 2016 was greeted with surprise. He was just 37, the youngest head of opera in Covent Garden’s history, and he was jumping from the relative obscurity of Northern Ireland Opera, with a budget of £1m, to a house with a budget of more than £130m. He insists the move never fazed him. “You have to have complete faith in your ability to do a job. The scale is different to Northern Ireland, but the principles of running an opera company are the same. Finding a story for an organisation, having a mission, driving it forward.” He was given a warm welcome, he says, with music director Antonio Pappano and head of casting Peter Katona (a fixture at Covent Garden for 35 years) helping to provide stability and continuity. Pappano’s current contract expires in 2020, but Mears suggests he is likely to continue in place beyond that date. Mears has been in his new role for a year, and today launches the Royal Opera House’s 2018-19 season. Most of these plans will have been set years ago under his predecessor Kasper Holten, but some of his fingerprints are already visible, in particular a production of Billy Budd directed by Deborah Warner that he has bought in from the Teatro Real in Madrid, and a Hansel and Gretel for Christmas that he hopes will tempt parents to bring their children to Covent Garden. “It’s not going to be set in a gas chamber,” he says when I suggest that some productions of this fairytale can be very dark. “That’s not the kind of show we’re after.” Engelbert Humperdinck’s opera – one of the first of a series of shows conceived for young people and designed to counter “negative preconceptions” – has replaced another Holten production. Mears won’t say which, but it’s a fair bet it was seen as either too expensive or too likely to bomb at the box office. With Arts Council England, aware of accusations of being London-centric, reducing the ROH’s funding (cut by 6% in real terms in last year’s settlement), these are relatively straitened times. Covent Garden needs to be a little more frugal and, in these days of Brexit and Corbynism, a little more of the people. That may be one reason behind Mears’s appointment. He showed both in Northern Ireland and with the opera company he founded in his mid-20s, Second Movement, that he could demystify opera, appeal to all ages and build a community of opera-goers. (That thinking may also underpin the recent announcement that Stuart Murphy, who has spent his career in television, is to be chief executive of English National Opera – a decision that bemused the opera cognoscenti.) Covent Garden will stage only five new productions in 2018-19, and only two of those will be produced in-house: Katya Kabanova directed by ROH stalwart Richard Jones, and Hansel and Gretel. There are also three new international co-productions, with The Queen of Spades, directed by the much-vaunted Stefan Herheim, and a starry La Forza del Destino (Anna Netrebko and Jonas Kaufmann under the baton of Pappano) joining the Billy Budd. Five new productions seems a bit thin, but Mears says the expense of reviving the Keith Warner production of Wagner’s Ring Cycle for its final outing means less money for everything else. In 2019-20 he promises eight new productions, and says in a typical season a third of all the productions staged will be new. Full as it is with revivals of tried-and-trusted productions – Tosca, La Traviata, The Marriage of Figaro, La Fille du Régiment – the 2018-19 season feels a little conservative, with operas that will keep the box office where the opera house management likes it to be, at around 95% capacity. Mears demurs, aware of the dangers of being labelled a safe pair of hands. “I think some would say that Janáček is not necessarily completely core repertoire,” he argues, “nor The Queen of Spades, or Billy Budd.” Barrie Kosky’s controversial new production of Carmen will return in the new season. “We actually had someone heckle last night,” says Mears. “They stood up and said: ‘This isn’t Carmen; this is a scandal.’ People who haven’t liked it say: ‘You’ve ruined Carmen.’ But what does that mean? We don’t know what Carmen is. Bizet never went to Spain. His opera was in itself a construct. What ‘You’ve ruined Carmen’ actually means is there is a disjunction between my interpretation of what Carmen should be and what’s on stage. What we can’t do as an artistic organisation is take these great, complex, pulsating masterpieces literally or at face value. Our job is to do something more than that – to dig deep and come up with work that generates an emotional reaction.” But he is wary of subversion for subversion’s sake. “You can lose the work if a production is completely conventional,” he says. “You can also lose the work if a production is too overly concerned with stodgy philosophy. What we need to find is the golden area in the middle where we have practitioners who are able to give life to these operas, which are often hundreds of years old, and make them live as if they’d been written yesterday.” He echoes his predecessor’s view that opera must never become a museum and that new work is crucial – “commissions are the lifeblood of the art form,” he says – but adds that commissioning new work is also very expensive. “It’s very difficult in the current financial climate to commit to a brand-new commission every single season,” he says. More likely is that there will be a new commission every other year. In 2013, Holten had announced to great fanfare four new commissions “inspired by the writings of philosopher Slavoj Žižek”. These new operas – by Kaija Saariaho, Jörg Widmann, Luca Francesconi and Mark-Anthony Turnage – were supposed to “challenge opera writers to write about their fears and hopes for the world now”, and the outgoing ROH chief executive Tony Hall said they would be staged by 2020. Oddly, they have never been heard of again, and there is no sign of them being programmed. I ask Mears what happened. “Two have fallen by the wayside for different reasons,” he says. “The other two – by Turnage and Saariaho – are still in our long-term schedules.” Mears accepts that one of his tasks is to broaden the ethnic mix of the audience, but how will that age-old problem be tackled? “We will have more diversity on stage and in our workforce,” he says. “But it really comes back to how we can entice a wider range of young people to see our work.” Opera in cinemas is great, he says, but nothing can replace the live experience. He will also address gender diversity. The new season features only one female director, Deborah Warner, and two female conductors, Keri-Lynn Wilson and Julia Jones in Carmen. “It’s a long-term project and it’s going to take time,” he says. The ROH will not follow the lead of the Proms and set quotas, but insists that the company does have firm targets and that a 50-50 gender split is the long-term aspiration. Gender equality, audience diversity, countering negative preconceptions, putting opera back into the cultural mainstream – what an agenda. It will, as Mears says, all take time. But will he be given that time? Holten lasted just six years, barely long enough, given the five-year planning cycle for operatic seasons, to get your feet under the table. Mears is a young man with time on his side. Now he needs to get everyone else on his side, too."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"society/2018/mar/15/concern-at-rising-infant-mortality-rate-in-england-and-wales","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-15T00:01:09Z","webTitle":"Concern at rising infant mortality rate in England and Wales","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/mar/15/concern-at-rising-infant-mortality-rate-in-england-and-wales","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/mar/15/concern-at-rising-infant-mortality-rate-in-england-and-wales","fields":{"headline":"Concern at rising infant mortality rate in England and Wales","bodyText":"More babies are dying within a year of being born, in a “disturbing reversal” of several decades of the NHS’s success in reducing infant mortality. Health professionals, charities and midwives voiced serious concern at the trend in England and Wales, which was confirmed in data published by the Office for National Statistics. The rate rose from 2.6 neonatal deaths per 1,000 births in 2015 to 2.7 for every 1,000 births in 2016. Smoking among mothers, maternal obesity, poverty and the England-wide shortage of midwives were all cited as potential explanations for the rise. The infant mortality rate, showing deaths within the first year of a child’s life, also rose, from 3.7 to 3.8 per 1,000 live births over the same period. There is particular concern that both have risen for the second year in a row after years of steady improvement. “It is deeply concerning to see a rise in infant mortality rates for the second year running. There are significant variations in mortality rates across the country, meaning there is much more to do to ensure that all health services are giving vulnerable babies the best chance of survival,” said Caroline Lee-Davey, the chief executive of Bliss, which helps sick babies and their parents. “Any increase is a real concern. There is a need to tackle some of the biggest factors influencing this, including smoking in pregnancy and rising levels of obesity, both of which can have an impact on infant mortality,” said Gill Walton, the chief executive of the Royal College of Midwives. “Whilst we cannot make a direct connection between staffing levels, pressures on our maternity services and infant mortality, there is no doubt that overworked and under-resourced services cannot deliver the safest and highest-quality care”. The Liberal Democrat MP Norman Lamb, an ex-health minister, urged ministers to urgently look into “this disturbing reversal of historic falls in infant mortality. The fact that the NHS is under such strain may well be contributing to this.” Jonathan Ashworth, Labour’s shadow health secretary, said: “Swingeing cuts to public health and early years services have resulted in child poverty rising, differences in life expectancy widening for the first time since 2011 and more obese children in our schools than almost any other high-income country.” The rise emerged as a new report warned that Britain already has the fourth highest infant mortality among 15 OECD countries analysed by the Nuffield Trust and the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health. Their analysis found that Britain is doing worse than other nations studied in seven of the 16 different indicators of the health of children aged between zero and four examined by Dr Ronny Cheung, an NHS paediatrician a hospital in London and visiting fellow at the Nuffield Trust. “After many years of progress, health outcomes for babies and young children in the UK are now stalling in several key areas like infant mortality and immunisation rates, and we are lagging behind most other high-income countries on mortality, breastfeeding and obesity rates,” the thinktank said in a statement. Cheung found that the rates of death among babies aged less than 28 days and also those aged up to a year had plateaued since 2013. The UK had the fourth highest infant mortality rate among all the 15 countries in 2014. Recent years have also seen increases in childhood cancer, while the rate of children being immunised against the measles vaccine has risen by 20% in a decade. However, fewer people have that jab than in countries such as Germany, Spain, the Netherlands and Spain, and the uptake of inoculations against whooping cough and meningitis has dropped since last year. Meanwhile, doctors claim that the first few weeks of 2018 saw over 10,000 more people die than usual. Lucinda Hiam at the London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine and Danny Dorling at Oxford University that say weekly mortality figures show 10,375 additional deaths (a rise of 12.4%) in England and Wales in the first seven weeks of 2018 compared with the previous five years. The ageing population and influenza do not explain the deaths, said NHS Digital."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/blog/2018/mar/15/jamie-carragher-spitting-sky-love-island","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-15T10:00:20Z","webTitle":"Flob farrago shows pundits helped turn Beautiful Game into Love Island | Paul MacInnes","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2018/mar/15/jamie-carragher-spitting-sky-love-island","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/blog/2018/mar/15/jamie-carragher-spitting-sky-love-island","fields":{"headline":"Flob farrago shows pundits helped turn Beautiful Game into Love Island","bodyText":"Deciding what to do with Jamie Carragher has taken some time. Indeed it’s been possible to worry for the HR department at Sky Sports. Perhaps they have seen the former Liverpool defender flob on a 14‑year‑old girl too many times. A loop of expectorate running continually before their eyes, this short video clip may eventually have assumed the same mystical qualities as the Zapruder film. Sky ultimately made its decision on Wednesday, opting to suspend Carragher from his role as a pundit until the end of the season, at which point his position will be reviewed. The judgment came five days after one Andy Hughes of Colwyn Bay crept up on Carragher in traffic after Manchester United’s 2-1 victory against Liverpool at Old Trafford on Saturday. Pulling alongside Carragher’s Range Rover Hughes experienced a moment of provocative genius equivalent to Donald Trump finding the caps lock. Winding down his window and leaning over his daughter, he repeated the score out loud: “2-1, Jamie lad,” Hughes squealed, adding that little diminutive at the end to show it was just a friendly piece of goading. At this point Carragher had a choice. He could have burst into tears, riven to his core by the unshakable truth contained within Mr Hughes’s words. He could also have opted for any one of another 62,000 responses available to him, none of which would have made him look like a thin-skinned barbarian. But in the end he went for spitting and, so, that’s that. The process by which Sky came to its decision was long and arduous. If you had to draw a parallel it would be the shaming of Cersei Lannister in Game of Thrones with the subscription broadcaster in the role of the High Sparrow. First off there was a period of uncertainty, Carragher left to brood on his sins. Then, on Monday, the pundit was summoned from Liverpool to London for a meeting with his bosses. The culmination of that encounter was Carragher being removed from his duties, but only for the evening (Gary Neville not only had to conduct video analysis for Stoke v Manchester City alone, but respond to his own observations with an arched eyebrow). This was hardly the end of it. The next day Carragher was back in Isleworth, live on Sky News, to offer trademark analysis. Only this time it was of his own grubby indiscretion. His interviewer, Sarah Hewson, kicked off by informing him she herself was “recoiling” at his “disgusting” behaviour. Carragher was then invited to consider his actions. The best explanation he could manage was “a moment of madness”, perhaps hoping for validation through alliteration. For a few minutes he flailed around trying to conjure a convincing explanation as to why the madness descended. None was forthcoming. Sky let that performance roll around in their mouths for 24 hours then decided on a longer suspension with the threat of an ultimate sanction in the summer. You could look at this as a cake‑and-eat-it outcome; a flobbing farrago has been spun out into four days of news with the prospect of more to come. At the same time a suspension has the effect of coming over like a serious sanction while keeping options open. On the other hand it is possible that Sky took so long to make a decision because it was actually a tricky one. Anyone who works in football media knows full well that celebrity, its cultivation and the public response to it is at the heart of the business they are part of. The game is not quite like Love Island yet, but it is getting that way. Who’s up and who’s down, who’s in dispute with whom, is a necessary tension to keep the drama rolling during days when there’s nothing happening on the pitch (that’s not a reference to United v Sevilla, by the way). Fans react to this fare as they would with any other type of celebrity news – they both love and loathe it in equal measure. As Ian Herbert wrote in the Daily Mail this week, pundits are increasingly as much of the plot as the footballers. You will never believe what Paul Scholes had to say about Manchester United or how Gary Neville slammed Antonio Conte. You won’t credit how Roy Keane eviscerated anyone and everyone including himself in front of a mirror. All this is part of the dance. But if the dance is basically to engender a cycle of barb and counter-barb it should not come as a surprise to anyone when it gets out of hand. Sky might have been looking at the situation this week and thinking: how do we de-escalate this? As things currently stand we have seen the logical conclusion to this dance. It ends in two 40-something men behaving like emotionally under-developed children as an actual child is humiliated in public. The daughter is no doubt experiencing her own week of infamy and all through no fault of her own. That she is the only voice in this entire shambles that carries any maturity is less surprising than it should be. “Stop it!”, she tells her father at more than one point during the film. If only he had listened."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"us-news/2018/mar/28/which-country-has-the-worst-class-system-the-uk-or-us","type":"article","sectionId":"inequality","sectionName":"Inequality","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-28T14:43:18Z","webTitle":"What Americans can learn from British class guilt","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/mar/28/which-country-has-the-worst-class-system-the-uk-or-us","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/mar/28/which-country-has-the-worst-class-system-the-uk-or-us","fields":{"headline":"What Americans can learn from British class guilt","bodyText":"Rodrigo seems like many of the bright young men of Silicon Valley. He graduated from one of the best universities in the world, and at 36, he now works for a tech startup. In his free time, he likes earnest chats – one of his favorite topics is how to improve urban infrastructure. But Rodrigo’s story is unusual in a way that offers some perspective on class mobility in America versus that of the UK. Rodrigo is Welsh and grew up on the dole, living in a council flat (the UK’s equivalent to social housing). He, his siblings and his single mother dwelled on the edge of a mining community that has been in economic decline since the 1980s. Rodrigo excelled in school, though, so he ultimately left his town and his neighborhood, which people “made jokes about”, and where his family “didn’t have a car, rode the bus a lot”. He attended Oxford University with grants, which he thinks was “super lucky”. His mother initially worried about her son going the Oxbridge route, wondering if he would be able to make that cultural transition or thrive there. In the end, he found the university to be a supportive place, despite the “pockets that conform to stereotypes” about public school boys (we call them private school in the US). In England, Rodrigo was initially somewhat ashamed of his origins, “trying to pass as much as I could”. This is no longer the case. I sought Rodrigo out because I wanted to see how the cliches around American and British class identity play out on a person’s life today. In both countries, people may feel uncomfortable talking about their class position publicly – which was part of why Rodrigo asked me not to use his last name. A hackneyed storyline is that we in the US have a covert class system: we supposedly measure people on merit, but we actually measure people on their skills, credentials, college educations and earning power. Meanwhile, the UK has an overt one: everyone knows who is a toff and who is a yob, and British people’s ears are supersonic when it comes to accents, and class markers are carefully noticed: the wine a person drinks, how they cut their food. America is supposed to have greater social mobility. In the UK, everyone ostensibly has a rung but they are also trapped in that position. Nowadays, these once-clear binaries are muddled. By some measures, America’s class mobility has foundered in recent decades. According to a 2015 Pew study, only 64% of Americans now believe that opportunities for mobility are broadly accessed, the lowest rate in around three decades. Numbers bear out this pessimism. As economist Raj Chetty explained in a 2016 lecture at the London School of Economics, the probability of a child born to parents in the bottom fifth of the incomes reaching the top fifth is 7.5% in America. In the UK, this number is 9%, according to research by economists Jo Blanden and Stephen Machin. There is, in short, less mobility in the US, says Richard Reeves, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution as well as the author of the book Dream Hoarders. Reeves, who is British, describes “the big focus of his work” the comparison of the two countries’ attitudes towards and expressions of social class. I myself am acutely aware that something has changed. I grew up in New York City and in London. In the local state school I attended in England, I saw and heard far more awareness of where a person stood in the social hierarchy than I had ever heard stateside. Some of my British classmates would say they wanted to do exactly what their fathers did; none of the kids I knew at school back in New York shared this sentiment. Thirty years later, many of the American kids I grew up with, despite their best efforts, have not reached the level of financial comfort of their parents. That lack of mobility is something Eliot Bamford, a New Hampshire-dwelling Englishman and public school teacher, can see in his adopted home. Some of his fellow rural teachers are squeezed economically, he says – they drive Uber during the summer holidays, for instance – though he and his wife “squeak by”. Bamford says that despite the fact that he encounters a great deal of poverty among the Special Education students he teaches – some of who live in trailer parks or come to school hungry – few discuss or label themselves in class terms. Bamford, who left England 20 years ago, grew up living on the edge of a council estate in Nottingham. He says that the Americans he interacts with socially in New Hampshire are also less diverse economically than his range of friends in Britain, where he was the first in his family to go to college. In England, Bamford feels you are “up against different kinds of people more often, living in closer communities”. He also spoke of extreme inequality expressed openly and through physical adjacency – like affluent houses nextdoor to these trailer parks – that he never saw in England. For Reeves, the biggest shocker has been that in America, people convince themselves that the system is meritocratic “and thus they don’t feel any shame about broadcasting the internships they got through nepotism, or that they got into colleges as legacies, or that they paid for private SAT prep for their kids”. Reeves argues there is a cognitive dissonance at play. In one captivating and acrid riff, he describes parents who “may be Rachel-Maddow-all-in-no-toy-guns-in-the-house kind of people, but they send all three of their kids to pricey Georgetown Day School without any moral perturbation”. “The UK, with all of it class consciousness, brings class guilt, which is a good thing. But the agonizing discussions over whether British liberal parents should send their children to public [private] schools doesn’t happen here. In the US, parents are aware of structural unfairness but with a total lack of moral queasiness.” While the British middle class remains one of the smallest and poorest in Europe – according to the Pew Research Center, a middle-class family of four in the UK is one of the poorest in Europe, with a disposable income of between $29,000 and $87,300 – the share of adults living in middle-income households has increased in the UK, from 61% to 67% between 1991 and 2010, according to Pew Global in 2017. This uptick is not true in the US. America’s middle-class share was a mere 59% in 2010 (with the caveat that middle-class people’s salaries in the US tend to be higher than in the UK). Meanwhile, wealth inequality in the US today also resembles that before the Great Depression. Social networks matter greatly, and our class calibrations are often around what college one attended, leading to gruesome institutional divisions between those who attend, say, community colleges and those who attend top-tier universities. In England, despite the recent rise in student fees, university is far cheaper. The epidemic of student loans that has weighed down young Americans and older American alike simply doesn’t exist. It was no accident that a saving grace for Rodrigo – who eventually moved to California and married an American – was the lack of copious student debt from his days at Oxford. And paradoxically, he feels that America’s attitude towards English people has given him a lift up when he moved to the US, as some Americans’ understanding of England is entirely derived from the aristocrats of imported television. Few Americans would admit to this or, of course, talk about class at all. As Reeves says, “a bit of [British] class consciousness, on balance, would be better for the US”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/mar/14/canadian-woman-sues-uk-government-over-alleged-sexual-assault-by-sailors","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-14T19:42:48Z","webTitle":"Canadian woman sues UK government over alleged sexual assault by sailors","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/14/canadian-woman-sues-uk-government-over-alleged-sexual-assault-by-sailors","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/mar/14/canadian-woman-sues-uk-government-over-alleged-sexual-assault-by-sailors","fields":{"headline":"Canadian woman sues UK government over alleged sexual assault by sailors","bodyText":"A Canadian woman who alleges she was sexually assaulted by British sailors has filed a lawsuit against the UK government, arguing that it is “vicariously liable” for any harm caused by its employees. The lawsuit stems from a 2015 incident in Shearwater, Nova Scotia, in which four members of the British Navy were charged with sexual assault causing bodily harm. Charges were later dropped against one of the men due to a lack of sufficient evidence. In 2017, charges were withdrawn against another of the accused after a judge ruled that his nearly one and half hour wait to see a lawyer had violated his rights. The two remaining men, Darren Smalley, 37, and Simon Radford,33, will face a criminal trial in Nova Scotia in September. None of the allegations have been proven in court. In a lawsuit filed last week in the supreme court of Nova Scotia, the plaintiff, whose identity is protected by a publication ban in the criminal case, said the alleged assault took place after the sailors arrived in Canada to take part in a hockey tournament. The sailors were staying at a Canadian Forces base and offered the woman, who was a university student at the time of the incident, and her friend a visit of their barracks. The men’s positions led her to trust them, the statement of claim noted. “That the defendant’s employees made themselves known as members of the Royal Navy made the plaintiff feel safe in accepting this offer and being in their presence.” At the barracks she accepted their offer of a drink and later woke up “from an unconscious state in a bed within the barracks over the course of being sexually assaulted by several of the Defendant’s employees”, the statement of claim, which has not been tested in court, noted. She sought medical attention the next day and reported the assault to authorities. The lawsuit argues that the UK government bears responsibility, as it paid for its employees to travel to Nova Scotia and represent its interests. The woman’s lawyer, Mike Dull, said the lawsuit was also motivated by his client’s belief that the UK government is funding the costs of defending the sailors. “And so rather than taking a hard look at the facts … and apologising or at least sort of recognising it in some way, the UK government has instead – from my client’s perspective – chosen to get behind her assaulters and fund their defence.” His client had suffered trauma after the assault, he added, noting that this “has been exacerbated by the strong criminal defence which has been put up by the accused, her assaulters”. While the amount being sought for damages is not specified in the lawsuit, court documents classify the amount as exceeding C$100,000.

He felt that Donald Trump’s administration was where he was meant to work. “It was a natural fit,” Naved Jafry said in an interview. Citing connections across the military, business and academia, he said: “I bring, and draw on, experiences from different areas of knowledge, like a polymath.” Jafry was contracted to work for Trump’s housing and urban development department (Hud). His government email signature said his title was senior adviser. Jafry said he used his role to advocate for “microcities”, where managers privately set their own laws and taxes away from central government control. But those plans are now stalled. Jafry, 38, said he had resigned from his position with Hud after the Guardian asked him to explain multiple allegations of fraud as well as exaggerations in his biography. Jafry, who has also been known by Jafari and Jafri, apologised for inflating his military record but denied making other false claims. He said he resigned because the Guardian’s questions tarnished his reputation inside Hud. “You and I both know we live in the world of opinion and facts merging together,” he said. Hud declined to discuss Jafry. The finding may present a new problem for Hud secretary Ben Carson. On Thursday, Sarah Sanders, Trump’s press secretary, said the White House was “looking into” a controversy around a $31,000 furniture set ordered for Carson’s office. After Carson claimed he had no involvement, emails released on Wednesday said he and his wife actually “picked out” the set. Styling himself as an “entrepreneur and philanthropist”, Jafry said he controlled a multimillion-dollar trust fund built since 1885 by relatives in India. According to court records, however, he struggled to pay rent and bills while engaging in a series of failed takeovers of gas stations and other ventures in Texas over the past decade. In November 2013, a judge ordered Jafry and a fuel company he chaired to repay more than $800,000 to the family of Alfred Oglesby, a former NFL player and investor in the fuel firm, who died in 2009. Oglesby’s widow accused Jafry of fraud. Jafry has not paid the money. Debt collectors said they had been trying to locate him for years. David Freedman, an attorney for Oglesby’s family, said he was surprised Jafry had resurfaced in an influential role in the government. “If he is advising Donald Trump we’re screwed – we should just surrender to North Korea right now,” said Freedman. Jafry denied the lawsuit’s allegations. He said he never received Oglesby’s investment, so he didn’t owe Oglesby’s family money. Having arrived in the US in about 2005, Jafry was the subject of several other legal actions in Texas. Owners of gas stations that Jafry tried to buy sued him and his business associates, repeatedly accusing Jafry of fraud and breaching contracts. Jafry denied wrongdoing. Two lawsuits were settled; a third was dismissed after Jafry did not respond and the plaintiffs failed to locate him. He said the deals collapsed because one owner made false claims about his property, while another failed to disclose that nearby construction work would harm trade. In February 2008, Jafry drew up a list of his holdings that said his personal wealth totalled $18.3m. The document, which was later filed to court, attributed most of his wealth to 164 acres of residential land in Mumbai, where he was raised. Yet after the filing of an eviction lawsuit in September 2010, Jafry was ordered by a Texas court to leave his four-bedroom home in Richmond and give the landlord $10,000, after failing to pay rent for seven months. He was also sued by the local power company after failing to pay his $4,300 bill. Jafry said the 2008 document was accurate at the time, but that his wealth had since evaporated because his claim to the Mumbai land was revoked by relatives unhappy with his troubled US ventures. He said he had already left the rented house when the eviction lawsuit was filed after being unsatisfied with the property. Initially, Jafry told the Guardian he had been hired to work on Hud’s envision centers, which work to reduce the number of people dependent on public housing. He later said he had not worked there after all, but declined to explain. Hud declined repeated requests to clarify what Jafry worked on. Asked in the earlier interview whether he had discussed microcities with Carson, Jafry said: “We are working on a political solution on this.” Jafry said he had met Donald Trump before the 2016 election in “a general setting”, but declined to elaborate. In addition to Jafry’s financial issues, a series of misrepresentations or exaggerations were found in a review of his personal website, other online sources and biographical information he provided. During an interview, Jafry described himself as a veteran of the US army and said he was deployed to Kosovo. When confronted with his service record, though, he said he in fact served as a reservist in the army national guard, and remained in California while giving logistics support to colleagues in Kosovo. A version of Jafry’s biography on his website said he held a degree in law and alternative dispute resolution from National University in La Jolla, California. Prof Jack Hamlin, chairman of National’s department of professional studies, said: “We do not offer a ‘law degree’.” He declined to discuss Jafry’s case. Jafry later said he received a BA in pre-law studies. Jafry has said that before arriving in the US, he made millions in the hospitality industry in Africa. An SEC filing from October 2007 said Jafry was a “founding partner” of the Marakanelo Hotel Group in Botswana. His former website biography said he had owned a group of safari resorts and hotels in Africa which had “merged with Marakanelo Hotels”, securing him a $7.5m windfall. But Sibo Gumpo, the group commercial manager of Crest Hotels, which operates the Marakanelo sites, said in a series of emails that this was not the case. “We do not have a record of the transaction,” said Gumpo. Jafry has over recent years led a series of small energy-related companies operating under variants of the name Zeons. Among the projects listed on the Zeons website under Jafry’s “microcities” branding is a residential property development in Chester county, Pennsylvania, named the Sussex Estates. But this is not a microcity. According to public records, it is owned by Ram Naidu, a retired doctor. “Naved does not have any financial interest in the Sussex development,” Sukhi Singh, who assisted Naidu, said in an email. Singh said Naidu was a friend of Jafry’s mother. Jafry said he had a verbal agreement to promote the development. Raffi Williams, a Hud spokesman, said in an email that Jafry was hired through Accel Corporation, a contractor. When this was put to Stacye Loman, the owner of Accel Corporation, she said in an email: “That is an incorrect statement.” Loman then gave the names of two different companies that she said had hired Jafry. She did not answer when asked if these had been subcontracted by her company. Williams stressed that Hud’s contract with Accel “was procured in 2015”. While Accel did begin providing services to Hud under the Obama administration in 2015, public records said Hud signed contracts for $2.1m worth of services from Accel in 2017 under Trump and Carson. One record said Accel signed an $800,000 deal with Hud on 26 September 2017 to “provide expert guidance” in helping senior Hud officials “to embrace change and provide dynamic leadership”. Jafry said he began work for Hud in October 2017."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/mar/14/williams-churchs-old-views-on-gay-clergy-led-to-desire-not-to-judge-sexual-activities","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-14T18:37:35Z","webTitle":"Williams: church's old views on gay clergy led to desire not to judge sexual activities","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/mar/14/williams-churchs-old-views-on-gay-clergy-led-to-desire-not-to-judge-sexual-activities","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/mar/14/williams-churchs-old-views-on-gay-clergy-led-to-desire-not-to-judge-sexual-activities","fields":{"headline":"Williams: church's old views on gay clergy led to desire not to judge sexual activities","bodyText":"The Church of England may have “overcompensated” for earlier repressive attitudes to gay clergy with a reluctance to deal rigorously with priests who sexually abused children, Rowan Williams, the former archbishop of Canterbury, has said. Giving evidence to the independent inquiry into child sexual abuse, Williams said an “awkwardness” about the church’s views on homosexuality 30 or 40 years ago may have led to a desire not to be “judgmental about people’s sexual activities”. In recent years, “more and more people [are] coming out of the closet. The question of clergy sexuality has been more openly discussed. The change in climate has been quite striking … I think there has been a sea change.” He went on: “At a time when people were beginning to feel awkward about traditional closeted attitudes, there was perhaps an overcompensation, [people] saying, ‘Well, we don’t want to be to be judgmental about people’s sexual activities … We must therefore give people a second chance and understand the pressures,’ and so on.” He suggested that “a rather paradoxical consequence of the traditional view of homosexuality within the church [is that] you want to overcompensate a bit for it.” The inquiry is holding three weeks of hearings on how the C of E handled cases and allegations of clerical sexual abuse, taking the diocese of Chichester as a case study. It earlier heard the diocese was “engulfed” with allegations in the first decade of this century and that at least 15 priests had been jailed for sex crimes. Among them was Peter Ball, the former bishop of Lewes, who was sent to prison in October 2015. An independent review commissioned by the C of E concluded that there had been collusion by senior figures to protect the church. The current bishop of Chichester, Martin Warner, told the inquiry on Wednesday that the diocese was described to him as a “basket case” when he was appointed in 2010. He said: “It is clear to me there had been a historic bias in the diocese in favour of adults in positions of power and authority. This has led to an unwillingness to take allegations of sexual abuse made by children or by adults sufficiently seriously. “It reflects a wider social attitude of deference, a culture of deferring unduly to those in power and a culture of deference and defensiveness … We are still going through the process of culture change, and for many people, I’m sorry to say, the requirement to take a DBS [police] check is interpreted as ‘Are you accusing me of abusing children?’” He depicted the diocese at the time he took up his post as dysfunctional, with competing centres of power and a lack of professional administration. Williams, archbishop of Canterbury from 2002 to 2012, told the hearing there was a “mindset” in the diocese in which the authority of ordained ministry was seen as beyond criticism. Chichester also had a reputation of being a diocese with a high degree of opposition to the ordination of women. The voices of those belonging to the Anglo-Catholic and conservative evangelical wings of the church were “firmest and loudest”. The inquiry continues."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2018/mar/15/london-cheapest-overseas-visitors-decades-says-study-fall-pound","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-15T00:01:10Z","webTitle":"London cheapest it has been for overseas visitors in decades, says study","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/mar/15/london-cheapest-overseas-visitors-decades-says-study-fall-pound","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/mar/15/london-cheapest-overseas-visitors-decades-says-study-fall-pound","fields":{"headline":"London cheapest it has been for overseas visitors in decades, says study","bodyText":"London is the cheapest it has been for overseas visitors in more than two decades as a consequence of Brexit, according to a report. The study by the Economist Intelligence Unit found that British cities have dropped to their cheapest levels internationally since at least the 1990s. It said the sharp fall in the pound after the EU referendum – still more than 6% lower than it was on the eve of the vote – had sent London and Manchester sharply down the rankings. Analysing a basket of more than 150 goods in 133 cities around the world, the report found London was now almost a third cheaper than Paris to visit, and almost a 10th cheaper than Dublin. The UK capital fell six places to 30th in the rankings for the most expensive city in Europe, while Manchester dropped five places to 56. Singapore retained the title as the world’s most expensive city for a fifth year running, while Paris and Zurich topped the list in Europe. Roxana Slavcheva, the editor of the report, said: “Rising import prices mean British shoppers will notice higher levels of inflation, even as businesses potentially benefit from inbound retail tourism and cross border trade.” While the weakness in sterling has created opportunities for UK retail tourism, it has pushed up the cost of living for UK households already under pressure because of weak growth in pay, which has hit overall economic growth."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/mar/14/russian-exiles-nikolai-glushkov-death-london-suspicious-friends-claim","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-14T18:53:50Z","webTitle":"Russian exile's death in London is suspicious, friends claim","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/mar/14/russian-exiles-nikolai-glushkov-death-london-suspicious-friends-claim","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/mar/14/russian-exiles-nikolai-glushkov-death-london-suspicious-friends-claim","fields":{"headline":"Russian exile's death in London is suspicious, friends claim","bodyText":"Friends of the Russian exile found dead in his London home on Monday said they believed his death to be suspicious, adding that he had shown no signs of depression in recent months and was “in a perfect mood”. Nikolai Glushkov’s body was found by his daughter Natalya at his house in New Malden, Kingston upon Thames. There were signs of “suffocation”, the Russian newspaper Kommersant reported. Glushkov, 68, lived alone. Counter-terrorism police are leading the investigation into his death because of Glushkov’s association with the oligarch Boris Berezovsky, who died in 2013. The Metropolitan police say there is currently no evidence to suggest a link between Glushkov’s case and the poisoning of Sergei Skripal in Salisbury. Glushkov was a prominent opponent of the Kremlin. He spent five years in jail in Russia before escaping to the UK in 2004. He was a director of Aeroflot, the state airline, and worked closely with Berezovsky in the 1980s and 90s. At the time of his death, Glushkov was about to defend a claim against him by Aeroflot at the commercial court in London, where he was accused by the Russian authorities of fraud. One friend, who declined to be named, said he had spent months preparing for the case. He failed to show up for a hearing on Monday morning. “He was eager to win,” the friend said. “He had been getting ready for this for months.” The friend said she had visited him in December in hospital, soon before he had an operation on his foot, and spoke to him afterwards on the phone. “He was in a good mood all the time. There was nothing about him which suggested depression or unhappiness. He was in perfect spirits,” the friend said. Alex Goldfarb, who knew Glushkov, said he thought his death was highly suspicious. “I think it’s fairly clear it wasn’t an accident or disease. It’s either suicide or strangulation, like with Boris [Berezovsky],” Goldfarb said. Berezovsky was found hanged at his ex-wife’s home in Berkshire. Glushkov refused to believe that his friend had killed himself, telling the Guardian at the time: “I don’t believe it was suicide. Too many deaths [of Russian emigres] have been happening.” Goldfarb said Russia’s spy agencies had held a grudge against Glushkov since the 1990s, after he stopped them from using Aeroflot as a network for money laundering and special operations. “There was a history. They considered him to be an enemy,” Goldfarb said. “They have a long memory.” Glushkov was part of Berezovsky’s circle of London exiles, most of whom are now dead. He knew Alexander Litvinenko, who was killed in 2006 by two Kremlin assassins using a radioactive cup of tea. In recent years, Glushkov was on friendly terms with his London neighbours, who saw him hobbling on crutches or with a walking stick after his operation. He had a dog and a cat. His daughter Natalya lives in the UK, while his ex-wife and son, Dima, are based in Moscow. He was granted political asylum in 2010. In 2011 he gave evidence in a court case brought by Berezovsky against fellow oligarch Roman Abramovich, who is on good terms with Vladimir Putin. Berezovsky lost. Glushkov was unhappy with the judgment and launched a formal appeal, citing bias. In 2013 he noted that a large number of Russian exiles had died under mysterious circumstances. He was practically the last one left, he told friends. The Met said on Tuesday the next of kin had been informed. “Whilst we believe we know the identity of the deceased, formal identification is yet to take place,” the force said. “The death is currently being treated as unexplained.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2018/mar/14/theranos-founder-elizabeth-holmes-fraud-charge","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-14T18:48:11Z","webTitle":"Theranos and its founder Elizabeth Holmes charged with 'massive fraud'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/mar/14/theranos-founder-elizabeth-holmes-fraud-charge","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2018/mar/14/theranos-founder-elizabeth-holmes-fraud-charge","fields":{"headline":"Theranos and its founder Elizabeth Holmes charged with 'massive fraud'","bodyText":"The Silicon Valley startup Theranos and its chief executive Elizabeth Holmes were charged by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Wednesday with “massive fraud” for raising $700m from investors by allegedly deceiving them about their supposedly groundbreaking blood-testing technology. Theranos and Holmes agreed to settle the charges without admitting or denying wrongdoing. Holmes, a Stanford dropout who was once hailed as the next Steve Jobs, will pay a $500,000 penalty, return millions of shares to the company, and relinquish her company voting power under the terms of the settlement. She will also be barred for 10 years from serving as an officer or director of a public company. “The Theranos story is an important lesson for Silicon Valley,” Jina Choi, the director of the SEC’s San Francisco office, said in a statement. “Innovators who seek to revolutionize and disrupt an industry must tell investors the truth about what their technology can do today, not just what they hope it might do someday.” The settlement bookends an ignominious tale of Silicon Valley excess. Holmes founded Theranos in 2003 with the goal of revolutionizing blood testing. The company received glowing press coverage and raised more than $700m from investors based on its promise that it had invented a machine that could conduct hundreds of laboratory tests with a single finger prick of blood. But in 2015, a series of Wall Street Journal articles revealed the company’s technology to be more of a parlor trick than a medical miracle. Most of the tests Theranos claimed to perform on its Edison machines were actually being performed by traditional blood-testing machines bought from other companies, the Journal revealed. Regulators subsequently raised serious concerns about the accuracy of testing that Theranos did conduct with its machines, and the company eventually retracted two years of blood tests. Theranos initially defended its technology, but subsequently agreed to shut down its labs and testing centers. In 2016, Holmes was barred from running a lab for two years by regulators. Theranos has settled lawsuits with an investor and Walgreens. “The company is pleased to be bringing this matter to a close and looks forward to advancing its technology,” Theranos’s independent directors said in a statement. The SEC complaint provides an inside look at how Holmes and Theranos enticed investors. The company would stage a blood test for potential investors, with phlebotomists actually taking a finger prick of their blood, despite the fact that the company’s machines were not being used to perform the tests. The complaint also details how Holmes fooled the media into overstating the capabilities of the technology, then used that coverage to raise funds. Holmes allegedly falsely told investors that Theranos’ machines were being used by the US defense department on the battlefield in Afghanistan and that the company would bring in $100m in revenue in 2014. Theranos’ actual 2014 revenues were approximately $100,000. The SEC also charged the company’s former president Ramesh Balwani, who left Theranos in 2016. He has not agreed to a settlement, so the charges against him will be litigated in federal court."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"stage/2018/mar/16/jack-barry-funniest-things","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-16T14:00:07Z","webTitle":"Jack Barry: ‘I recently dreamed that a telepathic baby summoned me to its house’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/mar/16/jack-barry-funniest-things","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2018/mar/16/jack-barry-funniest-things","fields":{"headline":"Jack Barry: ‘I recently dreamed that a telepathic baby summoned me to its house’","bodyText":"The funniest standup I’ve ever seen … I want to be nice and say one of my friends but that feels like a waste when this article is supposed to be about promoting me.

So shouldn’t they look in Britain?” On Wednesday, Theresa May told British MPs there was “no alternative conclusion other than the Russian state was responsible for the attempted murder of Mr Skripal and his daughter”. Like many Russians, Markosyan is up to date on the poisoning of Sergei Skripal and his daughter, and all the reasons why – despite the assertions of the UK government – Russia was not involved. Why use a Soviet nerve agent that can be traced back to Moscow? And why attempt to kill a double agent who was traded years ago and no longer of any use? And then, as seen on TV, came the kicker: “He lived a dangerous life. He clearly got himself into some trouble.” Television is a powerful force in Russia, where the top three stations are funded by the state. And in the past week, those channels have been feeding Russians a steady diet of bellicose rhetoric over the Skripal poisoning. “It’s really hard to ignore,” said Diana, 26, who stood smoking a menthol cigarette outside the grocery store. She declined to give her last name. “It makes you angry. Sometimes you feel like there’s going to be a war.” Russian politicians have promised harsh retribution for the sanctions and expulsions announced by May on Wednesday. Andrei Lugovoi, a Russian member of parliament who stands accused of the 2006 murder of the former Russian agent Alexander Litvinenko, has been a popular guest on talkshows. A foreign ministry spokeswoman said the British should pay closer attention to Vladimir Putin’s state of the union speech, in which the president exhibited Russia’s latest nuclear weapons. “They didn’t listen to us before,” Putin said in the speech. “Well, listen to us now.” The rise in tensions comes during the closing days of a lacklustre Russian presidential campaign. Putin is sure to be reelected to a fourth term in power but is concerned with getting out the vote to prove his government’s legitimacy. At the very least, accusations that the Kremlin ordered Skripal’s death seem unlikely to hurt his chances. In the past several years, conflict with the west has become the norm in Russia, and Putin’s nominal popularity has remained high since his annexation of Crimea, despite western sanctions. For many Russians, the hostile rhetoric isn’t all that unusual. It fits a familiar pattern that begins, they say, with Russia being blamed by the west, and then Moscow defending itself. “We are the world’s scapegoat,” said Anatoly Sobolev, a sales associate on his lunch hour at a KFC. Sobolev said he didn’t watch Russian television and believed that both the Russian government and media lied. But, he added, he trusted the British media and the British government even less. He said Russia had also been accused of meddling in the 2016 US elections without any evidence. “Are we just supposed to believe them for their word?” he asked. “Why can’t they show any proof?” The Russian establishment has also backed an idea that Westminster is lashing out to disguise weakness. People think “the British have gone rabid”, said Sergey Karaganov, an influential foreign policy thinker, speaking by telephone on Wednesday. “There is a sense the west is lashing out because you’re weak, because the west is declining and Russia is rebuilt.” Not everyone backs the government line, however. Waiting for friends at a subway station, a 20-year-old economics student named Alina said she was embarrassed by the heady rhetoric on television. “It’s obvious they did it,” she said. “But who’s going to force them to admit it?”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/mar/14/the-guardian-view-on-stephen-hawking-the-mind-of-god","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-14T18:09:59Z","webTitle":"The Guardian view on Stephen Hawking: the mind of God | Editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/14/the-guardian-view-on-stephen-hawking-the-mind-of-god","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/14/the-guardian-view-on-stephen-hawking-the-mind-of-god","fields":{"headline":"The Guardian view on Stephen Hawking: the mind of God","bodyText":"Stephen Hawking was a brilliant, complex man and scientist.

From his wheelchair, Hawking’s mind roamed the multiverses. It was his 1988 bestseller A Brief History of Time, about advances in cosmology, that made him a pop icon. It kindled Hawking’s showmanship: when asked what his book was about, he replied “the mind of God”. Despite his brilliance, Hawking never won a Nobel prize, as they are not awarded for theory unsupported by observation. Humankind’s new-found ability to generate mini-black holes may mean he will be proved right. Hawking stood out in an age remarkable for secular triumphs.

This prompted some newspapers to herald the demise of copper coinage, warning about the associated impact on penny sweets and the cascade machines in seaside amusement arcades. Wednesday’s Daily Mail front page called it “a PR disaster in the making”, the front of the Sun said, “Save our coppers,” and the Daily Mirror lamented: “Pennies dropped.” Asked about the plans, Theresa May’s spokesman said: “There are no proposals to scrap 1p or 2p coins in the consultation that HMT [Her Majesty’s Treasury] issued yesterday. The call for evidence is simply intended to enable the government to better understand the role of cash and digital payments in the new economy. “One thing HMT were seeking views on was whether the current denominational mix of coins meets the public’s needs. From the early reaction, it looks as if it does.” The government would “welcome all contributions to the debate” and would respond after the consultation closes on 5 June, he added. The charity sector had warned that scrapping the coins would damage smaller organisations that rely on bucket collections for the majority of their funding. The Charity Finance Group said UK charities collected millions of pounds’ worth of coppers every year. “It is a concern,” said Andrew O’Brien, the director of policy at CFG. “On the one hand, we don’t want the charity sector to be accused of being luddites. “On the other hand, fundraising conditions are tight, particularly at the lower end for smaller charities, where people are reliant on bucket collections and spontaneous contributions. Charities are coming up with new, innovative ways to fundraise, but [traditional collections] are still significant.” Mandy Johnson, chief executive of the Small Charities Coalition, which has about 9,200 members across the UK, said scrapping 1p and 2p coins would raise costs for charities. “Most small charities rely on donations from individuals for the majority of their fundraising. That’s volunteers asking people to put in their pennies where they can. At the moment, the alternatives to doing it that way are more costly.” Johnson added that while contactless collection tins were available, they had higher costs. “If they remove the opportunity for people to give their pennies in the traditional way, they’re raising the cost of fundraising for small charities.” As the Guardian revealed last year, George Osborne came close to abolishing 1p and 2p coins when he was chancellor, but the idea was blocked by the prime minister, David Cameron, who thought the public might disapprove."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/blog/2018/mar/15/mark-hughes-southampton-gamble-paul-wilson","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-15T11:00:21Z","webTitle":"Mark Hughes looks a big gamble for Southampton – but it could pay off | Paul Wilson","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2018/mar/15/mark-hughes-southampton-gamble-paul-wilson","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/blog/2018/mar/15/mark-hughes-southampton-gamble-paul-wilson","fields":{"headline":"Mark Hughes looks a big gamble for Southampton – but it could pay off","bodyText":"The month of March is never a great time to be changing managers but when Southampton became the ninth Premier League club this season to decide a new man may do the trick they probably fell just on the right side of the line between bold decision-making and blind panic. There are eight games remaining. Not much time for a complete turnaround but with enough potential points on offer for the club to climb away from trouble. Southampton are one point above the bottom three, barely keeping their heads above water, and there appeared enough reason to believe that under Mauricio Pellegrino they would have continued to sink. In that position – and there are a few teams immediately above Southampton who must feel the same way – a club struggling for points and confidence are always susceptible to one of the sides below them putting a run together and climbing out of danger. Exactly as Swansea appear to have done since the appointment of Carlos Carvalhal. The Swans are not safe yet – no one in the bottom half of the table can take anything for granted – but the outlook in South Wales is massively brighter than it was a couple of months ago. Carvalhal has done everything Swansea must have hoped he would do and more. It was an inspired appointment, particularly as the Portuguese had no Premier League experience and had not exactly been setting the Championship on fire with Sheffield Wednesday. All of which brings the task of Mark Hughes into sharp focus. Can a manager sacked after a dismal sequence of results at his old club really be expected to achieve an instant uplift at a new one? Hughes’s general record when working with clubs at the wrong end of the table is good but if Southampton are hoping to pull away from the bottom three it does not appear to make much sense to go for the manager who led Stoke into their present predicament. To put it even more bluntly, Stoke would be bottom of the table were West Bromwich Albion not having such a spectacularly poor season and, after four and a half years at the club, Hughes has to assume the responsibility for that. Boards in fear of relegation normally tend to look upwards rather than downwards for possible routes to salvation, though Carvalhal has shown what is possible with a little lateral thinking and, when there are only eight games left, the overriding consideration is to find someone both available and attainable. While Hughes certainly ticks those boxes, the worry for Southampton supporters is that he may not turn out to be a breath of fresh air like Carvalhal but a member of the rent-a-dour-manager group that has mostly been found wanting this season. Alan Pardew has had no effect whatsoever at West Brom after all, in fact it is something of a surprise he is still in situ. There have been signs of improvement at Stoke under Paul Lambert, though only small ones. Roy Hodgson does not count as a dour manager, to be fair, but he too is back in the bottom three after an initially promising mini-revival, while David Moyes’s work in steadying the ship at West Ham appears in danger of being undermined by off-field tensions and a general collapse of confidence. Even Sam Allardyce at Everton, who is not in any immediate relegation danger but is definitely dour, has not been greeted as an obvious improvement on the unpopular Ronald Koeman. Everton are a point above Watford, whose own managerial change has worked quite smoothly, but their away record is terrible and few supporters believe Allardyce is the man to take the club forward. The good news for Hughes and his latest charges is that the new regime can start with something of a free hit. Southampton’s FA Cup quarter-final at Wigan on Sunday has now been overshadowed by slumps in league form by both parties – the visitors have changed manager while the home side’s promotion push has been knocked off course – then the international break allows a period of respite before the trip to West Ham at the end of the month. The bad news is that the Saints’ remaining eight games include fixtures against Arsenal, Chelsea and Manchester City, as well as trips to Leicester, Everton and Swansea, so points are not going to be easy to come by. One would not envy anyone sent in as a firefighter so late in the season, though Southampton have some good players and eight games in which to survive should ensure everyone’s full concentration. That could be important. Hughes is in a completely different situation now to the one at Stoke, where he claimed he knew the players better than anyone else and was confident they would pull through in the end. Here he does not know the players, has little time in which to operate and if he is to salvage his managerial reputation must be positive from the start. There are no guarantees, but it just may work."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"books/2018/mar/15/further-reading-books-that-expose-the-secret-world-of-spies","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-15T10:22:53Z","webTitle":"Luke Harding picks five books that expose the secret world of spies","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/mar/15/further-reading-books-that-expose-the-secret-world-of-spies","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/mar/15/further-reading-books-that-expose-the-secret-world-of-spies","fields":{"headline":"Luke Harding picks five books that expose the secret world of spies","bodyText":"A man’s agonising scream is filmed. He is tied to a metal stretcher and is fed, alive, into the crematorium of the GRU, Russia’s military spy agency. His crime? Betrayal of the motherland. The victim? A colonel who “deceived us”. The video – shown to new recruits – features in the opening chapter of Aquarium, a novel by the Russian writer Viktor Suvorov. Suvorov was himself a GRU operative. He defected in the 1970s and lives in the UK. Another GRU officer was Sergei Skripal, who was poisoned last week with his daughter, Yulia, in Salisbury. Aquarium is a classic of spy literature, part bildingsroman and part insider account of an organisation famed for its brutishness and fanatical secrecy. None of Putin’s spy chiefs have written memoirs. One imagines it will be several decades before they do. In the meantime there is Pavel Sudoplatov, Stalin’s assassinations director, who gives a candid account of his profession in Special Tasks, published in 1994. Sudoplatov explains how he organised the murder of the state’s enemies, including a Ukrainian nationalist (done personally with exploding chocolates) and Trotsky (killed with that ice-pick). Sudoplatov justified these exotic crimes on the grounds of Leninist ethics: morality was what served the party. Later he regretted that communism chewed up so many innocents, observing: “Victorious Russian rulers have always combined the qualities of statesmen and criminals.” Putin spent the late 1980s in the GDR in Dresden. His more talented foreign intelligence co-worker, Yuri Shvets, was sent to the US. Shvets’s memoir, Washington Station, is a disillusioning account of his life as a KGB spy abroad and his attempts to recruit a US mole. His cover job as a correspondent for the Russian news agency Tass is more enjoyable than his espionage work. Meanwhile, his bosses back home are gerontocratic fools. Recalled to Moscow, Shvets visits the KGB’s legendary poisons factory, from where novichok, the deadly nerve agent used on Skripal, may have come. Tellingly, the KGB plotters who tried to overthrow Mikhail Gorbachev in 1991 met in the secret lab. When it came to surveillance, one friendly Warsaw Pact agency outdid even the KGB: the Stasi. The world of East Germany’s secret police is vividly evoked in Anna Funder’s Stasiland, written more than a decade after the fall of the Berlin Wall. She meets elderly unrepentant former Stasi officers, and their victims. Why did so many in the GDR became informers? The answer, one Stasi man tells her, was because they enjoyed being “somebody”. In The File, Timothy Garton Ash tracks down those who spied on him as a student in early 1980s East Berlin. It’s a meditation on the cold war, European history, unreliable memory and our mutable younger versus older selves. Garton Ash casts himself as a “spy for the reader”. Imagine his delight when he discovers his Stasi watchers gave him the code-name “Romeo”. Somewhere in the KGB’s Lubyanka HQ are similar files compiled over decades on prominent western figures (such as Trump). Fodder for future memoirs, should the Putin regime ever go the way of the USSR.

Fire safety concerns have been building up for a number of years, as a result of ineffective maintenance or of fundamental design, specification and installation problems. Grenfell has shone a spotlight on this, yet still financial and political barriers are preventing essential works from taking place and leaving vulnerable people sleeping in buildings that are potentially unsafe. As the collateral costs of Grenfell become more apparent – and with reports that only three council-owned high-rises out of the 160 that failed the government’s fire safety tests have yet been reclad – it is imperative that the Treasury makes an allocation for such potentially life-critical work. We believe that the solution is a building safety fund, similar to the Pension Protection Fund. The fund would allow housing associations and local authorities to focus on what needs to be done while applying to the scheme to fund the works. The fund could also manage litigation should it be deemed a third party is liable. The fund would help to speed up work on existing buildings and would centralise legal matters through controlled precedence. We would recommend looking at insurance premium tax as a way to pay for it. Ian Mcllwee Chief executive, British Woodworking Federation • Philip Hammond has guaranteed another year of deprivation that will inevitably result in more debt, hunger, ill health and deaths. He inherited from George Osborne the Welfare Reform Acts 2012 and 2016 in which he and his fellow ministers presumed to bring about behavioural change among their poorest working-age fellow citizens. That was to be achieved by applying the principle of the rational pursuit of self-interest to the unemployed. At its rawest that means: “Cut their benefits, increase their rent, make them hungry – then rational self interest will make them look for work.” That ignorant and grossly unfair presumption has been used to justify the punishment, with ever-deeper cuts in social security payments, of working-aged unemployed people for the crimes of a few that cost 1.2% of the welfare budget.

The Ministry of Defence, in spite of a budget squeeze, is to spend £48m setting up the centre, which will be under the umbrella of the Porton Down military research establishment. Other measures Gavin Williamson is set to announce today include thousands of British troops receiving a vaccination against anthrax so they can be deployed almost immediately in the event of an attack, either in the UK or overseas. Williamson is to use his first keynote speech since becoming defence secretary last year to respond to the nerve agent attack in Salisbury, which the government is blaming on Russia. According to excerpts of the speech distributed in advance, Williamson, one of the most outspoken critics of Russia within the government, will say: “If we doubted the threat Russia poses to our citizens, we only have to look at the shocking example of their reckless attack in Salisbury.” The MoD said in a press release that funding for the chemical weapons centre followed “ the calculated and brazen assassination attempt on Sergei Skripal by the Russian state”. As a signatory to the international convention banning chemical weapons, the UK cannot develop nerve agents but it can work on defensive measures. Williamson, who is to deliver the speech in Bristol, will say the threat from chemical attacks comes not just from Russia but other state actors. Against that background, he will say: “I made the decision to offer the anthrax vaccine to our high readiness forces providing them with vital protection against a deadly danger.” The MoD is at present engaged in a review of threats to the UK and making hard choices about what the spending priorities should be. There is tension in Whitehall between those who want to see a shift from spending on conventional forces towards cyber warfare and intelligence gathering. Williamson, trying to square this, will stress the importance of the 77th Brigade, which was set up in 2015 to deal with propaganda but which is not yet fully operational. The 77th Brigade, named after the Chindits, the British and Indian troops who engaged in guerrilla operations in Burma during the second world war, has had a difficult birth, with reports of a high staff turnover and other problems. Modernisation, Williamson will say, “will mean taking our intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance capability to the next level and it will mean accelerating the development of our innovative 77th Brigade – those reservists and regulars who give us the ability to win the information war – so we create and counter the narratives so central to modern conflict”. He will combine this with a plea for more spending. “In the face of intensifying threats, we must prioritise investment in military capabilities. We cannot sit back and let events overtake us. We have to be the ones who determine our future.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2018/mar/18/morecambe-resort-town-heart-dissent-within-momentum","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-18T16:00:07Z","webTitle":"Morecambe: resort town at heart of dissent within Momentum","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/mar/18/morecambe-resort-town-heart-dissent-within-momentum","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/mar/18/morecambe-resort-town-heart-dissent-within-momentum","fields":{"headline":"Morecambe: resort town at heart of dissent within Momentum","bodyText":"The seaside resort of Morecambe seems an unlikely place for a socialist revolt. But like in 1952, when the town became a “battleground of warring factions” within Labour, the strains of discontent have returned to the Lancashire coast. At the centre is the campaign group Momentum, which won control of Morecambe’s constituency Labour party (CLP) last summer on the back of Jeremy Corbyn’s better-than-expected performance in the snap general election. The victory was no sinister hard-left putsch, but it led within months to an angry public resignation, an official complaint to Labour and a lingering mutual suspicion between some “centrist” party members and supporters of the pro-Corbyn movement. The fallout centres on the selection of Morecambe and Lunesdale’s prospective parliamentary candidate in January, which, depending who you ask, was either a “comradely, friendly” affair or the “most set up, one-sided and biased” stitch-up that left one candidate feeling “so bullied and degraded” she withdrew from the race. The latter is the view of Kay Dickinson, founder of North Lancashire Momentum. Dickinson resigned as chair of the CLP in a furious Facebook post a week before Christmas, complaining that the party had sidelined three “excellent, loyal and dedicated local candidates” and that, similarly, Momentum bosses in London had selected Erica Lewis, a former aide to the Labour frontbencher Cat Smith, without consulting local members. “The Labour party, despite the influence of Jeremy Corbyn, is still a corrupt old boys’ club where people in power get to decide who stands for parliament,” Dickinson wrote. Tensions between local and national movements are nothing new, but the selection revealed a bigger issue for Labour. It emerged that Momentum’s candidate was able to use the group’s vast list of members to canvass supporters long before rival candidates could use either Labour’s or the unions’ membership lists simply because Momentum is not officially affiliated to Labour. The anomaly meant that Momentum’s candidate had a huge advantage over her rivals, Dickinson said, adding that she had passed on a complaint to Labour and raised the issue with the Momentum founder, Jon Lansman. Some Labour figures worry it is another way for Momentum to seize control of local parties and potentially deselect MPs. John Reynolds, a Lancaster city councillor who was chair of Morecambe and Lunesdale CLP until last summer, urged Labour to act: “It’s a huge advantage, which is why I was very, very surprised it was the case. I don’t think it’s the right way of doing things. I think we need to take a long, hard look at that.” Morecambe and Lunesdale is a bellwether seat held by the Tory David Morris – a former hairdresser who, curiously, played guitar in Rick Astley’s backing band – with a 1,399 majority. Cracks within the local Labour party began to emerge during the general election in June. Braced for heavy losses, Labour strategists concentrated on saving Smith, one of Corbyn’s closest allies, who is MP for neighbouring Lancaster and Fleetwood. The approach led to conflict between Reynolds, who was then CLP chair, and Dickinson, who helped run the Labour candidate’s campaign. She said the local party was given “no backing, no money” by Labour HQ and that she had been repeatedly ordered by Momentum to campaign in Lancaster instead of trying to win back Morecambe and Lunesdale. The rift prompted Reynolds to stand down, allowing Dickinson to take over when the only other candidate withdrew from the race. And so, almost by default, Momentum’s local campaign chief won control of Morecambe’s CLP. There was then a “full replacement” of the party executive, Reynolds said, as Dickinson and her allies took control. The Momentum-led leadership inherited a CLP they said had been starved of funding since losing its marginal status in 2015. Dickinson said there were 300-400 “missing” party members because its campaigning tool, NationBuilder, had not been updated for so long. It had no permanent premises, she said, no official email address, and its website was still registered to Geraldine Smith, the former MP who lost her seat seven years earlier. Claire Cozler, a councillor who sits on the CLP executive, said the marginal was run on a “thruppence and a button” and that Labour seemed to be forgetting about parts of the country that are geographically “out on a limb”. “There’s been a lack of investment, a lack of support, and it’s meant that Morris – despite the fact he’s absolutely cosmically useless – has doubled his majority on the back of Labour apparently washing their hands of us.” Despite its brief control of the CLP, Momentum has not made major advances in local politics. Only a handful of Labour councillors are Momentum members and barely 40 people attended its two meetings at the Robert Gillow pub in Lancaster in summer 2016. Alistair Sinclair, a prominent Momentum member and prospective Labour councillor in Lancaster, said any talk of Momentum being influential locally was “a bit of a red herring because we’re not organised in terms of even being visible, let alone activities” and that the group needed to “get its act together”. It may be about to get an opportunity. Behind the penny arcades, chip shops and B&amp;Bs on Morecambe’s promenade are some of the most deprived streets in England, where one in four children are raised in poverty and 152 youngsters a month rely on the town’s foodbank. Unease about entrenched poverty exploded into the open before Christmas when ITV News revealed that some children were being treated for rickets and schools were having to hand out clothing and charge parents’ phones because they couldn’t afford electricity. Within days of the broadcast, about 300 people turned up to donate food and clothes at an emergency meeting and a new volunteer group, Morecambe Community Collective, sprang up to organise the response. The group now hosts a weekly “food social” with donations to about 100 local families, while other grassroots groups are reviving parts of Morecambe that have fallen into disrepair since their Victorian heyday. The galvanised community activity is seen by some in Momentum as a possible key to their success. “If you go to the real core issues of Morecambe, in the West End, where poverty has been entrenched for decades, there’s a real opportunity there for anybody who’s saying I’m aware of what you’re facing and I’m with you,” said Sinclair. He said Momentum should leave “traditional campaigning” to Labour and focus instead on “being in the community, supporting the community”. However, those who run the resurgent community groups said they were deeply uneasy about any attempt to politicise their work. They are keenly aware that any overt political link would play into the hands of Morris, who sought to cast doubt on the ITV News report and claimed that the schools were linked to Momentum. “We can’t let it become a vehicle to bash us or ignore us because we’re aligned to one political party,” said Jo Ainscough, a co-founder of Morecambe Community Collective. Ainscough is herself a Labour CLP officer and Momentum member but said that had nothing to do with her volunteer work. Another co-founder, Linda Smalley, said being “party apolitical” was crucial because it “means no party can hijack our agenda”. “We take our badges off at the door,” she said. This disagreement over the future role of Momentum could be a sign that while the local Labour party attempts to heal the wounds of a divisive selection there may be further headaches to come."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/mar/14/russian-spy-poisoning-investigation-extends-dorset-town-sergei-skripal","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-14T18:22:00Z","webTitle":"Russian spy poisoning: investigation extends to Dorset town","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/mar/14/russian-spy-poisoning-investigation-extends-dorset-town-sergei-skripal","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/mar/14/russian-spy-poisoning-investigation-extends-dorset-town-sergei-skripal","fields":{"headline":"Russian spy poisoning: investigation extends to Dorset town","bodyText":"The investigation into the nerve agent attack on Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia has widened further to take in a Dorset town and detectives have examined computer equipment of some of the former spy’s neighbours. Residents of Gillingham, 30 miles west of Salisbury, were told to stay indoors while detectives and military personnel secured a vehicle connected to the attack. It is believed that the move is linked to Skripal’s BMW, one of the key focuses of the huge police operation. Neighbours of Skripal, who lives on the outskirts of Salisbury, revealed that police have been examining their computer equipment. Resident Chelsie Croes, 21, said: “They came to our house asking to check the wi-fi. The police wanted to check our internet routers. They didn’t say why they were doing it. I don’t know if they wanted to find out if we had been hacked into.” As part of the inquiry - codenamed Operation Lime - officers have been going door to door asking people if they knew the Skripals and when they last saw them. In Gillingham a street was sealed off early on Wednesday to allow the army to secure a breakdown truck. It is thought it may have been used to recover Skripal’s BMW. The truck belonging to Ashley Wood Recovery has been parked next to a bus stop in Gillingham for at least four days. Residents living inside the cordoned area were told by police to remain in their homes during the operation or stay away for the whole day. Stephanie Robertson, 24, said: “I was a bit worried. It’s right outside my house. I didn’t know if [the truck] was harmful or not. I was worried for my children. But I’ve been reassured by the police that it’s safe and we’re all OK.” The BMW is one of five key possible crime scenes that the police appear to be focusing on. The others are Skripal’s home, the spot where he and his daughter fell ill, and the two places where the pair ate and drank before their collapse. Police have launched a specific appeal for anyone who saw the Skripals in the BMW in the 45 minutes before they arrived in the Maltings shopping centre in Salisbury on the afternoon of Sunday 4 March, when they fell ill. New footage from a CCTV camera that emerged on Wednesday captured the BMW passing the Devizes Inn a few minutes’ drive from his home at around 1.35pm on the Sunday. Hamish de Bretton-Gordon, a former commander of the now-disbanded Joint Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear Regiment, said he believed the nerve agent used, novichok, was probably in powder form. “That seems to be the most plausible thing,” he said. Theories have been swirling around Salisbury about how the novichok may have been delivered, including on the BMW’s door handles, steering wheel or in its ventilation system. But the Guardian understands that the police officer taken ill, DS Nick Bailey, may have fallen ill after visiting Skripal’s home, suggesting the house remains crucial. De Bretton-Gordon said it was “plausible” that the nerve agent could have arrived in the post or in a gift. “You open a letter and the stuff goes all over the place,” he said. “It is equally plausible that an agent could have delivered it. You only need to drop a small amount in someone’s pocket or brush past them.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2018/mar/18/peter-rabbit-james-corden-will-gluck-review","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-18T07:50:01Z","webTitle":"Peter Rabbit review – unfunny bunny","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/mar/18/peter-rabbit-james-corden-will-gluck-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/mar/18/peter-rabbit-james-corden-will-gluck-review","fields":{"headline":"Peter Rabbit review – unfunny bunny","bodyText":"Beatrix Potter’s children’s books may have been out of copyright since 2014, but that’s no excuse for this manure-scented take on her best-known tale.

One possible motive for the attack was to provoke a diplomatic row with the UK. The Kremlin has a long-standing policy of testing western governments’ readiness to tolerate projections of Russian power overseas. An international spat can also whip up patriotic fervour in President Vladimir Putin’s domestic audience, since he is seeking re-election this weekend. By pushing back hard, the prime minister risks giving Mr Putin the reaction he wants. But treating the incident as anything less than an outrageous aggression looks weak. It signals that the use of a chemical weapon on British streets could somehow be excusable. Mrs May was right to set out a measured retaliatory response. Some of these were economic, targeting financial assets that might abet Russian espionage. Others focused on that capability more directly, including the expulsion of 23 diplomats, identified as “undeclared intelligence officers”. Mr Putin is unlikely to change his foreign policy as a result of unilateral British action. And, while Nato allies and the EU have offered words of solidarity, there is much uncertainty around the potential for coordinated containment of the Kremlin. The lack of such cohesion – especially when Brexit makes Britain look strategically dislocated – may have emboldened Russia. On the question of Kremlin responsibility, Mrs May supported her belief by citing the pattern of “complete disdain … sarcasm, contempt and defiance” in official Russian responses to British requests for an explanation as to how a nerve agent developed by former Soviet weapons facilities came to Salisbury. The goading manner of Mr Putin’s diplomatic mouthpieces seems designed to confirm that offence was intended, while not quite accepting responsibility. This is the style of a rogue state or, more pertinently, given Russia’s predilection for internet-based subterfuge, a troll state. The leader of the opposition’s response to the prime minister was dispiriting. Jeremy Corbyn invited Mrs May to acquiesce to Russia’s requests that a sample be sent to Moscow for verification – on the supposition that the Kremlin might then honestly try to match it with its own stores. He sounded too keen to find another explanation for the use of the nerve agent novichok in the attack. There are many reasons to be wary whenever governments ask for cross-party support. Oppositions have a duty to challenge prime ministers in the most critical circumstances. Nations should not act in haste over such issues. But Mr Corbyn’s reluctance to share Mrs May’s basic analysis of the Salisbury incident made him look eager to exonerate a hostile power. In the coming days the diplomatic clash with Moscow is sure to escalate. There is likely to be a campaign of obfuscation and misinformation directed at British audiences. That is the Kremlin’s well-established modus operandi. When matters of national security come to the fore, governments do not acquire a licence to act without check or criticism. But it is also vital to keep sight of the facts. Britain has been targeted with a chemical weapon and it is almost certain that there is only one plausible culprit with the means and the motive. The prime minister might not have as many tools for retaliation, unilateral or international, as she would like. But she has judged correctly that the time for equivocation, given the sinister nature of Mr Putin’s regime, is over."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/mar/18/extremism-pays-why-silicon-valley-not-shutting-it-down-youtube","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-18T07:00:01Z","webTitle":"Extremism pays.

That’s why Silicon Valley isn’t shutting it down","bodyText":"Zeynep Tufecki is one of the shrewdest writers on technology around. A while back, when researching an article on why (and how) Donald Trump appealed to those who supported him, she needed some direct quotes from the man himself and so turned to YouTube, which has a useful archive of videos of his campaign rallies. She then noticed something interesting. “YouTube started to recommend and ‘autoplay’ videos for me,” she wrote, “that featured white supremacist rants, Holocaust denials and other disturbing content.” Since Tufecki was not in the habit of watching far-right fare on YouTube, she wondered if this was an exclusively rightwing phenomenon. So she created another YouTube account and started watching Hillary Clinton’s and Bernie Sanders’s campaign videos, following the accompanying links suggested by YouTube’s “recommender” algorithm. “Before long,” she reported, “I was being directed to videos of a leftish conspiratorial cast, including arguments about the existence of secret government agencies and allegations that the United States government was behind the attacks of 11 September. As with the Trump videos, YouTube was recommending content that was more and more extreme.” If you think that this is all about politics, think again. Tufecki tried watching videos on non-political topics such as vegetarianism (which led to videos about veganism), and jogging (which led to items about running ultramarathons). “It seems,” she reflected, “as if you are never ‘hardcore’ enough for YouTube’s recommendation algorithm. It promotes, recommends and disseminates videos in a manner that appears to constantly up the stakes. Given its billion or so users, YouTube may be one of the most powerful radicalising instruments of the 21st century.” Tufecki’s right. We know from the research of Jonathan Albright and others that YouTube has become the key disseminator of “alt-right”, conspiracist, white-supremacist and other unsavoury propaganda. In the old days, if you wanted to stage a coup, the first thing to do was to capture the TV station. Nowadays all you have to do is to “weaponise” YouTube. After all, its first motto was “broadcast yourself”. Accordingly, if governments of the western world really wanted to cripple these disruptive forces, then shutting down YouTube would be a giant step forward. It wouldn’t prevent other such services springing up, of course, but none would have the power and reach that YouTube’s billion-strong network effect provides. This doesn’t mean that YouTube’s owner (Google) is hell-bent on furthering extremism of all stripes. It isn’t. All it’s interested in is maximising advertising revenues. And underpinning the implicit logic of its recommender algorithms is evidence that people are drawn to content that is more extreme than what they started with – or perhaps to incendiary content in general. So YouTube (like Facebook) is caught between a rock and a hard place. On the one hand, it’s embarrassed by the way in which it is being exploited by unsavoury actors (and also possibly worried about the longer-term threat of regulation); on the other hand, its bottom line is improved by increasing “user engagement” – ie, keeping people glued to YouTube. And since it’s a capitalist company, those revenues just have to keep growing. Watching social media executives trying to square this circle is like watching worms squirming on the head of a pin. The latest hapless exhibit is YouTube’s chief executive, Susan Wojcicki, who went to the South by Southwest conference in Texas last week to outline measures intended to curb the spread of misinformation on her platform. This will be achieved, apparently, by showing – alongside conspiracy-theory videos, for example – “additional information cues, including a text box linking to third-party sources [about] widely accepted events, like the moon landing”. It seems that the source of these magical text boxes will be Wikipedia. All of which makes one wonder which planet Wojcicki currently inhabits. She clearly knows nothing of conspiracy theories, for example, and has a touching faith that those who hold such beliefs are susceptible to evidence that might refute them. Nor does she understand that our current crisis of disinformation and computational propaganda will not be resolved by just finding and publishing “the facts”, whatever they are. Indeed, one of the most obvious implications of the proposed YouTube strategy is that it will turn Wikipedia into an even bigger epistemological battleground than it is at present. In fact, this is just another distraction from the fundamental issue, which is that social media platforms cannot solve the societal problems they have created – because, ultimately, doing so will hurt their revenues and growth. This is the unpalatable truth they are all squirming to avoid. And in doing so they’re really just confirming HL Mencken’s observation about the impossibility of getting someone to understand a proposition if his income depends on not understanding it. It’s not that the companies don’t get it, just that they cannot afford to admit that they do. What I’m reading Out of the loop?

Some in the Labour party still don’t. It is also plain, as Theresa May embarks on an open-ended confrontation with Moscow, that the dispute provoked by the Salisbury outrage could take years to resolve. Cold or hot, overt or covert, this is going to be a long war – and Britain will need all its friends and allies if it is to prevail against a ruthless opponent. Whether sincere, sufficient and timely support will be forthcoming is in serious doubt. It is not just about Salisbury, of course. Putin has been crossing red lines, at home and abroad, with growing impunity since he first gained national prominence in 1999. He made his name with a brutal pacification campaign in Chechnya justified by a series of suspicious apartment bombings. Alexander Litvinenko, later murdered in London, blamed the bombings on the FSB and, by implication, Putin. Justified perceptions of western weakness, ambivalence and division have since encouraged Putin in a pattern of escalating, aggressive behaviour. Its main features include wars in Georgia and Ukraine, cyber-attacks against Nato countries, election meddling and destabilisation operations, and the bloody Syrian intervention. Putin was further emboldened by his domestic dominance, achieved through manipulation of elections, the rustication of the Duma into a rubber-stamp parliament, and the elimination, by various means, of leading opponents, critics and free media. Boris Nemtsov, a liberal reformer killed in 2015, and Anna Politkovskaya, an investigative journalist murdered in 2006, are but two names on a long list that could ultimately include Sergei and Yulia Skripal. Underlying Putin’s actions is a sense of Russian exceptionalism – that somehow, Russia is different and not bound by the laws and obligations of the rules-based international order introduced after 1945. His attitude is rooted in the era of the dominant Soviet superpower. But its origins run deeper. Nineteenth-century tsarist Russia both envied and aped Europe. After the 1917 revolution, it defined itself in opposition to the west. Putin has revived that tradition. Until very recently, western leaders have been reluctant to believe the evidence of their own eyes – and their intelligence agencies. There are reasons for this myopia, not all bad. At one end of the spectrum, there is genuine dread that facing off against Putin could lead to some kind of military confrontation with an insecure, paranoid leader who boasted only this month of Russia’s fearsome nuclear weapons arsenal. Then there are the usual strategic and diplomatic considerations: Russia is an influential actor in big international issues such as North Korea and Iran. There are important business and trade interests. And then there is sheer political complacency. George W Bush said he could see into Putin’s soul, then discovered a black hole. Naive Barack Obama tried to “reset” relations with Russia but his plan crashed. For his part, Donald Trump is an infamous Putinophile – and nobody really knows why. Trump’s persistent refusal to criticise Putin directly, whether it be over use of chemical weapons in Syria or covert campaigns to subvert US elections, suggests the Russian leader has some kind of hold over him, possibly relating to Trump’s past business dealings in Russia. Robert Mueller’s federal investigation may shed more light on this. Germany, chronically dependent on Russian energy (almost 40% of its oil imports and 35% of its gas came from Russia in 2016), has obvious vulnerabilities in a hypothetical confrontation. France has commercial interests at stake. Many in Italy want to lift Crimea-related EU sanctions. And so on and so on. So when Trump assures Theresa May of his unstinting support, she should take his words with a large pinch of salt. Trump talks a lot. But what he does, or does not do, matters more. So far he has given Putin a free pass. So far he has refused to enact congressional sanctions over election-meddling. So far, he has acquiesced in Russia’s illegal occupation of Crimea. So far, he has dissed and undermined Nato, Britain’s last line of defence. So far, not so good. And when Emmanuel Macron, France’s president, speaks of “solidarity”, Britain beware. That favourite French word can mean anything or nothing. Similar scepticism must apply to expressions of support emanating from Brussels and other EU capitals. Europe’s track record on taking unified, uncompromising action in response to big international challenges is unimpressive. Just look at Syria. Europe, collectively, talks a good game. But it rarely registers on the scoreboard these days. And the sniggering man in the Kremlin knows it. Rallying these friends and partners into a cohesive alliance capable of facing down Putin, and forcing a step change in his behaviour, is a tall order for May. And now, uniquely, it is all the more problematic because of Brexit. To suggest that bad feeling over Britain’s unamicable departure will have no impact on future EU cooperation in such cases is delusional. Naturally, everybody agrees what happened in Salisbury is an outrage. But actually doing something practical to help out the Brexiting Brits, especially if it harms national interests, is another matter entirely. When push comes to shove, it seems unlikely Trump and Europe will give May the full backing she desperately needs as she goes up against one of the world’s most unscrupulous and dangerous leaders. It is going to be a long war – and not only with Russia. • Simon Tisdall is an assistant editor of the Guardian and a foreign affairs columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"}]}}
