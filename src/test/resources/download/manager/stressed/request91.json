This was the culmination of a day in which it became clear that Shadow Cabinet members were unanimous that Mr Powell would have to go. Several members of the Conservative Front Bench let it be known that they would resign if Mr Powell remained a member. Two of the leading figures in the drama appear to have been Mr Reginald Maudling, the deputy leader of the party, and Mr Quintin Hogg, its chief spokesman on home affairs. Both are understood to have been appalled by Mr Powell’s inflammatory speech, and to have reached the conclusion that it was no longer possible to work with him as a member of the Shadow Cabinet. There is little doubt that Mr Maudling conveyed this view to Mr Heath in the course of yesterday, and Mr Hogg’s similar view must have been conveyed to Mr Heath by a more roundabout route via Mr William Whitelaw, the party’s Chief Whip. Certainly there were very intensive consultations between members of the Shadow Cabinet and between many of them and Mr Heath. By the end of the afternoon it must have been apparent that Mr Heath would receive the full support of his colleagues if he dismissed Mr Powell. It was emphasised last night, however, that the decision to sack Mr Powell belonged to Mr Heath personally. He appears to have spent most of the day at Broadstairs brooding on the situation, to have travelled to his London flat late in the afternoon, and to have telephoned Mr Powell at Wolverhampton at about 9 p.m. A statement issued by Mr Heath at about 10 p.m. said: I have tonight been in touch with Mr Enoch Powell and told him of my decision, taken with the greatest regret, that he should no longer be invited to attend the Shadow Cabinet. I have told Mr Powell that I consider the speech he made in Birmingham yesterday to have been racialist in tone, and liable to exacerbate racial tensions. This is unacceptable from one of the leaders of the Conservative Party and incompatible with the responsibility of a member of the Shadow Cabinet. Relief The timing of the announcement, and of the decision which preceded it, raised the question of why Mr Heath had not acted early in the day, as soon as he had seen reports of Mr Powell’s speech, or, failing that, why he had not delayed the final step until tonight’s meeting of the Shadow Cabinet. The timing suggested that Mr Heath reached his decision in the light of the views telephoned to him by members of his Front Bench team. There is no doubt that a major factor in making up Mr Heath’s mind was the certainty of a further 24 hours of unfavourable press comment – even from normally Conservative newspapers. The general line of Fleet Street comment is understood to have been known to Mr Heath last night, and to have increased the pressure on him to act at once rather than to delay until this evening. But friends of Mr Heath insisted that this was a decision which could not be taken without careful consideration, but which could not be delayed once it had been reached. Several Shadow Ministers made it clear that Mr Powell, in their view, had become an intolerable colleague with whom it had become impossible to continue to work. This was the culmination. they said, of a long period during which Mr Powell had made it clear that he was in disagreement with almost everything the official Opposition was doing. Turning point Senior members of the Shadow Cabinet frankly accept that Mr Powell will be no less intolerable on the Conservative backbenches than he was inside the Shadow Cabinet. As one of them put it last night: “He will create hell.” But it was felt that Mr Powell’s brand of hell would tend to diminish in impact when it emanated from the backbenches, whereas the embarrassment he was able to create as a member of the Shadow Cabinet was more likely to wax than to wane. There was no doubt in the minds of senior Shadow Ministers last night that the sacking of Mr Powell represents a turning point in the history of the Conservative Party, and in particular in the history of Mr Heath’s leadership of it. It undoubtedly represents Mr Heath’s final declaration of war on the increasingly powerful extreme Right-wing faction in his party. Mr Powell is certain to receive the impassioned support of Right-wing Tories for his expression of views on the race question which are widely popular among sections of the electorate. As one Tory MP put it last night, with an eye to public opinion: “You could call him Mr National Opinion Powell.” ‘Have I really caused such a furore?’ As Mr Powell was leaving the Collegiate church of St Peter, Wolverhampton yesterday after attending Holy Communion there, a member of the congregation went up to him and and said: “Well done sir. It needed to be said.” At the same church a few hours later a memorial service to Dr Martin Luther King was to he held. Mr Powell, who has no television set and does not read Sunday papers, said to a reporter “Have I really caused such a furore? I was making a speech entirely in line with the same policy as declared by [Mr Heath] and the action the party will take under his leadership in the House of Commons this week.” Other news items about Enoch Powell included Immigration figures ‘sheer fantasy,’ while the leader stated, “Neither of the main parties can afford to give office to men who appear to be fanning the flames of racialism.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2018/apr/13/avoid-at-all-costs-gulf-streams-record-weakening-prompts-warnings-global-warming","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-13T13:49:41Z","webTitle":"Avoid Gulf stream disruption at all costs, scientists warn","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/apr/13/avoid-at-all-costs-gulf-streams-record-weakening-prompts-warnings-global-warming","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/apr/13/avoid-at-all-costs-gulf-streams-record-weakening-prompts-warnings-global-warming","fields":{"headline":"Avoid Gulf stream disruption at all costs, scientists warn","bodyText":"Serious disruption to the Gulf Stream ocean currents that are crucial in controlling global climate must be avoided “at all costs”, senior scientists have warned. The alert follows the revelation this week that the system is at its weakest ever recorded. Past collapses of the giant network have seen some of the most extreme impacts in climate history, with western Europe particularly vulnerable to a descent into freezing winters. A significantly weakened system is also likely to cause more severe storms in Europe, faster sea level rise on the east coast of the US and increasing drought in the Sahel in Africa. The new research worries scientists because of the huge impact global warming has already had on the currents and the unpredictability of a future “tipping point”. The currents that bring warm Atlantic water northwards towards the pole, where they cool, sink and return southwards, is the most significant control on northern hemisphere climate outside the atmosphere. But the system, formally called the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (Amoc), has weakened by 15% since 1950, thanks to melting Greenland ice and ocean warming making sea water less dense and more buoyant. This represents a massive slowdown – equivalent to halting all the world’s rivers three times over, or stopping the greatest river, the Amazon, 15 times. Such weakening has not been seen in at least the last 1,600 years, which is as far back as researchers have analysed so far. Furthermore, the new analyses show the weakening is accelerating. “From the study of past climate, we know changes in the Amoc have been some of the most abrupt and impactful events in the history of climate,” said Prof Stefan Rahmstorf, at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany and one of the world’s leading oceanographers, who led some of the new research. During the last Ice Age, winter temperatures changed by up to 10C within three years in some places. “We are dealing with a system that in some aspects is highly non-linear, so fiddling with it is very dangerous, because you may well trigger some surprises,” he said. “I wish I knew where this critical tipping point is, but that is unfortunately just what we don’t know. We should avoid disrupting the Amoc at all costs. It is one more reason why we should stop global warming as soon as possible.” Oceanographer Peter Spooner, at University College London, shares the concern: “The extent of the changes we have discovered comes as a surprise to many, including myself, and points to significant changes in the future.” A collapse in the Amoc would mean far less heat reaching western Europe and plunge the region into very severe winters, the kind of scenario depicted in an extreme fashion in the movie The Day After Tomorrow. A widespread collapse of deep-sea ecosystems has also been seen in the past. But as the Amoc weakens, it might actually increase summer heatwaves. That is because it takes time for the cooling of the northern waters to also cause cooling over the adjacent lands. However, the cooler waters affect the atmosphere in a way that helps warm air to flood into Europe from the south, a situation already seen in 2015. Other new research this week showed that Greenland’s massive ice cap is melting at the fastest rate for at least 450 years. This influx will continue to weaken the Amoc into the future until human-caused climate change is halted, but scientists do not not know how fast the weakening will be or when it reaches the point of collapse. “Many people have tried to check that with computer models,” said Rahmstorf. “But they differ a lot because it depends on a very subtle balance of density – that is temperature and salinity distribution in the ocean. We are not able to model this with any confidence right now.” “We are hoping to somehow make some headway, but I have been in this area for more than 20 years now and we still don’t understand why the models differ so much in the sensitivity of the Amoc,” he said. However, Rahmstorf said the international climate deal agreed in 2015 offers some hope if its ambition is increased and achieved: “If we can keep the temperature rise to well below 2C as agreed in the Paris agreement, I think we run a small risk of crossing this collapse tipping point.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2018/apr/13/mps-to-pressure-government-on-backing-for-swansea-tidal-lagoon-project","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-13T12:35:06Z","webTitle":"MPs to pressure government on backing for Swansea tidal lagoon project","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/apr/13/mps-to-pressure-government-on-backing-for-swansea-tidal-lagoon-project","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/apr/13/mps-to-pressure-government-on-backing-for-swansea-tidal-lagoon-project","fields":{"headline":"MPs to pressure government on backing for Swansea tidal lagoon project","bodyText":"MPs are to press ministers on why they have left investors hanging in limbo over taxpayer support for a pioneering £1.3bn tidal lagoon in Swansea. The business, energy and industrial strategy (BEIS) committee and Welsh affairs committee will call on government to explain why no decision has been forthcoming on the flagship scheme. The government has still not indicated whether it is minded to support the lagoon, 15 months since an independent review told ministers to back the clean energy project. Tidal Lagoon Power, a Gloucester-based company, has been pushing for years to build the first of five lagoons at Swansea, to harness power from the ebb and flow of the tides. But the company needs an indication the government is prepared to negotiate a guaranteed price of power for the renewable energy it produces, akin to the ones awarded to windfarm and nuclear power station developers. The BEIS and Welsh affairs committees will now hold an evidence session on the government’s decision-making process, most likely in May, the Guardian understands. The energy minister, Claire Perry, would be the obvious government representative to be quizzed by the MPs on the indecision, which Tidal Lagoon Power recently warned could lead it to significantly reduce its workforce. Rachel Reeves, Labour MP and chair of the BEIS committee, has previously urged minister to give investors clarity on the lagoon. “If they don’t think it can make a contribution, then they should be honest about that and explain what other measures they will take to reduce our carbon emissions,” she has said. Greg Clark, business secretary, told parliament in March that he did not “want to close the door” on the project yet. But he also said that the proposal had initially required a subsidy price twice as expensive as the Hinkley Point C nuclear power station. Privately, in letters to the Welsh government, which has offered to help on financing the lagoon, Clark said the technology was untried, with high capital costs and significant uncertainties. The Welsh government said talks with Whitehall had been constructive but “need to get into far more detail” to reach a swift conclusion. A spokesperson for BEIS said: “Any decision on the Swansea Bay tidal lagoon project will have to represent value for money for the UK taxpayer as well as the consumer.” Tidal Lagoon Power declined to comment. While the Swansea lagoon is currently stalled, another UK tidal power project took an important step forward this week. Scotland-based Atlantis announced the first of its tidal power array in the Pentland Firth, a strait in northern Scotland, had entered the start of its 25-year operations phase. The MeyGen scheme is the world’s largest tidal stream array but at 6MW of capacity is much smaller than the planned 320MW Swansea lagoon."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/apr/13/why-put-the-good-friday-agreement-at-risk-when-harmony-is-possible","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-13T15:25:54Z","webTitle":"Why put the Good Friday agreement at risk when harmony is possible? | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/apr/13/why-put-the-good-friday-agreement-at-risk-when-harmony-is-possible","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/apr/13/why-put-the-good-friday-agreement-at-risk-when-harmony-is-possible","fields":{"headline":"Why put the Good Friday agreement at risk when harmony is possible?","bodyText":"Your editorial (10 April) on the Good Friday agreement points out that “it did not get rid of sectarianism” and that two decades on “the two traditions remain entrenched”. If the “share of the Northern Ireland vote won by parties not defined by sectarian loyalty has barely changed in the past 20 years”, this must be seen as a direct consequence of the agreement, not an accident. It may have been necessary at the time, but by insisting, as your paper has noted, that any “devolved government would comprise a cross-community partnership in which unionists and nationalists would share power”, the 1998 settlement has in practice served not to challenge sectarianism but to manage it. Hence it is hardly surprising that subsequent elections in Northern Ireland have seen the voters of each “community” selecting the party most likely to champion its interests vis-a-vis the other side. The institutions as they stand leave no space for those who might not wish to define themselves as unionist or nationalist. In practice, opting for a non-sectarian party would, given the terms of the agreement, be a wasted vote. Surely it is time for this to change. Declan O’Neill Oldham • Hillary Clinton is correct to say that a reinstated hard border in Ireland would be an “enormous setback” (Don’t let Brexit undermine Ireland’s peace, 10 April). She needn’t be unduly worried. As Bertie Ahern, without complacency, told the BBC’s Newsnight, if border infrastructure was restored “people would just physically pull it down – the ordinary people”. Some fools in Northern Ireland’s unionist community and some evil people among dissident republicans may, for very different reasons, wish to countenance a hard border – one side because they believe it will help shore up their precious union with Britain, the other side because they wish to restart an old war. However, the former taoiseach and one of the architects of the Good Friday agreement is right. The normal decent people of Ireland, the vast majority of us, simply won’t stand for its return. Joe McCarthy Dublin • It was good to read Hillary Clinton’s insightful comments on the 20th anniversary of that far-reaching Good Friday agreement, which has had a profound affect on peace and prosperity in Ireland. It has an almost “sacred cow” veracity about it and its very toppling could indeed be disastrous. She is correct that the implications of Brexit and the intransigent views of our leading rightwing Brexiters cannot be allowed to dismantle all that has been achieved. Power sharing has admittedly stalled and this is a great shame, but if Martin McGuinness and Ian Paisley could be brought together in harmony, nothing is impossible or indeed off the table of rapprochement and constructive action. Judith Daniels Great Yarmouth, Norfolk • David Davis shows poor understanding of Irish politics in suggesting Leo Varadkar is strongly influenced by Sinn Féin. It would be a sure way for his Fine Gael party to lose support. It seems little more than a desperate effort to deflect the grip in which the DUP hold the Conservatives. Though I regret the UK vote, I sympathise with some of the arguments. This process began as one man’s effort to save his job before morphing into a campaign fuelled by ultimately discredited anti-European “facts”. It is now perpetuated by a naive or deliberate lack of accuracy. The British people, the Irish and the ordinary working citizens of Europe deserve better than this.

You can’t mistake the origin of these designs – Henri Matisse. Of course, these sketches are not actually by Matisse, any more than JW Anderson’s Moon Face earrings or Victoria Beckham’s Fluid shirt (which sold out quickly upon their autumn release) were designed by the man who painted the blazingly carnal Dance in 1910. In fact, Dior’s collection was inspired by the artist Niki de Saint Phalle, with references to her brightly coloured sculptures and mirror mosaics featuring heavily throughout. The overall takeaway from the brand’s SS18 advertising campaign, however, was pure Matisse. Because, 64 years after he died, the French artist is having a fashion moment. No modern artist has been as unapologetically sensual as Matisse. It is hard to know where to begin when drawing parallels between his purified abstract art of pleasure and the aesthetic boldness of modern fashion because there are so many threads in the weave. To start with the most obvious, though: colour. The Dior clothes mingling with those Matisse-like drawings include nocturnal blues that might be seen by a diver looking up through moonlit waters. In another example of the Matisse wave, the blue and pearl ovals of Annie Costello Brown’s Skye Earrings resemble the night sky. All these aqua hues echo one of the most intense masterpieces of poetic colour that Matisse ever painted, his 1913 canvas The Blue Window. The depths of colour into which Matisse can dive are, in fact, related to his own interest in fashion and fabrics. Born in 1869 in Picardy, northern France, where traditions of powerfully coloured textile weaving go back to the middle ages, he collected brightly coloured rugs and hangings all his life, especially from north Africa, and used them to create a private world of utopian rapture in his studio. You see the magic colours of these textiles, especially in his 20s paintings of models in rich interiors, which also show his eye for fashion: in Odalisque With Red Culottes (1921) he has his bare-breasted model show off a pair of opulent baggy pants. Matisse enjoyed fashion, so why shouldn’t fashion enjoy Matisse? Yet the current vogue is not so much about copying his culottes as putting on his masks. All these moon-faced earrings and floor drawings of haughtily gorgeous people are directly descended from the way Matisse reinvented the human face when he painted a portrait of his wife, Amélie, in 1913. It was the time when modern artists were looking at African masks in Paris’s Musée d’Ethnographie du Trocadero and enthusiastically collecting them. Picasso saw savagery and terror in these masks. Matisse saw cool beauty. In his portrait of Mme Matisse he gives her a mask-like face with mysterious black eyes, carving her features into a regular, symmetrical ovoid shape – a moon face, even. That mask-like perfecting of the human face was to become an obsession in his art that culminated in a superbly pure oval gazer among the dreamy coloured cut-outs he created in his last years. He drew faces with a relaxed freedom that is itself part of the new Matisse mood. Why not fill space with lines that mean something, as Matisse did in his idyllic drawings and cut-outs? At the Oscars, veteran film-maker James Ivory sported a shirt with the face of Timothée Chalamet, star of his film Call Me By Your Name, portrayed on it, with Matisse-like sensuality, by the British artist Andrew Mania. That same romanticism wafts through all the hints and echoes of Matisse that are drifting gracefully through the fashion world. For Matisse is not some cold decorative artist. He is a hot, passionate one, forever chasing a beauty so extreme it could shatter reality and replace it with a dream. Surely fashion is another way of chasing that dream. Those Matisse earrings and that Matisse shirt are fragments of the utopia his art creates, in which body and soul become one. Or if that’s too heady, let’s just say that by imagining the human face as a godlike mask, Matisse created a truly democratic ideal of beauty – democratic because it’s heavenly. No one actually looks like the moon. At least not on the outside. In channelling this great artist, fashion is diving deeper than it is sometimes given credit for."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"education/2018/apr/13/open-university-vice-chancellor-peter-horrocks-resigns-after-vote-of-no-confidence","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-13T11:38:33Z","webTitle":"Open University vice-chancellor resigns after staff revolt","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2018/apr/13/open-university-vice-chancellor-peter-horrocks-resigns-after-vote-of-no-confidence","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/education/2018/apr/13/open-university-vice-chancellor-peter-horrocks-resigns-after-vote-of-no-confidence","fields":{"headline":"Open University vice-chancellor resigns after staff revolt","bodyText":"Peter Horrocks, the vice-chancellor of the Open University, has resigned after failing to quell a staff revolt over his plans to institute major budget cuts and redundancies. The announcement came after Horrocks proved unable this week to win the backing of the OU’s governing council. He failed to convince its members that he could manage the reforms needed at the distance-learning institution launched by Harold Wilson in 1969. In his resignation statement, Horrocks said he understood the university’s governing bodies would ultimately approve his reforms. “So the time has come when I am ready to move on, having achieved my primary goals at the OU,” he said. OU insiders, however, said Horrocks had lost confidence of staff at all levels, with the council and university senate likely to block further restructuring if he remained in post. Professor Mary Kellett, the executive dean of the university’s wellbeing and education faculty, takes over immediately as acting vice-chancellor. The university said Horrocks would remain as a consultant for another three months. The former BBC executive ran into widespread opposition to his plans to slash the number of courses the institution offers, with as many as 1,000 core staff losing their jobs in response to the sharp decline in student enrolment the university has endured since tuition fees were raised in 2012. Confidential documents first revealed by the Guardian last month said 41 undergraduate and postgraduate degree courses were to be axed. Horrocks’s resignation from his £360,000-a-year post comes just a week after a meeting of University and College Union members at the OU demanded he step down. Lydia Richards, a UCU regional officer, said: “Staff made it quite clear that the vice-chancellor had to go and we are pleased he has finally got that message. The Open University is a fantastic institution and Horrocks’s replacement must defend the unique role it plays in our education system and the work of its staff. “The university leadership team should now scrap the damaging plans to cut jobs and courses, and work with us to develop a more positive strategy for the future of the institution.” Richard Gillingwater, the university’s pro-chancellor and chair of the university council, said Horrocks had made an enormous contribution to the OU during his three-year tenure. “Peter has recaptured the pioneering spirit of the OU, challenged norms and pushed us to put innovation at the heart of our preparations for the future,” Gillingwater said. But Ian Johnston, an OU lecturer, said there was a huge sense of relief at the news of Horrocks’ departure. “This must be humiliating for Peter Horrocks, but he has only himself to blame. From the start he appeared to take no interest in learning the culture of the university and to show contempt for staff at all levels,” he said. “We all recognise that the OU faces significant problems, but we will stand a much better chance when these solutions emerge from the staff as a whole and not from a tiny, uninformed clique at the top.” Horrocks said: “I know that all members of the university will continue to commit themselves to the changes necessary to live up to these opportunities. I wish the University and my successor the very best.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/apr/14/donald-trump-syria-address-full-text","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-14T02:16:55Z","webTitle":"Donald Trump's address on the launch of attacks on Syria – the full text","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/14/donald-trump-syria-address-full-text","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/apr/14/donald-trump-syria-address-full-text","fields":{"headline":"Donald Trump's address on the launch of attacks on Syria – the full text","bodyText":"My fellow Americans, a short time ago, I ordered the United States Armed Forces to launch precision strikes on targets associated with the chemical weapons capabilities of Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad. A combined operation with the armed forces of France and the United Kingdom is now under way. We thank them both. Tonight, I want to speak with you about why we have taken this action. One year ago, Assad launched a savage chemical weapons attack against his own innocent people. The United States responded with 58 missile strikes that destroyed 20 per cent of the Syrian Air Force. Last Saturday, the Assad regime again deployed chemical weapons to slaughter innocent civilians – this time, in the town of Douma, near the Syrian capital of Damascus. This massacre was a significant escalation in a pattern of chemical weapons use by that very terrible regime. The evil and the despicable attack left mothers and fathers, infants and children, thrashing in pain and gasping for air. These are not the actions of a man; they are crimes of a monster instead. Following the horrors of World War I a century ago, civilized nations joined together to ban chemical warfare. Chemical weapons are uniquely dangerous not only because they inflict gruesome suffering, but because even small amounts can unleash widespread devastation. The purpose of our actions tonight is to establish a strong deterrent against the production, spread, and use of chemical weapons. Establishing this deterrent is a vital national security interest of the United States. The combined American, British, and French response to these atrocities will integrate all instruments of our national power – military, economic, and diplomatic. We are prepared to sustain this response until the Syrian regime stops its use of prohibited chemical agents. I also have a message tonight for the two governments most responsible for supporting, equipping, and financing the criminal Assad regime. To Iran, and to Russia, I ask: What kind of a nation wants to be associated with the mass murder of innocent men, women, and children? The nations of the world can be judged by the friends they keep. No nation can succeed in the long run by promoting rogue states, brutal tyrants, and murderous dictators. In 2013, President Putin and his government promised the world that they would guarantee the elimination of Syria’s chemical weapons. Assad’s recent attack – and today’s response – are the direct result of Russia’s failure to keep that promise. Russia must decide if it will continue down this dark path, or if it will join with civilised nations as a force for stability and peace. Hopefully, someday we’ll get along with Russia, and maybe even Iran – but maybe not. I will say this: The United States has a lot to offer, with the greatest and most powerful economy in the history of the world. In Syria, the United States – with but a small force being used to eliminate what is left of ISIS – is doing what is necessary to protect the American people. Over the last year, nearly 100 per cent of the territory once controlled by the so-called ISIS caliphate in Syria and Iraq has been liberated and eliminated. The United States has also rebuilt our friendships across the Middle East. We have asked our partners to take greater responsibility for securing their home region, including contributing large amounts of money for the resources, equipment, and all of the anti-ISIS effort. Increased engagement from our friends, including Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Egypt, and others can ensure that Iran does not profit from the eradication of ISIS. America does not seek an indefinite presence in Syria under no circumstances. As other nations step up their contributions, we look forward to the day when we can bring our warriors home. And great warriors they are. Looking around our very troubled world, Americans have no illusions. We cannot purge the world of evil, or act everywhere there is tyranny. No amount of American blood or treasure can produce lasting peace and security in the Middle East. It’s a troubled place. We will try to make it better, but it is a troubled place. The United States will be a partner and a friend, but the fate of the region lies in the hands of its own people. In the last century, we looked straight into the darkest places of the human soul. We saw the anguish that can be unleashed and the evil that can take hold. By the end of the World War I, more than 1 million people had been killed or injured by chemical weapons. We never want to see that ghastly specter return. So today, the nations of Britain, France, and the United States of America have marshaled their righteous power against barbarism and brutality. Tonight, I ask all Americans to say a prayer for our noble warriors and our allies as they carry out their missions. We pray that God will bring comfort to those suffering in Syria. We pray that God will guide the whole region toward a future of dignity and of peace. And we pray that God will continue to watch over and bless the United States of America.

They have thrilled, bemused and aggravated – feelings San Francisco, San Jose, Austin and Washington DC are now experiencing as scooters from Bird and two other startups, LimeBike and Spin, hit their streets, with dozens more cities due to receive them this year. A full-scale backlash is under way in San Francisco, where some scooters have been tossed into trash cans and lakes. The city attorney has threatened to impound scooters, calling them dangerous, unlawful and examples of tech arrogance. City hall is exploring ways to regulate the devices. With a global market in their sights, the scooter startups are pushing back Bird comes armed with $115m (£80.3m) in investment funding and seems to take the Uber-esque, hard-charging stance on regulation that it is better to seek forgiveness than permission. A tangle with Santa Monica officials earned a criminal complaint and hefty fine. “The demand is huge. We’re looking to reach more than 50 markets this year and eventually have Birds all over the world,” says Stephen Schnell, the company’s vice president of operations, noting that Britain is on the company’s radar. “We try to pick cities that have bicycle lane infrastructure.” Schnell, like Bird’s CEO Travis VanderZanden, previously worked at Lyft and Uber. Ride sharing companies are shaking up urban transport but many commuters still have the “last mile” problem: a distance too far to walk and too short to drive, says Schnell. “This is a way to get people out of their vehicles.” Marlon Boarnet, an urban planning and spatial analysis professor at the University of Southern California, says dockless scooters can facilitate short trips while being light on the environment and using minimal space. “Traditionally we view this as walking or bicycling, but the concept can and should be extended to light and small powered vehicles like electric scooters. One could also include in this set small neighborhood electric vehicles or electric motor assisted bicycles. We should expand our idea of what an acceptable ‘short trip’ vehicle is.” Boarnet hopes the companies and city authorities can resolve issues such as where the scooters are left. When clumped in the middle of a pavement scooters can seem more nuisance clutter than transport revolution. The boom and bust of dockless bicycles in several markets – exemplified by a picture of a bicycle graveyard in China – act as a cautionary tale. The Guardian scooted around Santa Monica for a week to try them out. The longest journey was from the city’s downtown to Bird’s headquarters in Venice, three miles away. It took 17 minutes and cost $3.55 – a $1 base fee plus 15 cents per minute. The experience was positive. Scooters were easy to find with the app’s map pinpointing devices left by trees, parking meters, benches and doorways. Once you’ve scanned and unlocked the barcode with your phone there’s a childlike glee in kicking off with your foot, pushing the handlebar’s throttle button and gliding down the street. Not encased in a shell of metal and glass, you feel connected to your surroundings – both hands are needed to steer so it is difficult to text or fiddle with your phone. Tootling down Main Street, the most striking impression was the response of pedestrians, cyclists, skateboarders and motorists: in most cases there wasn’t one. In September the scooters were a novelty and drew stares. Now they’re part of the streetscape and barely remarked upon – except by some tourists who gawk and take pictures. Bird reports quick adoption; there are more than 50,000 regular riders in and around Santa Monica, and riders in San Francisco notched up more than 60,000 miles in just 17 days. “It’s kind of amazing,” says Schnell. What’s amazing, say critics, is the irresponsibility of the scooter companies and many of their riders. Few wear helmets in Santa Monica. It is common to see children riding scooters, two people on one scooter, parked scooters cluttering sidewalks and moving scooters scattering pedestrians on sidewalks. San Francisco residents have joined Santa Monicans in venting on social media. Riders are supposed to be licensed drivers, helmeted and are meant to ride on streets, preferably in bicycle lanes. Users need a driver’s licence to download the app and upon request Bird sends free helmets. Still, improper use abounds. According to a city spokesperson, so far Santa Monica has recorded 11 accidents, some serious, 328 citations and 694 traffic stops. Irked that Bird launched with little or no warning, city authorities filed a criminal complaint over lack of business licences and vendor permits. Both sides settled in February, with Bird promising to seek the licences and to pay more than $300,000 in fines. “Even though they got off to a rocky start we didn’t move to kick them out because based on our values we’re really committed to this new model of mobility,” says Anuj Gupta, Santa Monica’s deputy city manager. There has been no detectable impact on car congestion but scooters are now part of the transport mix, he says. “We honestly understand and share in the excitement about these devices.” But there’s another concern. If Bird and rival startups plant scooters on every block won’t people have even less incentive to walk and exercise? “You mean WALL-E world,” says Schnell, referencing the Pixar film in which future humans become obese gluttons ensconced in padded floating arm chairs. “Let’s hope not. With the scooters at least you have to stand.” Follow Guardian Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, and explore our archive here"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/live/2018/apr/28/county-cricket-live-lancashire-surrey-somerset-yorkshire-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-28T17:50:54Z","webTitle":"County cricket: Chanderpaul helps Lancashire batsmen dig in – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2018/apr/28/county-cricket-live-lancashire-surrey-somerset-yorkshire-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/live/2018/apr/28/county-cricket-live-lancashire-surrey-somerset-yorkshire-live","fields":{"headline":"County cricket: Chanderpaul helps Lancashire batsmen dig in – as it happened","bodyText":"Thank you for the company - it’s been a cracking day here at Old Trafford and lots of intrigue and wickets round the country where the rain has stayed away. Close of play scores below, see you tomorrow! SECOND DAY ROUND-UP Division one Worcestershire v Nottinghamshire: No play today. Somerset v Yorkshire: Farce! Somerset 2nd innings: 6-0. Yorkshire 96 all out ( (Brook 32; Gregory 3-30, Groenewald 3-12) Somerset 216 all out (Renshaw 112; Brooks 5-57) Lancashire v Surrey: Recovery. Lancashire 352 for 8 (Jordan Clark 78. Mennie 35 not out, Bailey 15 not out; Dernbach 3-68, Virdi 3-64). Hampshire v Essex: Damp. Hampshire 154 for 2 (Adams 57 not out, Amla 8 not out; Siddle 1-14, Harmer 1-21). Rain stopped play Division two Sussex v Gloucestershire: Chaos! Sussex 2nd innings 51 for 2 (van Zyl 23 not out) Gloucestershire 183 all out (Howell 37 Wiese 5-48; Robinson 4-67) Sussex 145 all out (Philip Salt 63; Higgins 5-21). Northants v Durham: No play today. Middlesex v Glamorgan: No play today. Leicestershire v Derbyshire: No play today. And some good news to finish - A somnolent day at Old Trafford, where cold morning gave way to bright afternoon, and the pitch dried out as the day grew long, and Lancashire tripped along to their first batting points of the summer. After a shaky first hour, it was an innings of bright starts – players getting in, only to fade when something really ample was in sight. Shivnarine Chanderpaul made 65 runs of inelegant fortitude before holing out in the last over before tea; Liam Livingstone was lbw to Jade Dernbach for 48 and Steven Croft, who went to fifty pulling a full-toss from Amar Virdi for six, was caught cleverly by Ben Foakes for 62. It was No 8 Jordan Clark who top-scored with 78 finely hefted runs, and took Lancashire to 352 for eight at the close. There was frustration for Haseeb Hameed, out for four, who started the season needing just one tidy knock to ink his place into Ed Smith’s notebook, but who has now made 35 runs in five Championship innings. Surrey, energetically nimble in the field, bowled cleverly – particularly Dernbach and Virdi, all slouch and sleeves, who can now add Chanderpaul to his already impressive list of internationals dismissed this year: Vince, Amla, Abbott and Rossouw. At Hove, Philip Salt’s fifty seemed a long day away as wickets tumbled all about. Sussex subsided to 145 all out in their first innings with seven batsmen stuck in single-figures. Ryan Higgins took five for 21. Gloucestershire were then bowled out for 183 with four wickets for Oliver Robinson and five for David Wiese. In their second innings Sussex were 51 for two at the close, with a lead of 13. There was another truncated day at the Ageas Bowl where Hampshire reached 154 for two before bad light stopped play. Jimmy Adams finished on 57 not out; James Vince was caught behind after a coquettish brush outside off-stump for 47. At Lord’s, play was eventually called off at five o’clock with Middlesex marooned at 64 for three against Glamorgan. There was no play at all at for the second day in a row at Worcestershire v Nottinghamshire, Northamptonshire v Durham and Leicestershire v Derbyshire. In their first tour match, Pakistan were bowled out for 168 by Kent, with five wickets for William Gidman. Imam ul-Haq, nephew of Inzamam, made 61, and was the only Pakistan batsman to pass 17. Here are the latest scores: Division One Somerset 216 and 6-0, Yorkshire 96 – Somerset lead by 126 runs Lancashire 352-8, Surrey yet to bat Hampshire 154-2, Essex yet to bat Worcs v Notts – no play due to rain Division Two Sussex 145 and 31-1, Gloucestershire 183 – Sussex trail by seven runs (L) Middlesex 64-3, Glamorgan yet to bat – no play Saturday Northants v Durham, Leics v Derbyshire – no play due to rain And that is stumps here at Old Trafford with Lancashire 352 for 8 (Jordan Clark 78. Mennie 35 not out, Bailey 15 not out; Dernbach 3-68, Virdi 3-64). Yorkshire are all out for 96 - they actually batted for longer than Somerset. There was some stoic resistance from Tim Bresnan at the end. They trail by 120. And there are two overs left for Somerset to face. Phew! What a day for the bowlers and Matt Renshaw. Who knows what the last 12 balls will bring. No doubt each one will be an event. At Hove Gloucestershire are all out for 183, which gives them a first-innings lead of 38. In reply Sussex are 5-1, with Philip Salt, the only rock in their first dig, out for 0. Another wicket for Higgins. Here at Old Trafford, the shadows are long and Lancashire are grinding away at Surrey with a little stand here, a little stand there. Mennie and Bailey have now put on 23. Lancs 346 for 8. Here are some Yorkie wickets to watch - I hadn’t realised they lost four with the score on 64. They’re now 84/9 - which is something of a recovery. And that’s Clark out, a FANTASTIC catch by the leaping Pope at square leg off Virdi for 78. A kind of slog-sweep by Clark, the sort that had been going to the boundary all the rest of his innings. And that’s a third wicket for Virdi, 3-56 off 17.2. To be honest a Jordan Clark hundred will make me look like a bit of an idiot in the first edition of the paper, though he is swinging the bat very nicely. And the sun is properly out. In the meantime, chaos with Vic down in Taunton and a quick 30 odd from the wonderfully named Kieran Noema-Barnett giving Gloucestershire a handy little lead at Hove. At Taunton the ball is still swinging and important Yorkshire wickets have fallen. Ballance was caught behind off the inside edge against Groenewald, while Brook was bowled off the inside edge by Craig Overton. Groenewald then claimed two identical dismissals in quick succession, with Waite and Hodd both edging to Trescothick at second slip. The visitors are now 64-6. The game at the Ageas Bowl has been suspended due to bad light, with Hampshire on 154-2 against Essex. Only three matches still being played; in Division One, Lancashire are 271-7 against Sussex while Yorkshire are just 53-4 at Taunton, with Somerset 216 all out. In Division Two, Gloucestershire are closing on a first-innings lead, on 134-6 with Sussex 145 all out. Lord’s: abandoned for the day From Vic: “At tea Yorkshire are 31-2, Lyth run-out after a mix up with Harry Brook and some superb combination work by George Bartlett and Craig Overton. Then Lewis Gregory, who has probably bowled better than he did against Worcestershire last week (when he was among the wickets), had Pujara lbw just before the break. In the meantime Harry Brook, very much the modern player - with his tall, statuesque stance and high hands- has played well against a tight Somerset attack. A nice tribute over the PA to Dave Callaghan during tea, the voice of Yorkshire cricket...most of which was familiar to Chris Waters in the press box.” Further inspection at five at Lord’s. This seems a little fruitless... TEA-TIME ROUND-UP Division one Worcestershire v Nottinghamshire: Play abandonded for the day. Somerset v Yorkshire: Farce! Yorkshire 31 for 2 (Brook 22 not out, Ballance 0 not out.) Somerset 216 all out (Renshaw 112; Brooks 5-57) Lancashire v Surrey: Fractured. Lancashire 206 for 6 (Croft 47 not out, Chanderpaul 65, Dernbach 3-35) Hampshire v Essex: Damp. Hampshire 154 for 2 (Adams 57 not out, Amla 8 not out; Siddle 1-14, Harmer 1-21). Rain stopped play Division two Sussex v Gloucestershire: Steady: Gloucestershire 104 for 4 (J Taylor 6 not out, van Buuren 0 not out; Robinson 3-30) Sussex 145 all out (Philip Salt 63; Higgins 5-21). Northants v Durham: Play abandoned for the day Middlesex v Glamorgan: No play yet today, inspection at 4pm Leicestershire v Derbyshire: Play abandoned for the day A sudden collapse at Canterbury where Pakistan are 155 for 9. Imam ul-Haq the only man to pass 2o. And so it came to pass, just as Lancashire collect their first batting point of the season, Chanderpaul holes out for 65. Lancashire 206 for 6 and they take tea. Further inspection at 4pm at Lord’s. Some nostalgia from Paul Speller. We didn’t have that one, but I was a big fan of Kings and Queens of England Books 1 and 2. We were just pondering the concentration required to field from 11am-6pm, even early on in the season, even on a short-sleeved jumper kind of day. It is such a peculiar test of endurance. Yorkshire 19 for 1; Lyth run-out for 0. Play has been suspended at the Ageas Bowl, Essex: 154 for 2. Gloucestershire 91 for 3; Robinson 2-20. And 50 for Chanderpaul! His 143rd in first-class cricket. And play has been abandoned at New Road too. And Somerset are all out for 216, collapsing from 145 for one. Century-before-lunch Renshaw the standout man, with seven other single figure scores. Brooks 5-57. Cricket has got a bit sleepy here at OT. Chanderpaul being elegantly inelegant in the afternoon somnolence. Another wicket at Old Trafford. Lancashire now 130 for five. Villas pushes forward at Curran and Borthwick takes a tremendous catch diving to his right at second slip. These Surrey boys are very quick and lithe, permanently prancing on the tips of their toes ready to dive or run or leap. At Canterbury, Inzy’s nephew Imam ul-Haq has made an unbeaten fifty. From Vic: “This has been an extraordinarily frenetic day..now Renshaw has gone after a form footed waft at Brooks so it’s 174-5. Can’t quibble too much since he finished with 112 from 99 balls. No longer sure who’s winning this game.. By the way Jack Leach is not playing ths game since he’s ill. Dom Bess is the Somerset spinner, which is handy. At this time of year - its still April and we are in the the third round of matches - it’s sometimes tricky to play one spinner let alone two. And Bess neds as much exposure as possible for everybody’s sake. In the ideal world Leach and Bess should play in he same side in mid-summer sunshine. Wickets still falling. Gregory lbw to Brooks aiming to square leg rather than mid-on 179-6. And another one. Davies caught behind off Coad. Despite everything Yorkshire in ascendancy. 145-1 has become 181-7.” Pitch inspection at 3pm at New Road. Bring wellies. Sorry I don’t think that Vince link works, but if you go onto the ECB website then videos, then wickets, you can see every one that has fallen today. Dernbach bowling very well here at OT. At Lord’s a further inspection at 3pm. And Gloucestershire have lost a wicket in reply to Sussex’s 145 all out. Dent b Robinson 14. See here Vince’s demise - hope it works. Poor kid. And Somerset have lost another: 182-8. A five-fer for Brooks 5-56. And Lancashire lose a wicket: Livingstone misreads some late swing, lbw Dernbach 48; Lancs 111 for four. Somerset now sliding slowly towards the abyss - 179 for 6, Jack Brooks 4-55. Oh, and Vince is out, for 47. Caught behind, the Essex twitter feed describes it as “flirts outside off-stump.” Renshaw is OUT! caught Hodd b Brooks 112. What an innings! 99 balls, 16 x 4, 4 x6. A hundred before lunch in April. One for the ages. Somerset 171 for 5. Ah, but something lovely from Vic who has just witnessed a litle bit of history: “It’s hard not to make this another tale of Smith/Warner/ Bancroft making fools of themselves in Cape Town just under a month ago. Without that episode we would not be celebrating a century before lunch by Somerset’s latest opener (in fact this would not happened if Eddie Byrom had not dislocated his shoulder in the last game against Worcestershire but that is not such a good line). You may remember that Cameron Bancroft was supposed to be playing for Somerset this season; you will remember his escapades in South Africa after which Somerset agonized and politely declined to continue with his contract. Enter Renshaw as a late replacement. In his first match he hit a critical century on a very green surface against Worcestershire – this pitch is only quite green – and now this. He’s supposed to be a bit of a blocker but take the Yorkshireman out of Yorkshire and then pitch him against Yorkshire and anything can happen. Here he attacked from the start and kept going. On 94 Jack Brooks bounced him and he hooked it for six even though there were two or three men on the leg side boundary. We’re still trying to work who scored the last century before lunch for Somerset (where Samson?) With just a few minutes to lunch and Somerset’s star batsman, James Hildreth just gone for a duck and Renshaw pummelled two length balls from Coad straight back over the bemused bowler’s head. Renshaw reached his hundred in 86 balls with 14 fours and four sixes. The blunt truth seems to be that Somerset owe Smith and Warner a big thank you. I doubt whether Bancroft, even without mental turmoil, could have equalled this. Renshaw does not have a one-day contract with Somerset. Perhaps they will revisit that. Renshaw has overshadowed everyone else and Somerset seem to be far too dependent upon him at the moment. Trescothick was caught in the gully in the second over; Bartlett after a promising little innings was lbw; Hildreth clipped a ball gracefully straight to square leg without scoring and Abell was bowled by the last ball before lunch. Everyone seems keen to be making up for lost time. 166-4.” Also, depressingly, this. Now, time for lunch. LUNCH-TIME ROUND-UP Division one Worcestershire v Nottinghamshire: No play yet today, inspection after lunch. Somerset v Yorkshire: Fireworks! Somerset 166 for 4 (Renshaw 111 not out; Coad 2- 50, Brooks 2-48) Lancashire v Surrey: Consolidation. Lancashire 94 for 3 (Livingstone 39, Chanderpaul 27, Dernbach 2-28) Hampshire v Essex: Steady. Hampshire 125 for 1 (Adams 49 not out, Vince 41 not out; Siddle 1 for 14) Division two Sussex v Gloucestershire: Subsidence! Sussex 145 all out (Philip Salt 63; Higgins 5-21). Gloucestershire 1 for 0 Northants v Durham: Play abandoned for the day Middlesex v Glamorgan: No play yet today, inspection at 1.10 Leicestershire v Derbyshire: Play abandoned for the day And a hundred for Renshaw! Bravo that man. Off just 84 deliveries - 14 x 4, 4 x6. Over at Kent, Pakistan are struggling with exposure to the English spring - 53 for 3 with two wickets to William Gidman. Imam ul-Haq, nephew of, 14 not out. Elsewhere, breath is being taken. Renshaw has slowed at little at Taunton, now just 11 short of that century. Sussex 130 for 9 and at Old Trafford Livingstone and Chanderpaul have put on a fifty partnership in 96 balls. And five wickets for Higgins at Hove (5 for 16), with Sussex now 117 for 7.NO! Make that 117 for 8. Soggy update: Play is abandoned for the day at Grace Road. And Renshaw now 81 not out at Somerset! 66 of the 81 in boundaries. Bresnan 4 overs 0 for 30... “My job is to perform, and my mindset is to play to the best of my ability.The rest will look after itself.” Hammed earlier this season on his batting and being coached by his dad. I wonder if looking back he will feel like the fact there was an opening in the England batting line-up just waiting for him to get runs was an added pressure. Have a read here. Meanwhile Livingstone has just hit Dernbach for three boundaries in a row. Sussex have lost another wicket down at Hove, another for Worrall; at Somerset Renshaw has moved on to 66. Three wickets for Ryan Higgins down at Hove; now a fourth falls with Finch out for five, this time to Worrall. Sussex 105/4. - And a super-rapid 53 for Matthew Renshaw at Taunton - Vic should be here soon with some news on that - he got to 50 entirely in boundaries ten fours and 2 sixes! Ah, so Lancashire now making a bit of a hash of things, having lost three wickets for 8 runs in 15 balls. First Hameed, then Davies c Dunn b Dernbach for 4 then Jennings perhaps marginally unlucky to be lbw to Sam Curran for 15. Lancs now 26 for 3, with rain forecast after lunch. A few more wickets round the counties... At the Ageas Bowl: Weatherley c Browne b Siddle 29 - Vince is in! - and a couple down at Hove, Salt c van Buuren b Higgins for 63 and Wells c Roderick b Higgins 27. A reckless swipe from Hameed, his first false shot in 23 balls, is followed the very next delivery by an edge behind. Hameed c Elgar b Dernbach 4. Lancashire 15 for 1. It’s raining again at Lord’s so I’m not sure there will be any play there before lunch. Oh dear, a wicket at Taunton, Trescothick c Brook, b Brooks 4, the weary old feet perhaps not quite ready for the early start. But here is his four to get off the mark. And we’re on at Old Trafford. Jennings and Hameed to face Dernbach bowling in a short-sleeved jumper - and a little nudge from Jennings gets Lancashire out of bed and onto the little rug that needs a hoover. Hameed very insistently padding down a lump in front of his stumps. He plays out the rest of the over tidily. Paul Edwards next to me, a huge Hameed fan, makes approving noises. I’m feeling a tidy thirty at least for him today. Yorkshire are bowling at Somerset, waiting for news at Lord’s. Good morning from Old Trafford and welcome to the second day of this round of matches - or the first if we scribble out yesterday as miserable washout. Here at Old Trafford the two teams are on the outfield, Surrey to the right, Lancashire to the left, playing football in full tracksuits with woolly hats- don’t get into your heads that this, now, is spring. The puddles at the bottom of the run-ups have dried and play will start at 11 o’clock, with 104 overs due in the day. Around the counties it is a mixed picture, with play already called off for the day at Northants, but five games are expected to start on time. Worcestershire v Nottinghamshire: Rain, delayed start expected Somerset v Yorkshire: Play will start at 11am. Lancashire v Surrey: Play will start at 11am Hampshire v Essex: Play will start at 11am DIVISION 2 Sussex v Gloucestershire: Play will start at 11am Northants v Durham: Play abandoned for the day Middlesex v Glamorgan: Damp, waiting on a start time Leicestershire v Derbyshire: lunch will be taken at 12 with an inspection afterwards Treats to look forward to - Stuart Broad having a bowl at New Road - if they get on at the ground where Gareth Batty once swam across the dressing-room. Five of Nottinghamshire’s scheduled 12 match days have been washed out so far this season. Also the battle of the young guns here at Old Trafford, Alastair Cook’s return to the crease, a flighty cameo or two from Tom Westley and James Vince and a chance to see Tom Barber bowl for Middlesex. Here is the current state of play after a rain-soaked Friday: DIVISION 1 Worcestershire v Nottinghamshire: No play Somerset v Yorkshire: No play Lancashire v Surrey: No play Hampshire v Essex: Hampshire 41/0. Weatherly 22, Adams 19. DIVISION 2 Sussex v Gloucestershire: Sussex 86/0. Salt 54, Wells 25 Northants v Durham: no play. Middlesex v Glamorgan: Middx 64/3 Eskinazi 31, Cartwright 0.

Illustrator David Roberts is both writer and artist of Suffragette: The Battle for Equality (Two Hoots £18.99). In a lavish colour hardback replete with his distinctive, perceptive art, he offers fascinating insights into the complex history of the movement, looking beyond the stereotypes to include working-class women and diverse stories from around the world. Despite Disney’s best efforts, Hans Christian Andersen’s The Little Mermaid has always occupied a dark place in the fairytale canon. In her contemporary reimagining, The Surface Breaks (Scholastic £12.99), Louise O’Neill harnesses that darkness and transforms the mermaid’s plight into a tale of feminist awakening. On her first swim to the surface young mermaid Gaia falls for a human boy, but what must she sacrifice to be with him? The suffocating patriarchy of the underwater kingdom, where women are reduced to their physical appearance, feels almost dystopian. O’Neill’s prose cuts and rages and her vision of the sea witch is truly transformative. From the US, Afro-Domenican poet Elizabeth Acevedo is a breathtaking new voice. In her verse novel, The Poet X (Electric Monkey £7.99), Xiomara feels trapped between the weight of parental and societal expectations and the discovery of her own true self. The notebook beneath her bed reveals her secrets and desires in a series of powerful, raw poems. A hymn to finding your voice and the potency of words. Speaking up for what you believe in also drives Run, Riot (Hodder £7.99), the YA debut from Nikesh Shukla, editor of The Good Immigrant, a book of essays about race. When teenagers film police beating an unarmed youth on their estate they find themselves on the run and uncover a conspiracy about the tower block where they live. Told from multiple viewpoints over the course of a single night, this electrifying thriller explores gentrification, corruption and community. In the 20 years since Melvin Burgess’s Junk, surprisingly few YA novels have dared tackle addiction. Juno Dawson’s Clean (Quercus £7.99) changes that in spectacular style. After overdosing in a penthouse suite, privileged heiress Lexi Volkov finds herself at the Clarity Centre, where a gruelling detox and group therapy reveal a fractured past. As bold and gritty as it is fabulously glossy and readable, it’s a provocative, important read. Finally, the pure joy and exhilaration of being young and alive on a perfect summer’s day is captured to stunning effect in David Almond’s The Colour of the Sun (Hodder £12.99). Davie turns away from the familiar streets of his home town, roaming towards the sunlit summit of the hills. He meets family, friends, a priest and a one-legged man, each with something to show him. There’s life and death here, otherworldly magic and the wonder of the everyday. Lyrical and unforgettable, it’s Almond’s most autobiographical novel to date and possibly his most beautiful. •To order any of these books for a special price click on the titles, go to guardianbookshop.com or call 0330 333 6846.

However, I see this as a west-centric understanding that fails to empathise with the fact that fairer skin is a beauty norm in much of the non-west, much like being thin or slim is a beauty standard in the west. Conversely, traditional South Asian beauty standards value a “healthy” or “plump” physique for women, which is an indicator of belonging to a family that is reasonably well-off. Yes, as an Indian woman, I do want fairer skin. And no, I would not use creams containing dangerous chemicals, because I respect myself too much for that. But I would use home remedies that my grandmothers and great-grandmothers have used for over a century – turmeric, chickpea flour, yoghurt, rose water – if they can help me feel better about myself and, yes, attract the attention of the opposite sex. Isn’t that a most human desire? What makes it OK to devalue non-western women’s quests for better self-esteem? It’s true that companies like Unilever – the manufacturer of Fair and Lovely – have in the past used abominable advertising campaigns to encourage women and men to buy their products. These advertisements made me as a teenager feel awful about myself. But let’s make a distinction between unhealthy advertising and chemical-laden cosmetics, and age-old beauty secrets to cater to an age-old beauty standard. My question is, why do articles about fairness creams that originate in the west often assume the right to occupy the moral high ground, looking down their noses at people from the east and south who choose to use these products, while overlooking similar phenomena in the west that lead people to use unhealthy methods for weight loss, fuller cleavages, fewer wrinkles and disguised grey hairs? Is wanting to have fair skin any sillier than wanting bigger boobs or not wanting to age? Isn’t insecurity about how you look a pretty universal human frailty?

An hour before the 81-year-old British director received his honorary degree from the free university of Brussels (ULB) on Thursday, he told reporters he could not allow Charles Michel’s comments to go unanswered. Loach said he was shocked to have to make a statement, adding that he understood that Michel, Belgium’s PM since 2011, had read law at the ULB. “Is the law so badly taught here? Or did he not pass his exam?” Loach said. “A good lawyer must examine the evidence before coming to a conclusion. Mr Michel, look at the evidence.” On the previous evening, during a speech at Brussels Grand Synagogue to mark the 70th anniversary of Israel’s foundation, Michel had surprised his audience by commenting on the row over Loach’s planned honour, which local Jewish organisations have been lobbying to have withdrawn in recent weeks. Michel told his audience: “No accommodation with antisemitism can be tolerated, whatever its form. And that also goes for my own alma mater.” A spokesman for the prime minister’s office later told the Belgian newspaper De Standaard: “Michel’s statement may be read as a rejection of the honorary doctorate. The prime minister has studied the file and believes that [Loach] has recently made controversial statements that justify the withdrawal of that honorary doctorate. “Obviously, the prime minister does not have to deal with academic freedom, the university does not need the permission of the prime minister in any way, but he does give his opinion. At the moment it does not seem appropriate to him to honour such a person.” Loach has faced heavy criticism in recent weeks over claims he has given cover to antisemitic views. He has had to defend himself from claims that he failed to condemn Holocaust denial during an interview with the BBC. The celebrated director, whose works include Cathy Come Home and I, Daniel Blake, has been further criticised for his calls for the expulsion of Labour MPs who took part in a recent protest in Westminster against antisemitism in the party. Loach claimed that those involved had been seeking to undermine their leader, Jeremy Corbyn. Speaking at the ULB’s Solbusch campus, Loach said: “I noticed that Charles Michel made this outing at a meeting celebrating the 70th anniversary of Israel. “Mr Michel is a lawyer, did he wonder about Israel’s failure to comply with international law? Has he asked the question of colonisation of the Palestinian territories? Has he asked the question of unarmed Palestinian civilians killed by the Israeli army? Has he asked the question of refugees living under the protection of the United Nations? There are so many examples of Israel’s failure to respect international law.” Such have the protests been against Loach’s award that the ULB’s rector, Yvon Englert, had sought a statement from Loach earlier in the week. In his subsequent statement, Loach described the attacks against him as malicious. “To portray myself as antisemitic simply because I add my voice to those who denounce the plight of Palestinians is grotesque,” he said. Englert said in response that he was satisfied there was no evidence of any antisemitism, despite the concerns voiced by five Jewish organisations who claimed the Palme d’Or winner had illustrated both an “obsessive hatred of Israel” and voiced “more than doubtful statements” about the Holocaust. Englert said: “The ULB does not flirt with antisemitism. There is no antisemitism or Holocaust denial by Ken Loach. To remove from him the title of doctor honoris causa would have been paradoxical.” In a BBC interview at the end of September last year, Loach was asked if Holocaust denial, as had reportedly occurred at a fringe Labour party conference that week, was acceptable. Loach responded: “History is for all of us to discuss. All history is our common heritage to discuss and analyse. The founding of the state of Israel, for example, based on ethnic cleansing, is there for us to discuss ... So don’t try to subvert that by false stories of antisemitism.” He later claimed that his comments had been twisted and that his answer and the question had overlapped. “Exaggerated or false charges of antisemitism have coincided with the election of Jeremy Corbyn as leader,” Loach wrote."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"football/2020/oct/30/nobby-stiles-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2020-10-30T18:02:26Z","webTitle":"Nobby Stiles obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/oct/30/nobby-stiles-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2020/oct/30/nobby-stiles-obituary","fields":{"headline":"Nobby Stiles obituary","bodyText":"Of all the players who contributed to England’s World Cup victory in 1966, Nobby Stiles, who has died aged 78 after suffering from prostate cancer and dementia, was the most unlikely of heroes. But, with his socks round his ankles and his false front teeth left in the dressing room, he was a formidable opponent, a robust tackler and an implacable marker, as he showed in a memorable and crucial performance in the semi-final against Portugal, when he comprehensively – and fairly – squeezed the life out of the great Eusébio. Eusébio had been a glittering star of the tournament, a gloriously talented and incisive attacker who had scored four of Portugal’s five goals in the quarter-finals against North Korea. But in the semi-final, Stiles man-marked him into ineffectiveness, enabling England to win 2-1. When Alf Ramsey had instructed him during the pre-match briefing to take Eusébio “out of the game”, Stiles had asked: “Do you mean for life, Alf?” However, his shepherding of the Portuguese star was not only beyond reproach but, in the estimation of his colleague George Cohen, “technically and morally brilliant”. It was a superbly intelligent performance, indicative of the role that Stiles had played throughout that World Cup as a shrewd, unselfish coverer of defenders and an economical user of the ball. He appeared in every game of the 1966 tournament and was part of the backbone of the side. Though he had no man-marking job to perform in the 4-2 win against West Germany in the final, he put in another strong performance, and on the final whistle was the most enthusiastic of celebrators, kissing anyone within close range and essaying a comical jig with the trophy that has passed into folk memory. Though quiet and even shy off the field, Stiles was voluble on it, constantly advising and exhorting his teammates. That he was able to have such an influence for England in the latter stages of the World Cup owed much to the stubborn support of Ramsey, who had stood up for Stiles when, in the group game against France, he had so badly fouled Jacky Simon that there were calls for his exclusion from the team by the Football Association. Ramsey firmly responded that, if Stiles went, then so would he – and Stiles stayed. Two years after England’s World Cup victory, Stiles was at Wembley again to help Manchester United become the first English team to win the European Cup final. Again Eusébio was one of his opponents, playing for Benfica, and again Stiles was detailed to keep him quiet. Although he was not as comprehensively successful in damping down his man the second time around, he still did a perfectly satisfactory job – and United won 4-1. As a result, Stiles is one of only three Englishmen – the others being Bobby Charlton and Ian Callaghan – to have won both a European Cup and a World Cup. At Old Trafford he also took possession of two league championship medals. Born in Collyhurst, Manchester, the son of Charlie, manager of an undertaker’s, and his wife, Kitty, Stiles joined Manchester United straight from school. He had grown up admiring his United predecessor Eddie Colman, a right-half of greater natural gifts, who died in the Munich air disaster of 1958. By that time Stiles had already represented England schoolboys as a right-half, displaying attacking talents that would be somewhat inhibited in his later career. He made his debut for United, in fact, as an inside-forward in the 1960-61 season, playing 26 league matches and scoring twice. When United reached the FA Cup final in 1963, and Stiles had missed just one cup tie besides playing 31 league games, he was, to his deep disappointment, dropped. The following season he was picked for just 17 league games, but fought his way back into the regular side in the 1964-65 season, missing only one league match in that First Division title-winning season. At only 5ft 6in, prematurely balding, with few teeth and severe short-sightedness that required him to wear contact lenses during matches and thick glasses off the field, Stiles was an unusual-looking footballing specimen. But whatever he lacked in classical good looks and physique, he made up for with intelligence and a highly competitive, even intimidating, demeanour. As he did for England, at United he stifled the activity of opposing sides’ key players, won the ball and then gave it to his team’s creative talents, such as Charlton and George Best. That formula once more proved irresistible in the 1966-67 season, when United again won the First Division title, and was decisive in the 1968 European Cup final against Benfica. Injuries restricted Stiles to just nine league games in the 1969-70 season, and in 1971, after he had appeared in 312 league matches in 11 years for Manchester United, the club transferred him to Second Division Middlesbrough for £20,000. By this time his England career was over. Having made his debut against Scotland at Wembley in 1965, he had packed in 19 matches for his country by the time of the 1966 World Cup final, but injuries and the rise of Alan Mullery meant that he played only 10 games thereafter. Although he was in good form in the run-up to the 1970 World Cup finals and was selected for the squad in Mexico, he was sent there as cover rather than as a main string in Ramsey’s bow, and did not feature in any of the matches. In his two seasons as a player at Middlesbrough, Stiles managed 57 league games before moving for a couple of seasons to Preston North End, where he appeared 46 times in Divisions Two and Three as a player-coach under Charlton as manager. He left Preston when Charlton resigned in 1975, but in 1977 returned for a four-year spell as manager, taking the club up from Division Three to Division Two in 1978. When they slipped back again in 1981, he moved to Canada for a three-year period as manager at Vancouver Whitecaps, and in 1985 he succeeded his brother-in-law Johnny Giles as manager at West Bromwich Albion, lasting in the job just four months. Subsequently he returned to Old Trafford as a youth coach, nurturing players such as David Beckham and Paul Scholes, but in later years he moved away from the footballing frontline to become a successful after-dinner speaker. He was made MBE in 2000. In 2010 he decided to auction his memorabilia to raise money for his family; his World Cup winner’s medal was bought by Manchester United for the record sum of £188,200. In 2016 his family revealed that Stiles had been affected by Alzheimer’s disease and vascular dementia since the age of 60, heightening awareness about the possible links between football and degenerative brain disease. He is survived by his wife, Kay, his childhood sweetheart, and their three sons, one of whom, John, was a professional footballer for Leeds United. • Norbert Peter Stiles, footballer, born 18 May 1942; died 30 October 2020"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/apr/27/rail-passengers-pay-price-for-broken-franchising-system-say-mps","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-26T23:01:29Z","webTitle":"Rail passengers pay price for broken franchising system, say MPs","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/apr/27/rail-passengers-pay-price-for-broken-franchising-system-say-mps","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/apr/27/rail-passengers-pay-price-for-broken-franchising-system-say-mps","fields":{"headline":"Rail passengers pay price for broken franchising system, say MPs","bodyText":"The rail franchising system is broken and passengers are paying the price, a cross-party committee of MPs has concluded. A scathing report by MPs on the public accounts committee said the government’s management of two major franchises was “completely inadequate”. The MPs accuse the Department for Transport of “failing to learn the lessons from previous failures” in allowing Stagecoach-Virgin to overbid for the East Coast franchise, which the government expects to terminate imminently, with the operator unable to meet payments. The PAC report also says the department was too ambitious about what could be achieved on the Thameslink, Southern and Great Northern franchise – operated by the Govia joint venture between Go-Ahead and Keolis – overlooking the state of the railway infrastructure and failing to engage with unions. Strikes have continued intermittently for two years on Southern. The MPs suggested the department “chose not to see the perfect storm of an ambitious upgrade programme coupled with plans to increase driver-controlled operation of trains”, leading to passengers “suffering an appalling level of delays and cancellations”. The PAC warned the transport secretary, Chris Grayling, against re-awarding a new deal to the Stagecoach-run Virgin Trains East Coast, saying it was “concerned that the department could terminate its contract … yet still give the operator the opportunity to run the franchise again in the future”. The committee added that the limited number of potential bidders to run train services highlighted what it called “the broken model of franchising”. The PAC chair, Meg Hillier, described the wider Southern franchise as “a multifaceted shambles causing untold misery for passengers”, while she said “wildly inaccurate passenger growth forecasts” had brought down East Coast. A DFT spokesperson said the report was imbalanced and disappointing, adding: “The delay and disruption Southern passengers experienced due to strike action in 2016 was unacceptable but services have improved dramatically and a brand new programme will begin next month bringing further improvements to their journeys. “Our franchising model already puts passengers and taxpayers first and has doubled the number of passengers using trains since privatisation.” However, Labour said the committee had confirmed its view that rail franchising was “on life support”. The shadow transport secretary, Andy McDonald, said: “It’s time Chris Grayling pulled the plug on this discredited and disintegrating system.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"science/2018/may/11/scientists-to-grow-mini-brains-using-neanderthal-dna","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-11T13:42:49Z","webTitle":"Scientists to grow 'mini-brains' using Neanderthal DNA","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/may/11/scientists-to-grow-mini-brains-using-neanderthal-dna","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2018/may/11/scientists-to-grow-mini-brains-using-neanderthal-dna","fields":{"headline":"Scientists to grow 'mini-brains' using Neanderthal DNA","bodyText":"Scientists are preparing to create “miniature brains” that have been genetically engineered to contain Neanderthal DNA, in an unprecedented attempt to understand how humans differ from our closest relatives. In the next few months the small blobs of tissue, known as brain organoids, will be grown from human stem cells that have been edited to contain “Neanderthalised” versions of several genes. The lentil-sized organoids, which are incapable of thoughts or feelings, replicate some of the basic structures of an adult brain. They could demonstrate for the first time if there were meaningful differences between human and Neanderthal brain biology. “Neanderthals are the closest relatives to everyday humans, so if we should define ourselves as a group or a species it is really them that we should compare ourselves to,” said Prof Svante Pääbo, director of the genetics department at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany, where the experiments are being performed. Pääbo previously led the successful international effort to crack the Neanderthal genome, and his lab is now focused on bringing Neanderthal traits back to life in the laboratory through sophisticated gene-editing techniques. The lab has already inserted Neanderthal genes for craniofacial development into mice (heavy-browed rodents are not anticipated), and Neanderthal pain perception genes into frogs’ eggs, which could hint at whether they had a different pain threshold to humans. Now the lab is turning its attention to the brain. “We’re seeing if we can find basic differences in how nerve cells function that may be a basis for why humans seem to be cognitively so special,” said Pääbo. The research comes as the longstanding stereotype of Neanderthals as gormless and thuggish is being rewritten by emerging evidence that they buried their dead, produced cave art and had brains that were larger than our own. In the basement beneath Pääbo’s office, scientists are working to extract DNA – the code of life – from ancient human and animal fossils excavated at sites across the world. The team’s success relies on taking obsessive precautions against contamination: a speck of dust floating in through a window can contain more DNA than the few milligrams of powdered ancient bone under analysis. Researchers shower and don spacesuit-style uniforms before entering rooms kept sterile by UV lights and a sophisticated air filtration system. It was under these stringent working conditions in 2010 that his team reassembled the code of the Neanderthal genome from heavily degraded samples taken from four females who lived in Europe tens of thousands of years ago. The genome revealed Neanderthals interbred with our ancestors – and successfully enough that all non-Africans today carry 1-4% of Neanderthal DNA. And since people acquired slightly different genes, collectively about a third of the Neanderthal genome is still floating around in modern populations. However, there are also genetic dead zones: large stretches of the Neanderthal genome that nobody inherited, possibly because they conferred disadvantages to health, fertility, cognition or physical appearance. “We want to know whether among those things, is there something hiding there that really sets us apart?” Pääbo said. “Is there a biological basis for why modern humans went on to become millions and eventually billions of people, spread across the world and have culture?” It is not certain that the contrasting fates of the two species are linked to differences in cognition, but Pääbo said: “It’s tempting to think that, yes.” The latest work focuses on differences in three genes known to be crucial for brain development. Using the editing technique Crispr, changes have been introduced into human stem cells to make them closer to Neanderthal versions. The stem cells are coaxed using chemical triggers to become neurons, which spontaneously clump together and self-organise into miniature brain-like structures that grow to a few millimetres in diameter. The lack of any sensory input means the internal wiring is haphazard and varies from one blob to the next. “You start the organoid growing and leave it for nine months and see what happens,” said Gray Camp, a group leader at the institute who is overseeing the organoid experiments. “You don’t get a well-formed human brain at all, but you see multiple regions have kind of formed; you can study the synapses and electrical activity and early developmental differences.” The scientists will compare the Neanderthalised organoids and the fully human ones to assess the speed at which the stem cells divide, develop and organise into three-dimensional brain structures and whether the brain cells wire up differently. “A dream result would be that the [genetic] changes make for longer or more branched neuronal outgrowth,” said Pääbo. “One would say it would be a biological basis for why our brain would function differently.” The work won’t reveal which species is “smarter”, but could hint at differences in the ability to plan, socialise and use language. The lab is also looking at how Neanderthal genes that are commonly found in the DNA of people with European and Asian ancestry influence brain development. By growing organoids from cells taken from living people and looking at how the Neanderthal genes switch on and off, the team can see whether a person’s brain development is subtly influenced by their ancient Neanderthal ancestry. “We can regrow your Neanderthal brain,” said Camp. “We can monitor that and resurrect the functionality of those neanderthal genes.” The team are not the first to contemplate resurrecting Neanderthal biology. The Harvard professor George Church previously suggested that a cloned Neanderthal baby could be created if an “adventurous female human” were prepared to act as a surrogate. Such a scenario, Pääbo counters, is not only ethically unpalatable but unachievable with today’s technology, which allows for only a handful of genetic edits at a time rather than the 30,000 required for fully Neanderthal tissue. Pääbo said he finds comments like Church’s frustrating because “then other people like me have to look like the boring, non-visionary guy, saying it’s not possible and think about the ethics.” Do blobs of brain come with their own ethical considerations? “Yes, at some point one can of course ask, when does a developing brain become an individual? But that is far into the future.” Modern humans and Neanderthals split into separate lineages around 400,000 years ago, with our ancestors remaining in Africa and the Neanderthals moving north into Europe. About 60,000 years ago, the archaeological record reveals, there was a mass migration of modern humans out of Africa that brought the two species face-to-face once more. The revelation that Neanderthals interbred with humans and were far more sophisticated than previously thought has led some to suggest the two lineages should be merged into a single species, but Pääbo and others disagree. “Yes, there’s growing evidence that Neanderthals, particularly towards the end of their history, did some form of art,” he said. “But if I’m a little mean, I would say they did some art but it was very modern art because I can’t see what it depicts.” And there is no evidence of Neanderthals having set out to explore the world’s oceans, as humans did at least 100,000 years ago, a feat that perhaps has as much to do with mindset as with being inventive enough to build a boat. “It is very risky to set out into the Pacific and look for something when you don’t know there’s something out there,” Pääbo said. “Neanderthals were reasonable, like other mammals. They didn’t go out into the ocean without seeing anything on the other side. To me, the biggest question in human history is, why did we become this crazy?”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/blog/2018/apr/28/women-faith-football-hijab-fifa-ban","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-28T08:00:10Z","webTitle":"When women were forced to choose between faith and football | Shireen Ahmed","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2018/apr/28/women-faith-football-hijab-fifa-ban","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/blog/2018/apr/28/women-faith-football-hijab-fifa-ban","fields":{"headline":"When women were forced to choose between faith and football","bodyText":"Football is full of incredible histories, many that remain undocumented and unknown. In particular, women’s football history gets left aside. There are efforts by historians and football lovers to educate the public on the incredible contributions of women in football. On International Women’s Day I was at the National Football Museum in Manchester for a women’s football conference to present on football and the hijab to a room of academics and researchers. Although there is much to be celebrated, there is still a sordid past that, as footballers, supporters and writers, we must understand in order to do justice to the beautiful game. There are stories that are hard to tell but must be told. Asmahan Mansour. That name has stayed with me for more than 10 years. Mansour was the Canadian girl at the centre of what would become an exclusionary ruling by Fifa to ban the hijab from the pitch. In 2007 the young footballer from Ontario attempted to wear a headscarf at a tournament and was not permitted to play by the referee. She was told she could remove it and play but her hijab would not be permitted on the pitch. Her team, from the capital, Ottawa, withdrew from the event in the Québécois city of Laval in response. The issue with Mansour went to the Canadian Soccer Association and then to Fifa, which decided to uphold the ban and create a policy around it but exempted head coverings that exposed the neck. Despite the fact there was no empirical data or evidence on file that a hijab could strangle a player or injure an opponent, the equipment regulation concluded it was dangerous. This was the basis under which the referee ejected Mansour. The net result was Mansour did not play. Nor did thousands of girls and women for almost seven years afterwards. Initially Fifa cited “religious symbolism” as a reason for not permitting head coverings. But that was too difficult to enforce considering the multitude of tattoos, signing of the cross and goal celebrations by prominent male footballers that would have had to be monitored and enforced. So it stuck with “health and safety” as a weak shield for its policy. In a 2011 Olympic qualifying match against Jordan, Iran’s women’s team were banned from playing because of their hijabs. They wore hijabs that were supposed to meet Fifa standards. Heartbroken and frustrated, the women left the pitch. Their dreams of Olympic football lay in tatters. Photographs of the sobbing players were plastered over the media. This was not a case of Muslim women being oppressed by their faith, it was a serious case of women being excluded by draconian rules, steeped in gendered Islamophobia and ignorance, that were created by men. Even the young Mansour felt the pain of exclusion when she told CBC News: “I thought it was disappointing because I thought I would actually make a difference but I didn’t.” But football dreams were not over. In came supporters, including Moya Dodd of the Asian Football Confederation, Assmaah Helal, a player and activist, and Prince Ali bin al-Hussein of Jordan, the then vice-president of Fifa and head of the Jordanian Football Association. They spearheaded campaigns and partnered with Right 2 Wear, the United Nations and Fifpro to put pressure on Fifa to approve the hijab. Women came to the rescue with designs and practical solutions for problems created by men; problems that kept thousands of people away from the sport they love. Companies such as Capsters and ResportOn designed sports hijabs with safety recommendations from the International Football Association Board, the decision-making body for the laws of the game. As the research and work continued, Muslim women were effectively sidelined. They were not encouraged to join regional or national teams because their status was unknown. Would they have to choose between faith and football? Why was this a choice that had to be made in the first place? On 1 March 2014, after much discussion, testing and clarification, Jérôme Valcke, Fifa’s then secretary general, announced that religious head coverings (including hijabs, turbans for Sikh men and kippahs for Jewish men) would be permitted on the pitch. The understanding was the headcoverings would meet Ifab medical regulations. Muslim women footballers all over the world – and the respective federations – heaved collective sighs of relief. But only after countless budding footballers lost out. In October 2016, less than two years after the hijab ban was overturned, the Under-17 Women’s World Cup was held in Amman, Jordan. It was the first time the hijab would be permitted, and more importantly welcomed, at a major Fifa tournament. It was also the first Fifa tournament to be hosted in the Middle East. It was an important – yet largely overlooked – moment in football. This victory came after much blood, sweat and toil of advocates and players who refused to give up and believed strongly in their connection and right to play. I tell tales about racialised women who might have been made to stay away from football but persevered with help from allies and guardians of the game. Football is for all of us. Sometimes it just takes women to prove it."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/apr/27/privatisation-forests-forestry-commission-commercial-development","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-27T05:00:37Z","webTitle":"Will we stand by and watch the privatisation of our forests?  | Simon Jenkins","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/27/privatisation-forests-forestry-commission-commercial-development","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/27/privatisation-forests-forestry-commission-commercial-development","fields":{"headline":"Will we stand by and watch the privatisation of our forests?","bodyText":"There is something murky down in the forest. In 2010, the Cameron government was so shocked at the reaction to its planned privatisation of the Forestry Commission that it backed off. It said it had abandoned the whole idea. It lied. It just privatised in secret. Plans have emerged of the commission’s proposals for Mortimer Forest outside Ludlow, an exquisite stretch of woodland in the Welsh Marches. A company called Forest Holidays wants to erect an estate of 70 luxury chalets in the forest. It is, in truth, a scattered luxury hotel, serviced by car parks, toilets, recreation areas and “landscaped lookouts”. The company already has 10 such estates and plans many more, with up to 90 chalets in each. These are not rural communities or compact villages. Forest Holidays was created in the 1960s by the Forestry Commission, which still holds a 14% share in the company. Under a bizarre 2012 “framework agreement”, the company is given the right to develop as many as 30 sites across the forestry estate at any one time, with no eventual limit. It pays the commission a rent per chalet of an average £3,000 a year, and rents out the chalets for up to £4,000 a week, an eye-popping margin. Some of the leases are for a phenomenal 125 years. According to the Sunday Times, it already ranks fourth in Britain among private companies for profits growth. This might all seem small beer, another example of the oleaginous workings of “parastatal” Britain. The country may have less woodland per acre than anywhere in Europe, but it can surely handle a few private estates of “hot tubs and fluffy towels”. As the company said recently, it is as yet developing only an “infinitesimal” share of the commission’s estate. So, what happened last December? A company called Phoenix Equity acquired 42% of Forest Holidays for £110m. This valued the company at an extraordinary £262m. The reason was soon clear when Forest Holidays’ chief executive, Bruce McKendrick, justified the high price on the grounds that “the [forestry] commission has a million hectares of forest, so we’ve got plenty to keep us going for many years to come”. That is equity-speak for “we struck a goldmine”. The Forest Holidays deal, in effect with the government, is extraordinary. The government has granted a private company exclusive access to exploit a public land bank. There will be no competitors, no rival bidders and no limit to its growth. Indeed the company and the commission make planning applications jointly, as if they were one and the same. The agreement also promises that, provided the sites are not in a nature reserve or protected area, they cannot be opposed. Should anyone object, such as an uppity planner, the Forestry Commission has “a duty to help bypass regulations”. With 14%, it has more than duty – it has a clear incentive. This means that a body that exists to maintain Britain’s forests is party not just to their privatisation but to their complete exploitation – and for as long as 125 years. It is small wonder this whole saga has been shrouded in secrecy. The Mortimer Forest plan has been with Hereford council for three years, only seeing the light of day in February. Doubtless because of the privatisation row, the 2012 deal stipulated that the commission commit itself to secrecy. It would ensure “that the media and the public are not aware of new development site selection”. For a public body explicitly to promise to conceal evidence of its dereliction of duty is amazing. A spokesman for the Mortimer campaigners, Colin Richards, is a passionate defender of forest wildness. To him, the chalet development will destroy the tranquillity of what is, in this case, not even a particularly large forest. As a result of the development, he says: “Wildlife habitat on publicly owned land will be destroyed in favour of a busy private holiday park. The whole project is a wolf in sheep’s clothing.” The Forestry Commission denies that it is engaged in privatisation, despite actually holding shares in the relevant private company. It argues that “the forests are still publicly owned, and the Forestry Commission retains control of what can happen on the land through the business framework agreement”. But the terms of this agreement are biased in the company’s favour, and they indicate a blatant conflict of interest. It is like London Zoo going into taxidermy. I love forests. I have no objection in principle to their privatisation – a tree is a tree – provided it is subject to objective planning and impartial regulation. There is none of that here. Chalet parks in public forests offend every dictate of rural planning. They are space-hungry, traffic-generating and energy-inefficient. Today, buildings (and jobs) should be concentrated on and around existing settlements, not left to sprawl wherever the money is good. Worst of all, these parks derive their private value by diminishing the public value of where they are located. The future of the British countryside is in the balance. Traditional town and country planning is in abeyance, following David Cameron’s dismantling of structure planning. Whitehall now forces through almost any development application, irrespective of quality or setting. No village or town is safe from a Persimmon 300-unit volume executive estate. There is no requirement to respect local character, once elementary planning practice. The Forestry Commission used to be the despoiler of Britain’s uplands, with its conifer acres, monocultures and acid rivers. It has lately improved, especially in its commitment to biodiversity and public recreation. Yet the Forest Holidays deal puts its entire estate into play. It is selling off a public land bank already worth £262m, yet hardly a penny (other than 14%) is coming to the taxpayer. This is pure banana republic. Forest Holidays describes its chalets, as they scatter through Britain’s woodlands, as “sheer decadence”. That says it all. • Simon Jenkins is a Guardian columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"us-news/live/2018/apr/26/americas-first-memorial-to-lynching-victims-opens-in-alabama-live-updates","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-26T22:30:51Z","webTitle":"America's first memorial to victims of lynching opens in Alabama – live updates","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2018/apr/26/americas-first-memorial-to-lynching-victims-opens-in-alabama-live-updates","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/live/2018/apr/26/americas-first-memorial-to-lynching-victims-opens-in-alabama-live-updates","fields":{"headline":"America's first memorial to victims of lynching opens in Alabama – live updates","bodyText":"The live blog will close shortly.

DuVernay said she was having a hard time finding the voice of the five teenagers who were wrongfully convicted of the rape of a Central Park jogger in 1989. The trouble comes, she said, from the difficulty finding any material from the time that told the story from the teenager’s perspective. “I pored through every trial transcript, I’ve read everything about that case, and they have no voice. Even the voice they were given – in their forced confessions – was not their own voice. Every single thing, even their voice in the confession, is not their own. “It’s flipped inside out. Every day I feel I’m wrestling with the story to try and turn it around, make it their story.” As DuVernay was speaking, she pointed to the audience and invited a man in the front row to stand up. When Yusef Salaam rose he got a standing ovation. Salaam served more than five years in prison for a crime that he didn’t commit, having been released in 2002 along with the others of the Central Park Five. Remarkably, no-one mentioned Donald Trump who spent a reported $85,000 to buy whole pages in New York newspapers calling for the five teenagers to be executed. ‘To go to that memorial is transforming’ We got a chance to interview Gloria Steinem. Despite battling laryngitis, the feminist icon spoke with us about the power of visiting the memorial and the fight for racial justice within the women’s rights movement. “We have this horrendous history of slavery and lynchings ... and we don’t learn this in school,” she said. “Germany for instance does a much better job than we do of acknowledging what happened. If you don’t, it remains like a kind of magnet that influences the future.” Steinem continued, “I know there are people who say, ‘Why bring this up? Why bring up all this pain?’ But I think you have to, otherwise it remains a magnet that dictates the future ...” She noted that some Native Americans say “it takes four generations to heal one act of violence”, adding that she hopes the memorial and museum help with that healing. “The memorial has a huge impact, because you see the names of real people, real places, what happened ... I thought I knew, actually. I’ve read all about this. I thought I knew. I think no matter how much you think you know, to go to that memorial is transforming.” She also shared a story of her most powerful experience at the monument – meeting a man who had been arrested as a teenager for a crime he did not commit, who was incarcerated for decades as a result. “He was a man of such depth and such profound gentleness, it both made me sad because of the years of life he lost, and also gave me faith in human beings. In spite of all the ways he had been treated and diminished, he enlarged me just by talking.” One of the most common themes this week in Montgomery is just how little most Americans really know about the true scale and incomprehensible brutality of lynching. For a long time that was even true for Michelle Duster, the great granddaughter of Ida B Wells-Barnett, the nation’s most tireless and celebrated anti-lynching advocate. “As a young child I was shielded from exactly the extent of the violence that she lived through and chronicled,” Duster told the Guardian. “It wasn’t really until I was a full-grown adult and decided to do more digging on my own that I became aware of the full extent of just how barbaric the lynchings were.” Wells-Barnett criss-crossed the south in the late nineteenth century collecting accounts of lynchings and became a prolific publisher of editorial pamphlets on the subject that debunked mythology and put the full outrage of the phenomenon on display. This was even after mobs had destroyed her business and chased her out of her home in Memphis, Tennessee for her writing. Duster said even with knowing how important her great grandmother’s work on lynching was, she was still surprised by just how large her presence looms in the museum, with multiple exhibits dedicated to Wells-Barnett. “I’m so happy to see that her impact, the contribution that she made to this country is getting told by as many people as possible, because I think she should be a household name,” said Duster, who is a professor of business writing at Columbia College in Chicago. “People need to know who she was and she’s not just African-American history, she is American history. “I think anybody who knows her story, would be inspired by what she did.” Sam Levin is at the memorial, and took more pictures of the row of plaques outlining the many shocking reasons black Americans were lynched. From “frightening a white girl” to “standing around” in a white neighborhood to “vagrancy”, here’s a Twitter thread with a small handful of the horrific stories. As the museum notes with a message in large lettering, thousands of murders were likely never recorded and will not be remembered: “Thousands of African Americans are unknown victims of racial terror lynchings whose deaths cannot be documented, many whose names will never be known.” The moderator in this afternoon’s debate at the EJI summit has just asked the feminist writer Gloria Steinem and civil rights and anti-poverty activist Marian Wright Edelman to tell us what they would say to someone who, in this hyper-partisan age, did not agree with them. Steinem framed her answer in terms of human interactions. The key was to find what she called the “path to empathy. It starts with talking and telling our stories. Listening to each other’s stories is the basis of everything, as through that we realize we are not alone.” Wright Edelman said that talking was fine, but action was all important. The Founder of the Children’s Defense Fund said that basic needs had to be met: “Children should not be dying from guns, there shouldn’t be unequal education, we should organize and vote. This is movement time. Don’t come here and celebrate this museum without thinking that there are even greater levels of harm, in some ways, happening today.” ‘My family came from slaves’ Brittany Willie, 19, said she didn’t know much about the death of James Nance, her grandmother’s grandfather whose name is honored at the new lynching memorial in Montgomery. “It’s real. This is my family,” she said as she touched Nance’s name, located on a block recognizing victims from Madison county, Alabama. “My family came from slaves.” Willie, from Huntsville, said she didn’t know how or why her great-great grandfather was killed, but that she believed he was a leader in his community: “I would’ve never thought I would come here and see his name ... It’s just astonishing.” ‘It’s emotionally overwhelming’ She added, “I really feel overwhelmed, mainly because of the fact that most of these people were innocent. They didn’t do anything. They were just minding their business ... For so long, society has put a shadow over these things. This museum is long overdue.” Chris Mosley, a 49-year-old from Birmingham, said he felt mixed emotions at the memorial: Joanna Millstein, a 23-year-old from New York, said the memorial felt like “the funeral of thousands”, adding, “It feels like you’re paying tribute and homage to thousands of people all at once, so it’s really kind of emotionally overwhelming.” I’m now at the National Memorial for Peace and Justice for its grand opening, where hundreds of visitors are exploring the powerful monument to thousands of lynching victims. Here are some of their reflections on site. Wretha Hudson, a 73-year-old Montgomery resident, said, “I hope it’s an eye opener, because a lot of people want us to forget about what’s happened, but that’s forgetting our ancestors ... How can you forget your roots?” Janae Peters, a 29-year-old teacher from Birmingham, came with a few of her students: “Honestly, it was heavy. ... But to see this, it begins the healing process.” Victoria Dunn and Corey Sledge, a couple from Montgomery, said they hoped the city would embrace this site. “This is something our children need to know, so they can understand the struggle,” Dunn said. Jesse Jackson: ‘lynching penetrates the consciousness’ Jesse Jackson has had more personal experience of racial violence than most people, having participated in the Selma to Montgomery civil rights marches and having been present at the assassination of Martin Luther King 50 years ago. He also grew up in Greenville, South Carolina, under the shadow of lynching. Jackson is today back in Montgomery for the opening of the new museum and memorial, and he’s just shared with the Guardian his memories of lynching in his childhood. He recalled in particular the lynching of Willie Earle in Greenville in 1947 when Jackson was just six years old. “They took him out of jail, stabbed him repeatedly, blew his brains out, left him in the gutter dead. Jackson spoke movingly about the impact of that terrible event. “Unlike regular murders, lynching penetrates the consciousness,” he said. “They go a long way to effecting one’s psyche. One person is killed, but the whole community is lynched psychologically.” The civil rights firebrand said that the new National Memorial for Peace and Justice, that commemorates the more than 4,000 black people who were lynched, is unlike anything in the world. But he added that it would be a long, hard road to get it recognized among the white descendants of lynchers. “For there to be reconciliation, both sides must be willing to reconcile. For there to be healing, you have to take the glass out of the wound,” he said. Last week Jackson was in South Africa for the funeral of Winnie Mandela, and that, he suggested, gave a sense of the challenge America now faces. “There were 60,000 in the stadium for Winnie’s funeral, and maybe 100 whites. So you speak of reconciliation. There’s unfinished work to be done.” Below are some striking statistics about racial violence in America, courtesy of the Legacy Museum’s powerful exhibits on slavery, lynchings and the US prison system. -12m kidnapped into the slave trade -More than 4,000 killed in racial terror lynchings -9m African Americans terrorized by the threat of lynching violence -8m Americans under criminal control -Thousands currently in prison who wrongly convicted, according to EJI estimates -More than 70m Americans have arrest records -In 1980, $6bn was spent on prisons and jails, skyrocketing to $80bnlast year -The number of women sent to prison has increased by 646% in the last 25 years In a passage reminiscent of late-career Martin Luther King, Rev Barber zeroed in on poverty as a force as destructive as that of lynching. “Upwards of 200,000 people die every year from low-wealth,” Barber said. “Yes we should be horrified that 5,000 people were lynched from the 1860s to the 1940s, but today 250,000 die from low wealth, that’s more than die from heart attacks, strokes and cancer. “Yes we should be in the street in America when one or two or three unarmed black men are killed in the street by police… But if we should be in the streets over [that], surely if 250,00 are dying we should call that a modern day political lynching.” ‘I dare you’!’ Rev Barber invites the crowd up and in a full volume preacher’s oratory, leads the following call and response: If they kept fighting In the face of lynch mobs I dare you to be scared of Trump! I dare you to be afraid of modern day white nationalists! They must not know who we are! We are the sons and daughters of those that kept on! Rev William Barber, a southerner, on the prevalence of lynching here: “This was done even in the bible belt, where so many people put their hands on the bible and don’t know what’s in it.” Barber chastised what he called “my so called Christian evangelicals who say so much about what god says so little, and so little about what god said so much... “In proverbs it says these are six things that god hates, seven that are an abomination.” None of them are about or abortion or being gay, Barber noted. But it does say that god hates “looking down on people and a lying tongue.” Barber went on: “Jesus was lynched. Jesus was an innocent victim of mob hysteria. Both the cross and the lynching tree were symbols of terror.” For readers who want to understand how pervasive lynchings were until the 1950s, Jamiles Lartey wrote an in-depth explainer. He notes that lynchings were photographed to be turned into postcards, and body parts were even used as souvenirs. Read the entire explainer here. After opening with a prayer, Rev Barber has taken the stage here at the summit in Montgomery. “There’s a certain solumness standing here today... There’s a quietness in my spirit as i think about those containers of dirt,” Barber said, referencing the jars of earth from lynching sites that have been collected and displayed at the museum. “I want to talk about memorializing those who were lynched then, and building a movement against lynching now.” From slavery to high tech alternatives to incarceration Michelle Alexander, author of The New Jim Crow, the 2010 book that sparked a huge nationwide debate about mass incarceration of African Americans and how it has become the modern equivalent of Southern segregation, has just given us a fascinating and scary warning about the future. She told the Guardian that she fears there is such a desire for a reduction in the US prison population – 2.3m people are currently behind bars – that if we aren’t careful it could lead to a whole new generation of even worse treatment. In particular, she’s worried about high-tech so-called “alternatives” to prison that sound pretty awful. They include GPS monitoring that Alexander said could expand into permanent surveillance of individuals or communities lasting decades, and home surveillance systems where people are kept prison by being forever watched. “So many private prison companies are getting into the business of developing high-tech alternatives to incarceration, so that the same communities that were once locked in literal cages and cycling in and out of giant cement buildings will instead be subject to perpetual high-tech surveillance and control,” she said. Alexander left us with an exhortation: “I hope we keep our eye on the ball and remember the goal isn’t simply to close prisons but to put an end to the mindset that made prisons and the need for control necessary in the first place.” Still at the legacy museum, Felicia Ishino, 40, came from Seattle with her daughter Isis Ishino-Amen, 20. Isis said she was shocked to learn the details of how slaves were sold: “They treated them like livestock, like animals ... To describe people that way, my ancestors that way, it made me sad and horrified ... It’s a lot to take in.” Eric Alexander, 41, said he was incarcerated for more than 10 years and that it was powerful to see the injustices of the prison system on display. He said he was particularly moved by the story of one prisoner who nearly died behind bars: “To hear his testimony, it made me cry, to hear he almost lost his life.” Alexander said he was also stunned by the historic newspaper coverage of lynchings: “I didn’t realize people were that brazen. That’s what touched me the most – the inhumanity of it all.” A few pictures of the memorial. Its design was partly inspired by the Holocaust Memorial in Berlin, and the Apartheid Museum in Johannesburg. Former vice president Al Gore made an appearance at the summit. He will be taking part in a session tomorrow focusing on environmental justice. The second session at the Summit will see Reverend Dr William Barber address the audience. Rev Barber is the founder of the Poor People’s Campaign, itself influenced from the work of Martin Luther King. It is the first organised campaign of civil disobedience in the Donald Trump era, aiming to “bring moral revival across the US”. Our reporter Oliver Laughland profiled Rev Barber here: “We have to remember that the civil rights movement did not just end,” says Barber before the evening service. “It was assassinated by killing the leaders, it was assassinated through division. Throughout our trips, what we’re finding is there is still a need for that coalition that Dr King talked about in ’68 in coming together to address the evils of racism, militarism, systemic poverty and ecological devastation.” Still at the Legacy museum, I talked to Lonnell Williams, 49, from Atlanta, who said it was inspiring to realize how much black Americans have overcome: “African Americans are still thriving in this country, despite relentless oppression. When you walk out of something like that, you feel like there’s nothing to fear.” He said he has been waiting a long time for this museum to open and that he wanted to be there on the first day: “It’s very, very important to me to occupy these spaces ... It was powerful, and it was empowering.” Danielle McCoy, a 41-year-old lawyer from Washington DC, said, “It made me very proud, because I’ve never seen the story described in such a succinct and coherent way.” She said she felt inspired by the experience: “It motivated me to do more. Martin Luther King Jr was in his 20s when he was doing this work. It made me think, what am I doing? Am I creating enough change? Am I pushing the needle far enough? ... It invigorated me.” The Legacy Museum, which chronicles slavery, lynching, segregation and mass incarceration, opened to packed crowds of visitors from across the US this morning. Inside are striking images, videos and stories of racial violence, including newspaper clippings advertising lynchings and interactive footage of men and women behind bars. Some visitors were moved to tears in the first few hours of its public launch. Below are some reactions from the first group of attendees. Tao Finklea, a 30-year-old from Vredenburgh, Alabama, said he never imagined his home state would host a museum like this: “This is an awakening for the state. And this is a wake-up call for the south ... I hope this becomes an experience of shared pain.” Glenda Lingo, a 68-year-old visitor from Nashville, said the museum was “long overdue”, adding, “It’s the history we’ve tried to hide for so many years. There’s no denying it anymore ... This has to start being in our history books. It’s the atrocities of white people in America ... I hope people are forced to see the truth.” Michelle Alexander on the idea of the “resistance” in the Trump era: “I have some difficulty with us framing ourselves as part of a resistance because as I see it, Trump and company are the resistance. There is a new America struggling to be born as part of that river of activism from the days of abolition on down and it’s beautiful to see it blooming in so many ways,” referencing struggles for LGBT rights, Dreamers, The movement for black lives, and protests at Standing Rock.” “Trump is the resistance. They see this new America being born and they say no, let’s go back.” Stay tuned for the second panel of the day at the summit. Still at the summit, Sherrilyn Ifill brought up the recent video of a black woman’s arrest at an Alabama Waffle House restaurant in a discussion on the connection between lynching and the “assault on the dignity of black women”. “When I saw their indifference to her nakedness ... it reminded me of [Mississippi civil rights leader] Fannie Lou Hammer and her account of being beaten and how she tried to keep her dress down. This assault on the dignity of black woman should not be dismissed either. When we talk about lynching we’re talking about people who were killed but assaults, and assaults on dignity were a key part of the way that black were and are engaged around white supremacy.” “It is part of a connected narrative on who black women are in our society... and how white supremacy must dominate black women: Must dominate their voices. Must dominate their freedom. Must insist that they do not carry within them the kind of compassion and love and tenderness this has been associated with white women.” The first panel of the day in Montgomery features: - Jelani Cobb, New Yorker columnist and Columbia Journalism professor - Michelle Alexander, author of The New Jim Crow - Sherrilyn Ifill, president &amp; director-counsel of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund Alexander opened by discussing idea that the museum is part of a movement to create a new kind of America: “Beyond truth, beyond reconciliation ... Part of what is happening here is the birth of a new nation. We are at a time in our history when confederate statues are coming down and new museums are coming up. This isn’t just the work of creating a more perfect union because our nation was never perfect. It isn’t about just improving this nation, this is the work of birthing a new nation.” The three went on to discuss the connections between lynching and the modern criminal justice system. “Is it too much to say that lynching is foundational to the relationship of African Americans and criminal justice?” Cobb asked. “No”, Ifill said confidently. “It was a fundamental breakdown in the criminal justice system … There’s a story to be told the role that local prosecutors play in refusing to seriously try and prosecute the lynchers even though everyone knew who they were.” The summit is opening with its first session, a discussion between journalist Michelle Alexander and academic Sherrilyn Ifill chaired by journalist Jelani Cobb. Karen Branan is one of the only white journalist in America who has investigated her own family’s past and their involvement in lynchings. In an essay she wrote for The Guardian, she explains what pushed her to undergo this years-long quest: What is your most unforgettable memory? I asked my 90-year-old grandmother, the sheriff’s widow. “The hanging,” she replied without pause. She told me of a woman and some men “hanged” in the open, downtown, “for a murder”. She was 17 at the time, living in Hamilton, Georgia. I thought she was talking about white people found guilty under law, so I let it be. Something in me was not yet ready to descend that deep staircase into my grandparents’ and the nation’s bloody basement. Two years later, in 1986, I learned I was to be the grandmother of a racially mixed grandchild and I, who had worked and written for years about racial justice, suddenly found myself keeping her a secret from my family in Georgia for fear of their racist reaction. Read the entire piece here. John Legend is at the Summit. In a series of tweets, he made the case of why the opening of this memorial is such a groundbreaking event, to this day. At the National Memorial for Peace and Justice, inscriptions explain why people would be lynched by white mobs. The crimes” committed were often breathtakingly minor. Robert Mallard, for example, was lynched for daring to vote. Elizabeth Lawrence was lynched for reprimanding children. Jesse Thornton did not give the “right” title to a police officer. He was lynched for that. Henry Patterson asked a white woman for a drink of water. At the top of a grassy Alabama hill, set against the open sky, more than 800 steel cylinders hang from roof beams. Each represents an American county and carries the names of those brutally killed there by lynching. This is America’s first memorial to lynching – a reign of racial terror that shapes race relations today. The memorial and its companion museum, opened by the Equal Justice Initiative, aim to pay homage to the 4,400 men and women killed by savage extrajudicial mobs up until the 1950s. But it also wants visitors to reflect on this past and the insidious legacy of racism, from slavery to today’s overwhelming mass incarceration of young black men. Over the next two days, the Guardian is offering special coverage of the monument’s historic opening. Five members of our staff have travelled to Montgomery to cover the event on the ground, with live reports and interviews with the team behind the monument."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2018/may/06/admissions-henry-marsh-mind-on-fire-arnold-thomas-fanning-american-histories-john-edgar-wideman","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-06T09:00:16Z","webTitle":"In brief: Admissions; Mind on Fire; American Histories – reviews","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/may/06/admissions-henry-marsh-mind-on-fire-arnold-thomas-fanning-american-histories-john-edgar-wideman","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/may/06/admissions-henry-marsh-mind-on-fire-arnold-thomas-fanning-american-histories-john-edgar-wideman","fields":{"headline":"In brief: Admissions; Mind on Fire; American Histories – reviews","bodyText":"Admissions: A Life in Brain Surgery Henry Marsh Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson, £8.99, pp271 (paperback) The follow-up to his first, sensational memoir, Do No Harm, this second instalment of life on the frontlines of brain surgery sees the neurosurgeon retiring from the NHS and leaving Britain to work in hospitals in Nepal and Ukraine under difficult conditions. His stories include the heartbreaking case of a mother who kills herself after her baby dies, but there are happy endings too. Marsh shuttles back and forth, from his early days as a medical student to the last chapter, where he reflects on his own beliefs about mortality. Despite the human suffering, it is all heroic, strangely uplifting stuff. Mind on Fire: A Memoir of Madness and Recovery Arnold Thomas Fanning Penguin Ireland, £14.99, pp275 Arnold Thomas Fanning is a respected Irish playwright, but for a period of his life he was homeless, living on the park benches and street corners of London, suffering from acute episodes of depression and mania. The first major bout came after his mother died of cancer when he was 20, and returned with a vengeance in his mid-20s, leaving him hospitalised. This is an extraordinary memoir about how it feels to be depressed, delusional, desperate – Fanning dramatises how he felt in the midst of mental turmoil rather than reflecting back in wellness. An arresting book that tells us as much about how we treat mentally ill people in Britain and Ireland as about how much of an “anti-life” depression can feel from the inside. American Histories John Edgar Wideman Canongate, £15.99, pp226 John Edgar Wideman begins this collection of short stories with an uncompromising letter to the president, written on behalf of black America, telling him that “slavery as a social condition did not disappear” with its abolition. Skin colour, he states, “continues to separate some of us”. Wideman is a writer who excels at dramatising African American sensibilities and this collection typically addresses issues of race, injustice and inequality with power and potency. Crystallised moments of experience carry entire worlds in stories such as Maps and Ledgers, in which a black school teacher is told that his father has committed murdered a man, and Dark Matter, which recounts conversations diners have eating out, from the whimsical to the political. This is published alongside Wideman’s earlier novels and is a gem for anyone yet to discover his work.

He suggests high-quality public art or a “tolerant and questioning” museum of the history of the British Isles. But what about street names? Instead of countless Acacia Avenues and roads named unimaginatively after British towns and regions, we should follow the widespread practice on the continent where streets, squares, even underground stations, commemorate poets, civil rights campaigners, and victims of repression, as well as past national leaders and military commanders. To take just three examples that immediately come to mind: Brussels has an Avenue Winston Churchill, a Paris Métro station on the Champs-Élysées is named Franklin D Roosevelt, and the Quay of the Exiled Spaniard overlooks the River Garonne in Toulouse. In Britain, individuals are commemorated, begrudgingly it seems, here and there. In Haringey, north London, there is a Nelson Mandela Close, almost hidden away, almost apologetically.

As part of the Arctic Dispatches series, reporting from Alaska, Oliver Milman asked whether the catastrophic melting of Arctic ice could be reversed using an unlikely substance – sand. It’s a compelling read that explores unusual ways technology and creative thinking could be employed to slow the effects of climate change. Our only strategy at present seems to be to tell people to stop burning fossil fuels. It’s a good idea, but it is going to need a lot more than that to stop the Arctic’s sea ice from disappearing. Steven Desch, lead physicist Last week it was announced that the British government would consider a ban on cotton buds, plastic drinking straws and other single-use plastics, following the success of the 5p plastic bag charge. But compared to the plastic bag ban introduced in Kenya last year – which threatens up to four years’ imprisonment and fines of up to $40,000 (£31,000) for anyone producing, selling or even carrying a plastic bag – Britain’s actions look like child’s play. Jonathan Watts has been in Nairobi and writes about the impact of the Kenyan ban eight months after it was introduced. Winners of the Goldman environmental prize were announced this week, celebrating six remarkable success stories – five of them driven by women – of individuals or groups who have taken on powerful vested interests. Among the winners were Makoma Lekalakala and Liz McDaid, who took on Jacob Zuma and Vladmir Putin in a legal challenge over nuclear power and won, and Claire Nouvian, a journalist turned activist who, inspired by the vampire squid, is fighting for less destructive fishing practices.

Among their successes so far: getting a library and bus stop in their community. What we heard One of the side effects of the introduction of the plastic bag is that it killed off centuries-old crafts all over the world. When I was growing up in Somaliland, every mother (or servant, for the rich) took these beautiful baskets made of wicker-like material to markets every morning. The baskets were reusable and handwoven exclusively by women who made a decent living from their craft. And then one-time-use plastic came. The art of basket-weaving died off. I don’t think there is a single skilled basket-weaver left in Somaliland today. SomlanderBrit, commenting below the line on our Kenyan plastic bag story Where was the upside?

Failure to involve the local third sector means that emerging “devo” practices risk missing the opportunity to draw on the sector’s reach into communities and to make new structures fully representative. The warning comes in response to the third annual survey by Localgiving, the leading UK network for local charities and community groups. Of respondents in areas of England where devo has begun, such as Greater Manchester and the west of England, 5% said they could recall being consulted about the process. Among all 686 respondents, 27% thought the impact of devo would be positive and 17% that it would be negative, but the majority were unsure or believed it would have no significant impact. There were sharp differences in attitudes around the UK. Only 25% of English respondents thought the impact would be positive, rising to 35% in Wales and 56% in Scotland, where no one regarded it as negative. Chris Dormer, head of business development at Localgiving, said at the launch of the survey report that it was “crazy” for grassroots groups to be excluded from devo planning “when you think these are organisations helping so many beneficiaries, working close to the ground, having such knowledge”. Paul Streets, chief executive of Lloyds Bank Foundation, which supports hundreds of local charities across England and Wales, said the findings confirmed his “pretty bleak” view of the way devo was developing in pioneer English areas. The engagement of local groups in constructing Manchester’s recent homelessness strategy had been one encouraging sign, Streets conceded. But more usually charities were struggling to get their voices heard, especially if there was no effective local council for voluntary service or other umbrella organisation. “Even then, while an umbrella body can be really good, it’s not as good as the rich, bottom-up conversation you really need,” Streets said. Vicky Morgan, head of business development at Circle Collective, a London-based charity and social enterprise working with young people facing barriers to employment, said it was tough for leaders of small charities to find the time to lobby for involvement or to make the links that were needed. Corporate supporters could play a valuable role in helping local charities make their case, Morgan said. But while some businesses, like Sage Foundation, which sponsored the Localgiving report, did lend appropriate expertise, others had a limited view of corporate social responsibility and staff volunteering. The chief executive of one small charity present at the launch recalled a company having sent “20 people for a day to paint our front door”. The Localgiving survey, carried out last year, found that pressures on local charities continued to grow as a result of austerity. Almost four in five (78%) reported a rise in demand for their services over the previous 12 months and 48% said they had been forced to dip into their reserves. Fewer than half – 47% – said they were confident of staying afloat for five years. For the first time, Localgiving estimated the financial value of volunteers in the local voluntary sector, putting it between £7.5bn and £10.5bn a year – a range it describes as “relatively conservative” because it is calculated by pricing hours volunteered at the minimum wage, not the average.

This season has offered only three new American plays (three and a half if John Lithgow’s storytelling earns a partial credit), serious and not. They’ve all closed. But Broadway is still a place for revivals, especially if those revivals are star-spangled and scheduled for a limited run, which explains why Denzel Washington has poured himself into a flash, droopy suit and loped on to the ramshackle set of Eugene O’Neill’s epic downer, The Iceman Cometh. Written at the end of his life, The Iceman Cometh was a bleak reprieve from the even bleaker world of Long Day’s Journey into Night. The play sent O’Neill spiraling back to his days at Jimmy the Priest’s, the seaport saloon where he’d tried to kill himself in an upstairs room. With his typically on-the-nose irony, O’Neill renamed the place Harry Hope’s and populated it with a gang of sloppy no-hopers, all of them clinging to illusions – what O’Neill called pipe dreams – of what their lives could be once they put down the bottle. When the lights rise – the lighting gets sillier, but the first scene has a dyspeptic Edward Hopper gleam – it’s the end of the night or early in the morning and most of the mob has passed out in their chairs. (Later in the evening you can see a few people in the audience repeating the trick.) They’re resting before two highly anticipated events – the celebration of saloon owner Harry’s birthday (Harry is played here by Colm Meaney) and the arrival of Hickey (Washington), the charismatic salesman who always stands them all to a drink, what Michael Potts’s Joe calls “cyanide cut with carbolic acid to give it a mellow flavor”. But when Hickey arrives, he has horrifying news – he’s on the wagon. What’s more, he’s had an epiphany. He has managed to rid himself of his own pipe dreams and he makes it his mission to convert the rest of the bar to his faith, encouraging them to follow through on their own dreams – to get married, to get sober, to get a job – so that they can let those dreams die, waking to a new reality. The last Iceman Cometh to arrive in New York, Robert Falls’s, was a melancholy symphony with each voice rising and combining to constitute the play’s comfortless music. That’s not present in Wolfe’s production, a series of solos, many of them from the horn section. Cuts have been made to the play – it runs nearly four hours, an hour less than other productions – and maybe this has harmed the cohesion, the lived-in-ness. One experiences less a world and more a room full of actors, mostly good ones, each waiting for a chance to monologue. The big monologue belongs to Washington’s Hickey – it’s a doozy about the life and death of his wife. For most of it, Washington is playing Washington, letting his good looks and irrepressible charm do most of the character work, though the play’s most exciting moments are when he lets that charm falter (something he’s also been exploring in his recent film work, too) showing something uglier and more ravaged underneath. Hickey’s terror when he suspects he may have his new religion all wrong is one of the few moments of the play that one sees rather than feels. The play is a difficult one. It’s a roughly mixed cocktail of poetry, psychodrama and bombast that’s only rarely wise to itself. But like O’Neill’s best works it has a power that outpaces the scenes and the lines. Here, the punches are sometimes packed and sometimes pulled. It’s a drink that won’t knock you out."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"sport/2018/apr/26/iaaf-doctor-calls-for-intersex-category-athletics-caster-semenya","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-26T14:47:52Z","webTitle":"IAAF doctor predicts intersex category in athletics within five to 10 years","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/apr/26/iaaf-doctor-calls-for-intersex-category-athletics-caster-semenya","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/apr/26/iaaf-doctor-calls-for-intersex-category-athletics-caster-semenya","fields":{"headline":"IAAF doctor predicts intersex category in athletics within five to 10 years","bodyText":"A leading scientist at international athletics’ governing body has said he is in favour of a third category for intersex athletes and that it could happen within five years – although he admitted public opinion will have to shift first. Dr Stéphane Bermon, who heads the IAAF’s health and science department, told the Guardian that while he was speaking in a personal capacity he had the “feeling some day it will happen, and probably in five or 10 years”. However, Bermon said: “My feeling is also the public is not ready for this. We don’t want to stigmatise athletes. We also have to take into account religious and cultural sensitivities. So basically I am in favour but there needs [to be] some changes in public opinion.” Bermon’s comments came on the day the IAAF published new rules that will require women with high testosterone levels to take a pill to lower it below five nanomoles per litre if they want to compete internationally at distances ranging from 400m to a mile. Females who do not abide by the rules, which come into force on 1 November, will still be eligible to compete in non-international competitions or in the male classification. The policy has already proved controversial, with some feeling it unfairly targets Caster Semenya, the two-time 800m Olympic champion who underwent gender testing in 2009. The South African appeared to express her displeasure by tweeting: “I am 97% sure you don’t like me but I’m 100% sure I don’t care.” However Bermon insists the issue was more prevalent than is realised. “We have a lot of athletes with this kind of condition. It is not just the one or two people you hear about in the media. In elite female athletics the number of intersex athletes is 140 times more than what you might find in the normal female population.” Nevertheless it remains a difficult and sensitive issue, and Semenya has born the brunt of it since she burst on to the world stage as a shy 18-year-old by winning the 800m at the 2009 world championships. That led to gender tests that were never made public but were alleged, according to Australia’s Daily Telegraph, to show she had no womb or ovaries but had internal testes. In 2011 the IAAF introduced a testosterone limit and Semenya was not quite the same athlete. She was beaten by Mariya Savinova at that year’s world championships and at London 2012, although she was later upgraded to gold medals after the Russian was convicted of doping. The IAAF was accused of violating Semenya’s human rights, gross insensitivity and even racism. It insisted it was merely trying to ensure women with higher testosterone do not have an unfair advantage. Arguments flared, subsided and flared again; Semenya mostly suffered in silence. However in 2015 the court of arbitration for sport suspended the IAAF’s rules on hyperandrogenism following a legal challenge by the Indian sprinter Dutee Chand, which meant Semenya was free to race without medication. She has been unstoppable ever since. Yet her situation appears likely to change again. When Cas suspended the hyperandrogenism rules it asked the IAAF to come up with evidence to show that high testosterone does make a significant difference to performance. The IAAF believes it has done that following research from Bermon, who analysed blood samples from male and female athletes at the 2011 and 2013 world championships. When he examined women with very high testosterone in 2011, who subsequently took hormone-suppressing treatment, he found their performance decreased by 5.7% on average in 2013. Sebastian Coe, the president of the IAAF, said the new rules are solely about ensuring equal conditions for all athletes. “Like many other sports, we choose to have two classifications – men’s events and women’s events. We need to be clear about the competition criteria for these categories. Our evidence and data show that testosterone, either naturally produced or artificially inserted into the body, provides significant performance advantages in female athletes.” Bermon rejected the suggestion the policy is unfair because it targets women born with natural advantages – not unlike those enjoyed by Usain Bolt by being tall and having fast-twitch muscle fibres. “Historically the reason why we have separate male and female categories is that otherwise females would never win any medals,” Bermon added. “Testosterone is the most important factor in explaining the difference. We are talking about females competing with levels similar to males. Very often it is more than 20 or 25nmol/L. So it is very high.” This, however, is unlikely to be the end of the matter. The IAAF is already bracing itself for another challenge at Cas, although it believes it has a robust case. Semenya, meanwhile, knows her world could be slowing down again. The sports scientist Ross Tucker predicts she could run the 800m between five and seven seconds slower next year if she takes testosterone-suppressing medication. Whether that is right and proper will be fiercely debated in the months ahead."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2018/may/10/world-cup-2018-how-will-your-team-fare-in-russia","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-10T14:04:56Z","webTitle":"World Cup 2018: how will your team fare in Russia?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/may/10/world-cup-2018-how-will-your-team-fare-in-russia","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/may/10/world-cup-2018-how-will-your-team-fare-in-russia","fields":{"headline":"World Cup 2018: how will your team fare in Russia?","bodyText":"It’s not long now until Russia kick off the World Cup against Saudi Arabia in the Luzhniki Stadium.

You two boys need to learn to play nicely. Together we win.” Every. Single. Word. It’s literally perfect, from the casual WTF-ery of “when I am over”, as though a bilateral summit were immediately pending, to Katie’s attempt to cast herself as a Republican strategist with the grim heft of a Lee Atwater. As for the explanation as to how “we” “win”, I’m sure Brad Parscale will be seconding her to the 2020 campaign just the minute he starts smoking crack. Big hire, that one. Gamechanger. However, the tweet’s keystone is obviously Katie’s bogglingly self-satirising attempt to play nanny to two “boys” who don’t even eat people like her for breakfast. They have people who have people who have people who eat people like her for breakfast. Still, she’s totally gonna bang their two heads together! Or, as the newspaper headlines will have it: “Unemployed foreign no-mark neutralised by secret service for trying to touch president’s hem.” And yet, perhaps a new opportunity for interaction with Trump has presented itself. This week, it was announced that the US president’s much hokey-cokeyed state visit to the UK will, in fact, be going ahead in July. The news was only wryly welcomed by London mayor Sadiq Khan, but a certain someone is absolutely wetting her pants about it. As Katie declared: “A great little place I know called the rest of Britain is THRILLED to welcome Trump in July. Do not listen to the nipple-height, Muslim mayor of Londonistan. Britain needs Trump.” Well, he does feel like the one thing that could bring our divided nation together at this moment … Depending on where you stand on such things, his visit will either be an overhyped event with protests much smaller than billed, or the most effective use of snowflakes against the far right since Operation Barbarossa. Either way, we are getting ahead of ourselves. There is much to unpack, not least the sense that this should be madam’s big moment. I don’t mean to add any pressure, but it will clearly be nothing less than a total and humiliating failure for Hopkins if she is not able to finesse herself into some sort of encounter with the president while he is on these shores. The second strain at work is her ongoing campaign against Khan, which she uses for securing bookings on Fox News in the off-season between terrorist incidents here or elsewhere in Europe. Indeed, last week Katie hinted at even bigger plans in this department, saying: “I would stand as London mayor.” Yet another Hopkins statement to which the most concise reply is: “You live in Devon, dear.” The last time this response felt necessary was less than a month ago, when Katie posted a film of her giving a speech in which she announced: “I am a card-carrying member of the NRA.” You live in Devon, dear. “Other mothers have car stickers saying: ‘Baby on Board,’” she went on. “I like to think mine has bullets.” I’m sure you like to think it, but it doesn’t make it true. You might be able to get away with persuading Americans that you never venture into Widecombe-in-the-Moor unless you’re open-carrying. But you’ll have less luck in your homeland. We see you. The obvious question – so obvious it has begun to be asked with increasing frequency by even Katie’s fans – is why she does not simply do one to the States permanently. A few months ago, she attempted to explain it to a genuinely puzzled fan. “Moving to the States would be like getting into a warm bath, sir,” she replied, mustering all the grandeur of a duchess assured that the housemaid has drawn said bath specifically for her. “Welcoming and reassuring. But this is no time to leave the cold shower of the UK. We must get furious and fight back.” The reality is that in the big pond of more skilled US wingnuts, Katie would not even be a microscopic organism. Thus her sole American USP – or the beat she is forced to share only with Nigel Farage – is staying in the UK, and talking down Britain for money on Fox News. Which she does at every possible opportunity, despite the exercise being almost a performance art piece about pointlessness. I can scarcely imagine a better illustration of virtue-signalling than calling for the London mayor to go, on an American cable news channel, in a live link-up from Devon. Yet on she goes with the shtick, primarily talking down London – although it may as well be any major city. And, naturally, the ironies of this position escape our great student of Islamist terror. Like the enemies of the west to whom she fancies herself the polar opposite, Katie detests cities and what they represent. The rootlessness. The cosmopolitanism. The bourgeois liberalism. How much better things were in a mythic past that we must get back to, forcibly if necessary, whether the degenerate want us to or not. According to the Exeter Pol Pot, London has “fallen” and is a den of every conceivable vice. Come her revolution, it would presumably be razed to the ground, Phnom Penh-style, and its denizens sent back to work on the land in Devon, or possibly in Katie’s online content mine. There have, of course, been cultural greats who romanticised their own kicks against the Enlightenment. In that situation, though, I do think it helps to be as talented as Richard Wagner, say, and not just someone whose prose reads as if it was written by a verbicidal maniac. The other irony is that Katie is frequently required to make journeys to the capital for a television booking, or to be sacked by someone for her latest act of Freudian self-sabotage. Think of her as the Occidental Tourist. At these moments, her attempts to despair of the capital feel more Alan Partridge than ever. As he put it more than 15 years ago, while trying to flog his book to commuters in Norwich station: “Go to London! I guarantee you’ll either be mugged or underappreciated. Catch the train to London, stopping at Rejection, Disappointment, Backstabbing Central and Shattered Dreams Parkway.” Well, quite. Still, a Trump visit would certainly be worth Katie’s train fare, and we must look forward to her affectionately ruffling his combover in public as one of its many high points. Good Morning Britain posts a dog’s breakfast of a tweet Enormous congratulations to ITV breakfast show Good Morning Britain for the manner in which it appears to be marking World Autism Month. “We’re looking to speak to pet owners who haven’t given their pets vaccinations because they’re worried about side-effects,” ran an appeal for guests on the show’s Twitter feed earlier this week, “as well as people who have done so and now believe their pet has canine autism as a result.” The tweet has drawn furious responses from doctors, parents of autistic children, parents of autistic children who are also pet owners – and all other permutations thereof. But the fact that it remains up several days later suggests that a) the idea remains actively pursued, and b) not a whole lot of tosses are given."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2018/apr/26/londons-flagship-tory-boroughs-may-be-out-of-labour-reach-poll-predicts","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-26T15:01:52Z","webTitle":"London's flagship Tory boroughs may be out of Labour's reach, poll predicts","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/apr/26/londons-flagship-tory-boroughs-may-be-out-of-labour-reach-poll-predicts","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/apr/26/londons-flagship-tory-boroughs-may-be-out-of-labour-reach-poll-predicts","fields":{"headline":"London's flagship Tory boroughs may be out of Labour's reach, poll predicts","bodyText":"A poll indicating that Labour may fall short of taking two flagship Tory councils may aid the party’s efforts to get the vote out in London, according to the political analyst who commissioned the research. The new YouGov poll indicates the party is on course for the best performance in London local elections of any party for more than 40 years, but still may not capture the Tory flagship councils in Wandsworth and Westminster. Though Labour has a huge share of the vote in London – 51% of voters – the party has slipped back in inner London since a similar poll in February that predicated it could snatch Conservative councils in Barnet, Wandsworth and Westminster. A three-point drop, which the new poll indicates, would result in Labour only winning in Barnet. The YouGov surveys for Queen Mary University of London’s Mile End Institute put Labour on 51% to the Tories’ 29%. Prof Philip Cowley, who commissioned the research, said the poll showed Labour was dominant but would help to motivate the party’s activists. “I’d argue that electorally the poll is not as good, but politically it is better. It will do Labour no harm to lower expectations about Wandsworth and Westminster because they are both very tough electoral nuts to crack, but this poll still has Labour on course for an astonishing performance in the capital,” he told the Guardian’s PoliticsWeekly podcast. The poll suggests a 5.35% swing to Labour in next week’s elections since the same seats were fought in 2014, down from 7.35% in February. Labour remains well ahead not just in inner city boroughs but also in traditional Tory suburbs, where Labour leads 46% to 34%. More than 100 local authorities in the rest of England will also have council elections on 3 May, but Labour has pinned its hopes on winning a huge victory across the capital. Last year, the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, said Labour would aim to capture the Tory “crown jewels”, pledging there was “no corner of London where Labour can’t win”. Khan was referring to Wandsworth – known for its historically low council tax – and Barnet, once dubbed “easyCouncil” for its mass outsourcing of services. However, the Conservatives have been conducting serious expectation management, predicting a dire result for the party in the capital. Labour has since attempt to water down some of the expectation. The shadow communities secretary, Andrew Gwynne, told the Guardian last week that the polls had been “incredibly unhelpful” to Labour because they raised expectations when the last time the councils had been up for election four years ago the result was generally regarded as a high-water mark for the party. “We are cautious, we think there will be a good set of local elections for us, but some of the swings required go beyond even the huge swings we saw at the last general election,” he said. The general election result – when the Conservative Treasury minister Jane Ellison was swept out of her Battersea seat after a 10% swing to Labour – has given activists hope of taking Wandsworth for the first time in 40 years, but in several wards the party would need a significantly bigger swing to take the number of councillors needed for a majority. The grassroots activist group Momentum has been holding high-profile campaign days in the target councils of Barnet, Wandsworth, Westminster and Kensington and Chelsea, aiming to recapture some of the energy that led to Jeremy Corbyn’s surge late in the general election campaign."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2018/apr/26/nicky-morgan-tories-will-not-be-forgiven-if-brexit-hurts-economy","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-26T17:14:30Z","webTitle":"'Of course we're leaving': Rudd clarifies EU customs union position","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/apr/26/nicky-morgan-tories-will-not-be-forgiven-if-brexit-hurts-economy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/apr/26/nicky-morgan-tories-will-not-be-forgiven-if-brexit-hurts-economy","fields":{"headline":"'Of course we're leaving': Rudd clarifies EU customs union position","bodyText":"Amber Rudd has been forced to issue a hasty clarification after appearing to hold out the possibility that Britain could remain in a customs union with the EU after Brexit. At a lunch with journalists in Westminster, which took place as MPs were debating the issue in the House of Commons, the home secretary was asked if she would vote to stay in in a customs union if she were still a backbencher. “I am committed to the government’s position, which to some extent, we are still working on,” she replied. Later, she was asked if she thought it was more or less likely that the UK would stay in the customs union. Rudd said: “I’m afraid I’m not going to be drawn on that; we still have a few discussions to have, in a really positive, consensual, easy way, amongst all my cabinet colleagues, in order to arrive at a final position”. That contrasts with the government’s position, which is that the UK will leave the customs union. Within an hour of the lunch ending, Rudd tweeted that she “could have been clearer” about her position. But her earlier ambivalence gave heart to those who are pushing for the UK to remain in a customs union. Downing Street later disowned the remarks. May’s spokesman said: “The government is absolutely clear and without ambiguity that we are leaving the customs union and not joining a customs union. “It’s the position of the prime minister, the cabinet and the entire government that we will be leaving the customs union and be free to sign our own trade deals around the world.” Number 10 said there was “a discussion around the issue of which two customs options the government opts for - but are we leaving the customs union? The answer is categorically yes.” Both options set out in the Mansion House speech were still on the table, the spokesman said. “But as we move forward, you can expect there to be a single option,” he said. “Neither of the options are a customs union.” However, the remarks were seized on by MPs keen to shift the government’s position. The shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, said: “Amber Rudd appears to have let slip that discussions around the cabinet table about negotiating a customs union with the EU have not in fact concluded. “If that is so, then the prime minister should rethink her approach and listen to the growing chorus of voices in parliament and in business that believe she has got it wrong on a customs union.” In the Commons, Rudd’s pro-remain colleagues were arguing vehemently for a change in government policy. The former education secretary Nicky Morgan said her party would “not be forgiven for a generation” if a hard Brexit undermined the economy and peace in Northern Ireland. Morgan, who is one of the 12 Commons committee chairs who jointly sought the debate, said it was vital for parliament to properly examine what would happen if the UK does not remain in the EU’s customs union. Morgan said that earlier in the week the Treasury select committee, which she chairs, had helped organise a session that heard evidence from Prof Patrick Minford, a leading pro-Brexit economist whose forecasts are strongly backed by Jacob Rees-Mogg, among others. Morgan told MPs that Minford had told the hearing that when it came to trade agreements the UK could pursue outside the single market and customs union, “we don’t have any precedents for this”. She said: “This country is being asked to experiment at other people’s pleasure with a free trade policy when we do not know what the costs will be for constituents and businesses in this country. “And I say to my party – if we undermine and ignore the evidence for peace in Northern Ireland, and we undermine the business and financial security of people in this country, we will not be forgiven for a generation.” The debate has no direct influence on government policy, but is was regarded as a gauge of Commons opinion ahead of potentially crucial future votes on amendments committing the government to staying in the customs union. These have been tabled to the government’s pre-Brexit trade bill and customs bill, due to be debated in the coming months, with supportive MPs saying they believe there would be enough Tory rebels to win a vote. More than 10 Conservatives expressed doubts about leaving the customs union – sufficient to overturn the government’s majority if they all rebel. Thursday’s debate was opened by Yvette Cooper, the Labourchair of the home affairs committee, who warned that decisions needed to be made soon. “We’re running out of time for parliament to help shape the negotiations,” she said. And we’re running out of time to hear from the government about what it’s actually going to do.” Ken Clarke, the Europhile Tory MP, said he was deeply worried about the impact of leaving the customs union on both the Irish border and future trade. “I really do think it is remarkable how little attention parliament has been allowed to pay to the quite momentous events that are taking place at the moment, and will certainly take place over the next few months, and which have a profound importance for the future health of our economy and the standing of this country in the world,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/apr/26/10m-syrians-at-risk-of-forfeiting-homes-under-new-property-law","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-26T14:02:24Z","webTitle":"10m Syrians at risk of forfeiting homes under new property law","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/26/10m-syrians-at-risk-of-forfeiting-homes-under-new-property-law","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/apr/26/10m-syrians-at-risk-of-forfeiting-homes-under-new-property-law","fields":{"headline":"10m Syrians at risk of forfeiting homes under new property law","bodyText":"More than 10 million Syrians who have fled the country’s raging war have been told to lay claim to their homes by early May or risk forfeiting them to the state. A property law announced this month has raised widespread fears that Syrian citizens who have opposed Bashar al-Assad face permanent exile and that other people considered loyalists may be given access to their communities. With the majority of internally displaced and overseas refugees unable or unwilling to return to prove ownership of properties, analysts and exiles say the law, known as article 10, and the tight timeframe surrounding it could serve as an instrument of demographic change and social engineering. It has drawn parallels with laws enacted in Lebanon after the civil war to seize land in central Beirut, and the absentee property law in Israel in 1950 that legalised seizures from Palestinians driven from their lands. The Syrian law empowers local administrations to re-register property ownership within their areas, a move that requires landowners to be present. Syrian legal experts say the law focuses on war-damaged areas around Damascus and does not include areas unscathed by the fighting. However, critics and exiled landowners say the regulation has a clear political dimension and carries implications that extend well beyond selective re-zoning. “For millions of internally displaced and refugees, such proof [of ownership] will most likely be mission impossible,” said Maha Yahya, director of the Carnegie Middle East Centre in Beirut. “Many left without title deeds, some lived in informal settlements, therefore without legally recognised proof of ownership and for others – mainly refugees – going back to Syria to provide such proof is tantamount to a suicide mission. “From the regime’s perspective, the law will serve three purposes: it gives them an additional vetting instrument over returnees and a way to strip political opponents of their assets. For refugees, largely perceived by the regime as traitors, this increases their risk of permanent exile. It will allow the regime to consolidate its power base by repopulating strategic areas with regime loyalists. This places the residents of informal settlements in major cities at risk of further dispossession. This may remove any potential source of future resistance for good.” The effects of the proposed law were widely discussed at an EU-UN donor conference in Brussels this week. On the sidelines of the summit, which concluded with close to a $5bn shortfall in aid pledges, officials from both sides said there was an increasing understanding in Europe that many of the estimated 1.5 million Syrians now on the continent were not going home. “This is the nail in the coffin for them,” said a senior EU official. “This is blatant power consolidation by Assad. It is punitive, not regulatory. Make no mistake. On the one hand, it is normal to do something like this after a natural disaster like an earthquake. But not now. And not like this. The war is still raging and metastasising. It’s not anywhere near over.” A perception that the war is winding down, coupled with conflict fatigue, has dampened the appetite of potential donors and made a political settlement ever more elusive. With robust backing from Russia and Iran, Assad has been manoeuvred into a winning position in key parts of the battlefield, including in Damascus, where Syrian and Russian forces continued an assault on the Yarmouk Palestinian camp on Thursday. In response to the latest clashes, the UNRWA commissioner general, Pierre Krähenbühl, said: “Yarmouk and its inhabitants have endured indescribable pain and suffering over years of conflict. We are deeply concerned about the fate of thousands of civilians, including Palestine refugees, after more than a week of dramatically increased violence.” In northern and southern Syria, regime offensives have yet to fully begin. The conflict in both areas has morphed numerous times and, even with bedrock support from Tehran and Moscow, regaining full control of the country any time soon is seen as an unlikely proposition. Nadim Shehadi, the director of the Fares Centre for Eastern Mediterranean Studies at Tufts University in the US, said the full effect of the property law remained unclear. “Much will depend on implementation. This could be ethnic cleansing by stealth, not dissimilar to absentee laws we have seen before,” he said. “In Lebanon we had a similar law in the rebuilding of the Nahr al-Bared camp, which was destroyed in 2007 by the Lebanese army in a fight with a terrorist group called Fath al-Islam. There were illegal constructions in contravention to zoning and building regulations and unclear property rights with complicated compensation regimes.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/apr/26/men-deny-racist-sticker-crusade-posed-nazis-aston-birmingham","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-26T17:04:15Z","webTitle":"Men accused of racist sticker crusade 'posed giving Nazi salute'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/apr/26/men-deny-racist-sticker-crusade-posed-nazis-aston-birmingham","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/apr/26/men-deny-racist-sticker-crusade-posed-nazis-aston-birmingham","fields":{"headline":"Men accused of racist sticker crusade 'posed giving Nazi salute'","bodyText":"Two of five men accused of inciting racial hatred after plastering offensive stickers across a university campus posed for a photograph giving a Nazi salute, a court has heard. Prosecutors said “threatening, abusive or at very least insulting” stickers stuck to signs at Aston University, Birmingham, were “recruitment tools” for the neo-Nazi National Action group. One of the stickers showed a white figure giving a Nazi salute, and stated: “White Zone – National Action”. Another read: “Britain is ours – the rest must go.” The men are accused of putting up the stickers on the afternoon of 9 July 2016. Jurors saw university CCTV footage allegedly showing the men on campus that day. An image showed some of the group posing in front of the university with the National Action flag, and two of them giving Nazi salutes. Jurors were told they would see evidence of planning, including messages and a downloaded map of the campus. Opening the prosecution on Thursday, Kelly Brocklehurst said the defendants accepted they put the stickers up, but did not accept that they had incited racial hatred. “When you are faced with something that says White Zone and the image of somebody with a raised right arm, stickers with swastikas, we say: how can that not be threatening, abusive or at very least insulting?” the barrister said. “That is exactly the aim, or one of the aims, of what these defendants were seeking to achieve.” He told the jury: “There’s likely no dispute about what they did, the dispute is likely about why they did it. But we say you can be, and will be, sure they intended racial hatred, and if not they were well aware of what those stickers were capable of achieving.” The defendants, who are all said to have been members of National Action at the time, are: Chad Williams-Allen, 26, Dean Lloyd, 27, both of West Bromwich, and Garry Jack, 22, of Birmingham. Two other men cannot be named for legal reasons. The jury was shown messages from 2 March 2016 in which Williams-Allen allegedly sent an image of a National Action sticker, and said: “Been taking the long route home through paki land and slapping these everywhere.” Another defendant, also 26, had images on electronic devices seized by police which allegedly said “Hitler was right” and “bring back apartheid”. The trial, expected to last up to three weeks, continues."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2018/apr/28/448-psychosis-opera-philip-venables-lyric-hammersmith-lso-rattle-mahler-9-10-barbican-review","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-28T12:00:13Z","webTitle":"The week in classical: 4.48 Psychosis; London Symphony Orchestra/Rattle – review","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/apr/28/448-psychosis-opera-philip-venables-lyric-hammersmith-lso-rattle-mahler-9-10-barbican-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/apr/28/448-psychosis-opera-philip-venables-lyric-hammersmith-lso-rattle-mahler-9-10-barbican-review","fields":{"headline":"The week in classical: 4.48 Psychosis; London Symphony Orchestra/Rattle – review","bodyText":"Shorn of joy, matted with despair, Philip Venables’s 4.48 Psychosis shot to near classic status after its world premiere in 2016. It might have been a damp squib on second encounter. On the contrary, this intense, 90-minute opera, for six women, a dozen instrumentalists and pre-recorded material, was yet more spiky, cogent, witty and elegiac in its first revival, at the Lyric Hammersmith. It is based on Sarah Kane’s play about the unending labyrinth of clinical depression, finished in 1999 shortly before her suicide at the age of 28. Venables (b1979), the Royal Opera’s first composer in residence, has said he chose to make an opera from 4.48 Psychosis in part because of his response to the musicality of the text. With so much else to take in when the work was new, from fragmented narrative and unidentifiable characters to the score’s tight, bright skein of musical styles – now minimalist, now rock, close-harmony chorale, a snatch of Bach, a quasi lute song – the verbal aspect did not take on particular prominence. This time it hit home. Three sopranos (Gweneth-Ann Rand, Lucy Hall, Susanna Hurrell) and three mezzo-sopranos (Lucy Schaufer, Rachael Lloyd, Samantha Price), all amplified, and with no weak link, express the loneliness and pain of mental illness. There’s enough information to suggest that the 24 short scenes, folding into one another, take part in an institution, but the imprisoning walls and flashing white lights may be of their own imaginings. 4.48 is that time of wakefulness, of lucidity and terror. Venables mixes song with, variously, a spoken voice or words appearing on the rear wall (distinct from surtitles, which are used as needed). One device he employs to great effect is for a singer to sound the first word of a sentence, on a sustained note, while the speaker completes the rest, as in “I… am fat, I… cannot listen, I… cannot love.” Kane’s own voice is never lost in Venables’s handling. The production, directed by Ted Huffman, honours the work, with clean, crisp designs, lighting and video by Hannah Clark, DM Wood and Pierre Martin. Richard Baker – like Thomas Adès, Oliver Knussen and Ryan Wigglesworth, a sympathetic composer-conductor – conjured expert playing from the agile musicians of Chroma. With three saxophones, accordion, wood saw, hammer and fist, the score has a dusky, unbleached quality, which intermittently breaks out in lament or cry. The bleakness of the subject matter, and the generosity of the performance, forged to make an unforgettable evening. The same might be said of the London Symphony Orchestra’s two concerts of Mahler’s final two symphonies, conducted by Simon Rattle and paired, in the case of the Ninth, with a world premiere by Helen Grime (b1981), and in the Tenth with Michael Tippett’s sumptuous late score, The Rose Lake. Grime’s ambitious Woven Space, completing a work in part heard at the opening of Rattle’s LSO season last autumn, had more in common with Tippett’s music than might first appear. His endless twining of canons and song made a resounding echo with the subtle, gleaming intricacies of Grime’s music. Mahler’s Symphony No 10 (1910), his last, was written not so much in the shadow of death – though it can seem that way, since he died within a year of drafting it – as in the blinding glare of a tormented life. On top of bereavement and his own fragile health, he discovered that his wife, Alma, was having an affair with the architect Walter Gropius. Littering the score with cries from the heart – “To live for you, to die for you” – Mahler established the melodic and harmonic arguments, but much remained incomplete. Some conductors prefer to perform only the Adagio, a 25-minute torso, which in mood answers, and challenges, the slow finale of the Ninth. Christian Thielemann has just released a recording with the Munich Philharmonic. Rattle, instead, has long put his faith in the Deryck Cooke “completion”, performing it frequently enough to conduct from memory. It enables us to hear all five movements, harmonically daring and suggestive of new horizons the composer might one day have explored. Here, as in the Ninth too, Mahler takes the inner mechanisms of the orchestra, particularly the violas and second violins, and puts them in the spotlight. They played magnificently, seconds to the right of Rattle, violas between first violins and cellos. The rest of the strings, the brass, percussion and woodwind, and the many section soloists, gave their outstanding best to an audience who, especially towards the end of the Ninth, seemed to stop breathing. Man (on this occasion) of the match goes to Chi Yu-Mo, who plays the small but powerful E flat clarinet. He hit his shrill, high notes with spot-on intonation, duetting effortlessly with violin or piccolo or flute, ranging in style from klezmer dance to bucolic shepherd to anarchic goat. Lord knows what it does to his diaphragm.

The discount retailer is working on a proposal for a company voluntary arrangement (CVA), expected during the first half of May. Poundworld, which has 355 stores and employs about 5,500 people, joins a growing list of UK retailers struggling to cope with rising costs. High rent bills and business rates – as well as weak consumer confidence and the shift to buying online – have piled pressure on retailers. Poundworld has also been hit by a weaker pound since the Brexit vote because a lot of its costs are in dollars. The retailer is owned by the US private equity firm TPG Capital, the same firm that owns the Prezzo chain, which is also closing about 100 restaurants through a CVA. Poundworld’s decision to seek a deal with its landlords, first reported by Sky News, follows a similar move by Carpetright. Its creditors were due on Thursday afternoon to vote on the potential closure of about 90 stores. Toys R Us went into administration in February, triggering the closure of 100 stores and the loss of more than 3,000 jobs. The electronics retailer Maplin and the fashion chain East have also collapsed, costing a further 2,500 jobs, in recent weeks. Meanwhile, the new chief executive of the department store chain Fenwick, Robbie Feather, told Retail Week magazine that it would be consulting with a “significant number” of its 2,200 employees over the coming months, as part of a restructuring of the business."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2022/dec/29/pele-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2022-12-29T19:59:57Z","webTitle":"Pelé obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/dec/29/pele-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2022/dec/29/pele-obituary","fields":{"headline":"Pelé obituary","bodyText":"Pelé, who has died aged 82 after suffering from cancer, is widely regarded as the greatest footballer the game has ever seen. He was the only player to have won the World Cup three times, and perhaps the most remarkable aspect of his long career was that he reached his apotheosis so early, and on the world’s biggest stage. He was 17 when he played for Brazil in the 1958 World Cup finals in Sweden, scoring six goals in their last three games – the winner in the quarter-final, a hat-trick in the semi-final and two in the final – his confidence and stature growing palpably with every game. Almost two decades later he came out of retirement and made the almost unthinkable decision of signing for New York Cosmos. For all its wealth, the US was then a pauper of the football world, and it was Pelé who helped introduce Americans to “soccer”. His first game was televised in 22 countries, and the pitch, more dirt than grass, had to be spray-painted green for the watching world. Pelé’s fame began to grow almost from the moment he made his dramatic entrance in the World Cup as the youngest footballer to play in the tournament (and still the youngest to have scored a hat-trick, or to have appeared and scored in a final). Although he missed the first two games of the 1958 tournament through injury, senior members of the Brazil squad urged the manager to play both Pelé and the right-winger Garrincha in the final group match against the Soviet Union. Unleashing these two players against the Soviets kickstarted the Brazilian campaign. Both hit the post in the first intoxicating three minutes of the match and Brazil played with a virtuosity that heralded their arrival as the dominant, irresistible force in world football. When Brazil reached the final and beat Sweden, the hosts, 5-2, Pelé stole the show, his two goals an illustration of the ability that set him apart from all other footballers. The first was a breathtaking piece of skill; he controlled the ball on his chest, chipped it back over his head and then ran around the flummoxed defender and volleyed it into the net. For the second, he soared above his marker before making a perfectly placed header. Pelé was blessed with a blend of supreme athleticism, skill and tactical vision. He could run 100m in 11 seconds, shoot with either foot and outjump the tallest defenders. His sheer physicality and turn of speed were electrifying as he homed in on goal, outsprinting or simply charging through defences while managing to keep the ball under close control. But, unusually for such a prolific goalscorer, he could also be a team player. While he was still a teenager, wealthy Italian clubs attempted to lure him away from Brazil, offering a then unheard-of $1m to his club, Santos FC, for his signature. But in 1961, the Brazilian president Jânio Quadros declared Pelé a “non-exportable national treasure”, ensuring that he remained at the club for almost two decades. He was born Edson Arantes do Nascimento in the village of Três Corações in the Brazilian state of Minas Gerais, the son of Celeste and João Ramos. The boy was named after the inventor Thomas Edison, though his parents misspelt the name. The origin of Pelé, the nickname he picked up as a young boy, is something of a mystery, but its novelty and simplicity – easy to pronounce in any language (he complained it sounded like babytalk in Portuguese) – would add to his aura as his career advanced. His father, known as Dondinho, was a gifted footballer and in the hope of a final shot at glory took the family to Bauru, a railway town in São Paulo state. A knee injury put an end to his sports career and the family slipped into poverty. From the age of seven, Pelé worked part-time as a shoeshine boy. Celeste was adamant her son would not follow in João’s footsteps, but by the time he was a teenager, scouts from the big clubs in Rio and São Paulo were knocking at the door. Waldemar de Brito, a scout and former footballer who appeared in the 1934 World Cup, finally persuaded his mother to let him have a trial for Santos. De Brito took Pelé under his wing, and when they arrived in Santos, the port city for the booming industrial and coffee-producing state of São Paulo, he declared the 15-year-old was going to be “the greatest football player in the world”. Santos was a small but ambitious provincial club when Pelé made his debut in 1956, and he was instrumental in transforming it into a national and then international force. In 1957, his first full season as a professional, in which he also won his first international cap, he was the top scorer in the São Paulo state championship. The following year the team scored 143 goals in 38 games to win the title, Pelé scoring 58 times – a record that still stands – and a remarkable 75 goals in all competitions in the calendar year, a world record that stood until 1972. By the 1960s the team was one of the most successful in the world, earning the nickname the Santásticos as they won eight more state championships, six Brazilian championships, two Copas Libertadores (South American championships) and two Intercontinental Cups. Keen to cash in on Pelé’s box office appeal – and pay his astronomical salary – Santos embarked on a relentless schedule of exhibition matches in dozens of countries across four continents. Their star attraction was contractually obliged to play everywhere they went, so by the time Pelé appeared in his second World Cup, in Chile in 1962, he had played an exhausting 426 games and scored 488 goals in matches for club and country. He arrived with a groin injury, which flared up in Brazil’s second game and ruled him out of the rest of the tournament, though Brazil, led by an inspirational Garrincha, went on to win their second successive World Cup. Worse followed four years later at the 1966 World Cup in England, when Bulgarian and Portuguese defenders repeatedly hacked Pelé down at the knees. He limped out of the tournament and, angered at the lack of protection from referees, vowed that he had played his last World Cup. Four years later, acutely aware of his place in history and with a point to prove, he had changed his mind. Chastened, the Brazil squad trained for the tournament for three months to deal with an increasingly physical European game and the altitude and intense heat of Mexico. Pelé was the only survivor of the victorious 1958 squad but he was joined by a new generation of gifted players, including Tostão, Rivelino, Jairzinho, Gerson and his Santos teammate Carlos Alberto. The 1970 World Cup was the first to be watched live by a global television audience. It was also the first to be broadcast in colour, and in the brilliant Mexican sunshine the gold shirts and cobalt blue shorts of Brazil dazzled the watching world. They won the tournament for the third time – beating Italy 4-1 in the final – by playing football of such imagination and thrilling execution that it is regarded as one of the high-water marks in the history of sport. Their swaggering, distinctly Brazilian futebol arte proved that it was possible to win by playing with joyful exuberance, and Pelé was the most potent symbol of this sporting celebration. After 1970 he was probably the most famous man in world sport, with only Muhammad Ali as instantly recognisable and universally idolised. He played five more games for Brazil and continued with Santos for another four years, but declined to come out of international retirement for the 1974 World Cup. Brazil’s manager, Mario Zagallo, had lost the nucleus of his glorious 1970 team and implored Pelé to change his mind, but the player realised that, as well as being past his peak, he was a far more lucrative asset off the field. At this point in his life, money had become more pressing than football. As the result of bad judgment and dubious advice, he twice lost his fortune and was almost made bankrupt. One reason Santos were able to keep him for so long was their willingness to bail him out, on very favourable terms, after his business collapsed. He played his last game for the club in October 1974 but, with financial clouds still hanging over him, he came out of retirement a few months later after receiving an offer he simply could not refuse. To the astonishment of football fans, particularly in Brazil, he went to play for New York Cosmos in the fledgling North American Soccer League (NASL). They would pay him $7m for three years as a player, plus another three as a “goodwill ambassador”. As well as a salary that would make him the highest-paid sportsman in the world, he was also tempted by the offer of a new challenge laid down by the Cosmos manager, Clive Toye, perhaps one that suited a footballer past his peak: “I told him don’t go to Italy, don’t go to Spain, all you can do is win a championship. Come to the US and you can win a country.” And so it proved: Pelé and the Cosmos were a perfect fit. The astonishing skill that had beguiled football fans in almost every country in the world was a revelation to a new American audience, and he loved the razzmatazz of the NASL – his easy charm was a gift to sports marketing men who were selling, in effect, a brand new product. Over three seasons he scored 65 goals in 111 games for the Cosmos, and led them to the 1977 American championship. The team became a huge commercial presence and regularly sold out their 60,000-seater stadium – unthinkable before his arrival. His last game came in October 1977, an exhibition match in New York between his two clubs, Santos and Cosmos, broadcast to dozens of countries, in which he played one half for each side, and scored his last goal, his 1,283rd in 1,367 games. Those figures are remarkable in themselves, but the fact that more than 500 of those games were friendlies played all over the world is testament to his popularity and box office appeal. When he retired for a second time, the winning smile and goodwill that had won over American sports fans became his stock in trade, and he went on to act as a highly paid roving ambassador for a number of organisations, from Fifa and the United Nations to Mastercard and Pepsi. He even headed a health campaign for erectile dysfunction awareness. Wherever he went, he was received like royalty. Though never a member of a political party, he was appointed Brazil’s minister of sport in 1995, serving until 1998, the year the lei Pelé (Pele’s law) was passed by congress. Its noble aim was to clean up the country’s notoriously chaotic and corrupt football bodies and give greater freedom of movement to players, though the bill was watered down before and after its promulgation. In 1999 he was named athlete of the century by the International Olympic Committee (even though he had never appeared at an Olympic Games) and a year later (jointly with Diego Maradona) Fifa player of the century. He was vice-president of Santos and made honorary president of the revamped New York Cosmos in 2010. His honorary titles in many different countries included an honorary knighthood in the UK (1997). Pelé’s first two marriages ended in divorce. In 2016 he married his third wife, Marcia Cibele Aoki. She survives him, along with two daughters, Kelly Cristina and Jennifer, and a son, Édson, from his first marriage, to Rosemeri Cholbi; twins, Joshua and Celeste, from his second marriage, to Assíria Lemos; and a daughter, Flávia Kurtz, from an earlier relationship. He did not acknowledge his daughter Sandra, from a relationship with Anizia Machado, even after she won a paternity case. They never met and she died in 2006. • Pelé (Edson Arantes do Nascimento), footballer, born 23 October 1940; died 29 December 2022"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/apr/26/amber-rudd-heartbroken-windrush","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-26T12:29:25Z","webTitle":"It’s a bit late for Amber Rudd to be ‘heartbroken’ over anything | Polly Toynbee","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/26/amber-rudd-heartbroken-windrush","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/26/amber-rudd-heartbroken-windrush","fields":{"headline":"It’s a bit late for Amber Rudd to be ‘heartbroken’ over anything","bodyText":"“Heartbreaking,” the home secretary calls the Windrush cases. To a mother whose son died in fear of unjust deportation, or a man denied urgent cancer treatment, “heartbreaking” is the right word. But Theresa May’s “sorry for any anxiety that has been caused” better reflects this government’s heart. Amber Rudd, in her car-crash replies to Yvette Cooper’s forensic questioning on Wednesday, was forced to admit that she had a target for removals: this year it is 12,000 people. Today’s official line from Matt Hancock, the all-purpose Today programme minister, is: “It has never been Home Office policy to take decisions arbitrarily to meet the target.” But from inside the Home Office comes evidence that hard targets were pinned on immigration officers’ walls. Of course they went after “low-hanging fruit”, those easy to find because they had lived here for ever, paying income tax and council tax; the older, the easier. Gotcha! Either the home secretary ignored the inevitable cruelty in chasing her targets – or she was too dumb to ask. True, Border Force staff told me that Rudd had had the wool pulled over her eyes about its state of dereliction. When she first visited Heathrow, managers bussed in apprentice tax-collectors from Newcastle to staff the passport kiosks, with passengers held back in another hall so that she saw no queues. She might use the Henry II get-out clause: she asked for 12,000 deportations – but she never meant cruelty. “This should never have been allowed to happen,” she says now. But has she visited Yarls Wood detention centre unannounced? Presumably she doesn’t read the Guardian and so missed all of Amelia Gentleman’s searing reports on Windrush families over many months. So what finally broke her heart? The embarrassment of 12 Caribbean heads of state at the Commonwealth heads of government conference demanding a meeting, perhaps. Or David Lammy collecting the signatures of 140 MPs outraged by Windrush cases they tried to raise. But might the heartbreak moment really have come when the Daily Mail finally took up the Windrush stories (with scant acknowledgment of Amelia’s reporting)? Breaking this government’s stone heart has proved impossible over the years. As £30bn and then another £12bn were gouged from the social security budget, the devastating effects on families, on disabled people, on children, had no impact. Instead the government heaped abuse on victims, as Iain Duncan Smith vowed to end the “something-for-nothing culture”. Never admitting most people on benefits are in work, he liked warning them: “This is not an easy life any more, chum. I think you’re a slacker.” He denied his strict targets for knocking people off benefits: but jobcentre staff showed me what were called ”spinning plates” monthly targets, with one telling me: “You park your conscience when you work here.” Staff missing their quota were disciplined. The easiest hits were people with learning disabilities or mental illness, and benefits were stopped for tiny infractions. Did anyone in government break their heart over diabetic ex-soldier David Clapson, who starved to death when his benefits were stopped? George Osborne relentlessly sneered at households sleeping on with “closed blinds while honest citizens set off to work”. Now his Evening Standard begs for charity for London’s hungry children, impoverished by him: the Institute for Fiscal Studies warns that another 1.2 million children are falling into poverty. It never broke their hearts to punish families with more than two children, or cut rent support, or evict anyone with a spare room, sending them sometimes hundreds of miles from schools, jobs, friends and family. It didn’t break their hearts to see more than 50,000 Motability cars taken from disabled households. Would it break their hearts to see people with children using food banks? Tory MPs know all this. I have sat in their surgeries to see how they react to the stream of human suffering they are inflicting. They look sorrowful, and promise to write (useless) letters to ministers. They get pleas for help from people being evicted and frail old people neglected at home for lack of care. They see children’s centres closing, and the soaring numbers of children taken into care because no one caught family problems early. They hear from patients in pain or danger through operations postponed. Maybe they complain about 600,000 lost young people, hanging around neither in education nor employment, with youth services having been abolished. A “hostile environment” is what the government has deliberately created. Calculated cruelty has been policy, not accident. Writing about all this state-inflicted suffering can feel like banging your head against a brick wall: Guardian readers know it already, while government ministers don’t give a damn. Is Amber Rudd’s “heartbreak” a moment of great collective epiphany? Will a frozen dam of tears suddenly be unleashed? Theresa May’s “burning social injustices” burn brighter than ever, with no sign yet of an outbreak of howling repentance along the government benches. • Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"money/2018/may/03/concert-tickets-stevie-wonder-aretha-franklin-tribute","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-03T06:00:34Z","webTitle":"I thought I was buying tickets for Aretha Franklin and Stevie Wonder – but it was a tribute act","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2018/may/03/concert-tickets-stevie-wonder-aretha-franklin-tribute","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2018/may/03/concert-tickets-stevie-wonder-aretha-franklin-tribute","fields":{"headline":"I thought I was seeing Aretha Franklin and Stevie Wonder – but it was a tribute act","bodyText":"I paid £287.46 for a ticket to see Stevie Wonder and Aretha Franklin in concert on the Viagogo website.

In August 2017, a B&amp;Q plumber replaced the shower splash boards because water had penetrated behind them. Eight weeks later, we noticed water across the kitchen ceiling. An emergency plumber from Anglian Water discovered water pouring behind the splash boards. He isolated the shower and stated the problem was due to poor installation. When the B&amp;Q plumber returned, he couldn’t find the source of the leak and deduced the Anglian Water plumber must have stopped it. Within weeks, the wallpaper on a wall dividing a bedroom and bathroom became damp and mouldy. The plasterwork was crumbling and a skirting board beginning to come away from the wall. Despite accepting in a letter that the damage “seems to be B&amp;Q’s liability” a B&amp;Q manager insisted we claim on our home insurance. This would leave us out of pocket as we would have to pay the policy excess and any consequent increase in our premium. PD, Taylor, Lincolnshire B&amp;Q says: “We are committed to supporting the customer and helping him find a resolution. The information provided so far has been insufficient to determine whether the installation caused the issue. In these instances, we would always refer the customer to their insurer, as they are best placed to help identify the source of the problem.” Its intransigence is extraordinary. You point out that no water pipes existed along that wall before the shower was installed, and that no one except B&amp;Q installers and the emergency plumber have touched them since. The plumber, in a written report, places the leak as stemming from a feed pipe to the shower which, he writes, has been inadequately fitted. B&amp;Q’s manager declared in a letter, after his inspection, that the liability seemed to lie with B&amp;Q. Then, in the next paragraph, warned that this was in no way an admission of liability. When I point this out to B&amp;Q it merely repeats the same statement. Five months on, you are awaiting a decision by the Furniture Ombudsman.

Brexit opponents claim the chances of Britain securing a trade deal with India superior to a Indian-EU deal are a fantasy unless the UK makes major concessions on Indian skilled labour accessing UK markets. Karan Bilimoria, the British Indian entrepreneur and life peer, insisted Modi’s priority was a free trade deal with the EU. Britain is nevertheless lavishing diplomatic attention over Narendra Modi, the Indian prime minister, thanking him for breaking a decade of Indian indifference to the Commonwealth by personally attending the Commonwealth summit and so giving the post-colonial assembly greater relevance. Modi did not attend the Commonwealth summit in Malta two years ago, and his predecessor, Manmohan Singh, missed the 2011 summit in Australia and its successor in Sri Lanka in 2013. But Modi, who was personally courted by both Prince Charles and Theresa May to attend the talks, regards the Commonwealth as a useful multilateral forum from which China, India’s great rival, is absent. He is also looking for allies in any trade war with the US. In common with most Commonwealth leaders, Modi also sees the visit as a chance to woo the City of London and court foreign direct investment. The Indian prime minister has been rewarded for his commitment to the Commonwealth with Wednesday’s lengthy bilateral meeting with May, an audience with the Queen, a visit with Prince Charles to the Science Museum and a commitment that British intelligence will help fight Pakistan-based militant groups. In a further sign of British respect, Modi’s plane from Sweden was greeted at Heathrow by the foreign secretary, Boris Johnson. Modi’s aides also claimed he was travelling in a limousine when many other heads of state were due to travel to a Windsor retreat in a bus. At a packed town-hall-style meeting in Central Hall Westminster, Modi spoke of his rise from tea seller to visitor to a royal palace, and said the days of incremental change in India were over. Throughout the day he was also pursued by hundreds of demonstrators protesting gainst his attitude to Kashmir, Hindu nationalism and the failure to act against horrific instances of sexual violence against women, including the rape of an eight-year-old Muslim girl. British ministers say a free trade deal with India is a priority after Brexit, but the joint Indian-UK statement issued after the bilateral meeting acknowledges that the UK cannot sign any new deal until the Brexit transition period ends. The EU is also locked in talks with India over a free trade deal, a subject Modi will raise with the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, in a stopover before he returns to India from London. After Brexit the UK will initially simply seek to replicate the EU-Indian free trade deal, but any bespoke agreement will be hard to negotiate since India will be looking for concessions on visa travel from India to the UK. The lengthy bilateral deal signed by the two countries covers cyberspace, technology sharing, solar energy, sustainable urban development, water management, animal husbandry, safe use of nuclear energy, artificial intelligence and big-data analytics. The joint agreement said a “secure, free, open, inclusive and prosperous Indo-Pacific” was in the interests of India, the UK and the international community, adding: “The UK and India will also work together to tackle threats such as piracy, protect freedom of navigation and open access, and improve maritime domain awareness in the region.” India regards the statement as significant given Beijing’s tough approach to disputes to the South China Sea and attempts to increase its footprint in the Indo-Pacific region."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2018/apr/18/labour-would-rip-up-definition-of-affordable-housing-corbyn-says","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-18T21:30:35Z","webTitle":"Labour would rip up definition of affordable housing, Corbyn says","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/apr/18/labour-would-rip-up-definition-of-affordable-housing-corbyn-says","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/apr/18/labour-would-rip-up-definition-of-affordable-housing-corbyn-says","fields":{"headline":"Labour would rip up definition of affordable housing, Corbyn says","bodyText":"A Labour government would rip up the government’s definition of affordable housing and instead bring in a measure linked to people’s incomes, Jeremy Corbyn will say on Thursday. A report, Housing for the Many, accuses ministers of stretching the term affordable to breaking point to include homes let at up to 80% of market rents – more than £1,500 a month in some areas – and homes for sale up to £450,000. “It has become a deliberately malleable phrase, used to cover up a shift in government policy towards increasingly expensive and insecure homes,” it says. The Labour leader and John Healey, the shadow housing secretary, set out the party’s plans to link affordability to people’s incomes on tenures including social rent, living rent and low-cost ownership, in the 40-page green paper, to be launched on Thursday. Labour says one “common yardstick” is whether rent or a mortgage costs more than one-third of a household’s after-tax income. The green paper says Labour is keen to help not just the poorest in society, but also “the ‘just coping’ class in Britain today who do the jobs we all rely on – IT workers, HGV drivers, joiners, warehouse managers, lab technicians, nurses, teaching assistants, call centre supervisors, shop staff. They are the backbone of the British economy and heart of our public services.” Britain faces an acute housing affordability crisis, with around 1.7m private rented households currently paying more than a third of their income in rent and 1m owner-occupiers paying more than a third of their income on their mortgage. Corbyn will say: “When housing has become a site of speculation for a wealthy few, leaving the many unable to access a decent, secure home, something has gone seriously wrong. We need to restore the principle that a decent home is a right owed to all, not a privilege for the few. And the only way to deliver on that right for everyone, regardless of income, is through social housing.” The paper includes a series of other measures, including creating a new Department of Housing and an independent watchdog, along the lines of the Office for Budget Responsibility, to assess the government’s policies and ensure they are delivered. A Labour government would also end the right to buy, which the Cameron government extended to cover tenants in social housing, risking the depletion of the supply of social housing. Labour would also lift the cap on borrowing by local authorities, to allow councils to build more social housing themselves. A Conservative spokesperson said: “Labour would kick away the housing ladder from everyone living in council houses by taking away their right to buy, just as Labour did in Wales. Under the Conservatives, we are investing £9bn to build more good-quality homes that people can afford and have seen the highest number of new homes being built for a decade.” Healey will say: “The housing market is broken and current Conservative housing policy is failing to fix it. We have to build more affordable homes to make homes more affordable.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/apr/18/chelsea-win-everton-maintain-three-point-wsl-lead","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-18T21:04:13Z","webTitle":"Chelsea hold on at Everton to maintain three-point WSL lead","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/apr/18/chelsea-win-everton-maintain-three-point-wsl-lead","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/apr/18/chelsea-win-everton-maintain-three-point-wsl-lead","fields":{"headline":"Chelsea hold on at Everton to maintain three-point WSL lead","bodyText":"Chelsea maintained their three-point lead over Manchester City at the top of the Women’s Super League thanks to a 1-0 win at Everton.

The raid on the Museum of East Asian Art (MEAA) in Bennett Street took place at about 1.20am on Tuesday 17 April. A first-floor window was smashed and the thieves broke into several display cabinets to steal a number of artefacts described as culturally significant. Among the objects taken were a jade monkey holding a peach, jade Mandarin ducks and a Chinese stoneware vase. Police, who reached the scene within five minutes of the call alerting them, said the burglary was well planned and swift and the artefacts may have been stolen to order. DS Matthew Reed said: “Due to the items stolen and the speed of the burglary, we suspect this to be a targeted attack with the artefacts possibly stolen to order. These items range in monetary value, but their cultural significance is priceless. “I’d like to thank members of the public who have assisted us so far and ask anyone else who can help our inquiries to get in touch.” Police have seized a white Ford Transit van that had been stolen from Ballance Street in Bath and was left at the scene. Officers are keen to hear from anyone who saw the vehicle being towed or moved overnight on Monday 16 to Tuesday 17 April. Nicole Chiang, the museum’s curator, said: “We are deeply shocked and saddened by the burglary as we are preparing for our 25th anniversary celebrations. Not only do the stolen objects have significant historical and cultural value, they also hold irreplaceable emotional value for our founder.” Based in a restored Georgian townhouse close to the Royal Crescent, the MEAA bills itself as the only UK museum dedicated to the arts and cultures of eastern and south-eastern Asia. It opened in1993 and features thousands of objects from the region. Some of its Chinese art dates from 5,000BC. The independent museum was founded by Brian McElney, a former lawyer and longtime resident of Hong Kong, who donated much of his personal collection to the museum. The MEAA website said it was closed due to unforeseen circumstances and would reopen next month. The police said the items taken were: a jade monkey holding a peach, approximately 5.7cm by 2.6cm; jade mandarin ducks with lotus flowers, 7.1cm by 4.9cm by 6.3cm; an inlaid wooden covered box, 24.5cm by 14cm by 9cm; a soapstone figure of the Han dynasty scholar, writer and jester Dongfang Shuo, 11cm tall; a set of 14 gold belt plaques, ranging from 4.5cm to 12cm in length; and a Jizhou stoneware vase, 16.5cm tall and 12cm in diameter.

Girls often come in pairs. One will be popular, overtly sexual and self-possessed, and the other is a loser, who pines for popularity – and is always secretly attractive, often subjected to a makeover that will unveil their beauty to the world. “And then they’ll get deflowered and take lots of drugs and do all these wild things,” laughs Sharlene Teo. There are no such stereotypes in her first novel, Ponti, in which teenagers Szu and Circe get no makeovers, solace, or much attention from anyone. “I’ve never read a book depicting two teenage girls who are equally losers, unknowing and unattractive,” Teo says – and in Ponti, you can. The novel follows the lives of three Singaporean women: Szu, initially seen in 2003 as a bored and anxious 16-year-old who lives in a decaying house with her aunt and mother Amisa, a one-time actor who starred in a cult-horror film called Ponti!, and who now spends her days at home, conducting fake seances with her sister; and Circe, a more privileged and worldly teenager who befriends Szu at school. Leaping forward to 2020, Circe is now a demotivated and aimless thirtysomething, working as a social media consultant (the empty jargon of the industry is hilariously captured by Teo). Having lost contact with Szu after a mysterious falling out, Circe is asked to prepare a campaign for a remake of Ponti! – bringing back old ghosts of her time with her onetime friend and her actor mother. Teo deftly captures the insidious female rivalry often rife in teenage girlhood, but also the passion of that age, in which a short friendship can feel dramatically momentous. With the benefit of hindsight, Circe reflects: “Szu felt like my first test of patience: a tenuous, milk-toothed kind of love that evolved into the toil and torpor of a difficult marriage. You could say it was prophetic. I’m not exaggerating when I say that we were only 16, but I felt like we had been through decades.” The story of Szu’s mother, Amisa, is traced over several chapters. An arresting beauty, she is discovered by a film producer while working in a cinema box office in 1977. She is cast in a movie as the Pontianak: a mythological, cannibalistic beauty, created when a deformed girl makes a deal with a shaman to become beautiful. This is a real Malay myth, as explained in the novel, “told by worried wives to make their husbands wary of young, beautiful girls walking alone at night”. The shoddy B-movie never takes off, and Amisa’s dreams of reinvention morph into bitter resignation, having spent too long dreaming of a rags-to-riches narrative, only to be pushed back into rags. Exacerbating her sense of failure is the attention of loyal fans, who still send her letters 30 years later. Even her own daughter idealises her mother’s glory days, dwelling on how she can’t live up to her beauty, vowing: “One day I will learn to be as expertly cruel as she is.” When Teo won a fellowship to work on her manuscript as part of her MFA programme, her first idea was “an epic Pontianak novel”, narrated by the monster. She ended up discarding it halfway through writing it (“I cannot read it now!”) when she watched the film Berberian Sound Studio. Teo became fixated by “the idea of predestined failure’” and by the female face in film: “If you stake your whole identity on being this visual spectacle, where does that leave you?” Singapore closes in on the characters as much as the past does, Teo calling it “a character in and of itself – it excludes people and none of them feel quite at home in it.” Her vivid descriptions of its weather – skyrocketing pollution, repressive humidity – leave the reader almost sweating with the characters. Born and raised in Singapore, Teo has lived in the UK for a decade, which helped her write about her hometown. “It’s very much written in my psyche. When I try to write about London it’s not that interesting,” she says. “I guess my imagination works more when there’s gaps to fill in, so there’s that psychic and geographic distance between your imagination of the place and how it actually is.” She wanted to depict a Singapore that is not “this exoticised version, of this one-dimensional new liberal metropolis. It’s not at all like a travel guide.” Before Ponti was even finished, Teo was already receiving praise; Ian McEwan presented her with the inaugural Deborah Rogers award for first-time writers in 2016 and called the then unfinished manuscript “a remarkable first novel in the making”. After the award, the writing process became “like someone who was running away from a fire. You got this prize, this money, this validation – and if you can’t write the damn thing [Ponti], you’re like a total loser.” (Thankfully, she could). But when I ask her about her writing routines, she laments the “shaming culture” that dictates “all these didactic rules” one must follow to be considered a writer – like having to write every day. “Everybody has their own process ... You’re not a machine,” she says. “I feel like as long as you’re reading, you’re fine. If you’re a writer and you stop reading things that don’t relate directly to your work, for pleasure, then you’re fucked. What are you even doing? How can you expect people to read your stuff for pleasure if you’re not?” Ponti by Sharlene Teo is published by Picador."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"environment/2018/apr/18/americans-waste-food-fruit-vegetables-study","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-18T18:05:58Z","webTitle":"Americans waste 150,000 tons of food each day – equal to a pound per person","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/apr/18/americans-waste-food-fruit-vegetables-study","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/apr/18/americans-waste-food-fruit-vegetables-study","fields":{"headline":"Americans waste 150,000 tons of food each day – equal to a pound per person","bodyText":"Americans waste about a pound of food per person each day, with people who have healthier diets rich in fruit and vegetables the most wasteful, research has found. About 150,000 tons of food is tossed out in US households each day, equivalent to about a third of the daily calories that each American consumes. Fruit and vegetables were the most likely to be thrown out, followed by dairy and then meat. This waste has an environmental toll, with the volume of discarded food equivalent to the yearly use of 30m acres of land, 780m pounds of pesticide and 4.2tn gallons of irrigated water. Rotting food also clogs up landfills and releases methane, a powerful greenhouse gas. Researchers at the US Department of Agriculture analysed eight years of food data, up to 2014, to see where food is wasted and also what members of the public say they do at mealtimes. The research has been published in Plos One. The study found that the healthiest Americans are the most wasteful, because of their high consumption of fruits and vegetables, which are frequently thrown out. Fruit and vegetables require less land to grow than than other foods, such as meat, but require a large amount of water and pesticides. Lisa Jahns, a nutritionist at USDA and co-author of the study, said: “We need a simultaneous effort to increase food quality as well as reduce food waste. We need to put both of those things out.” Jahns’s study recommends educating consumers on fruit and vegetable storage in order to reduce food waste. She said: “Consumers aren’t connecting the dots, [and] they don’t see the cost when they throw food in the trash. At the same time, we don’t want to undermine legitimate food safety concerns and we need to be aware it’s not just the cost of food that’s the issue. It’s the time and energy required to prepare and store food, which often isn’t a priority in a busy household.” Food waste occurs from farm to the plate in the US, with separate research released this week showing that American supermarkets are failing to address the issue. The report, by the Center for Biological Diversity, found that just four of the 10 largest grocery chains in the US have specific food waste reduction commitments. A further four out of the 10 don’t prevent the waste of food considered too cosmetically “imperfect” to sell. Walmart achieved the highest grade, a B, while Aldi US was the worst. Trader Joe’s, Target and Whole Foods all did poorly, ranked with a D. “There is just so much wasted food at so many levels,” said Jordan Figueiredo, who runs the “Ugly” Fruit and Veg Campaign and collaborated on the report. “Supermarkets usually get a free pass for doing anything to reduce wasted food or donate extra food. There is so much more they can and should do to reduce wasted food, especially given that they are essentially the gatekeepers for our food.” Figueiredo said there needs to be better funding for food recovery and wider use of composting, which is only available to about one in 10 Americans."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/apr/19/britain-housing-market-broken-labour-council-houses","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-19T05:31:08Z","webTitle":"Britain’s housing market is broken.

Here’s how Labour will fix it","bodyText":"The housing market is broken, and, after eight long years it is clear that current Conservative housing policy is failing to fix it. Ministers talk big about housebuilding targets to be reached some time in the next decade. But what new homes we build, and who they’re for, matter just as much as how many we build. To make housing more affordable, we need to build more affordable homes, and to hardwire housing affordability through the system, from planning to funding to delivery. The public know this: eight in 10 people think ministers should be doing more to get affordable housing built. That’s why Jeremy Corbyn and I are launching Labour’s green paper: Housing for the Many. It will be Labour’s lodestar as we set out our ambition to build 1m genuinely affordable homes over 10 years, including the biggest council housebuilding programme for over 30 years. In the past, this scale of ambition was seen as common sense – a Labour government will show that it still makes sense. Because even the word “affordable” has been corrupted and discredited under the Tories, we will redefine and reclaim affordable housing – doing away with the Conservatives’ bogus “affordable rent” at up to 80% of market rates and replacing it with genuinely affordable homes to rent and buy linked to average incomes. We will build for those who need it, including the very poorest and most vulnerable, with a big boost to new social rented homes. And we will also build Labour’s new affordable homes for those in work on ordinary incomes who are priced out of the housing market and being failed by housing policy. This is the “just coping” class in Britain today, who do the jobs we all rely on – IT workers, HGV drivers, joiners, warehouse managers, lab technicians, nurses, teaching assistants, call centre supervisors, shop staff. We must start by halting the huge loss of the vital affordable homes we already have. So we’ll stop the sell-off of 50,000 social rented homes a year by suspending the right to buy, ending all conversions to “affordable rent” and scrapping the government’s plans to force councils to sell the best of their homes. We will transform the planning system with a new duty to deliver affordable homes, an English Sovereign Land Trust to make more land available more cheaply and an end to the “viability” loophole that lets commercial developers dodge their obligation to deliver affordable homes. And we will back councils, housing associations and community providers with the funding and flexibility to build big for their communities. Our efforts to transform affordable housing has been redoubled after the terrible fire at Grenfell Tower, a tragedy that shocked the nation. When a country as decent and well-off as ours cannot ensure something as basic as a safe home for all its citizens, things must change. And when Grenfell survivors contributing to our green paper say that “tenants were victims before the fire” and “we’re treated as second-class citizens in social housing”, then radical, root-and-branch reform is needed. So we will make safe homes for all the very highest priority, with sprinklers fitted in high-rise blocks and fire safety the first standard in a new decent homes programme. And we will give new rights for affordable housing residents, including tenants on boards, a new national tenants’ commissioner, new transparency standards and a vote on estate regeneration schemes. The green paper is a signal of our intent and ambition to fundamentally change the housing prospects for millions of people in this country – and to lead a new national debate about how we can finally bring an end to Britain’s housing crisis. • John Healey is shadow secretary of state for housing and planning"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"science/2018/apr/19/mystery-of-sea-nomads-amazing-ability-to-freedive-is-solved","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-19T16:00:10Z","webTitle":"Mystery of sea nomads' amazing ability to freedive is solved","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/apr/19/mystery-of-sea-nomads-amazing-ability-to-freedive-is-solved","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2018/apr/19/mystery-of-sea-nomads-amazing-ability-to-freedive-is-solved","fields":{"headline":"Mystery of sea nomads' amazing ability to freedive is solved","bodyText":"The secret behind the ability of a group of “sea nomads” in Southeast Asia to hold their breath for extraordinary periods of time while freediving to hunt fish has finally been revealed – and it’s down to evolution. The Bajau people are able to dive tens of metres underwater with no conventional diving aids. Instead they rely on weights, handmade wooden goggles – and a single breath of air. But while the Bajau people’s talents have long been known, it was unclear whether the skill was the result of practice, as in the case of the excellent underwater vision of Thai “sea nomad” children, or the result of adaptations which have their roots in the Bajau people’s DNA. Now experts say they have the answer: over time the Bajau people have undergone natural selection, resulting in certain versions of genes becoming widespread – many of which are linked to biological changes, including having a larger spleen, that could help the Bajau to hold their breath underwater for many minutes at a time. The team say the findings could eventually prove useful in medical settings, potentially allowing experts to identify patients that might be at greater risk of death if they experience a lack of oxygen, for example during surgery. “There seems to be so much to learn from the Bajau and other diving populations about how the human body is able to react to oxygen deprivation, which is an important medical issue,” said Dr Melissa Ilardo, first author of the study who was at the University of Copenhagen at the time of the research. Writing in the journal Cell, the scientists reveal how they unpicked the mystery following a clue from previous research: species of seals which can dive for longer have larger than expected spleens – an organ which, among its functions, can store oxygen-carrying red blood cells. As a result the team used an ultrasound device to measure the spleen in 43 Bajau people and 33 people from a neighbouring group of farming people, the Saluan. “The spleen size is about 50% larger in these sea nomads than it is in the [Saluan], so already it was like ‘Oh my God – it is really [an] extreme physiological characteristic,” said Prof Eske Willerslev, a co-author of the study from the University of Cambridge. The team note the trend held regardless of whether the Bajau individual was themselves a diver, and even when factors such as age, sex and height were taken into account. Genetic testing revealed that certain versions of genes are more commonly found in Bajau people than would be expected, with many apparently linked to biological changes that could help individuals cope with low-oxygen conditions. Among them is a form of a gene linked to an increased spleen size – an effect the team reveal is likely down to an increase in thyroid hormone levels. Crucially, a contraction of the spleen is one of the features of the so called “diving reflex” – a set of responses in mammals that occur when the head is submerged. A large spleen means even more oxygen-carrying red blood cells can be pumped into the circulatory system when the organ contracts, allowing individuals to stay underwater for longer. Another is a form of a gene linked to a different feature of the diving reflex: narrowing of the blood vessels to the extremities, aiding delivery of oxygenated blood to organs such as the brain, heart and lungs. Further analysis by the team revealed that these genetic boons are not the result of chance, but evolutionary adaptations arising from natural selection. Stephen Stearns, professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at Yale University who was not involved in the research, saidthe study adds to evidence for recent natural selection on certain genes in human populations – with previous examples including genes for lactose tolerance that cropped up with the advent of domestication of dairy animals, and genes for adaptation to high altitude in Tibetans and Native Americans in the Andes. “What we lack at this point, and badly need, are samples large enough to allow us to infer when the selection [in the Bajau] started to happen,” he said. “We know that the Bajau have been leading this lifestyle for at least a thousand years, but we do not know when they started it – perhaps much earlier.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/apr/18/daphne-caruana-galizia-murder-eu-politicians-demand-broader-inquiry-malta-police-chief","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-18T18:36:36Z","webTitle":"EU politicians demand broader inquiry into Daphne Caruana Galizia murder","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/18/daphne-caruana-galizia-murder-eu-politicians-demand-broader-inquiry-malta-police-chief","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/apr/18/daphne-caruana-galizia-murder-eu-politicians-demand-broader-inquiry-malta-police-chief","fields":{"headline":"EU politicians demand broader inquiry into Daphne Caruana Galizia murder","bodyText":"Politicians across Europe have demanded that Malta’s chief of police broaden the investigation into the killing of Daphne Caruana Galizia so that it pursues more aggressively those “with a motivation for silencing” the anti-corruption journalist. Their intervention comes following Tuesday’s launch of the Daphne Project, a collaboration between international media organisations, including the Guardian, that came together in response to her murder and have pledged to continue her work. The publication of a first wave of stories by the 18 media partners, including the New York Times, Le Monde and Süddeutsche Zeitung, caused an uproar in Malta, and provoked widespread concern over the slow progress of the inquiry. Describing the assassination of Caruana Galizia as horrifying, Dunja Mijatović, commissioner for human rights at the Council of Europe, said: “Six months after her killing, it does not appear that the Maltese authorities have made any tangible progress to identify the masterminds.” The Portuguese MEP Ana Gomes, who led a parliamentary delegation to investigate the rule of law in Malta following Caruana Galizia’s assassination on 16 October, published a video message addressed directly to Lawrence Cutajar, Malta’s commissioner of police. She said the inquiry needed to look at people who had “a motivation for silencing Daphne”. “Everyone knows that the police investigation needs to be widened to include suspected individuals who could have commissioned the assassination,” Gomes said. Three men are in custody and awaiting trial for planting and triggering the car bomb that killed the journalist near her home in northern Malta. The suspects, George and Alfred Degiorgio and their associate Vincent Muscat, have pleaded not guilty. Police are still hunting whoever may have commissioned the attack. Among a series of other developments: Some supporters of Malta’s ruling Labour party rounded on Caruana Galizia’s husband and three sons, with a call for citizens to march in protest at their “provocation”. The family have claimed that elements in government are hampering the police investigation. The magisterial inquiry into the murder case made a surprise on-site inspection in the northern village of Bidnija, where the journalist was killed. The three accused men, accompanied by armed officers and lawyers, looked on as the magistrate was shown key locations by the officer leading the homicide inquiry. The European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, came under fire from an influential MEP for his allegedly “intimate” relationship with Malta’s prime minister, which he said had in effect given the country licence to act with impunity. The opposition MP and former leader of Malta’s opposition, Simon Busuttil, was targeted by police, who summoned him for questioning after he allegedly allowed his personal car to be used to carry political posters. Caruana Galizia ran a popular political blog in which she took on businessmen and politicians from both of Malta’s leading parties. By the time of her death, she was defending 47 individual libel suits. In an interview 10 days before her death, published on Tuesday by the Daphne Project, Caruana Galizia detailed decades of politically motivated threats and harassment. These included an arson attack on her home, attacks in the media and the freezing of her bank accounts. A recording of the interview has been sent to the EU justice commissioner, Věra Jourová. “Why are the Maltese police authorities not considering this interview as a lead in the investigations?” Gomes asked in her video address. “I request, Mr Commissioner, that the recording of this interview be preserved and be followed as a lead in the police investigations.” Sophia in ’t Veld, the Dutch MEP and deputy leader of the liberal group in the European parliament, added: “There is still deep concern across Europe about the tragic murder of Daphne Caruana Galizia. I’m personally horrified by reports that the investigation may be being hampered and justice denied to her family members. “We need reassurance that the government of Malta really wants to get to the bottom of who was responsible for ordering Daphne’s assassination. If we have to raise this issue again in the European parliament and elsewhere, we won’t hesitate to do so.” As political tensions within Malta escalated, Busuttil tweeted that he had been summoned to appear at Valletta police headquarters at 3pm on Thursday. He is to face questions about the use of his car while posters were put up to mark the six-month anniversary of Caruana Galizia’s murder. Speaking to the Guardian, he described the action against him as “beyond Orwellian”, adding that it was “straight out of a police state”. Juncker came under fire from one influential MEP for an allegedly “intimate” relationship with Joseph Muscat, which the parliamentarian said had in effect given Malta a “blank cheque” to act as it pleased. Sven Giegold, a German MEP and frequent critic of the Maltese government, said: “There is a systematic problem of a breach in the rule of law and this is being covered up by the commission. Even after the death of Daphne it is still being covered up, and I find that outrageous.” A European commission spokesperson did not respond directly to personal criticism of Juncker but rejected suggestions of covering up violations of the rule of law in Malta. “The commission expects an independent and thorough investigation of Daphne Caruana Galizia’s murder. We have made this point at all levels, with different interlocutors, and our position is known and allegations that claim differently are simply false,” the spokesperson said. “We urge the responsible authorities to continue the ongoing investigation up and until the persons responsible for this crime have been found and justice is served.” For security reasons, Caruana Galizia’s sons have been advised to stay away from Malta. All three live and work abroad. Their father remains at the family home in Bidnija, where he is under 24-hour police guard. In Bidnija on Wednesday, the three accused were led to the scene of the crime. With their hands cuffed, they followed proceedings as Insp Keith Arnaud of the Malta homicide squad accompanied the magistrate to the ridge of a hill. Investigators allege that the former gun battery, which has clear views of Caruana Galizia’s home and the road below it, was used as a lookout point by Alfred Degiorgio in the weeks preceding the attack. Arnaud has given evidence that he collected a fresh cigarette butt from the scene just after the bombing, and that lab tests found traces of Alfred Degiorgio’s DNA. The magistrate, Claire Stafrace Zammit, has ruled that there was enough evidence for the three to stand trial but has not made a decision on whether an application for bail should be granted."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/live/2018/apr/18/bournemouth-v-manchester-united-premier-league-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-18T20:42:20Z","webTitle":"Bournemouth 0-2 Manchester United: Premier League – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2018/apr/18/bournemouth-v-manchester-united-premier-league-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/live/2018/apr/18/bournemouth-v-manchester-united-premier-league-live","fields":{"headline":"Bournemouth 0-2 Manchester United: Premier League – as it happened","bodyText":"Read Paul Doyle’s report from the Vitality Stadium. Manchester United have cut Manchester City’s lead to ONLY 13 points. Hooray! More importantly, they’ve responded well to the West Brom debacle and this win means they effectively only need a point to confirm their place in the top four. Jose Mourinho will be pleased. He’s seen plenty of players stake a claim for a starting place in Saturday’s FA Cup semi-final against Tottenham. Paul Pogba was excellent. It’s been a productive night, although Bournemouth will argue the outcome would have been different if Callum Wilson had been awarded a penalty when it was only 1-0. Thanks for reading and emailing. Bye. It’s all over. 90 min: There will be four added minutes. Jose Mourinho is still grinning madly scowling. 87 min: Blind introduces some comedy. Just as he’s preparing to unleash a shot with his left foot, the ball hits his standing right and he swipes at thin air. We can all empathise with him. 84 min: Wilson beats the lunging Jones before being bundled over by Smalling. Nothing doing despite his appeals. 83 min: Jermain Defoe replaces Josh King. 82 min: Mousset shoots over from a tight angle. 80 min: Daley Blind replaces the excellent Paul Pogba, who played like a man with a point to prove. 78 min: United are in complete control. 75 min: Dan Gosling replaces Andrew Surman. 72 min: Nemanja Matic replaces Ander Herrera. Martial leads a break on the left before finding Pogba, who hurtles away before slipping a pass through to Lukaku. Ake can’t reach Lukaku, who lifts the ball over the onrushing Begovic. Lukaku has done it against Bournemouth again. Jose Mourinho does not smile. He does not leave his seat on the bench. 69 min: Rashford fizzes a drive straight at Begovic from 20 yards. 68 min: Surman’s booked for clattering into Herrera. 67 min: The free-kick is right on the edge of the area, in the middle of the D. Pogba and Lukaku stand over the ball. Lukaku slams it straight into the wall. What a waste. 66 min: Mousset clips Pogba’s heels this far outside the Bournemouth area. What a chance for United to double their lead here. 65 min: Martial relieves some pressure with a powerful run. He finds Rashford, whose shot’s deflected wide. 64 min: Lewis Cook breaks past a feeble challenge from Herrera and knocks a pass through to Wilson. The striker’s first touch isn’t great, though, and Jones is able to deflect his shot behind. From the resulting corner, the ball drops to King after a header from Ake, but he can’t get his shot away. Bournemouth feel Jones was holding King back. 63 min: Romelu Lukaku, so often the scourge of Bournemouth, replaces Jesse Lingard. 62 min: United counter and Pogba bursts away, only for Steve Cook to hack him down cynically from behind. A poor challenge and he deserves his booking. 60 min: Smalling’s booked for hauling Wilson down. United are starting to make a few errors. 58 min: Mousset makes an instant impact, barreling down the left. He’s tackled and the ball runs to Daniels, who sees his cross deflected over. The corner comes to nothing. Nor does a Bournemouth free-kick on the right. But this is better from Howe’s men. 57 min: Lys Mousset replaces Jordon Ibe. It’s an attacking change from Eddie How. 56 min: Fraser pings a pass down the left to King, who’s away. King clips a cross into the middle and it looks certain that Wilson will score from close range. Somehow, though, he fails to make any contact with his volley. And why’s that? Because Luke Shaw was fouling him. He had his arms round the striker, a point Wilson makes forcibly to Graham Scott, but the referee waves away Bournemouth’s appeals for a penalty. 52 min: Surman’s corner is headed away and United break. Pogba surges down the right, spins and sprays a lovely pass through to Rashford. He’s forced wide, though, and he can’t pick out a team-mate. Still, United will fancy their chances on the break. 51 min: Wilson hares down a long punt down the right channel, holds of Smalling and wins a corner. 49 min: Lewis Cook brings down the flying Jesse Lingard. He’s booked. 48 min: Rashford finds Pogba on the edge of the area. Pogba tries a backheel. It doesn’t come off. Moments later, after Martial’s ended a promising run with a shot that’s blocked by a desperate Steve Cook, he tries some stepovers on the left and mishits a cross at Begovic. Keep it simple, Paul. Be more like Marouane. 46 min: Bournemouth get the second half underway. Eddie Howe will want to see much more from them. But it takes them less than half a minute to give the ball away, Fraser far too sloppy. A dull half draws to a close. United lead thanks to a goal from Chris Smalling. 45 min+1: A long throw from Francis lands at Steve Cook’s feet. His shot’s deflected wide for a corner. Nothing comes from it, but Bournemouth keep pushing, only for Fellaini to intercept Ibe’s dangerous cross. 45 min: Wilson takes too long to make up his mind and gets tackled b Fellaini. But the assertive Ake steams in to win possession and force his way through the middle. He’s knocked over but an advantage is played when the ball runs to King on the right. He shoots from 18 yards, but it’s straight at De Gea who pushes it away. 43 min: King breaks down the left, with plenty of options in the middle, but his cross is poor. Bournemouth have wasted a few decent positions. 40 min: Bournemouth are lacking inspiration. 37 min: Bournemouth have been outplayed in midfield. That’s Marouane Fellaini’s influence for you. 35 min: Pogba nips a pass through to Martial. But he’s offside. 33 min: Bournemouth haven’t been ahead at half-time in a home game since 30 December. They don’t start well here. Indeed they’ve only scored the opening goal at home once since then, in the 4-1 defeat to Tottenham last month. 31 min: Lewis Cook bustles through the middle, no one there to stop him. He moves the ball to Fraser, who ducks inside, but he’s off balance and rushed as he shoots and it’s an easy save for De Gea. This is a fine goal. Ander Herrera slides a lovely pass through to Jesse Lingard, who’s peeled away from three or four ball-watching Bournemouth defenders. Lingard keeps his head and drills a low cross into the six-yard box, where Chris Smalling slides in for a simple finish. 27 min: Ake and Rashford race for a loose ball. Ake gets there first and looks to dribble away. But just as he’s about to send the ball up the left flank, Rashford slides in to win possession. The linesman’s right there and he sees no foul, so Rashford’s able to spring up and charge into the area. He decides he might as well shoot and it’s a good effort, stinging the palms of Begovic, who does well to push the ball to safety. 24 min: Bournemouth break at last, Fraser sending Lewis Cook down the left. Cook holds the ball up, swivels and then plays a nice pass back to Fraser, who hurtles into the area before seeing his shot deflected wide of the near post. Bournemouth take the corner shot, with United dozing, but Daniels is beaten to the ball by Jones after threatening to burst into the area again. Better from the hosts. 23 min: Shaw hoists a cross to the far post. Fellaini can’t beat Daniels, though. Bournemouth are a bit of pressure here. Herrera bustles King off the ball. Martial’s shot’s charged down. 20 min: This is drab. 18 min: Martial, United’s most enterprising player, glides through on the left again, only to overrun the ball as he enters a dangerous area, allowing Ake to clear. 16 min: Rashford’s corner is headed away at the near post. Eventually the ball comes to Herrera, 25 yards out, and he skews a shot over. 15 min: Rashford slips a pass through to Lingard on the left. Steve Cook deflects his cross behind for a corner. 14 min: United enjoy some more possession. Then a pass finds Lingard in space. He turns and overhits a through-ball. Mourinho is unmoved. 12 min: Possession update: 62-38 in United’s favour. Take that, Josep! 11 min: Daniels sprays a pass down the line, looking for Wilson, who’s made another good run. He waits for support before finding Ibe, who drills a shot harmlessly wide from 18 yards. Bournemouth will be encouraged, though. 10 min: Wilson chests down a long ball and lays it off to Lewis Cook, who instantly knocks it back into the path of the Bournemouth striker. Momentarily Wilson seems to have the beating of Phil Jones, but the United centre-back does well to recover and outmuscle his man. 9 min: Pogba picks up possession outside Bournemouth’s area. He does no stepovers. Instead he lifts a pass to the far stick for Fellaini, who velcro-chests it down, only for the flag to go up. 8 min: Daniels makes progress down the left, but his cutback’s dealt with by Herrera. 7 min: “Interesting that the squad starting this game, bar Pogba, were all at the club pre-Mourinho,” says Matthias Hammer. “Indeed, I count 4 Mourinho signings among the players dropped. I certainly can’t help but question United’s transfer policy in recent years. How many of United’s big name signings have actually been an unqualified success?” 6 min: Smalling clips a pass over the top for Rashford, but the flag goes up for offside. 4 min: United counter, Martial linking with Pogba and driving at Bournemouth on the left. He wins a corner. Begovic punches it away. “Apart from Pogba, this is pretty much a Louis van Gaal side out there,” says Sanchit Sabhlok. “Which is ironic given that Mourinho probably got these guys in to play faster but lest we forget van Gaal’s second season was a snoozefest. But hey, Martial and Rashford start together! I’m not complaining!” 3 min: The free-kick is to the left of the D, favouring a right-footer. But Bournemouth try to catch United out. Fraser runs up as though he’s going to shoot, only to touch the ball to Francis, who sees his low shot charged down. 2 min: King dribbles inside and is taken down by Herrera 25 yards from goal. Peep! We’re off, Manchester United getting the game underway and kicking from left to right in the first half. They’re in white, Bournemouth are in red and black. Here come the teams! The Vitality Stadium’s bouncing, the sun’s out and it’s almost time for some soccer! Jose Mourinho speaks! “I would say that Matic is looking at Saturday. But not every player out of the team is for the semi. the message is always the same. People sometimes in the stadium or at home can be confused with my message. because my message sometimes is not what people think it is. But in the last match for example the only attacking player I didn’t play was Dwight Yorke, who was in the stands, and I almost brought him on. I put six on and Dwight is quite fit. The message sometimes is different from what people think. We have a fresh team. We cannot complain about 24 hours less than Bournemouth. The majority of players didn’t play the last match and even the ones that started, like Herrera and Paul, Herrera played 45 minutes and Paul played 55, so it is a team where only Chris Smalling played for 90 minutes. My message today was not to speak about the semi-final. It is that we need four or five points to confirm top four. That is target No1 for today. If it is not possible to win, at least reduce it by one point. Saturday the objective is to reach the final.” Eddie Howe speaks! “We love entertaining the big clubs and we’re looking forward to it. We’re desperate to win. I expect a much better performance from the team today.” Bournemouth make two changes from the team that lost 3-0 at Anfield on Saturday. Dan Gosling and Jermain Defoe drop to the bench and are replaced by Andrew Surman and Callum Wilson. Jose Mourinho swings the axe, making a total of seven changes to the Manchester United side that lost to West Brom on Sunday. Out go Antonio Valencia, Victor Lindelof, Ashley Young, Nemanja Matic, Juan Mata, Alexis Sanchez and Romelu Lukaku. In come Phil Jones, Luke Shaw, Marouane Fellaini, Jesse Lingard, Marcus Rashford and Anthony Martial. Paul Pogba starts despite suggestions that he would be dropped. Although you almost wonder if that means he won’t play against Tottenham on Saturday. Bournemouth: Begovic; Francis, S Cook, Ake, Daniels; Fraser, L Cook, Surman, Ibe; King; Wilson. Subs: Boruc, Simpson, Gosling, Arter, Pugh, Mousset, Defoe. Manchester United: De Gea; Darmian, Jones, Smalling, Shaw; Herrera, Fellaini, Pogba; Lingard, Rashford, Martial. Subs: Pereira, Bailly, Blind, Young, Matic, Sanchez, Lukaku. Referee: Graham Scott. Hello. On the whole, Manchester United probably don’t really want to be more like Bournemouth. After all, Bournemouth have never won anything, they’re 11th in the Premier League, their stadium’s tiny, they’ve never been asked to promote a superhero film and they don’t even have an Official Office Equipment Partner. Or an Official Outdoor Apparel Partner. Tsk. They’re not doing football right! And yet they’re happy. How strange. Despite their lack of an Official Tyre Partner, they’re content with their lot in life and it isn’t really that perplexing when you think about it. Bournemouth are unlikely to ever win anything big. They’ll probably never qualify for the Champions League. They might never play in the Europa League. But what they do is enjoy themselves on the pitch. Eddie Howe’s side play with identity, spirit and togetherness and they have style and panache. They entertain their supporters. Howe isn’t some cavalier dilettante, but he likes his players to take risks and he trusts in his methods, even in difficult times. It’s a refreshing approach in a business that sometimes takes itself too seriously and United look like they could do some of that carefree attitude. Sure, they’re never going to be one of the most expansive teams as long as Jose Mourinho is around. But as they digest conceding the title to Manchester City with that comically limp defeat to West Brom on Sunday, perhaps they could loosen up a little. Perhaps Jose could turn that frown upside down. Perhaps, instead of feeling sorry for themselves, they could use tonight as an opportunity to rediscover some joy. This, after all, isn’t really an important game. It’s a chance for everyone to have some fun, for United’s attacking players to develop something resembling an understanding, to find a way of not feeling so horribly cramped. Bournemouth, 10 points clear of the bottom three, are surely safe for another season and will spy a chance to a second win over United in three home outings. They’ll go for it. Instead of fretting about this Saturday’s FA Cup semi-final against Tottenham, instead of feeling sorry for themselves after the West Brom fiasco, instead of going back to basics as a form of self-punishment, United could consider responding in kind. Over to you, Jose.

It’s not my first choice. Not that I don’t get on with them – I do, but before I went travelling I lived in London and had moved away to university, so I’ve had my taste of freedom. Compared with some people’s parents, mine are very generous. They don’t make me pay rent. My mum calls me a “boomerang child”. I’ve got a new job as a property auctioneer’s assistant in London. I’ll be doing the sales pitches and the prep for the auctions. When I started earning money, my attitude towards it changed – I became thrifty. When I commuted to London, before I went travelling, I took the slow train rather than the fast one to save £250 a month. I never buy lunch. I take my own just because I know that had I spent £8 a day on it, I wouldn’t have been able to go travelling. I also always get the bus rather than the tube to save costs. I owe the Student Loans Company £42,000, which I borrowed to study geography at Newcastle University. I knew when I signed up that I would have it. So it doesn’t hang over me every day. I pay it back in tiny amounts compared with what I earn. I think it’s worth it. I wouldn’t be where I am if I hadn’t got a degree. I have tallied up how long it will take to save up a £20,000 deposit for a house, and, on my current salary, setting aside money at the rate I was doing to go travelling, it will take seven years. Even then, I won’t be able to afford to buy in London. I’d have to move elsewhere and be realistic about the kind of property I can afford. I don’t think it’s unachievable. When I left Newcastle I moved back home, and that summer I worked as a waitress at Wimbledon. Because of the tips I made quite a lot of money. In two weeks I earned roughly £1,500, which I was able to save. I then did an internship with the local planning department for four months and was paid £100 a week. At that point, I really didn’t have any money. I did struggle and didn’t do a lot. That winter I did a ski season in Val d’Isère in France, which I paid for out of my savings from Wimbledon. They said I’d earn a good wage out there, but what they didn’t mention was that they’d deduct money for a ski pass, equipment, insurance and accommodation, and I was just left with minimal spending money a day. When I came back from the ski season I worked for Savills for a year on £22,500. I saved up £8,000 as I knew I wanted to travel. While away I worked in a coffee shop in Sydney. I stayed with a family and got bed and board in return for walking their dog. I want to move back to London, but I’m waiting for my boyfriend, who’s travelling, before I do. We used to rent a room in a house in Clapham Junction for £850 a month plus bills, which we split. I won’t pay that kind of price on my own, although I know a lot of people do. My new job is going to sponsor me to do a master’s and an APC surveyor’s qualification concurrently. It will mean studying evenings and weekends. I worked hard at university, I got a first class, so I know the work that needs to go in and the rewards afterwards. In terms of the next five years, I’ll be staying put and trying to work my way up, qualifying as a surveyor so I can ultimately earn more money."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/apr/19/windrush-theresa-may-immigrants","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-19T05:00:07Z","webTitle":"It’s not just Windrush. Theresa May has created hostility to all immigrants | Nesrine Malik","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/19/windrush-theresa-may-immigrants","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/19/windrush-theresa-may-immigrants","fields":{"headline":"It’s not just Windrush. Theresa May has created hostility to all immigrants","bodyText":"To the politicians who presided over a long-term policy to use every means possible to reject and eject as many people from the UK, regardless of extenuating circumstances or status (up to and including whether they came to the country as British subjects or citizens), the Windrush scandal appears to be an aberration. Amber Rudd called the treatment “appalling”, as if she had no responsibility for it as the current home secretary. Caroline Nokes, the immigration minister, revealed that there had been deportations but that she did not know how many, and that the situation “as a minister” had “appalled” her. Theresa May, in her apology to Caribbean leaders, described the violations as simply unforeseen fallout from recently introduced policies that clamped down on the undocumented. Yet in her six years as home secretary she was the high priestess of hostile environments for immigrants. But the prime minister and Tory MPs and advisers have been falling over themselves on social media to appear shocked and to abhor what has been happening. It is a roll call of the shameless and brazenly amnesiac. It’s all just a quirk of the system you see, a mechanical fault, an unintended consequence, is the narrative. But a miscarriage at the scale that every day seems to grow more bewildering is too large to be attributed to clerical error or incompetence. It is in the official documents. The Home Office annual report from last year stated that: “In January 2016, we broadened our engagement activity in priority countries to maximise returns of all nationals in the UK illegally.” In 2014 the government removed a key protection from the statute books for some British residents of the Windrush generation who could face deportation. Official handbooks were printed, giving instructions to deportees. One clause in particular is a smoking gun, “try to be Jamaican – use local accents and dialect (overseas accents can attract unwanted attention)”. The Home Office had created a whole guidebook based on the premise that it was sending people to a land that was foreign to them. It is bewildering to watch May have the gall, even in the face of such an obvious breadcrumb trail, to attempt to minimise the problem and urge people to engage in this doublethink. During prime minister’s questions this week she offered a robotic apology but stopped short of accountability, or a promise of reform. But for her to admit that this is just one example of the immigration policies the Home Office has been instructed to execute would rightly invalidate the whole system and trigger a loss of faith. And it would mean holding May accountable. Little has animated the bloodless May more than her hostility to immigration, and under her leadership the Home Office became a ruthless tool of persecution. Never mind Rudd, merely a pliant executor of May’s obsession with the “tens of thousands” net migration target. If the buck stops anywhere, it stops with the prime minister. If you are angry about the treatment of the Windrush generation it is important to understand that this anger cannot be selective, if there are to be no more violations. There is no cross-party, cross-media support for a different type of immigration policy victim than the Windrush scandal has managed to muster. Not for those who are illegally detained, those on hunger strike in protest against poor conditions. Not for those whose illnesses were treated as lies and to which they later succumbed. Not for the sexually exploited and not for the children separated from their parents. Not even for those British subjects separated from their families by unreasonably high income visa requirements. During my own long battle with the Home Office to secure residency, I spent many hours in Croydon. I went on one occasion to withdraw my passport, which had languished unprocessed for months, to travel to see my sick mother. Driven wild with fear that I would not be able to see her if the unthinkable happened, I was ready to risk not being allowed back in the country. The waiting room was a holding pen of quiet individual tragedies, full of people whose personal and professional lives had been thrown into turmoil by loss of documents, technical glitches and glacial incompetence. The cruelty we all experienced was not a bug, it was a feature. The scandal of the Windrush generation is the kind of thing that happens when this rot sets in so deep that the infrastructure of a civilised society begins to fall apart. The rise in the number of the persecuted is analogous to the doubling in deaths of homeless people. There is only so much austerity an economy can take before the human toll rises. And there is only so much ideological fixation on “sending people home” before we are deporting grandmothers who arrived in this country when they were children. And make no mistake, it is ideological. The Conservative party has been consistent in its aggressive immigration policy since 2010, when David Cameron decided that a tough stance on immigration was a flagship party offering to its base supporters. No ifs, no buts, he said. Detention, deportation and NHS treatment refusal is the culmination of the party’s most lucid positions. It is not incompetence, it is not even malice. It is an enthusiastic strategy that over the past decade has become a cornerstone, a defining element of Conservative governments. An immigration policy, very much like austerity, unafraid to be brutal if the deserving, whether they are the “indigenous population” of the country or hardworking taxpayers, are to be protected from those who are after a “free ride”. There has been no bureaucratic snafu. The only miscalculation was that everyone got a little bit cocky, and who can blame them. The error was that the dragnet picked up some people who fall into a popular sympathy sweet spot. The elderly ones who came here from the Commonwealth to rebuild Britain and who even the Daily Mail can look kindly upon. They appeal to a patrician nostalgia and have a humanising narrative that others who come to this country in different circumstances do not enjoy. An apology and exceptions made for Windrush cases alone is not enough. If we are to be content with only this, then the government’s furtive shimmy away from the crime scene will be successful, and the Home Office’s daily violations of human rights will continue. If we are to prevent the assaults against those we can relate to, we must also be angry for those we cannot. • Nesrine Malik is a Guardian columnist.

But what if that one small step had been taken by a woman? What kind of leap would that have represented, at a time when the American public was waking up to women’s rights? That’s the focus of Mercury 13, a Netflix documentary that explores the fates of 13 female pilots who were prevented from entering Nasa’s space training program. The women featured in the film passed through some of the same physiological and psychological testing procedures as Nasa’s first male astronauts, as the space race with Russia ramped up in the early 1960s. In some cases, the women, each of them skilled flyers, fared better than their male counterparts, but their testing, which was designed to assess their suitability for space flight, was conducted with private funding without the approval of Nasa. As the women prepared to undergo further testing, which would have included flying jet planes, Nasa refused to extend the project. The women’s dreams were shattered, and it would be more than two decades before an American woman made it into space. After the release of Hidden Figures in 2016, which told the story of three black women who struggled for acceptance at Nasa during the space race, Mercury 13 offers a further glimpse into the difficulty women faced in breaking into the field. “I think it’s important to tell people that women were involved in the space program. There’s lots of films about the space program and lots of stories about the space program but they generally focus on men,” said Heather Walsh, who co-directed Mercury 13 with David Sington. “So I think it’s good to draw out these stories and show that women might not have been talked about but they were there, and they did help, and they did do their bit.” The film follows the story of the 13 women and their legal battle before Congress in 1962, arguing that they were prevented from further space testing and training on sexual discrimination grounds. Their case captured the imagination of the American public, but was rejected by President Johnson. It was a missed opportunity. Russia sent the first woman – Valentina Tereshkova – into space in 1963, winning a propaganda battle that the US could have otherwise claimed. Walsh believes there would have been greater implications than just a propaganda victory, had the US backed the Mercury 13 women. “I think everything would have changed. I think there would have been a female president by now,” she said. “Being an astronaut at that time was the pinnacle of what you could do. You know, the whole world was watching. And when you step out on to the moon there wasn’t a person on the planet that didn’t want to see you and didn’t know who you were. “And I think if that person was a woman it would have would have changed things. It would have seemed normal for women to do anything.” Mercury 13 interviews Wally Funk, Rhea Woltman, Sarah Ratley and Gene Nora Jessen, each of the women participated in space-readiness testing conducted by Dr William Randy Lovelace, who had helped develop the physical and psychological examinations used to select the first team of astronauts for the Nasa training program. Named Project Mercury, it was America’s first human spaceflight program, and would see Alan Shepard become the first American in space in 1962. Lovelace was close friends with Jacqueline Cochran, whose pilot skills had propelled her to fame in the 1930s. Cochran had set women’s national speed records and was involved in setting up establishing Women Airforce Service Pilots, who performed non-combat flying missions during the second world war. Cochran and Lovelace felt women had a role to play in space. Outside his contract with Nasa, Lovelace began a private screening program, conducting the same tests he had devised for men on female pilots. Jerrie Cobb, who later became a staunch advocate for female flyers, was the first to undergo space testing, but faced resistance in the media. Mercury 13 shows one clip from a television interview in the early 1960s that particularly illustrates the opposition the women faced. In the interview Cobb is quizzed as to why “there is a need” for women in space. She answered: “Well it’s the same thing as is there a need for men in space. I mean, if we’re going to send a human being into space we should send the one most qualified. And in certain areas women have to offer, in other areas men do. I think we ought to use both.” Sington, who previously directed In the Shadow of the Moon, a documentary about manned US missions to the moon, said he and Walsh had originally hoped to bring Hillary Clinton’s success in the 2016 election into the film. Clinton has often told a story about writing to Nasa as a teenager, asking how she could become an astronaut. She said she received a letter back “saying they weren’t accepting women”, and Sington said contrasting that experience with her subsequent presidency would have provided an uplifting ending. Clearly, that didn’t happen. We’ll never know if Walsh is correct – and if we would have had a female president by now had a woman been the first to walk on the moon. Even if the Mercury 13 had passed the aptitude tests, they might still have been rejected – perhaps Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin would still have proved more able, and the first person on the moon would still have been a man. But as Cobb told her skeptical interviewer in the 1960s: women should have been given the opportunity to try.

Fifty million children worldwide have been displaced from their homes by war, disaster and persecution. On their difficult and dangerous journey across key migrant routes they face risks of abuse, forced labour, child slavery and trafficking. Yet approaches to this crisis are failing vulnerable children. Government attempts to prevent the safe entry of refugees into their countries have endangered children, forcing them on to more dangerous routes or into the hands of unscrupulous people smugglers. Frequently, arbitrary immigration rules – even in the UK – deport child refugees when they turn 18 or prevent unaccompanied children from being reunited with their families. This unique gathering of leaders brings together countries that have witnessed this devastating crisis from multiple perspectives – countries from which children are fleeing violent conflict and countries in which they seek refuge. Including Nigeria, where the Boko Haram insurgency has displaced millions; Bangladesh, which has received 650,000 Rohingya children since August; and Cyprus, which sits along the European migrant route. Imagine what could be achieved if these nations were to stand united to support child refugees. I urge them all to demonstrate their shared values of human rights, tolerance and respect by working towards a fairer and more just solution to this crisis. Alison Wallace CEO, SOS Children’s Villages UK • International development secretary Penny Mordaunt’s address in London (Report, 12 April) has raised concerns that children have not been made a primary focus by the Department for International Development. We feel that any UK aid, whatever department oversees it, should prioritise the most vulnerable children and their needs. This is a win-win approach to work towards achieving the sustainable development goals (SDGs) and ensures no one is left behind. We know that around 535 million children – a quarter of the world’s child population – are living in fragile and conflict-affected states. Yet, globally, less than 1% of the official development assistance is spent on ending violence against children. This means those in fragile states are deprived of the normal protection of community, school and family, and are at serious risk of violence and abuse at the hands of slavers, traffickers, armed groups and all those who would exploit them. Sarah Pickwick Senior conflict adviser, World Vision UK • Perhaps now, the mature trees of Sheffield (17,500 in danger of being felled under the council’s PFI contract) can after all, be saved and incorporated into the Queen’s Canopy (The Queen’s Green Planet review, 16 April). Let’s silence the chainsaws and join Commonwealth countries in a project dedicated to the maintenance of biodiversity, a healthy environment and the protection of our precious trees for generations to come. Jenny O’Shea London • Afua Hirsch’s piece (What is the Commonwealth if not the British Empire 2.0?, 18 April) makes interesting reading, but the most disheartening aspect of the Commonwealth is not that “while Britain is proud of the institution, its black and brown people are regarded with contempt”. Unacceptable as it is, white-on-black-and-brown contempt in the UK is nothing compared with the homegrown black-on-black and brown-on-brown contempt in Africa, the Caribbean and south-east Asia. You only have to look at the appalling post-election violence in Kenya, the constitutional amendment in Uganda, or India’s system of “untouchables”, for example. The real outrage is the ever-widening gap between rich and poor Commonwealth countries. It so outrageous that the theme of the 2018 summit – Towards a common future – would be comical if the reality of dehumanising poverty was not so tragic for African, south-east Asian and Caribbean countries and their peoples, especially the millions of unemployed youths as well as city slum women and their children, who are living in tin shacks without running water, adequate food, sanitation or security. Their intolerable poverty is manifesting itself in mass migration in search of a better life in the rich Commonwealth countries such as Australia, Canada and the UK. Instead of pretending that all Commonwealth countries and peoples are moving “towards a common future”, the rich members should prioritise assisting their poor counterparts in tackling population growth, which is the primary cause of environmental degradation, urbanisation, unemployment, famine, political violence and ultimately mass migration.

Current financial penalties are “meaningless” in deterring the worst, criminal offenders among landlords, according to the housing, communities and local government committee. The committee also called for greater protection for tenants from evictions, rent increases and harassment, noting that 800,000 private rented homes suffer from excess cold, mould or faulty wiring. However, it made no recommendations for rent controls. MPs on the committee called on the government “to give local authorities the power to confiscate properties from those committing the most egregious offences and whose business model relies on the exploitation of vulnerable tenants”. It said in some areas up to 25 people could be found living in houses of only three bedrooms, “while some landlords charge rent of up to £500 for a bed in a room with four bunkbeds”. But the MPs said it was striking that six out of 10 councils had not prosecuted a single landlord in 2016. Councils told the MPs that “some of the fines levied are pitiful” – often only £100 or £200 – yet it can cost local authorities thousands to take landlords to court. The report by MPs comes amid mounting concerns over Britain’s rapidly expanding private rental sector. Earlier this week the Resolution Foundation said one third of today’s millennial generation will never own their own home, with many forced to raise families in insecure and often substandard rental accommodation. It advocated rent caps and longer-term secure tenancies. Clive Betts, the Labour MP for Sheffield South East, who chairs the committee, said: “The imbalance in power in the private rented sector means vulnerable tenants often lack protection from unscrupulous landlords who can threaten them with retaliatory rent rises and eviction if they complain about unacceptable conditions in their homes.” The report found that 44% of tenants said a fear of retaliatory eviction had stopped them from making a complaint to their landlord. Around 200,000 said they had been abused or harassed by their landlord. The government has said that it is already cracking down on problems in the rental market and is working on plans to introduce a single housing ombudsman, and new legislation to make it easier for tenants to take legal action. A spokesman for the Ministry for Housing, Communities and Local Government said: “Everyone deserves a safe and decent home and we have given councils stronger powers to crack down on bad landlords, including fines of up to £30,000 and banning orders.” The Residential Landlords Association, which represents 50,000 landlords who own 250,000 homes, said it welcomed much of the report. However, it added that further regulation – the MPs also called for a Law Commission review of tenancy laws – would be unwelcome. “The RLA has long been concerned with the increasing complexity of laws and regulations related to private rented housing, which cause uncertainty for all those in the sector.” Campaigners at Generation Rent, a group representing tenants, said many tenants were just too frightened to complain about squalid conditions. Dan Wilson Craw of Generation Rent said: “Having the confidence to complain is just one reason why the government should strengthen protections from eviction and rent hikes. Growing numbers of people living longer in the private rental market – including one in four children – need greater security regardless of whether their landlord is flouting safety standards, so the committee has missed an opportunity to go further in its recommendations.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/apr/18/political-platitudes-have-masked-cruel-policies-time-to-stop-swallowing-them","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-18T16:00:41Z","webTitle":"Political platitudes have masked cruel policies – time to stop swallowing them | Zoe Williams","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/18/political-platitudes-have-masked-cruel-policies-time-to-stop-swallowing-them","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/18/political-platitudes-have-masked-cruel-policies-time-to-stop-swallowing-them","fields":{"headline":"Political platitudes have masked cruel policies – time to stop swallowing them","bodyText":"The politics of the platitude – the statement with which no reasonable person could disagree – has been dominant for at least the past 20 years. Who doesn’t want zero hunger? Who thinks education is bad? Who doesn’t want clean and sustainable energy or responsible, pro-social businesses? Who wants poverty entrenched, children from poor families to have no aspirations, opportunities for only some, inequality to thrive and some people to be treated as worth less than others? The language became so anodyne and meaningless that we had to look for the sense of it in the cracks, in the things that went unsaid. What did “lacking aspiration” really mean? Did it mean a person didn’t want a good life, or just that they weren’t middle-class enough? How was it that all unfortunate circumstances were driven by their hapless or feckless victims, and there were never any other factors? Why, when everybody was against inequality and for human rights, did equality get further away, and “human rights” become the new “red tape”, amorphous, troublesome, indistinct, someone else’s idea? In tandem with the new discourse, where everybody wanted the same thing – better, less impoverished lives for all – and all that was left was for decent people to choose between a suite of practical options, the actual decisions meted out by politics have become cruel. The “hostile environment” for which Theresa May is rightly castigated today has become the norm not just for immigrants, but for everyone who falls short of what the “decent citizen” of her conception should be. Anyone economically unproductive, unless they are old; anyone insufficiently healthy, unless they are in the Paralympics; anyone who doesn’t belong here, a category whose dimensions have become theoretically limitless, now that the criterion for belonging is that you can prove you belong, yet the Home Office holds the proof and is liable to destroy it at any moment, for “data protection”. It transpires – who knew? – that not every stamp of politics does want the best for everyone. Being unable, under the 21st century’s Convention on What’s Normal, to admit to not wanting the best, instead rightwing politics has reconfigured what it means by “everyone”. There’s historical precedent, sure, for conservative politicians not saying what they mean. Margaret Thatcher famously wanted to solve her disputes in the industrial heartlands by just putting a wall around Liverpool and leaving them to it. Even though this view was pretty well understood at the time, it took the release of historical cabinet papers before anyone could stick it on her. But the new element, the shiny modern bit of our predicament, is the sluggishness: we’re aways waiting for the hostile environment to explode into human tragedy, for a man to be refused cancer treatment, for a woman to be deported, for a hunger strike, for a suicide, always waiting for a catastrophic injustice to have a face, before we can say “this is unjust”. It’s not a collective amnesia, where we have forgotten what justice looks like, or a sudden, generalised lack of sincerity or compassion. It’s just a logical consequence; there’s no space to argue about principle, because everyone claims to believe the same thing. So we wait and see what it looks like in practice. This has the pleasing scientific veneer of an evidence base, but is destructive to the lives capsized in the process. We need to stop buying it: stop swallowing the rhetoric with which no reasonable person would disagree. Then we might see the meanings beneath it in time to halt the consequences rather than bemoan them. Pitchforks at the ready on Mumsnet “Am I being unreasonable?”, asked a woman posting on Mumsnet. That would have been the moment to look away. The answer is always either: “No, that’s fine, though it’s quite unreasonable that you wasted my time by asking,” or: “Unreasonable doesn’t even begin to cover it, you are so boilingly unhinged that someone should tattoo you with a warning sign or stripe you yellow and black like a bee.” But I had got as far as the subject line, whence there is no escape, like a spell invented by Tolkien. A mother of three was complaining that her husband, having started a job, had announced he needed “full personal assistance” in the morning. I assumed it was a sex thing, but no: he needed his keys and his wallet laid out, and his shoes and suit neatly arranged, unless he was cycling, in which case he wanted them in a bag, but she wouldn’t be informed of his method of transport until such time as she’d already done the other thing. Responses divided three ways: “If my husband said this, I would laugh in his face”; “I used to have a husband like this, then I left him and my current husband is much nicer”; and “How disappointing, I thought this was going to be a sex thing.” The outrage was superb – I want to say comradely or supportive, but no, it was just so vividly enjoyable. If someone had suggested forging the man’s Brompton into stocks and setting him there in a town square, I would have been in. Any one of us would have been. Which all made me feel a little sorry for the great villains of the internet age, the Zuckerbergs, the Russians trolls, the many facilitators of a social rage that previously didn’t exist. It’s not that the internet is making us angry. It’s just the place that you go when only anger will do, as the corner shop is to the strawberry bonbon. Dogged questioning not always appropriate The Queen’s corgi, Willow, passed away this week aged 14, survived by two dachshund-corgi crosses that are probably called dawgies, full name: Inspector Dawgie. The first question, “Do you think you will get another?”, is only natural, but dangerously freighted. “Why not? Didn’t you love Willow?” is the unspoken followup; unless it’s a yes, in which case: “So soon? How could you?” “How long, realistically, do you think you’re going to live?” hovers in the background, along with: “Do you trust any of your children to adopt a young pet, and if not, why not?” Safer, always, to go off on a tangent: taxidermy; chinchillas; tact lies in unexpected places at this difficult time."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"business/2018/apr/18/patrick-bousquet-chevanne-marks-spencer-marketing-boss-depart-management-shakeup","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-18T16:37:47Z","webTitle":"Patrick Bousquet-Chevanne departs in latest M&S shakeup","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/apr/18/patrick-bousquet-chevanne-marks-spencer-marketing-boss-depart-management-shakeup","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/apr/18/patrick-bousquet-chevanne-marks-spencer-marketing-boss-depart-management-shakeup","fields":{"headline":"Patrick Bousquet-Chevanne departs in latest M&S shakeup","bodyText":"The man who hired Mrs Claus and Paddington to help market Marks &amp; Spencer is leaving the company in the latest management shakeup under the new chairman, Archie Norman. Patrick Bousquet-Chavanne, executive director of customer, marketing and M&amp;S.com, will depart after six years on the board with a payoff worth up to £2m, though he is unlikely to receive about half of that as it is a performance-related share bonus. Bousquet-Chavanne’s duties will be split between the marketing bosses for food and for clothing and home, with a small central team mainly handling online services. Steve Rowe, chief executive of M&amp;S, said: “Patrick has overseen some extraordinary marketing programmes for M&amp;S corporately and made great strides in laying the foundations of our digital business.” Bousquet-Chavanne oversaw the successful Mrs Claus Christmas ad featuring Janet McTeer as a stylish James Bond-style character, as well as last year’s Paddington commercial after a series of more traditional efforts. Other management changes at M&amp;S include the food boss Andy Adcock this month being replaced by Stuart Machin, formerly group chief executive of the Poundland owner, Steinhoff UK. Helen Weir left her post as finance director at the end of last month and will be replaced by the former Dixons director Humphrey Singer later this year. In October, M&amp;S also brought in the former chief executive of Halfords, Jill McDonald, to help revive its struggling clothing, beauty and home sections. Her appointment to the new role of managing director of clothing and home prompted the departure of Jo Jenkins, the head of womenswear, lingerie and beauty, who left to run the fashion brand White Stuff. The announcement of McDonald’s appointment in May came days before Norman was named as the new chairman. He joined the business in September. The new chair promised radical change, accusing M&amp;S of “drifting” for more than 15 years. Alongside the management rejig, the group has confirmed plans to close up to 14 stores, sold off its Hong Kong arm and announced the consolidation of its network of distribution centres."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2018/apr/19/asian-food-shows-korea-japan-netflix","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-19T05:00:08Z","webTitle":"Bored by British food shows?

Netflix's Asian ones have more flavour","bodyText":"I have had it with British food programmes. Almost without exception, they have driven themselves headfirst into the ground. Our celebrity cookery shows have long since drowned in a morass of tweeness. Our cookery competitions are worse; at this point MasterChef and The Great British Bake Off have become so crushingly repetitive that you may as well just watch a 15-second loop of someone staring at an oven. And then there’s Saturday Kitchen which, as ever, deserves to be tried as a witch and burned alive in a town square. But my disappointment with British food shows has led me to discover something quite exciting. On Netflix, nestled among concussed gameshows and masturbatory chef profiles, there is a rich vein of Asian food TV. These programmes have got their own patterns and rhythms, and ways of celebrating food, and I’m in deep. If you’re as bored as me with homegrown UK fare, here are the shows worth checking out. Kantaro: The Sweet Tooth Salaryman This will take some explaining, but it’s worth it. First, I want you to think of Dexter. Now, I want you to imagine that instead of being a serial killer, Dexter’s big secret is that he is aroused by puddings. And, instead of murder scenes, there are long sequences where Dexter visits a real-life pudding shop and narrates a long philosophical love letter to its most famous dish. He will wax lyrical about the ingredients and the presentation and the cultural importance of the pudding, while the pudding is presented in the same way that Top Gear presents supercars. Then he will take a bite and be transported into an intense hallucination, where all his co-workers have giant cherries for heads, or where he sits in a pudding floating through space, or where he embarks on an elaborate La La Land-style dance sequence about chestnuts. It is also worth pointing out that, unless I’ve got this very wrong, pudding literally makes him ejaculate. Kantaro: The Sweet Tooth Salaryman is the weirdest thing that will ever make you hungry. Samurai Gourmet Again, this one has a slightly bizarre premise – an old Japanese man asks an imaginary samurai to help him navigate his life problems – but if you push that to the side, you are left with a beautiful meditation on the joys of solo dining. In every episode, lead character Kasumi ends up ordering a dish in a different location. As he gently ponders on the meaning of life, we see the dish being lovingly prepared in the kitchen. It’s presented to him and he slowly describes what makes it so great. It is joyful, touching and innocent. There are no real stakes to speak of, but that is part of its charm. Midnight Diner: Tokyo Stories “My diner is open from midnight to seven in the morning,” murmurs the Master, owner of a tiny 12-seat restaurant. “Do I even have customers? More than you’d expect.” He has a few rules – nobody can have more than three drinks and all fights have to be taken outside – but he will try to cook whatever you ask for. Every episode tells the story of a different customer and how their lives intersect with the dish they order. At the end of each episode, they will often break the fourth wall to offer tips on preparation. That’s all there is to it, but Midnight Diner: Tokyo Stories is just as woozy and narcoleptic as you would imagine. Chef &amp; My Fridge Much more traditional is this nutso South Korean cookery show, the conceit of which revolves around packing up and shipping a celebrity’s refrigerator wholesale to the studio. The hosts then mock the celebrity for the state of the fridge, and the contents are handed to a squadron of chefs, who attempt to create a dish from them in 15 minutes. It’s Ready Steady Cook, basically, but also aggressively Korean. “What are the parameters of chastity?” one guest is casually asked in episode three."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2018/apr/18/time-to-take-a-stand-on-killings-in-gaza","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-18T16:53:14Z","webTitle":"Time to take a stand on killings in Gaza | Letter","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/18/time-to-take-a-stand-on-killings-in-gaza","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/apr/18/time-to-take-a-stand-on-killings-in-gaza","fields":{"headline":"Time to take a stand on killings in Gaza","bodyText":"For several weeks you have reported the killings by Israeli forces in Gaza. Each week Israel has placed troops on the security border with Gaza with the intention to shoot to kill Palestinians demonstrating. So far 35 Palestinians have been killed and more than 1,500 injured with live ammunition. Instructions to shoot to kill were given in advance (Deaths in Gaza will haunt Israeli snipers, Letters, 13 April; Letters, 17 April). It is right for the British government to comment on hostile actions by foreign states in breach of international law wherever they occur – on UK territory, in Syria or in Yemen. But the silence of the prime minister and the foreign secretary on Israel’s premeditated killings is deafening. Moreover, the UK government continues to approve arms exports to Israel despite its own guidelines prohibiting any sales of weapons that risk being used in violation of international law. We call on the government to condemn publicly Israel’s actions; to support an immediate UN investigation into the killings; and to ensure UK arms, finance and trade are not used to support Israel’s unlawful actions. The British government must fulfil its responsibilities to hold Israel accountable and to bring about the end of Israel’s unlawful siege and the military occupation of Gaza, East Jerusalem and the West Bank.

After a special case hearing on Wednesday, the chief constable of West Midlands police, Dave Thompson, ordered that Asst Ch Con Marcus Beale be dismissed after a briefcase of papers disappeared from the boot of his vehicle. “The conduct in this case is a serious criminal conviction for improperly caring for documents,” Thompson said. “I agree (with a previous disciplinary panel decision) that the misconduct in this case is serious and is very likely to undermine public confidence in policing.” Beale, 54, who was due to retire next week, pleaded guilty last year to an offence under the Official Secrets Act and was fined £3,500. He argued that he should not be dismissed and should only receive a final written warning. Addressing the hearing at the West Midlands police headquarters in Birmingham, Beale’s counsel, John Beggs QC, said a dismissal would be “merely symbolic” in light of the officer’s imminent retirement. Beale will retain a £215,000 tax-free pension lump sum. Beggs argued that Beale had reported the documents as missing immediately and his failing had been unintentional with no malice or premeditation. “Mr Beale’s response to this ghastly realisation (that documents had been stolen) was swift, professional, selfless, and imbued with the characteristic that runs through him like Brighton rock – honesty and integrity,” he said. In February, a disciplinary panel recommended that Beale be dismissed by the force, but the final decision was left to the West Midlands police chief constable. The disciplinary panel heard how Beale left the documents in the car boot for five days, during which he went to the pub, spent a weekend away in London with his wife, and went supermarket shopping. The documents were never supposed to leave police premises. The case contained four documents, which included minutes from a high-level counter-terrorism meeting, counter-terrorism local profiles, details of regular organised crime and sensitive information about a high-profile investigation. Beale only discovered that the briefcase was missing when he stopped at Warwick services on 15 May 2017 while on the way to Oxford. During the previous hearing, Fiona Barton QC, representing the force, said there was no sign of a forced entry to the car and that it was “an extraordinary mystery” how the documents had been stolen. She said the impact of the incident could have been catastrophic and it was “a matter of luck the documents do not appear to have seen the light of day”. • This article was amended on 19 April 2018. An earlier version incorrectly said that Beale would lose a £215,000 tax-free pension lump sum when in fact he will retain it."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/apr/19/recep-tayyip-erdogan-turkey-president-election-dictator-seeks-total-control","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-19T04:00:05Z","webTitle":"Recep Tayyip Erdoğan: a dictator in all but name seeks complete control | Simon Tisdall","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/19/recep-tayyip-erdogan-turkey-president-election-dictator-seeks-total-control","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/apr/19/recep-tayyip-erdogan-turkey-president-election-dictator-seeks-total-control","fields":{"headline":"Recep Tayyip Erdoğan: a dictator in all but name seeks complete control","bodyText":"Recep Tayyip Erdoğan is one of a crop of present-day political leaders who value the respectability an ostensibly democratic election confers but don’t want to risk actually losing the vote. In this respect, Turkey’s president is no different from Russia’s Vladimir Putin and Egypt’s Abdel Fatah al-Sisi. Their shared idea of democracy can be summed up by the motto: “You vote, I win.” It is possible Erdogan and his ruling Justice and Development party (AKP) could lose the snap presidential and parliamentary polls called for 24 June. But it is extremely unlikely. The AKP won a clear majority of seats in parliament in 2015 and is already assured of the support, should it need it, of the Nationalist Movement party (MHP). As for Erdoğan, he remains Turkey’s dominant politician, a position he has occupied for a decade or more at home, in contrast to the steady decline in his international standing. He is also a deeply divisive figure. A recent survey by Metropoll gave him a nationwide approval rating of 49.8%. Just over 42% of respondents said they disapproved. Even if there were a politician of sufficient power and prestige to effectively challenge Erdoğan – and there isn’t – the odds are stacked against any would-be usurper. Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu, the likeable but ineffective leader of the main opposition Republican People’s party (CHP), gained only 19% approval in the same poll. Erdoğan has sidelined old comrades such as Abdullah Gül and Ahmet Davutoğlu, formerly president and prime minister respectively, ensuring nobody within the AKP is in a position to rival him. And since the failed 2016 coup, he has systemically emasculated rival power bases and independent media, locking up pro-Kurdish lawmakers and journalists and sacking tens of thousands of civil servants, academics, military, police and judges on specious grounds of national security. In such circumstances, the prospect of truly competitive, open, free and fair elections is slim to non-existent. In a very real sense, Erdoğan, himself a one-time prison inmate who came up the hard way, has been waiting for this moment all his life. If and when he wins, he will assume the full powers of the new “executive presidency” that was narrowly voted through in last year’s bitterly contested constitutional referendum. Elections had not been due for another 18 months. By bringing the polls forward, Erdoğan is finally set to gain full, personal control of all key aspects of domestic and foreign policy. He will become a dictator in all but name, more powerful perhaps than even Kemal Atatürk, modern, secular Turkey’s founding father. Worried politicians in Paris, Berlin, London and Washington no longer see a reliable friend and ally in Ankara. They see an autocratic figure exploiting nationalist and neo-Islamist sentiment, xenophobia and Europhobia, and feelings of public insecurity brought on by next door’s Syrian crisis, to justify egregious human rights abuses, institutional vandalism and anti-EU, anti-western policies. Turkey under Erdoğan, though still a Nato member, is now closely aligned with Russia. In Syria, Erdoğan has backed Moscow and Tehran in pursuing a political and territorial settlement that would keep Bashar al-Assad’s regime in place, even though he had previously demanded the Syrian leader resign. In return, Moscow gave tacit support to Turkey’s recent military incursion into Afrin, in north-west Syria, in furtherance of Erdoğan’s obsessive vendetta with the Syrian (and Iraqi) Kurds – all of whom he denounces as terrorists. On past precedent, inflammatory anti-Kurdish rhetoric will play a big part in Erdoğan’s re-election bid. The need to be “strong” in Afrin was one reason for calling early polls, he said on Wednesday. Putin and, for example, China’s Xi Jinping, another executive president-forever, may be impressed by Erdoğan’s dubious ascendancy. Iran’s hardliners may cheer him on. But the western democracies, which Turks for many years aspired to emulate, will not. For them, Turkey is increasingly on the wrong side of a global argument between freedom and control."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2018/apr/20/swallow-me-track-of-the-week","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-20T10:00:21Z","webTitle":"Tracks of the week reviewed: Florence + the Machine, LUMP and Janelle Monáe","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/apr/20/swallow-me-track-of-the-week","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/apr/20/swallow-me-track-of-the-week","fields":{"headline":"Tracks of the week reviewed: Florence + the Machine, LUMP and Janelle Monáe","bodyText":"The Ninth Wave Swallow Me The Ninth Wave are goths from Glasgow.

There are times, though, when he can take it just a little too far. Even by its usual fairly dismal standards, this has been a terrible week for the government. Theresa May might have got lucky with her first bombing raid on Syria, but she has been held bang to rights over the shameful treatment of the Windrush generation. Amber Rudd has been forced to admit that she was concerned about the state of the Home Office – imagine how angry she is going to be when she finds out who is in charge – and the blame for the hostile environment policy clearly points to her predecessor as home secretary. One T May. To compound the embarrassment, the whole episode has been unfolding while Britain has been hosting the Commonwealth heads of government meeting, making it only a matter of luck that no one has tried to deport a visiting head of state. So far. It seemed a done deal, then, that Theresa would get a mandatory punishment beating at prime minister’s questions. She knew it, everyone knew it. But the Labour leader just couldn’t bring himself to deliver it. Faced with the prime minister’s own hopelessness, he chose to fight mediocrity with mediocrity. If a country gets the leaders it deserves, then the UK must be near enough on death row. The prime minister had tried to minimise the damage by arranging for a Tory backbench stooge, Neil O’Brien, to open proceedings by asking for a Windrush update. This allowed Theresa to deliver her best “I’m sorry if I inadvertently gave any offence” all-purpose, general apology. “There has been a lot of confusion and anxiety,” she said. Most of it her own. Exactly a year after her decision to call the general election, Theresa was unable to prevent herself from channelling her inner Maybot. As an anniversary present to herself, presumably. Corbyn began promisingly by asking about Albert Thompson, who had been refused cancer treatment. Why had she brushed this off when he had raised the case a few weeks ago? Theresa looked panicky and stumbled over her words. She hadn’t brushed off Thompson. She just hadn’t bothered to do anything about him because he hadn’t seemed very important then. Things began to fall apart when the Labour leader asked her why she had chosen to destroy Windrush landing cards in 2010. It wasn’t me, Theresa declared happily. She had dun nuffink. It had been done the year before when Labour was in government, so Labour was obviously to blame. This wasn’t entirely true. The decision had been taken by the UK Border Agency without any ministerial involvement – but it was more than enough to floor Corbyn, who had made the basic error of asking a question to which he didn’t know the answer. Even so, the Labour leader ought to have been able to recover. The real issue wasn’t the destruction of the landing cards per se. It was only the prime minister’s subsequent hostile environment policy that brought the landing cards into play. But Corbyn isn’t any good at thinking on his feet. Or when sitting down, for that matter. Thinking isn’t his strongest point. His mouth opened and closed, trying to form words that never came. Theresa made the most of her reprieve, fumbling her way to safety. She couldn’t say how many people had been deported and she wasn’t in a hurry to find out, but she did want everyone to know that some of her best friends were Windrush generation. And in any case, even if she had been a little bit racist in her enthusiasm to cut immigration, she wasn’t as bad as the Labour leader, who refused to deal with antisemitism in his own party. It was as unedifying as that. Two leaders trading accusations of racism while refusing to accept any responsibility for their own actions. While all this was going on, David Lammy was leaping up and down, desperate to ask the question his leader hadn’t. May eyed him nervously, well aware that he could inflict serious damage. The speaker, however, never called him and the danger passed. Despite never rising above poor and unconvincing, the prime minister had got away with it. Sometimes, being a Maybot is more than enough. The bar is that low."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"money/2018/apr/18/government-slow-to-protect-low-paid-workers-say-mps","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-18T18:48:07Z","webTitle":"Government too slow to protect low-paid workers, say MPs","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2018/apr/18/government-slow-to-protect-low-paid-workers-say-mps","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2018/apr/18/government-slow-to-protect-low-paid-workers-say-mps","fields":{"headline":"Government too slow to protect low-paid workers, say MPs","bodyText":"The government is under fire from MPs for being too slow to act to protect low-paid workers from exploitation. The chairs of the work and pensions select committee and the business, energy and industrial strategy (BEIS) committee called on the government to urgently bring forward laws to protect workers. The comments come after the government said on Wednesday that further consultation was required before introducing new rules such as a guaranteed premium to the legal minimum wage for zero-hours workers or mandatory written employment status statements. The government was responding to a report by the select committees published in November, which included draft legislation intended to close the loopholes that allow irresponsible companies to underpay workers. That followed the government-backed Matthew Taylor review into gig economy working, which also suggested changes to employment law, including clarification of what it means to be self-employed. A number of businesses, including Uber and Deliveroo, face legal action from drivers and couriers who say they are not independent contractors, as the companies claim, and so should be entitled to holiday pay and other benefits. Rachel Reeves, Labour MP and chair of the BEIS committee, said: “People in the everyday economy, from delivery drivers and warehouse workers to carers and retail staff, too often find themselves subject to levels of control and injustice from businesses who reap the benefits of this ultra-flexible business model without taking proper responsibility as employers. “The government’s response to our committees’ work and the Taylor review is far too slow and ministers need to turn words into action and bring forward legislation urgently to make these changes, or throw their support behind the draft bill that our committees have proposed.” The MPs’ draft bill aimed to clarify the definitions of employment status and enshrine the presumption that those working for companies over a certain size are all classed as workers, with rights to the minimum wage and holiday pay. Frank Field, Labour MP and chair of the pensions committee, said the government should introduce a short bill in which it guaranteed workers basic rights and paved the way for further legislation on more complex matters in future. “It is disappointing that the government hasn’t picked up our bill and run with it,” he added."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"sport/blog/2018/apr/18/tms-talksport-radio-change-cricket-england","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-18T16:39:20Z","webTitle":"TMS bowled out by TalkSport but stop weeping, change is sometimes good | Barney Ronay","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2018/apr/18/tms-talksport-radio-change-cricket-england","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/blog/2018/apr/18/tms-talksport-radio-change-cricket-england","fields":{"headline":"TMS bowled out by TalkSport but stop weeping, change is sometimes good","bodyText":"Stop all the clocks. Stamp a single steel-toed work boot through Mrs Blenkinsop’s sensational triple-tiered Victoria sponge. Prevent the dog from barking with a bag of gravel. For BBC Test Match Special is dead. Or at least, suspended for a bit over the autumn and winter. Instead commercial radio is back in the shape of TalkSport, which has outbid the BBC for rights to England’s autumn and winter Test tours to Sri Lanka and West Indies. And nothing now can ever come to any good. Except, of course for the fact it may actually be all right. A quick census of the loudest online voices suggests the general response to this news has been somewhere on the spectrum between regret, dismay and a great swirling fudge of mawkish, cake-fondling, doily-clutching Middle England horror. Understandably so, too. It is a mark of the way Test cricket is cherished in England that the idea of different voices bringing it into your kitchen or down through the headphones in the insomniac hours is like a familial loss. Test Match Special is much-loved. For many people its enforced break during the winter will be an absence that goes beyond sport, a missing beat in the rhythms of the day. And yet there are limits to this. The sense of mild hysteria, the social media suggestion that losing TMS for a few months is “worse than Brexit” seems a little overdone. For a start someone should probably check on Jonathan Agnew, who seems to think his employer being outbid for some broadcast rights is a national disaster on the scale of the death of Princess Diana and that ice skating woman falling over all rolled into one. Imagine Princess Diana falling over in an ice skating race, thereby accidentally derailing Charlotte Dujardin’s quest for dressage gold, while simultaneously being denied the right to broadcast cricket on the BBC. That’s how bad we’re talking. Or at least this appears to be the case judging by Agnew’s funereal tweets on the subject. Not only is the self-righteous tone a provocation to every other working broadcaster involved in covering the sport, it also does a disservice to the genuine depth of feeling around this. There are good reasons why cricket on the BBC is an emotive issue. The corporation played a hand in keeping the sport going when it might have died after the second world war, re-spinning its mass popularity into the fabric of the summer. Plenty of us wouldn’t have known cricket existed but for the BBC – Peter West, Tony Lewis and all that, smiling avuncular men in blazers staring right into the camera on a grey Tuesday morning in the dog days of the summer. Plus on a more basic level Test Match Special does a fine job, credit to some brilliant journalists and producers. Simon Mann, Charles Dagnall, Isa Guha, Daniel Norcross and the rest are all excellent. Vic Marks, also of these pages, offers the kind of voice you do not often hear on any media, determinedly anti-sensational voice, wryly humorous in hectoring times. TalkSport will have a huge job on its hands just trying to meet the same standards of analysis and reporting. It should be said Agnew is also a brilliant broadcaster, and hugely popular too, the best out there at simply pointing himself at his sport and talking, with a wonderfully easy style. But he is also a part of why some may welcome a bit of variation, those moments where the sense of vital work being done, of weepy self-importance slips into something else. Imagine the phrase “Bumptious BBC self-regard” baked in a nuclear reactor until it finally grows arms and legs, escapes, kits itself out in chinos and begins talking in a cosy, righteous tone about delivering a vital national service. There is nothing in the rules that says this is the way cricket must be presented, or that everyone will like it. The endless goodbye to Henry Blofeld, for example, was fair enough but I’ve also heard cricket-loving kids say the Blofeld tone is why lots of other kids their age think cricket is just for posh, entitled people. They cringe at the idea of introducing their football-loving schoolmates to the great summer sport only to find Blofeld on, flapping about cakes and pigeons and dear old things. You what, mate? On the other hand new things can be good. Competition can be good. Giving someone else a go can give everyone a lift. At which point enter, to the sound of Darth Vader’s march, the dreaded TalkSport. The new kid will not be to everyone’s taste at first. It can be blokey and relentless, far more tabloid in style and tone. Not to mention overly obsessed with wood stain and van hire, adverts that will jar with the rhythms at first, although past broadcasts suggests this quickly fades. There are deeper currents too. TalkSport is owned by Rupert Murdoch’s News Corp, which bought the Wireless Group two years ago. Plenty will object to the most ruthless and iconoclastic of media families taking over the presentation of their beloved five-day game. On the other hand the cricket boards of Sri Lanka and West Indies will be grateful for extra funds the BBC would not stretch to. Plus there is plenty of evidence to suggest the product will be decent. Early rumours suggest the excellent Steve Harmison and – yes – even the great David Lloyd may be regulars. Change, different voices, a new audience: these are things cricket has needed for a while. So save the tear-soaked cake crumbs, the sense of bumptious entitlement. You never know, the new world may not be so terrible after all."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"politics/2018/apr/18/nigel-farage-admits-his-children-hold-german-as-well-as-uk-passports","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-18T19:15:32Z","webTitle":"Nigel Farage: two of my children have German passports","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/apr/18/nigel-farage-admits-his-children-hold-german-as-well-as-uk-passports","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/apr/18/nigel-farage-admits-his-children-hold-german-as-well-as-uk-passports","fields":{"headline":"Nigel Farage: two of my children have German passports","bodyText":"Nigel Farage has admitted two of his children have both British and German passports, which would allow them to take advantage of free movement rights post-Brexit, but insisted they feel British rather than European. In a robust exchange with former deputy prime minister Nick Clegg, the ex-Ukip leader also suggested Britain had lost the second world war because the nation had been “bankrupted” and “our big imperial possessions started to disappear.” Farage has four children, two with his wife Kirsten Mehr, who is a German national and has confirmed the couple separated last year. His children would be entitled to German citizenship through their mother. Last year witnesses claimed on social media to have seen the former Ukip leader queuing at the German embassy, though his spokesman at the time denied Farage had been seeking citizenship. In the exchange with Clegg, which features on the Lib Dem leader’s new podcast, Farage denied his children felt as European as they did British, although he added they spoke “perfect German”. Clegg, whose wife is Spanish, said his three children held Spanish passports and asked if Farage’s children also had German and British passports. “Yes. Yes. And that link to the German side of their family is clearly important to them but their identity, when it comes to a football game, it’s pretty clear which side they’re actually going to support,” Farage said. “Their mum may not.” He added it was bizarre that the majority of the younger generation had been in favour of remain. “I’m astonished that the young people look upon the European Union as being this bright, shiny future. They will change their minds. What you can’t see is that the European project is disintegrating before our eyes.” Farage said he felt the UK had been the loser in 1945. “We were the ones who lost everything.” He added: “In many ways I am very bullish about Britain as it is right now. Yeah we’ve got our problems, our divisions, we’ve always had them. But there’s a great feeling.” Clegg’s podcast, Anger Management, sees the former Lib Dem leader follow in the footsteps of his contemporary Ed Miliband, who hosts the podcast Reasons to Be Cheerful. Future guests on Clegg’s show are set to include former chancellor George Osborne and football pundit and presenter Gary Lineker."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2018/apr/18/bump-stocks-slide-fire-solutions-stop-making-device","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-18T16:13:46Z","webTitle":"Leading bump stock maker to stop selling rapid-fire device","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/apr/18/bump-stocks-slide-fire-solutions-stop-making-device","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/apr/18/bump-stocks-slide-fire-solutions-stop-making-device","fields":{"headline":"Leading bump stock maker to stop selling rapid-fire device","bodyText":"The leading maker of the rapid-fire accessory used by the shooter in the Las Vegas massacre will stop selling the devices next month. Slide Fire Solutions, which holds several patents and describes itself as “the official bump stock”, has been under mounting pressure since 58 people were killed and hundreds injured when a 64-year-old man opened fire on concertgoers last October. After 17 people were killed at a Florida high school in February, Donald Trump ordered the US justice department to ban bump stocks, which were not used by the shooter in that incident. A notice on the company website states: “On Sunday, May 20, 2018 at midnight CST, Slide Fire will cease taking orders for its products and shut down its website. Orders placed prior to May 20th, 2018 will all be processed and shipped.” Bump stock devices use the recoil energy of a semiautomatic rifle to slide the gun back and forth, creating continuous fire with one pull of the trigger to simulate a fully automatic weapon. Under the Obama administration, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) examined bump stocks and decided that they could not be banned under existing law. But on 23 March, the justice department issued a proposal to amend firearms regulations to classify bump-stock devices as machine guns, allowing them to be prohibited. “These devices convert an otherwise semiautomatic firearm into a machine gun,” the notice states. “With limited exceptions, primarily as to government agencies, the [Gun Control Act of 1968] makes it unlawful for any person to transfer or possess a machine gun.” Jeff Sessions, the attorney general, said in a statement: “After the senseless attack in Las Vegas, this proposed rule is a critical step in our effort to reduce the threat of gun violence that is in keeping with the Constitution and the laws passed by Congress.” The decision is likely to face court challenges from gun owners who may argue that only Congress has the authority to outlaw bump stocks. But if it is enacted after the 90-day review period, owners and retailers will be required to destroy the devices or turn them over to the ATF, which estimates that the public has purchased about 520,000. Florida passed a state law last month which bans bump stocks, among other gun restrictions. They are also explicitly or implicitly banned in California, New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts and Washington state, and the city of Denver. Slide Fire, which could not be reached by phone on Wednesday morning, dominates the bump stocks market. It was founded in 2010 by Jeremiah Cottle, an air force veteran, in the remote and small Texas town of Moran.

In Birmingham, Leeds and Manchester, city council workers were among the most frequent applicants for the ultra-high interest debt last month, according to figures from a loan comparison website. In Leicester, workers for the courier company DPD applied for the most loans after people in the NHS. The most common reason given for requesting the loans was “to pay bills”. DPD recently announced it was reforming its working model after the death of a courier who was charged £150 for attending a hospital appointment. The figures released on Wednesday by the Cash Lady comparison website showed that NHS workers applied for more payday loans than any other workers in London, Cardiff and Bristol and applied for more loans nationally than any other organisation’s workers. The website collates loans issued by companies including Quick Quid, The Money Shop, Sunny and 118 118 Money. Cash Lady said the lenders charge interest rates between 68.7% and 1,325%. The data casts fresh light on how even people with regular incomes are being forced to turn to super high interest companies for emergency loans. Frank Field, the chairman of the commons select committee on work and pensions described it as shocking and said it chimed with reports last year of nurses using foodbanks. Around 300,000 people a month take out the high-cost short-term credit. At the end of 2016, 1.6 million people had payday loan debt, with the average loan just over £300. Around one in eight of the debtors was in arrears, according to the Financial Conduct Authority. After NHS staff, supermarket workers for Tesco, Asda and Sainsbury’s applied for the most loans in March, followed by staff at McDonalds, the supermarket Morrisons and Royal Mail. Next came the British Army – which has already banned payday loan adverts from military bases and publications – Amazon and workers for the outsourcing giant Capita. NHS workers’ representatives said it showed “a terrible state of affairs”. “No one should be so desperate for money that they have no option but to go cap in hand to unscrupulous lenders,” said Unison head of health, Sara Gorton. “It shows how much harm years of government pay restraint has caused.” NHS England did not respond to request for comment. Sarah-Jayne Clifton, director of the Jubilee Debt Campaign, said the figures showed how “austerity, low wages, and insecure work are driving people to take on high cost debt from rip-off lenders just to put food on the table”. She said: “We need the government to take urgent action, not only to rein in rip-off lenders, but also to tackle the cost of living crisis and cuts to social protection that are driving people towards the loan sharks in the first place.” The Money Advice Trust told a parliamentary inquiry into payday loans last year that “when young people reach 16 to 24 and are thinking about borrowing, they are more likely to go for high-cost credit than the mainstream alternatives”, purely because the marketing was so “slick” and the online experience so easy. Responding to the figures, an MoD spokesman said: “We provide service personnel with guidance, education and support to ensure they can make informed financial decisions.” A spokesman for Birmingham city council said: “We are one of the largest local employers and we pay the Birmingham Living Wage, which is higher than the national living wage”. Leeds city council said measures to help staff included low-cost credit union loans. Amazon said it paid all its workers, including agency staff, at least £8 per hour."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"money/2018/apr/24/ee-new-contract-signed-cooling-off-period","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-24T06:00:13Z","webTitle":"Why shouldn’t I get a cooling-off period over my EE contract?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2018/apr/24/ee-new-contract-signed-cooling-off-period","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2018/apr/24/ee-new-contract-signed-cooling-off-period","fields":{"headline":"Why shouldn’t I get a cooling-off period over my EE contract?","bodyText":"A few weeks ago, I went into an EE shop with the intention of reducing my monthly mobile phone payments, as my contract was nearing the end.

The total is up from 455 towers in the pipeline in 2016, according to research from the industry forum New London Architecture (NLA) and real estate consultancy GL Hearn. Construction has started on 115 towers, also a record. Over the past two years, work started on more projects than in the preceding five years combined. Twentytwo, formerly nicknamed “the Pinnacle” and then “the Stump” after work stalled, will be – at 62 storeys or 278 metres – the tallest building in the City of London when it is completed next year. However, in the 2020s it will be overtaken by 1 Undershaft, nicknamed the Trellis, at 290m. Two of Europe’s tallest residential towers will be the 233-metre Landmark Pinnacle on the Isle of Dogs and the 235-metre Spire London, also in Canary Wharf. Both are expected to be completed by 2020. But they do not come close to the Shard, which, at 310 metres, remains the tallest building in Europe. The report also recorded signs of a slowdown. Last year 40 tall building projects were under way, a 25% drop on 2016, and 18 were finished, down 30%. Projects now typically take three to four years from start to finish rather than two to three years as before. The number of applications for new towers last year was down by 10% from 2016 and by 35% from 2015, when an application for Greenwich Peninsula was made involving more than 40 tall buildings. Peter Murray, the NLA chair, said the slowdown was to be expected. “The uncertainties created by Brexit are causing projects to be postponed, while higher stamp duty introduced by George Osborne in December 2014 continues to impact on the market.” The planned towers could provide 106,000 new homes by 2030, while the mayor of London has called for 66,000 new homes a year. Half of the planned towers (252) are in east London, while the second-biggest cluster (99) is in central London. Almost a third of the entire pipeline is in outer London, in zones three, four and five. In Croydon, the world’s tallest modular tower, containing more than 300 build-to-rent flats, has received planning consent."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/apr/18/royal-canadian-mint-sues-australia-possum-magic-coins","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-18T16:38:49Z","webTitle":"Canadian mint sues Australian mint over magic possums and red poppies","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/18/royal-canadian-mint-sues-australia-possum-magic-coins","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/apr/18/royal-canadian-mint-sues-australia-possum-magic-coins","fields":{"headline":"Canadian mint sues Australian mint over magic possums and red poppies","bodyText":"The Royal Canadian Mint has demanded that its Australian counterpart destroy a set of coloured coins celebrating the popular children’s book Possum Magic amid a legal battle over rights to the process used to create them. A lawsuit filed in December in Australia’s federal court alleges that the Royal Australian Mint had – without permission – used a patented method of printing colour on metal to print 500,000 commemorative Remembrance Day $2 coins featuring a red poppy. The Canadians said they had flagged the patent issue two years earlier, only to have their concerns met with an assertion that the method being used in Australia was “sufficiently different to have not infringed” the patent. The Canadian mint eventually took its complaint to the Australian courts, demanding that any coins not yet in circulation be either turned over or “destroy[ed] under supervision”, according to the National Post. The lawsuit launched by the Canadian crown corporation also seeks to force Australian mint – which is part of the Australian government – to surrender any profits and pay damages. Recently, the Canadian mint expanded its lawsuit to include several other $2 coins, including a 2017 release featuring designs from Possum Magic and Olympic-themed coins. While the coins in question include 12 colourful designs printed on an estimated 15m coins, the Canadian mint said it is not seeking the destruction of any coins already in circulation. Their demands have been countered with another lawsuit – this week the Australian government filed a counter claim asking that the Canadian patent be declared invalid on the grounds that it is not enough of a “novelty” over what has been done previously. The duelling mints are also business rivals who rely on developing new technologies in order to secure contracts around the world. In recent years, the Canadians’ list of clients has ranged from Indonesia to the United Arab Emirates. The Royal Canadian Mint has said that its lawsuit is aimed at protecting what sets it apart on the global market. “As a crown corporation mandated to operate in anticipation of profit, our technologies are vital to maintaining our competitive standing, and the mint undertakes all steps necessary to protect its intellectual property rights,” a spokesperson told the National Post earlier this year."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/apr/18/starbucks-misguided-racism-workshops","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-18T15:39:49Z","webTitle":"Why Starbucks shouldn't be praised for its misguided racism workshops | Hina Tai","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/18/starbucks-misguided-racism-workshops","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/18/starbucks-misguided-racism-workshops","fields":{"headline":"Why Starbucks shouldn't be praised for its misguided racism workshops","bodyText":"After a Starbucks manager had two black men arrested for occupying a table without making a purchase, Starbucks has announced their plan to conduct racial implicit bias workshops for all their employees amid the growing protest. Implicit bias, a term drawn from psychology, has become a new buzzword in the media that refers to the unconscious attitudes and stereotypes held by individuals around certain groups of people. Often people can act on implicit bias in prejudicial and discriminatory ways without even realizing it, such as assuming a black man is less qualified for a job than a white man, despite having similar résumés and skill sets. While the line between implicit bias and explicit bias can become murky at times, the Starbucks incident is a clear case of explicit bias and to call it anything less is outrageous. To consciously pick up the phone to call the police on two black men sitting at a table doing nothing is an explicit act. What is more concerning than how this incident is being represented to the masses is the willingness of non-profits and social justice organizations to discuss overt discriminatory incidents through the lens of implicit bias. Implicit bias frames offer these organizations an ability to discuss race in a disarming, nonthreatening means because the idea is implicit bias affects everyone’s minds unconsciously and no one is safe from its grasp. There is some validity to this argument. However, the concerning part is when implicit bias workshops – which rely heavily on social psychology to understand and overcome our brain’s unconscious racial biases and stereotyping – are offered in place to mask explicit and structural bias qualifiers that form racial violence and attitudes. As such, implicit bias workshops have become nothing more than a neoliberal PR stunt for both corporations attempting to avoid legal liability, and race organizations seeking to be solutions and funding-oriented. It’s an easy out when genuine solutions to racial violence are much more complex, time-consuming and expensive. In the Starbucks case, consider that Jonathan Greenblatt, CEO of the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), has been brought on as one of the “experts” to develop the implicit bias workshop curriculum. The ADL is a staunch supporter of Israel and advocates against the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement, which calls for an end to Palestinian occupation. How ironic is it that ADL is involved in a racial bias workshop while supporting Israel’s policing and oppression of Palestinian people? Additionally, the ADL has sponsored exchange programs that allow Israel’s military to provide training to US law enforcement officers. During a time when Black Lives Matter is galvanizing against the militarization of police and an end to police brutality against black and brown bodies, this is a grave oversight. These are the politically charged structural-level issues implicit bias work is deflecting from. Because it makes people uncomfortable. The ways by which neoliberalism has co-opted social justice work is not new though. Most recently, Cornel West called out Ta-Nehisi Coates for being the “neoliberal face of the black freedom struggle”. Coates’ contribution to mainstreaming the black narrative is undeniable. Yet West has very valid critiques of Coates’s work that apply to the emerging implicit bias field as well. West underscores “any analysis or vision of the world that omits the centrality of Wall Street power, US military policies and the complex dynamics of class, gender and sexuality in black America is too narrow and dangerously misleading”. This is where implicit bias workshops fall short – in both analysis and vision. There is a place for recognizing the critical role of implicit bias in racial disparities; it’s just not here. Bottom line – don’t be too quick to label Starbucks’ racial implicit bias trainings a victory. It’s far from it. The process for change is uncomfortable and if it’s not, then it’s probably not working."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/2018/apr/18/spanish-minister-contradicted-claim-that-catalans-misused-funds-says-judge","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-18T18:15:18Z","webTitle":"Spanish minister contradicted claim Catalan government misused funds, says judge","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/18/spanish-minister-contradicted-claim-that-catalans-misused-funds-says-judge","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/apr/18/spanish-minister-contradicted-claim-that-catalans-misused-funds-says-judge","fields":{"headline":"Spanish minister contradicted claim Catalan government misused funds, says judge","bodyText":"The Spanish supreme court judge investigating the Catalan independence referendum has asked Spain’s finance minister to explain why he claimed that no public money was used to stage the vote, saying the assertion contradicts one of the key allegations facing the former regional president and other members of his sacked government. Carles Puigdemont and several of his former ministers are currently under investigation over allegations of misuse of public funds, rebellion and sedition relating to their roles in last October’s illegal vote on splitting from Spain. However, in an interview published on Monday, the finance minister, Cristóbal Montoro, told the Spanish newspaper El Mundo that while he did not know where the funds for the vote had come from, “I do know it wasn’t public money”. The claim prompted a ruling from the judge, Pablo Llarena, two days later ordering Montoro “to provide, as soon as possible, the specific objective basis for those assertions”. Llarena also noted that several of those under investigation had seized on the minister’s statement as proof that the misuse of public funds allegations were unfounded. “Some of those under investigation,” he wrote on Wednesday, “have based their arguments on statements from the finance minister in which he allegedly expresses the certainty that no public money was spent on the vote held in Catalonia on 1 October 2017.” The judge also said such statements “contradicted evidence sources gathered during this investigation”. Puigdemont, who fled to Belgium following the referendum and the subsequent unilateral independence declaration, is currently in Germany facing extradition to Spain under an international arrest warrant. Two weeks ago, a court in Schleswig-Holstein rejected the extradition request over the rebellion allegations but said Puigdemont could be extradited over possible misuse of public funds. On Tuesday, the Spanish supreme court hit out at the German court, accusing it of “a lack of rigour” in its handling of the rebellion allegations. The legal investigations come as Catalan MPs struggle to form a new government after last December’s elections, which saw the pro-independence parties retain their parliamentary majority. Efforts to reappoint Puigdemont have come to nothing, while attempts to invest two other jailed Catalan leaders have been headed off by the Spanish courts. If a new government is not in place by 22 May, the region will return to the polls in July. On Wednesday, the speaker of the Catalan parliament said a new election was “not at all in the interest of Catalonia” and accused the Spanish authorities of thwarting the political process. “I think that this question should be put to the Spanish government and to the courts: how long will they continue to block [Catalonia’s president] from taking office?” said Roger Torrent. “It is the Spanish government and the institutions of the state, and in particular the courts, that are blocking the swearing-in from happening.” Catalonia has been under the control of the Spanish government since the end of October, when the prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, used the constitution to sack Puigdemont’s government and call elections."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2018/apr/18/khan-challenges-corbyn-walk-the-walk-labour-antisemitism","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-18T14:56:50Z","webTitle":"Sadiq Khan challenges Corbyn to 'walk the walk' on antisemitism","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/apr/18/khan-challenges-corbyn-walk-the-walk-labour-antisemitism","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/apr/18/khan-challenges-corbyn-walk-the-walk-labour-antisemitism","fields":{"headline":"Sadiq Khan challenges Corbyn to 'walk the walk' on antisemitism","bodyText":"Sadiq Khan has weighed in on the Labour antisemitism debate, claiming that some of the cases were so “glaringly obvious” that the party should have been quicker at kicking out offenders. The London mayor singled out his predecessor Ken Livingstone, saying it was “difficult to believe” that he had not been expelled nearly two years on from his “clearly antisemitic” remarks. He issued a challenge to Jeremy Corbyn to “walk the walk” on tackling antisemitism within the party, after the Labour leader instructed his new general secretary, Jennie Formby, to make it a priority. Corbyn has been accused of failing to tackle the issue head-on after a series of recommendations from an internal review by Shami Chakrabarti were slow to be implemented, with several still outstanding. Khan told the Guardian that he had spoken to Jewish Londoners who “genuinely believe” that the Labour party was not for them because it had failed to deal with the problem effectively. It came after Corbyn’s backbenchers had rounded on the failure of the party to tackle antisemitism in a blistering three-hour debate on Tuesday night that featured furious speeches from many Labour MPs which threatened his efforts to show that he is a “militant opponent” of antisemitism. Speaking at City Hall, Khan said: “A number of Londoners of Jewish faith I spoke to are finding it very difficult because they genuinely believe the Labour party is not for them. Why? Because they’re Jewish and there’s a perception that the Labour party has not dealt with the problems of antisemitism. You can’t escape the fact they genuinely believe that.” The London mayor, who said last year he was “deeply disappointed” that Livingstone had not been expelled from the party, insisted the veteran politician’s remarks linking Hitler and Zionism were “clearly antisemitic”. “I find it difficult to believe that two years on we haven’t managed to resolve this complaint,” he said. “Any member against whom an allegation of antisemitism is made has got to have that allegation investigated speedily, and if they are antisemitic, kicked out of the party.” He said Labour must have “zero tolerance” for anybody who was racist, adding: “Some complaints which are open and shut can be done very quickly. Some complaints may take longer. Of course we’ve got to have due process. But some of this is so glaringly obvious I don’t see why it takes so long.” In the House of Commons, Theresa May accused Corbyn of allowing antisemitism to “run rife” in the Labour party after he criticised her over the handling of the Windrush generation scandal. “He talks about being callous. I will not take that following a debate last night where powerful contributions were made particularly from [Ruth Smee, Margaret Hodge and Luciana Berger]. I will not take an accusation of [being] callous from a man who allows antisemitism to run rife in his own party.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"media/2018/apr/18/phil-hay-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-18T15:18:27Z","webTitle":"Phil Hay obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/apr/18/phil-hay-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2018/apr/18/phil-hay-obituary","fields":{"headline":"Phil Hay obituary","bodyText":"My friend Phil Hay, who has died of cancer aged 62, was a distinguished broadcast journalist and respected communications official with the World Bank. With a gift for laughter and a talent for friendship, he found his calling in communication. One of 11 children of Bernard, a schoolteacher, and Joanna, he was born in Stratford, New Zealand, a small town on the country’s north island. A degree in history and international politics from Victoria University of Wellington made journalism seem the obvious career choice. Phil’s start came at Radio New Zealand, as a producer and then editor on Morning Report, covering subjects from domestic politics to nuclear proliferation. Later he would listen back and laugh at his earlier self, grilling Wellington politicians as if they were responsible for the course of world events. But that interest in international affairs propelled him in the mid-80s to London and the BBC. He was a much-admired reporter for the Today programme, blessed with a mellifluous voice, eventually becoming the BBC’s correspondent in San Francisco. He moved in 1994 to Washington, where he was the founding producer of American Graffiti, a weekly magazine show for BBC Radio 5 Live that showcased both Phil’s uncanny ability to get people to talk and his eye for an amusing tale. Long day-night sessions spent making that programme frequently ended in howling laughter. But his passion for global affairs soon saw him embark on a second career in international development at the World Bank, which he joined in 1996. Phil was involved in speechwriting, and communications across a number of areas – including education and health – and across the globe. He exuded individuality, originality and unconventionality in both his personality and work. Phil cared deeply about the cause of development and brought energy and expertise to all that he did. Walking the corridors of the World Bank’s headquarters with him was inevitably punctuated by exchanged greetings, jokes and hugs from a seemingly endless line of people. He could also command an audience, moving hundreds of World Bank employees from laughter to solemnity in a moment, when introducing a film on Sudanese refugees. But his greatest joy was reserved for family – his wife, Anne (nee Cronin), and daughters, Maddy, Charlotte and Isabel. Phil would talk lovingly about spending time with them at home in Arlington, Virginia; how his girls were faring at college and school; and the joys of two and a half decades of married life. Phil was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in 2016. He understood the seriousness of his illness, but never lost his curiosity or humour, continuing to fire off emails, recommending a new book or an old song. He will be remembered with love by countless friends and colleagues who benefited from knowing a man of generosity, warmth and great wisdom. He is survived by Anne and their daughters, and by seven of his siblings – his brothers, Mark and Jeff, and sisters, Susan, Lisa, Jude, Kristin and Jane."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"stage/2018/apr/22/tremor-sherman-theatre-review-lisa-diveney-paul-rattray","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-22T07:00:19Z","webTitle":"Tremor review – an aftershock not fully realised","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/apr/22/tremor-sherman-theatre-review-lisa-diveney-paul-rattray","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2018/apr/22/tremor-sherman-theatre-review-lisa-diveney-paul-rattray","fields":{"headline":"Tremor review – an aftershock not fully realised","bodyText":"Brad Birch’s new play charts a series of aftershocks experienced by Tom and Sophie four years after a traumatic accident. At the time of the accident, they were a couple; they separated shortly afterwards and have not seen each other since. The opening shock, which sets off the first of the tremors suggested by the title, is Sophie’s unexpected arrival at Tom’s new home. It’s a classic pattern, the figure from the past who threatens a seemingly stable present. Much of the interest here is created through suspense: Tom’s suspense as he tries to work out how Sophie has found him and why? The audience’s suspense as we ask ourselves the same questions. Plus, what happened in their shared past and, as the action develops, what does this mean in a wider context? In the published text, Birch’s stage directions indicate: “Tom’s living room. Modern flat-pack furniture deliberately arranged, undercut by a scattering of toddler toys.” In their in-the-round production, director David Mercatali and designer Hayley Grindle present a bare circle, more like a gladiatorial arena than a room. While I don’t believe that productions have to reflect exactly an author’s stated intentions, in this instance, I feel that the change of setting exaggerates dramaturgical weaknesses in the text. Lisa Diveney and Paul Rattray are both very able actors but, restricted to standing or moving around the circle and so deprived of those small, physical actions that imply emotions beyond the words spoken, their characters come across as constructs. This in turn highlights the fact that information about the accident, communicated via the tunnel visions of these character-constructs, is too limited to allow the audience a view of what actually happened. The suspense of the opening feels like a manipulative device; the production presents, without quite satisfactorily dramatising, disturbing polarities in our society. • Tremor is at the Sherman theatre, Cardiff, until 5 May"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"music/2018/apr/19/drinks-hippo-lite-review-cate-le-bons-postcards-from-the-edge","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-19T11:00:04Z","webTitle":"Drinks: Hippo Lite review – Cate Le Bon's postcards from the edge","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/apr/19/drinks-hippo-lite-review-cate-le-bons-postcards-from-the-edge","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/apr/19/drinks-hippo-lite-review-cate-le-bons-postcards-from-the-edge","fields":{"headline":"Drinks: Hippo Lite review – Cate Le Bon's postcards from the edge","bodyText":"There may be no more concrete proof of Cate Le Bon’s stature than Noel Gallagher’s appearance on Later… With Jools Holland last October. Tucked in the back left of the stage, barely visible behind Gallagher’s groovy boys giving it their best Slade impression, stood a kind of Fake Le Bon: a woman sporting an exact replica of the Welsh guitarist’s old pudding-bowl haircut, plus the kind of cloak that she’s often flourished in videos and on stage. This austere figure also appeared to be playing a pair of scissors, and evidently represented Gallagher attempting to signpost his experimental streak amid the brawny 70s stomp. It was funny to see a fairly leftfield artist’s essence boiled down to aesthetic shorthand – especially since it’s an image that the wild Welsh guitarist has long since abandoned. Le Bon used to make lightly psychedelic pop that turned and resolved as satisfyingly as a Swiss cuckoo clock. But after weathering the stresses of money and critical opinion that followed 2013’s gorgeous Mug Museum, she decided to recalibrate her approach: “Music is supposed to be fun,” she told the Guardian. “It’s easy to forget that.” Now living in LA, she formed duo Drinks with Tim Presley, a one-time Fall member and power-pop innovator operating under the mantle of White Fence, a mutating outfit known for its collaborations with one-man cottage industry Ty Segall. The pair took inspiration from Soul Jazz’s pre-punk compilation Punk 45: There Is No Such Thing as Society, stripped away their respective heavenly ways with melody and got primitive on debut Hermits on Holiday: gnarled guitar motifs squawked like menacing birdsong, while strange insider jokes wove in and out of music that was intermittently funky and freeform. The liberating experience rubbed off on both parties: Le Bon’s next solo album, 2016’s fantastic Crab Day, was more dissonant and less linear than her past records, the lyrics full of muddled senses (“love is not love when it’s a coat hanger”) and broken emotional connections. She produced Presley’s The Wink, which shaved off his shaggier tendencies for a nervy high-wire act full of strange blooms of warmth and wit. To fans of post-punk and “psych”, whatever that means these days, Le Bon and Presley’s productions should be a playful, inventive tonic to genres that often come off as exercises in who has the best fancy dress box (an ongoing battle between Starcrawler and the Lemon Twigs). Until now, the duo’s various collaborations haven’t always fully communicated their obvious ease with one another, their intimacy occasionally peeping through pockets of cryptic skronk. But their second album is genuinely a case of hermits on holiday: the pair spent a month living in a crumbling house in Saint-Hippolyte-du-Fort (hence the title) in the south of France, swimming in rivers, dodging scorpions, drinking beer in deserted town squares and making an album at their leisure. It opens, on Blue from the Dark, with the kind of spindly Spanish guitar that might twang across one of these squares – a light, lulling melody that underpins their earnest harmonies and fades into the sound of children’s voices and backyard play. Hippo Lite is more atmospheric and relaxed than the duo’s recent combined releases, but this is largely a red herring: we’re nowhere near Cliff’s Summer Holiday. Instead, field recordings of croaking frogs and squeaking doors give the album its inviting sense of place, along with a lyrical scheme that’s mostly nonsense, but nonetheless conveys better than any postcard the peculiar sensations of being in an idyll far from home: “If you see me in a dream / Pedalling at half the time / Liquid spaces come in between”, they sing on Pink Or Die, capturing the strange dissolution of time in foreign climes. “Antihista, antihista!” they yelp on Leave the Lights On, as if scrabbling around for salve after a hornet sting. It is a fairly bizarre album, but an absorbing and clever one that gets stranger as it goes on. The ornate, cascading piano melodies in Corner Shops demand a microscope to see exactly how they’re knitted together, while Real Outside uses a needling guitar and the kind of lurching violin last heard on the Raincoats’ debut album to create a strange, ritualistic two-step that suggests the rules of some lost game. The closest the pair come to conventional intimacy is Greasing Up, which sounds as though they’ve unravelled a local folk song. In the later years of Presley and Le Bon’s careers, Hippo Lite probably won’t be regarded as a major event, but when every aspect of an artist’s career is monetised, and album promotion cycles seem more like personality cults, it’s this casual approach to creativity that makes it so appealing. Anyone can cut their hair and wield a pair of scissors, but Drinks’ sensibility is much harder to bottle."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"music/2018/apr/19/what-no-whitney-the-biggest-rock-roll-hall-of-fame-snubs-ever-ranked","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-19T11:00:43Z","webTitle":"What, no Whitney?

Björk This week saw the latest batch of inductees into the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland, Ohio, but – like many other uncategorisable, expansive, eclectic and influential singer-songwriters – Björk was nowhere to be seen. 19. Lee “Scratch” Perry Reggae doesn’t get much of a look-in: Bob Marley and Jimmy Cliff are there, but not the genre’s most exploratory and unhinged artist/producer. 18. Suicide The hall of fame is not an institution much given to frightening the horses – and frightening the horses was very much the point of Suicide’s minimal, electronic updating of rock’n’roll. 17. Larry Williams An absent rock’n’roller – beloved of the Beatles, who covered three of his songs – whose career shifted from rock to soul and back again. 16. Black Flag This year, Bad Brains were nominated – the first time hardcore punk has impinged on the event’s consciousness: no Black Flag, no Minor Threat, no Dead Kennedys. 15. Derrick May Disco is underrepresented, but it is present in abundance compared with house and techno, which has not a solitary artist or producer in the Hall of Fame. 14. Roberta Flack Curiously, Flack’s measured, urbane and quietly intense brand of soul-jazz was panned by US critics during her heyday, which may account for her absence here. 13. Love The least biddable of west coast 60s psych legends are another surprising omission: perhaps their masterpiece, Forever Changes, offers too bleak a view of the summer of love. 12. Depeche Mode U2 aside, the hall really doesn’t do British post-punk, no matter how stadium-packing. Not only are Depeche Mode absent, the Cure are, too. 11. Eric B &amp; Rakim After years of ignoring hip-hop, a few rappers have been admitted. The operative word is “few”: the greatest, most influential duo of rap’s golden age are noticeable by their absence. 10. Whitney Houston The Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame is not a bastion of pop, but it isn’t entirely immune to its charms. Madonna is in there, which raises the question: why not Houston, who sold 200m records, was the first black woman to get heavy rotation on MTV, and created the soul diva’s latterday template? 9. The New York Dolls Punk’s forebears are thinly represented in the hall of fame’s pantheon: the Stooges are there, but not the MC5; Lou Reed only got a posthumous induction. And there’s no sign of the New York Dolls, whose boundary-pushing, gender-confusing brand of glam (another genre the Hall of Fame largely overlooks) lit a fire under Ramones and the Sex Pistols alike. 8. Kate Bush You might excuse her exclusion because she never really broke the US. But if the mark of a great artist is how many others claim them as an inspiration, without coming close to replicating their idiosyncratic genius, then Bush is about as great an artist as you can get … 7. Captain Beefheart … which brings us to another inimitable artist: nearly 50 years on, the avant mangling of the blues found on Beefheart’s 1969 masterpiece, Trout Mask Replica, remains a gold standard by which all rock music’s challenging explorations of the far-out are judged. He is not in the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame – but Journey are. 6. Iron Maiden The hall seems to have as sniffy an attitude to heavy metal as it does to all forms of dance music: it exists in a bizarre parallel universe of hard rock where Bon Jovi are more worthy than Judas Priest. No nod either for Iron Maiden, progenitors of the new wave of British heavy metal and a band of pivotal and unceasing importance to their genre. 5. Johnny Burnette The hall of fame is good on foundation rock’n’roll: its initial USP was to honour the US’s 50s legends – but they missed the toughest 50s legend of all. Listen to the Johnny Burnette Trio’s ferocious 1956 single Train Kept A-Rollin’, complete with groundbreaking distorted guitar, and you hear the roots of everything from garage rock to Motörhead to Led Zeppelin. It was the first song the latter ever performed. 4. Gil Scott-Heron A strange omission. His work is hardly obscure – who doesn’t know The Bottle and Home Is Where the Hatred Is? – and his groundbreaking, no-compromise fusion of soul, jazz, blues, spoken word and biting social commentary hangs heavy over successive generations of soul artists and rappers. “He influenced all of hip-hop,” as Eminem noted. 3. Gram Parsons Some hall of fame snubs are explicable – hats off to the website doughtily campaigning on behalf of R Kelly – and others suggest the voters may have strict musical tastes. Others are inexplicable: even given the institution’s self-imposed boundaries of taste, how has the man widely credited with single-handedly inventing the notion of country-rock been missed out? 2. Kraftwerk You can understand why, say, Can and Neu! have failed to make the cut: European experimentalism isn’t really the hall of fame’s thing. But the extent of Kraftwerk’s influence over subsequent pop music – they are the electronic Velvet Underground – makes the fact they were overlooked this year in favour of Dire Straits as mind-blowing in its own way as hearing Trans-Europe Express for the first time. 1. Chic There are few episodes in the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame’s history as excruciating as the non-induction of Chic, which seemed to speak loudly about certain deep-seated musical prejudices. Donna Summer was posthumously inducted, but the sense that here is a world where disco still sucks is hard to miss, no matter how spectacular and influential Chic’s career as artists and producers. They were perennially nominated and perennially knocked back, until Nile Rodgers was eventually given a consolation prize: an award for musical excellence that came complete with an online citation that posited him as an artist who made “danceable rock”, presumably lest the kind of hooting thicko that turned up at the 1979 Disco Demolition riot get upset."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"education/2018/apr/18/inclusion-in-education-works-we-must-respect-it","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-18T16:53:25Z","webTitle":"Inclusion in education works.

We must respect it","bodyText":"It was my great privilege to lead an inclusive secondary modern school in the selective nightmare that is Lincolnshire (Forcing schools to abandon inclusion leaves us all poorer, 16 April). We actively welcomed those with complex social and emotional needs, and our school community benefited enormously. Clive (not his real name) had Asperger’s. Everyone got to know him. Everyone recognised his difference. By educating all about Asperger’s, it was possible for Clive to be himself and be accepted. We learned more from him about the autistic spectrum than any course any of us attended. He blazed a trail so that staff and students could welcome those with the other alphabet soup of conditions that demand inclusion but are so often met with intolerance and exclusion. Through careful support and reasonable adjustments, and alongside our sensory impaired students, we were able to ensure that opportunity was given to all to fulfil themselves and become the best that they could be. My successor has, due to curriculum changes and budget restrictions, cut back on the availability of courses appropriate to need and removed the support network integral to the success of inclusion. The school is no longer an inclusive one and a light has dimmed in that particular part of the county. I know that this is happening across many schools in England. Inclusion works. It enables understanding, empathy and tolerance. Our education system is moving further away from these qualities that are fundamental to the development of a cohesive society. What trouble are we storing up for ourselves consigning so many to such an experience? What hope do we give them for the future? Martyn Taylor Newark, Nottinghamshire • Fully inclusive schools are vital not only for children with attributes that fall outside the ever-narrowing, exam-grades-driven “norm”, and for their peers, but also for society as a whole. Without the real understanding of human difference with which proudly diverse schools endow their pupils, how are the adults whom these children become going to make a good society? Employers and recruiters need to understand what people can do and make adjustments for anything they can’t do in the usual way; employees need to work well in diverse and inclusive teams; and customers need to make their train journeys, do their shopping and enjoy their coffee among a diversity of fellow customers who reflect the population – with no one excluded. Dr Jane Frances Cambridge • John Harris is right to say that central government policies are abandoning inclusion as an educational principle. As he says, this is not entirely a product of education policies but also due to the starvation of funds for local government. However, the problems for education that most directly affect children with additional (special) educational needs are more deeply rooted in the poverty of purposes and ideals for education. Education has become a commercial and technical enterprise and lost touch with humanity. Unless that can be restored we are all the poorer. Dr Simon Gibbs Newcastle on Tyne • Forcing schools to abandon inclusion indeed leaves us all poorer. In 1978 the Warnock report was published and the “integration” movement received a boost. The 1981 Education Act made provision for pupils to be educated in mainstream schools. Further progress was made as the statutory assessment process took off and an increasing number of children received statements outlining their special educational needs (SEN). There were always tensions between the identified needs of a child and the budget available to meet those needs, but a high proportion of children with SEN were educated relatively successfully in mainstream schools. The rot began to set in with the reporting of test results, compounded by Ofsted assessments that moved more and more to analysis of schools’ performance. Children with SEN were the losers as the drive for higher test results led schools to adopt the kind of unethical practices outlined by John Harris. The squeeze on schools’ funding, together with a change in legislation that has had the impact of making it harder to identify and meet children’s needs, has resulted in the deterioration in the quality of educational provision offered to those with the greatest needs. Linda Rhead London • Your piece on families crowdfunding to take legal action against special needs cuts (Report, 14 April) is both sad and immensely worrying. There is an elephant in the room, which I describe as the values inherent in leadership decisions. The leadership roles are in central government, in local authorities and in schools. There are academy executive heads commanding salaries of three to four times the general pay and conditions salaries for a headteacher. Schools are “choosing” to reduce the support for struggling pupils and seeking to shed the blame, while the proliferation of school leadership roles for people who do not teach continues. In local authorities, there is a vacuum where there were once assistant directors and advisers with leadership roles that had SEN and schools’ overall quality as their focus. Chief officers are making cuts to local services while earning more than the prime minister does. At the level of central government, there is a lack of moral principle in both education and in health.

Is it the sense of gathering storm in international relations, at the very heart of which is the tournament’s host nation? Is it the mounting air of absurdity that might attend an event hosted by a Russian leader seemingly bent on playing the pariah, who is engaged in gruesome and increasingly provocative proxy conflict in Syria, and who was at the weekend accused of tampering with evidence at the site of a suspected chemical attack while denying weapons inspectors access to it? Is Infantino wondering how he can honestly be photographed having the usual lighthearted promotional kickabout with president Vladimir Putin, who an international coalition holds explicitly responsible for the recent deployment of nerve agent against two civilians on UK soil? Is Infantino thinking that even by his own standards of grinning idiocy, this might look too useful for words? Don’t be silly. Like anyone who understands even the Ladybird version of the news, Gianni is concerned that the television rights to the World Cup after the pending one – Qatar 2022 – might have been undersold. They could totally have got a billion dollars more, even if it is in winter and the required run of 64 matches is already cocking up all manner of domestic competitions. Consequently, Infantino muses after a very obliging proposal from Conmebol, it might be time to rush through his sporticidal plan for a 48-team World Cup and make Qatar host one of those at short notice instead. Could the tiny emirate make the jump to 84 matches too? We shall come to the geopolitical problems with such a wheeze shortly. Before we do, perhaps I have underestimated Infantino’s grasp of the manifold tensions building as we head towards Russia 2018. After all, the Fifa president is, he assured us last week, “ready for controversy”. But the controversy he is ready for turns out to be controversy over VAR. It is a “brand new controversy”, he concedes. Then again, so is the looming threat of World War III. I suppose you’ve got to try these things. As for the preposterous suggestion that Qatar should now be made to host a 48-team World Cup, you have to admire Infantino’s gift for diversion. “I really think it is something very interesting,” he said last week of the Conmebol proposal – and you can see why he would think such a thing much more interesting than discussing the imminent World Cup. “We have to study it seriously, and if it is possible, why not?” No doubt Qatar would be able to answer that question with some passion, what with its attendant obligation to provide four more stadiums at short notice. They’ve already had to sling up a new town or two to stop the required World Cup venues looking silly. The alternative is that they share hosting duties with some regional neighbours. Again, I am unsure which version of the news Infantino reads, but there are what we might call local difficulties in that area, what with the Saudi and Emirati-led boycott of Qatar that has hampered the emirate since June last year. Even delivering fully on their plans for the 32-team tournament is looking like a stretch for the 2022 hosts, with Qatar currently far from meeting their accommodation targets. Iran is already preparing to offer overspill accommodation on the sharia-enforcing islands of Kish and Qeshm if needed. Those not tempted by that possibility may be enticed by Qatar’s own idea: to use cruise ships to accommodate travelling fans, as well as – in an ironic twist some way short of delicious – upgrading the controversial migrant labour camps that housed the workers that built the infrastructure. Kuwait may be the more palatable option, certainly for taking on extra World Cup matches. As far as any thaw in the boycott goes, even UAE, who originally offered to host matches in 2022, marked the new year by projecting the flags of all Gulf nations except Qatar on to the Burj Khalifa. Details, details. Hassan al-Thawadi, the general secretary overseeing Qatar’s World Cup planning, is looking on the bright side. “If North and South Korea can come together for the winter Olympics,” he declared this year, “so can the Middle East at the World Cup.” Still, if even these fantastical diversions don’t draw your eye from Russia 2018, Infantino has others for you. The first is expanding the current eight-team Club World Cup competition to 24 teams. There’s up to $25bn in that, apparently, as long as it goes hand-in-hand with his second proposal – a global league for national sides. “There are companies that are interested in it,” Infantino revealed vaguely last week. Concerned at the ever-increasing demands on players, European Leagues president and ExCo member Lars-Christer Olsson told the Times this week: “It cannot just be money deciding how football should be organised.” Oh, Lars-Christer! I think we know it can. As always with Fifa, we find ourselves where we do because of money – overt and covert. A corrupt joint bidding process for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups is now running up against global politics that make even those of Fifa look decidedly Mickey Mouse. The Fifa president appears to be mounting a massive rearguard exercise in distraction – again driven by money. This feels quite the Sorcerer’s Apprentice move, but still, what’s the worst that could happen?"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"education/2018/apr/18/british-girl-wins-gold-medal-at-international-maths-competition","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-18T16:18:43Z","webTitle":"British girl wins gold medal in international maths competition","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2018/apr/18/british-girl-wins-gold-medal-at-international-maths-competition","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/education/2018/apr/18/british-girl-wins-gold-medal-at-international-maths-competition","fields":{"headline":"British girl wins gold medal in international maths competition","bodyText":"A 17-year-old Briton has won a gold medal in an international mathematics competition, becoming the first UK entrant to achieve full marks. Emily Beatty, who attends King Edward VII school in Sheffield, came joint-first among nearly 200 teenagers who took part. She was one of only five competitors to get a perfect score of 42 out of 42. The British team finished third of 52 in the European Girls’ Mathematical Olympiad, which took place in Florence, Italy. Her teammates Alevtina Studenikina, from Cheltenham Ladies college in Gloucestershire, and Naomi Wei, from City of London Girls’ school, won silver medals for their scores. Melissa Quail, from Longsands academy in Cambridgeshire, won a bronze medal. The team was chosen by the UK Mathematics Trust (UKMT), a charity set up to advance young people’s education in maths. Speaking the day before the competition, Beatty and her teammates explained why they loved the subject. Beatty said she has always found “elegance in doing mathematics” and that she likes the way “structures weave into each other”. Studenikina said: “I find Olympiad-style mathematics questions interesting because, even though they do not necessarily seem to have useful applications, principles and skills obtained from solving them help solve real-life problems.” Quail said she enjoyed solving maths problems as they allowed her the freedom to use her imagination and creativity. Data shows that 65% of boys who get As in GCSE maths choose to take it at A-level, compared with 43% of girls. Only 39% of maths candidates and 27% of further maths candidates are female. Speaking to the Times Education Supplement, Beatty’s maths teacher, Graham Harvey, said that older pupils could be good role models for young mathematicians. “Probably the biggest impact on Emily was from one of our former students, another girl, currently at Cambridge studying maths,” he said. “We have always encouraged our older students to help us run clubs for the younger ones. Emily herself is currently mentoring one of our year 10 students. We also have a significant number of female maths teachers in the department.” Linda Gooden, the headteacher at King Edward VII school, said: “As a headteacher, I alongside all the other staff in school are really proud of Emily’s success and achievements. We always encourage staff to develop and enhance depth of mathematical understanding from an early age. We are really pleased with Emily’s achievements and know her parents will be proud too.” Rachel Greenhalgh, the director of the UK Mathematics Trust, said: “The team demonstrated their outstanding problem-solving skills and it is great to see their mathematical potential recognised. “I thank all those involved, from the maths teachers who support our activities and the UKMT volunteers who run them on our behalf, to our sponsors and supporters, in helping make this possible.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/bike-blog/2018/apr/20/mallorcas-scenic-roads-designed-for-early-motorists-are-a-cyclists-dream","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-20T10:46:10Z","webTitle":"Mallorca's scenic roads, designed for early motorists, are a cyclist's dream","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/bike-blog/2018/apr/20/mallorcas-scenic-roads-designed-for-early-motorists-are-a-cyclists-dream","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/bike-blog/2018/apr/20/mallorcas-scenic-roads-designed-for-early-motorists-are-a-cyclists-dream","fields":{"headline":"Mallorca's scenic roads, designed for early motorists, are a cyclist's dream","bodyText":"Mallorca attracts more than 200,000 roadies a year. Bradley Wiggins and Chris Froome are usually credited for popularising winter riding on this Spanish Balearic island, but it’s two others who really put the island on the cycling map, one of them quite literally. 1950s pro cyclist Doug Petty has been bringing cyclists to Mallorca every year for 51 years, and he’s been able to keep them coming because of the lure of two twisting roads built in the late-1920s by local engineer Antoni Parietti, who built the snaking carreteres to attract motor tourists. Sports car drivers still head to the Coll dels Reis and the Cap de Formentor mountain road, but the majority of those now skimming Parietti’s curves are pedal powered. Petty started leading road-bike tours of Mallorca in 1968 and the sprightly 88-year-old is still doing so, with Parietti’s roads being the key draw. Both are bucket-list climbs with killer sea views – and are usually bathed in sunshine, with advice from ride guides to “drink plenty of water.” But when I was there in mid-April, there was plenty of water falling from the sky. Mallorca doesn’t usually get much rain, but it got plenty that week. I’d left the beach resort of Alcúdia at 6.30am to climb through the Unesco world heritage listed Tramuntana mountains to the top of the Coll dels Reis, wanting to get there before the crowds. Tourist coaches and fellow cyclists can clog the hairpins, I’d heard, but there were none when I was there. Unusually, this famous ascent has to be descended first. Parietti built the road to kick-start the tourist industry in the two-house fishing port of Sa Calobra, which then as now can only be otherwise reached by boat. Mallorca has long been a tourist destination – composer Frédéric Chopin holidayed on the island as early as 1838 and the swashbuckling Errol Flynn wreaked havoc in the bars when he lived here in the 1950s. Of course, lager-fuelled swashbucklers of an altogether different kind swamped the package-tourism resorts of Magaluf and Palma Nova in the 1970s. But in the off- and shoulder-seasons it’s now cyclists sustaining Mallorca’s rural economy, with the petrol filling stations on the main climbs surprisingly well stocked with energy gels and 700c inner tubes. The Coll dels Reis climb – more usually known by the name of Sa Calobra – ascends to 668 metres over 9.4kms of supremely smooth tarmac. It has 26 hairpin bends, and, at the top, a bonkers bridge which loops over its own road, a 270-degree coil that kicks up the gradient from 7% to 11%. These aren’t tough inclines: the climb attracts riders because of the switchbacks not the steepness. 55,000 riders have logged their Sa Calobra climb times on Strava, with the fastest ascent taking just 24 minutes 54 seconds. Wiggins is said to have logged an even faster time during the preparation for his 2012 Tour de France victory, but he didn’t upload it. I ascended Sa Calobra in 42.42 and would like to think I could ride it faster in more clement weather. At the top, and to prevent hypothermia, I bought a hot chocolate, but as the cafe was open to the elements there was no drying out of my wet kit. The chilly return to Alcúdia was mostly downhill and, unlike earlier in the day, the road now heaved with cyclists, many of whom were no doubt heading to Sa Calobra. Rosa Simo, the manager of the Iberostar Playa de Muro hotel in Alcúdia, told me that 90% of the hotel’s 700 guests were cyclists. The hotel is known as a cycling hot-spot as it also hosts the annual Challenge Mallorca stage race, a pre-season favourite for pro teams.

The Netherlands’ intensive farming and temperate climate make it the best country for geese in Europe, according to the Sovon Dutch centre for field ornithology, the organisation responsible for surveying bird populations. The population boom, however, is not without problems. Roadside grasslands are particularly attractive to breeding birds because of their the abundance of clover leaves and protection from predators. Hundreds of geese have been spotted off roads in Gelderland in the east of the country and elsewhere. Others have been swooping down into the paths of cars and lorries, presumably seeking to protect their offspring. A stretch of road in the town of Opheusden, in Gelderland, reported four collisions in a week. Albert de Jong from the Sovon centre called for drivers to be wary, but insisted that it was for the government now to take the risks seriously and build infrastructure to deter the birds from major roads. “We have during the summer more than 500,000 geese and we are a small country,” he said. “That’s because we are very suitable for them. The junctions on the motorways provide small pieces of nature. There is grass, access to water, and they are away from predatory risk as it is too dangerous for the foxes. Geese are very opportunistic.“It is a dangerous situation. I have seen some just flying in front of vehicles or walking on to the roads. They are defending their territory. First of all we need to discover the areas where they are breeding, where this is a problem. We know a lot of them but not all of them. We need to make it less attractive to the geese. Drivers aren’t going to drive more slowly for them.” The Dutch government had said in 2013 that it wanted to reduce the size of its goose population back to its 2005 levels which, experts say, would entail the slaughter of 500,000 birds. The state pays tens of millions of euros to farmers every year to compensate for damage to crops caused by greylag, barnacle and white-fronted geese. Schiphol and Noord-Holland have been in a long-running fight for approval to gas thousands of geese in the area around the airport, one of the biggest in Europe, despite a court ban. A spokesman for the Rijkswaterstaat, which is responsible for road safety, told Dutch newspaper De Telegraaf that it was constantly erecting fences to keep animals off the roads but that this was impossible for flying birds. “We cannot quite avoid that entirely,” the spokesman said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2018/apr/21/that-show-was-as-white-as-it-gets-sex-and-the-citys-problematic-legacy","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-21T08:59:09Z","webTitle":"‘That show was as white as it gets!’ Sex and the City’s problematic legacy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/apr/21/that-show-was-as-white-as-it-gets-sex-and-the-citys-problematic-legacy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2018/apr/21/that-show-was-as-white-as-it-gets-sex-and-the-citys-problematic-legacy","fields":{"headline":"‘That show was as white as it gets!’ Sex and the City’s problematic legacy","bodyText":"The Halloween before last, Dan Clay went out in an outfit that changed his life. He paired a baby-pink tank top with a white tutu and accessorised with heels, a tumble of blond curls and a splash of NYC puddle water: Carrie Dragshaw was born. “It started as a really innocent Halloween costume with no aspirations of internet celebrity,” says the Manhattan-based strategy consultant, whose 108,000 Instagram followers now include one Sarah Jessica Parker. Clay’s earliest memories of Sex and the City involve publicly scorning the show as a still-closeted frat boy, but those days are long gone. “The first time I got into it, it was like a complete Carrie love-fest,” he says. “I was like ‘She is me! I am her! I’ve never seen myself so mirrored!’” Many of his social circle feel the same way: “It’s like our Seinfeld, the way that people say for every moment you experience in life, there is a Seinfeld reference? I feel like Sex and the City is that for people who are going on a lot of dates and going to lots of magazine launches.” The magazine launch-attending demographic may be larger than previously imagined. Clay’s Carrie Dragshaw is just one of many manifestations of SATC’s passionate, diverse and seemingly ever-strengthening fanbase. In the 14 years since the finale aired, Instagram fan accounts such as Every Outfit on Sex and the City and Sex and the City Quotes have accumulated hundreds of thousands of followers, and even after the nixing of a mooted third feature film, they remain committed. This summer, that fandom faces its most serious test yet, as Cynthia Nixon, who played Miranda on the show, runs in the Democratic primary for New York governor. Meanwhile, the show’s sex-positive, female-fronted TV successors (Girls, Girlfriends, The Mindy Project) have spawned successors of their own (Crazy Ex-Girlfriend, Insecure, Divorce). Yet, somehow, SATC’s critical appreciation and cultural standing have never equalled its enduring popular appeal. It seems the Sex and the City legacy is determined by two, often conflated questions: was it any good? And were Carrie, Miranda, Charlotte and Samantha good feminist role models? We should be able to answer the first without too much trouble — if you like it, you like it; yet ongoing disputes around the second tend to colour all judgments. And there’s no getting around the fact that much of SATC looks extremely un-woke by 2017 standards. “That show was as white as it gets,” says Chelsea Fairless, fashion editor, designer and co-founder of Every Outfit on Sex and the City and the #WokeCharlotte meme. “They didn’t ever have a person of colour as a series regular.” Fairless also admits that many of the show’s overt racial insensitivities (Samantha in a post-chemo afro wig, Carrie’s “ghetto gold”) went over her head on first viewing. “I’m white and I wasn’t educated or a particularly good ally at that point in my life. I did take issue with their handling of certain queer issues back in the 90s, because that is my community … But I’m not about to protest the show on those grounds; I’ll just make fun of it on Instagram instead.” Other SATC issues, such as the show’s overt materialism and utterly fantastical depiction of the lifestyle afforded by freelance journalism, were controversial almost from the get-go. By the sixth and final season the writers seemed to be deliberately courting feminist disapproval, with episode titles such as A Woman’s Right To Shoes. Yet the enjoyment fans took in the show’s many pleasures seemed to make them impervious to its flaws. As has only become more obvious in the intervening years, frivolity on SATC was never just frivolity; it was an all-encompassing creative aesthetic – one so fertile that neither Carrie Dragshaw nor Every Outfit on Sex and the City seem likely to run out of inspiration any time soon. “I would venture to say that the mix of high fashion and fast fashion that [costume designer] Patricia Field brought to the show influenced most people who work in fashion in one way or another,” says Fairless, whose own recently launched design line, Female Trouble, includes Carrie-inspired nameplate necklaces. So perhaps the “Yeah, I know … but it’s fun!” defence isn’t as weak as it might initially seem? The very fact that we’re able to so overlook SATC’s impact is proof of how truly transformative it was, says Liz Tuccillo, a writer on the show whose subsequent books He’s Just Not That Into You (with Greg Behrendt, 2004) and How to Be Single (2008) both spawned hit screen adaptations of their own. “These women were the first on television to say, ‘We are in our 30s, we want love, but we’re also going to have fun, have sex, go out.’ They allowed this time of singleness to not just be a frightening time of not knowing when or if he would show up, but also of glamour and joy and friendship.” By inviting the single life into the shimmery spotlight, SATC also created space for some consideration more serious than Carrie’s “I couldn’t help but wonder … ” musings. Books on the single woman, her history and her habits became a mini-publishing phenomenon, epitomised by Kate Bolick’s 2015 memoir-cum-biography Spinster (of which SJP is also, reportedly, a fan). “In 2000, when I moved from Boston to New York to study cultural criticism, more than a few people said, ‘Ah, you want to be Carrie Bradshaw!’” recalls Bolick. “I found [it] insulting … Carrie Bradshaw is fun and likable – I’d love to get a drink with her – but she’s not a serious thinker or writer.” Yet Bolick agrees with Tuccillo’s assessment of the show’s wider importance: “I definitely appreciate that the show portrayed single women as autonomous sexual creatures with thriving careers, rather than sad, lonely spinsters. And, truly, the show was a genius way to capture what, at the time, was a totally not-understood demographic shift, in which women were pushing off the age of first marriage and making more money than ever before.” So perhaps SATC’s most serious shortcoming was its final one. After 94 episodes of extolling a woman’s friends as her true soulmates, the finale gave into romcom’s most tedious convention: it coupled up Carrie with Big in the ultimate marriage of narrative convenience. Candace Bushnell, author of the original New York Observer columns, admitted as much in a Guardian interview last year: “Well, I think, in real life, Carrie and Big wouldn’t have ended up together,” she said. “But at that point the TV show had become so big … it’s show business, not show art, so at that point it was for the audience and we weren’t thinking about what the impact would be 10 years later.” At least the disappointment of this unhappily happy ending is easy enough to resolve: simply never acknowledge that Sex and the City has, in fact, ended. That’s what Dan Clay is doing: “I tried to, like, rewrite history and imbue Carrie Dragshaw with all of the traits that I loved about Carrie [Bradshaw] and none of the ones I didn’t,” he says. “The internet is a pretty intense place at times – like, a lot of tough news – and Carrie’s not political at all, she exists outside of all that.” The escapist joy of harking back to this pre-Trump, even pre-9/11 innocence, is payment enough for Clay; he donates any money made from Carrie Dragshaw to charitable causes, which “help spread the message of love that she was born for”. Never-ending Sex and the City also means enough time for everyone to gradually learn to own the fact that they loved it all along – and that’s OK. As the noted academic and novelist Roxane Gay wrote in her 2014 essay collection Bad Feminist (essential reading for any conflicted SATC fan), “I have certain … interests and personality traits and opinions that may not fall in line with mainstream feminism, but I am still a feminist. I cannot tell you how freeing it has been to accept this about myself.” For Clay, whose embracing of Sex and the City went hand-in-hand with coming out as gay, this experience has been nothing less than transformative: “If you’re trying to hide yourself, there are certain things that you don’t even entertain the possibility of, y’know? Don’t say you like Britney Spears too loudly, don’t wear too-tight pants, don’t watch Sex and the City. So then, just allowing myself to like what I like and not question it, became this very minor act of self-expression and self-love.” That’s what the Sex and the City fandom is about in the end: a little bit of self-love in a harsh world. Whether you’re a feminist concerned about letting the side down, a Sopranos-worshipping straight dude who’s unwittingly bought into the myth that high feminine cannot equal high culture, or a gay man desperately trying to stay closeted, making peace with your inner girlie-girl Carrie can do you good. “Of course the perfect feminist wouldn’t watch Sex and the City!” says Fairless. “It’s too white, it’s too materialistic, it’s not serious enough, but I’m exhausted just thinking about the amount of willpower that it would require for me to boycott it. And I’d rather use that energy to dismantle the patriarchy, obvs.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"film/2018/apr/22/funny-cow-review-maxine-peake-paddy-considine","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-22T08:00:18Z","webTitle":"Funny Cow review – grit and wit","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/apr/22/funny-cow-review-maxine-peake-paddy-considine","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/apr/22/funny-cow-review-maxine-peake-paddy-considine","fields":{"headline":"Funny Cow review – grit and wit","bodyText":"There are several moments in this astringently uncomfortable tragicomedy – which boasts a blistering central performance by Maxine Peake – that will leave audiences squirming and divided. Funny Cow follows the changing fortunes of a standup comic finding her feet in the northern working men’s clubs of the 70s. It has been described by writer and co-star Tony Pitts as “an unblinking obituary” and “unsentimental commentary” on the culture in which he grew up. Some will be shocked by Peake’s “Funny Cow” (we know her only by her stage name), winning round hostile audiences with un-PC gags that were once the backbone of the British club circuit. Others will simply nod in resigned recognition at this hard-knocks world in which “it’s not about being funny, it’s about surviving”. There are echoes of Mat Whitecross’s 2010 Ian Dury biopic Sex &amp; Drugs &amp; Rock &amp; Roll in the slightly surreal framing sequences through which Peake’s antiheroine presents a cabaret-style collage of her life. Stepping into the backstreets of her past, the now successful adult, who combines the glamour of Marti Caine with the true grit of Cathy Come Home actress Carol White, meets her childhood self: a vibrant, crimson streak in a drab, grey world. Habitually dressed in red, this young firebrand carries a balloon and believes she can fly – an image that recurs throughout the film. Fleeing the nest, she moves in with Bob (Pitts), whose violent rages she meets with a deadpan defiance learned at the wrong end of her father’s belt (“Are you angry? You seem angry”). Later she picks up with Paddy Considine’s parodically middle-class Angus, who takes her to see Albert Lamorisse’s Le Ballon Rouge, and causes her to exclaim, “I’m not Eliza fucking Doolittle!” Having embraced her outsider status as a child, Peake’s misfit only feels at home on stage. “I can’t be a civilian,” she tells Alun Armstrong’s Lenny, the miserable “master of mirth” who assures her that “women aren’t funny”, and suggests she try singing or stripping instead. “I died years ago,” Lenny admits despondently. “I’m a comedic zombie.” As for Funny Cow, she has learned to “spit it out or swallow it up”; to accept that life can be “too much and not enough at the same time”. From brutal domestic fireworks to shabby onstage entrances, cinematographer Tony Slater Ling’s focus rarely strays from Peake’s protagonist, with Steadicam operator Roger Tooley following her down streets and corridors, sticking close to her side. It’s an intimate portrait of an often abrasive character who wears her inability to love as a badge of honour. Peake rises magnificently to the challenges of the role, her face flickering between a practised smile and a silent scream, ripe with contradiction. A scene in which the camera holds her gaze as she freezes on stage is particularly unforgiving – a symphony of pain and panic, sadness and rage, all playing simultaneously across Peake’s mercurial face. There are clear connections to Trevor Griffiths’s play Comedians, along with more unexpected echoes of David Seltzer’s often forgotten film Punchline. One critic famously charged the latter with committing the unforgivable sin of being “a movie about comedy that’s not funny” – something that could also be said of Funny Cow. But while the standup declares that it’s her job to “make ’em laugh”, Pitts and director Adrian Shergold, a TV veteran whose credits include the brilliant Pierrepoint, are aiming for something more complex – to make us care for Funny Cow without feeling sorry for her. The supporting roles are solid, from Stephen Graham’s twin turn as brutal father and cowed brother, to Lindsey Coulson’s heartbreaking performance as an increasingly lonely mum, driven to drink by the sheer coldness of life. There are some eye-catching cameos, too, from comedians such as John Bishop and Jim Moir (AKA Vic Reeves) to Dexys frontman Kevin Rowland, in superbly morose form. Richard Hawley pops up as part of a nightclub duo with Corinne Bailey Rae, and also serves as the film’s composer, providing bittersweet counterpoint to the downbeat drama. As Kim Longinotto demonstrated in her wonderful documentary Love Is All (2014), there’s a uniquely cinematic quality to Hawley’s work, with its peerless evocation of social realism and romantic beauty intertwined. Funny Cow may prove as hard to embrace as its spiky subject, but Peake’s performance and Hawley’s music help to carry us across the threshold."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"science/2018/apr/18/defeated-by-ikeas-flatpack-call-in-the-robots","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-18T18:00:31Z","webTitle":"Flat-pack heaven?

Robots master task of assembling Ikea chair","bodyText":"Those who fear the rise of the machines, look away now. In a laboratory in Singapore two robots have mastered a task that roundly defeats humans every weekend: they have successfully assembled an Ikea chair. Engineers at Nanyang Technological University used a 3D camera and two industrial robot arms fitted with grippers and force sensors to take on the challenge of building an £18 “Stefan” chair from the furniture company. Working together, the robots completed the job in 20 minutes and 19 seconds after having the parts placed in front of them. More than half of the time was spent planning moves, with the execution taking nine minutes in total. Typically, the job takes a person 10 to 15 minutes, an Ikea spokesperson said. Lead researcher Quang-Cuong Pham said he wanted to test whether robotics equipment already on the market was capable of pulling off such a complicated job. It requires the machines to recognise the chair parts, work out how to pick them up and move them without causing damage, and then perform the moves flawlessly. “Our aim was to bring all these capabilities together and push them to the limit,” he said. It took a few attempts to get it right. Early on, the robots dropped wooden pins, let go of parts too soon, and performed moves that did more to dismantle the chair than assemble it. Some moves required a part to be held by both robots at the same time, and since industrial robots are far stronger than Ikea furniture, a number of mistakes ended badly. “We bought four chair kits and broke a few of them,” said Pham. The robots did not work out what to do from scratch. They were programmed to know what the parts of the chair looked like, how they should go together, and in what order. “What it works out on the fly is how to do it,” said Pham. So far the robots can only assemble the chair frame, which is held together with wooden pins. To put each one in place, the robot finds roughly the right spot and then moves the pin around in a spiral until it locates the hole. The next step is to have the robots finish the job by bolting the various parts together. “That could take a few more months,” said Pham. “It’s not significantly more difficult.” Reported in the journal Science Robotics, the work is a reminder that engineers are making progress in the field despite a recent flurry of videos that show robots falling over at every conceivable opportunity, being defeated by a door, or simply having a bad day at the office. Pham believes the work paves the way for robots to move on from industrial assembly lines where they perform precise, repetitive movements, and tackle more complicated tasks, such as building computers and aircraft from stores of parts. Edward Johns, a roboticist at Imperial College London, said: “We will soon see manufacturing robots moving beyond car assembly lines, but the key long-term challenge is generalisation to everyday environments, outside of factories and laboratories. In particular, fine-grained object manipulation, such as hammering a nail into a hole, is extremely challenging for robots to adapt to new environments, and yet these are the skills which really showcase human dexterity above all other animals”. Plenty of challenges remain for robots, said Manuel Giuliani at the Bristol Robotics Laboratory at the University of the West of England. Machines struggle to recognise parts that are lying on top of each other; are bad at handling slippery objects; and have yet to master picking up soft items, such as fruit, without squishing them, he said. In the meantime, Pham is keen to see if robots can learn to build the chair using only an image of the assembled product as a guide. Will the technology ever help humans who struggle with the task? “I don’t think it is in Ikea’s business model to have robots assemble their chairs,” he said. “In the next 10 to 20 years, people will still be sweating over flat-pack furniture.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"theguardian/2018/apr/24/weekly-notes-queries-government-for-the-people","type":"article","sectionId":"theguardian","sectionName":"From the Guardian","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-24T10:59:17Z","webTitle":"Who benefits from fighting the idea that government is for the people?

Details of Braithwaite’s situation published in the Guardian last week attracted huge public condemnation and helped push the Windrush scandal into the headlines. Although he was relieved to have a temporary solution to his immigration problem, he said his difficulties had come close to destroying his life. Braithwaite, who arrived in Britain from Barbados in 1961, had worked at a north London primary school for more than 15 years when a routine check on his immigration status revealed he did not have an up-to-date identity document. He was sacked despite the fact he has lived in the UK for more than 50 years. Getting the biometric card was “only half of what I wanted – it’s a only a temporary thing”. “I’m glad that my story opened up the dysfunctionality of the Home Office. It has been a betrayal of my people. I feel very bitter still. People’s lives have been disrupted. My life has been turned upside down. It devastated me to the point of I was going to kill myself at one point. “Having someone take away 57 years of your life is terrible. It made me feel I’ve got no worth, no status nothing. They’ve taken it all away from me. I didn’t understand why. I almost fell apart with the stress.” He had always assumed he was British, having attended primary school and secondary school here, and having worked continuously since leaving school. He married in London and has three British children and five grandchildren. “I never applied for a British passport. We thought we were British,” he said. Chai Patel, the legal policy director at the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants, said: “Glad as we are the Home Office finally resolved Michael’s situation, it’s appalling that they appear to operate a system of appeal by Twitter. For the many who can’t get the injustices they suffer into the media, there is no such respite from the grinding, bureaucratic cruelty of the system. “The growing public anger about these injustices must be reflected, not in case-by-case defeats for an embarrassed Home Office, but a full and independent inquiry into the systemic failures of the Home Office, otherwise the Windrush generation will continue to suffer, as will many other groups of migrants wrongly targeted by the hostile environment.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"travel/2018/apr/25/colombias-cowboy-music-vallenato-steals-the-show-in-valledupar","type":"article","sectionId":"travel","sectionName":"Travel","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-25T05:30:39Z","webTitle":"Colombia’s cowboy music: vallenato steals the show in Valledupar","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2018/apr/25/colombias-cowboy-music-vallenato-steals-the-show-in-valledupar","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/travel/2018/apr/25/colombias-cowboy-music-vallenato-steals-the-show-in-valledupar","fields":{"headline":"Colombia’s cowboy music: vallenato steals the show in Valledupar","bodyText":"Plaza Alfonso Lopez shook to its 16th-century foundations as I squeezed through the whiskey-drinking, sombrero-wearing crowd. On stage, a fast-fingered accordionist played, a sweat stain spreading across his chest. The crowd held aloft framed photographs of their accordion heroes and roared approval as musical scales swooped and soared in the sultry air. Valledupar is the spiritual home of vallenato music. Vallenato translates as “born in the valley” and is the music of the north Colombian countryside. Typically, it is performed by a trio: an accordionist, bongo player and someone playing a guacharaca, a rasping stick not unlike a cheese-grater. Originating from farmers who mixed Spanish and West African rhythms, vallenato was long derided across Colombia as unsophisticated cowboy music, before it was championed by the country’s intelligentsia, among them Gabriel García Márquez, who once described his novel One Hundred Years of Solitude to be a 350-page vallenato. More recently, it has become spearheaded by commercialised pop reinterpretations, notably by Latin superstar Carlos Vives. Since 1968 Valledupar has hosted the annual Festival de la Leyenda Vallenata (25-30 April 2018), which features the genre’s finest accordionists competing to be crowned King of Vallenato. Every 10 years those winners compete against each other to be crowned King of Kings. The last of those was last year, and was also the 50th anniversary of the festival – so any previous winner could enter. I watched the best of the vallenato accordion greats alongside 150,000 other spectators at the four-day festival. Valledupar, home to 450,000 people, is an unremarkable city on a hot flat plain; to the north, cattle-rearing pasture gives way to the La Guajira desert. The city does, however, have an agreeable old centre of whitewashed lanes that provided shade from the arid heat while its Spanish colonial plazas feature ornate churches with huge wooden doors. My base was Casa de los Santos Reyes (doubles from £40 B&amp;B), a converted merchant’s house with several patios adorned with pot plants behind the property’s thick 18th-century adobe walls. The guesthouse is in Cañaguate – a district named after the blossom trees that dash Valledupar yellow each spring – and a few blocks from the heartbeat of the festival at Plaza Alfonso Lopez. I arrived in time for a traditional breakfast of cheese-filled arepas and chicken soup – the latter a local hangover remedy for a festival hangover. That morning the hotel had invited local vallenato star Jose-Ricardo Villafane to play accordion to guests. He demonstrated the four vallenato tempos (also known as airs) that all competitors must perform, his fingers fluttering over his keys. “Paseo is fast and happy, the merengue is sensual, son is deep and melancholic but the quickest and most technical tempo to play is puya,” he said. Musically, the festival officially started that evening with a concert for several thousand spectators at Ronda del Concurso, a soulless sports stadium on the outskirts of town. I watched a performance featuring vallenato’s biggest commercial stars, including so-called new wave artists, such as Churo Diaz and Carlos Vives, with their pop infusions and big band backing. The concert was too slick and commercial for me. I didn’t feel the passion that inspired a popular vallenato myth: about a legendary accordionist called Francisco el Hombre who had slain the devil by playing vallenato. It all began to make sense the next morning when the festival exploded into life at the plaza, where the early elimination rounds to find the King of Kings was held. This was unadulterated vallenato – just the trio of instrumentalists with no showy theatrics. It was mid-morning but already the crowd was downing the ubiquitous festival tipple: Old Parr Whisky. As a gringo I stood out (I saw few other foreigners) and plastic cups of Old Parr were jammed into my hand by other festivalgoers. But I resisted another festival delicacy sold around the plaza – grilled ants eaten as an aphrodisiac. The tempo that really got to me was the hectic puya. The maestro accordionists played it at a dervish pace that quickened my pulse. I found myself chanting names of artists I’d never heard of the day before. Sometimes the players sang, considered a supreme skill while doubling up on accordion. The lyrics are as passionate as they are bittersweet. “And I saw your brown eyes for a moment /And the sun was dying of jealousy …” crooned one performer, belting out a soulful song about tragic love. By night the city lanes felt less like a furnace but the music never abated, as private parrandas (street parties) were in full swing. The locals were well-oiled and played famous vallenato tunes to howling crescendos. “My two sons are accordion players and my three-year-old grandson already plays bongo,” said Javier Alvarez-Orozco, a local who invited me join his parranda for evermore whiskey. “Vallenato is in their blood,” he said. Later I came across another gathering featuring a contemporary offshoot of vallenato called piqueria, a freeform rap battle backed by accordion and featuring two combatants using humorous improvised verse. There were sober interludes, too, as I sought out Valledupar’s other attractions, such as Casa Beto Murgas Museo del Acordeón (free, suggested donation £5, guided tours available), which has a collection of 200 historic accordions – including beautiful machines inlaid with mother-of-pearl. The Guatapurí river flows through the centre of town straight from the Sierra Nevada’s icy headwaters, offering a bracing dip. One of my favourites became the daily artisanal market that sold oddities such as hand-painted Panama hats, while I also saw a local religious procession celebrating the miracle of the virgin of Santa Rosario. The grand accordion final came after four days of competition and was an intoxicating affair of musical wizardry that saw a competitor called Alvaro Lopez crowned King of Kings. The brilliant performance was a little lost in the cavernous stadium but I was still being sustained by the magical morning I’d had observing vallenato’s next generation under the tutelage of renowned accordionist, El Turco Gil at a local music academy. His youthful proteges entranced me during a public concert showcasing their skills. A young girl played a doleful ballad about unrequited love with Tina Turner-esque swagger while a puya, performed by Juan-David, a blind accordionist from the countryside, blew me away with its ferocious tempo. “I saw his genius from an early age,” said Gil. “He can’t see but he ‘feels’ vallenato and will be a maestro someday.” “People question whether pure vallenato will lose its soul as the music gains commercial success. These children suggest not.” • Specialist Colombia operator, Amakuna has a week-long Origins of Vallenato itinerary in Valledupar and La Guajira from £1,495pp, including B&amp;B accommodation, guided tours, transfers and internal flights.

Yes, the only representative from the biggest club in England was David De Gea, whose case was strengthened by having to spend a whole season trying to second-guess Chris Smalling. Yet only someone with a rabid anti-United bias would see that as an embarrassing development, whereas the enlightened ones, the true believers and the reddest and most devilish of red devils are capable of railing against the media’s one-sided attempts to denigrate yet another wonderful season for José Mourinho. You read that right. For what better proof is there of Plucky Little Manchester United’s lack of football heritage than five Manchester City players getting in the PFA team? This is what poor old José has been battling against all year: happy, well-coached players in a functioning team. But the media don’t want you to know that!!! They’re all Pep this, Pep that, always overlooking how brilliantly Mourinho has done to get his bunch of misfit losers into SECOND PLACE and THE LAST 16 of Big Cup, even though he’s been forced to make do with a squad so immature and unreliable that Old Trafford natives are pining for the days of William Prunier, Bebé and post-Fergie Wazziesta. Of course, the haters will probably try to convince you that Mourinho has actually been dealt a very good hand. They’ll tell you that Paul Pogba is one of the most talented midfielders of his generation, Alexis Sánchez’s four-and-a-half year deal is reportedly worth as much as £14m a year after tax and Anthony Martial is wondering whether it might be more fun playing for Barcelona. They’ll tell you that Mourinho is a man out of his time. They’ll even tell you that his football is boring and negative! But these people cannot be believed. They are liars and trolls who, whisper it, have been sent by Luke Shaw to spread anti-José propaganda. Do not listen to them. It is a conspiracy. The Luke Shaw Conspiracy. You cannot trust this man. Do not trust Luke Shaw. He’s the real villain of the piece, the real traitor, the evil genius who told Pogba to do all those stupid flicks and tricks against West Brom. His malign influence has even affected The Fiver, which has forgotten that it promised The Man a preview of Wednesday night’s game at the Vitality Stadium. Apparently United can cut City’s lead at the top to a mere 13 points with a win over Bournemouth. But mentioning that wouldn’t fit the narrative, would it? Exactly.

We were fooled","bodyText":"Since the murder of Stephen Lawrence 25 years ago – through the succession of botched police investigations and the landmark Macpherson report in 1999 – those of us closest to the unfolding events have developed a set of certainties. We knew all about the racism and incompetence that let Stephen’s killers walk free for so long. We knew all about the intransigence and denial that led the authorities to close ranks, even in the incontrovertible face of wrongdoing. But by the end of this painful, difficult period, with two of the killers convicted, a whole series of policing improvements enacted and reassurances that the mindset of our police service had irrevocably changed, we also felt certain that good had sprung from tragedy. That the kind of police officer who might have doubted that racism was a problem, or doubted that the Metropolitan police service’s institutional failings explained the shameful treatment of the Lawrences, would now be aware. If Stephen was to have a lasting legacy, that, we felt, was part of it. So imagine the scene just a few days ago, when Doreen Lawrence and I sat in a small screening theatre in central London to watch the second part of the BBC documentary Stephen: The Murder That Changed a Nation. This episode, broadcast this evening, focused on the police officers most intimately involved with the Lawrences around the time of their private prosecution against the suspected killers in 1996. These were officers with whom we had had a distant relationship at first, but who over a period of time won our confidence. We came to believe that they really wanted to bring Stephen’s killers to justice; but more than that, we believed they really had been changed by the experience of knowing how badly their institution had treated a vulnerable family at their direst time of need. We did not hold back from them. They seemed to feel what we felt. They knew what we knew. The documentary features Bill Mellish, who is now retired but as a detective superintendent was deployed by the Met as senior investigating officer at the time of the private prosecution. He told the programme: “I think one officer on the night [of the murder] formed, wrongly, the opinion that it was a drug-related murder.” But watching the broadcast we were aghast when he continued: “And I think on that basis and perhaps one or two other examples [they] branded the whole of the Metropolitan police as racist. Utter rubbish.” Asked for his opinion of the Macpherson report, a process many feel contributed to a sea change in Britain’s thinking on policing and race relations, Mellish said: “It confirmed my suspicion that it was a kangaroo court. I know they’re wrong. I have been in the Met for 32 years.” He went on to attack Lady Lawrence as ungrateful, saying she used as a gimmick a tendency to never smile; and that I and Michael Mansfield, the family’s barrister, were extreme leftwingers working to our own agenda. Hearing those words felt like an almighty kick in the gut. I felt betrayed. I looked at Doreen; she gave a sharp intake of breath, then fell silent. It is hard to describe the shock. By the end of the episode we were both shaking with fury. We had assumed that Mellish, like us, had been enlightened by the Macpherson revelations. But, having left the Met, here he was, free to say what he really thought. And the meaning of what he said was clear to both of us. If he, who has had 25 years to dissect it all, could still dismiss what he saw in this way, what about those who were not that close to it, or had never met us, and those who are there now? If we could not convince him, what chance do we have with the others? It seems to me now that most of what the police did they did for themselves, not the family. It was basically the Met’s crisis management. Of course, Mellish is just one former officer. In the years that have passed, many senior officers have said positive things about the impact of the case on how they police communities. But my fear is that much of what they actually learned was how to spin things better. And of course we now know that while the Met should have been helping the Lawrences it was simultaneously spying on them, using an undercover officer. The most worrying thing for me is that this chimes with what I see right now in my day-to-day work as a lawyer. The cases we are getting involving racism and the police tell you that, for too many, the mindset is not much changed since the time of Stephen’s death. We have hundreds of cases of police officers acting in a terrible fashion. You cannot help but think that the improvements we so wanted to see were only skin deep. Maybe we fooled ourselves into believing they were really happening. I am left wondering how much of the Met’s latest advocacy of stop and search is about stopping violence on the streets, and how much is just about getting back to the bad old days. The job for Cressida Dick, the current Met commissioner, is to prove her intentions are genuine. But we must not lose hope. Society has moved on to the point where there is an acceptance that racism exists. There is legislation that at least sets down how the police should behave. And though the possibility of further convictions in the Lawrence case itself is now remote, we can, begrudgingly, accept that. So what remains is to remember Stephen, and what the Lawrences have done for this country, but also to learn the lessons his tragic death taught us. I am not at all sure that is happening at present. The police reflect society; if there is to be racial justice, they must play a part. But with his words, one former detective has unwittingly revealed the task the commissioner faces, and how much further she still has to go. • Imran Khan is the lawyer for Stephen Lawrence’s family"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"film/2018/apr/22/beyond-the-clouds-review-majid-majidi-mumbai","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-22T07:00:19Z","webTitle":"Beyond the Clouds review – edgy tale of Mumbai’s underclass","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/apr/22/beyond-the-clouds-review-majid-majidi-mumbai","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/apr/22/beyond-the-clouds-review-majid-majidi-mumbai","fields":{"headline":"Beyond the Clouds review – edgy tale of Mumbai’s underclass","bodyText":"Oscar-nominated Iranian director Majid Majidi (for 1997’s Children of Heaven) turns his lens on India and finds an underclass that is denied justice, rights and even a voice by virtue of the poverty in which they live.

He seems to think that I want this myself, and that it will make me happy, but I have never suggested nor wanted it. He says he wants me to do whatever I like as long as I come back to him, and never leave him. To be honest, I just find it all very strange. There are various possible reasons for your partner’s requests. For example, he may be feeling that your sex life together needs a boost but does not know how to implement this – or even how to start an appropriate conversation about it. Or he may have reached a point in his life where he feels he needs to explore his own sexuality in a new direction. But considering his expressed fear of abandonment, it is also possible that he may be experiencing a crisis of confidence about his own ability to continue pleasing you himself, and is offering what he thinks are viable options. Communicate your concerns about this to him in a gentle and reassuring manner. Use a nonthreatening questioning style such as “Please would you help me to understand your desire to open our relationship?” and “What would make our own lovemaking more exciting for you?” It is not unusual for a person to be excited by the thought of his partner being sexual with another man; in fact, it may reflect a wish to reclaim earlier feelings of attraction for you – an erotic charge possibly sparked by a rival’s challenge. • Pamela Stephenson Connolly is a US-based psychotherapist who specialises in treating sexual disorders. • If you would like advice from Pamela Stephenson Connolly on sexual matters, send us a brief description of your concerns to private.lives@theguardian.com (please don’t send attachments).

A scrapbook of the wryly observed failed relationships of Isabelle (Juliette Binoche), it’s talky (incessantly so at times), knowing and ironic. It’s also unexpectedly light in tone. “Frothy” is something of a departure for Denis, best known for the savage poetry of films such as Beau Travail and White Material. You keep expecting to discover a razor blade embedded in the soap. But none appears. Neither, in this skittish flit from break-up to brush-off, does the film give us much to get our teeth into apart from Binoche’s mercurial and pleasingly readable performance. Divorced artist Isabelle is certainly beguiling. The film’s seemingly endless queue of slavering French men can’t be wrong. Wearing their midlife crises like optimistically trendy haircuts, Isabelle’s suitors talk themselves in and out of her bed. Meanwhile, a score of laid-back jazz wafts through the film like the smoke from a post-coital cigarette. Although the material is conventional, Denis’s approach, at least, is interesting. The trajectories of relationships are interrupted, and we build up a fractured portrait of Isabelle and her romantic life from snapshots rather than an in-depth examination of a single encounter. It’s not wholly satisfying. For all the scenes of Isabelle, moist-eyed, contemplating her latest breakup, there’s a flippancy here that adds a veneer to the film, making it a struggle to access any real emotional depth. But then, it wouldn’t be a Claire Denis film if it didn’t make us work a little."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"books/2018/apr/21/end-of-the-american-dream-the-dark-history-of-america-first","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-21T07:00:07Z","webTitle":"End of the American dream?

The dark history of 'America first'","bodyText":"“Sadly, the American dream is dead,” Donald Trump proclaimed when he announced his candidacy for president of the United States. It seemed an astonishing thing for a candidate to say; people campaigning for president usually glorify the nation they hope to lead, flattering voters into choosing them. But this reversal was just a taste of what was to come, as he revealed an unnerving skill at twisting what would be negative for anyone else into a positive for himself. By the time he won the election, Trump had flipped much of what many people thought they knew about the US on its head. In his acceptance speech he again pronounced the American dream dead, but promised to revive it. We were told that this dream of prosperity was under threat, so much so that a platform of “economic nationalism” carried the presidency. Reading last rites over the American dream was disquieting enough. But throughout the campaign, Trump also promised to put America first, a pledge renewed – twice – in his inaugural address. It was a disturbing phrase; think pieces on the slogan’s history began to sprout up, explaining that it stretches back to efforts to keep the US out of the second world war. In fact, “America first” has a much longer and darker history than that, one deeply entangled with the country’s brutal legacy of slavery and white nationalism, its conflicted relationship to immigration, nativism and xenophobia. Gradually, the complex and often terrible tale this slogan represents was lost to mainstream history – but kept alive by underground fascist movements. “America first” is, to put it plainly, a dog whistle. The expression’s backstory seems at first to uncannily anticipate Trump and (at least some of) his supporters, but the truth is that eruptions of American conservative populism are nothing new – and “America first” has been associated with them for well over a century. This is merely the latest iteration of a powerful strain of populist demagoguery in American history, from president Andrew Jackson (1829-1837) to Louisiana senator Huey Long a century later – one that now extends to Trump. The slogan appears at least as early as 1884, when a California paper ran “America First and Always” as the headline of an article about fighting trade wars with the British. The New York Times shared in 1891 “the idea that the Republican Party has always believed in”, namely: “America first; the rest of the world afterward”. The Republican party agreed, adopting the phrase as a campaign slogan by 1894. A few years later, “See America First” had become the ubiquitous slogan of the newly burgeoning American tourist industry, one that adapted easily as a political promise. This was recognised by an Ohio newspaper owner named Warren G Harding, who successfully campaigned for senator in 1914 under the banner “Prosper America First”. The expression did not become a national catchphrase, however, until April 1915, when President Woodrow Wilson gave a speech defending US neutrality during the first world war: “Our whole duty for the present, at any rate, is summed up in the motto: ‘America First’.” American opinion was deeply divided over the war; while many decried what was widely perceived as a baldly nationalist venture by Germany, there was plenty of anti-British sentiment, too, especially among Irish-Americans. American neutrality was by no means always motivated by pure isolationism; it mingled pacifism, anti-imperialism, anti-colonialism, nationalism and exceptionalism as well. Wilson was delivering the “America first” speech with his eye on a second presidential term: “America first” should not be understood “in a selfish spirit”, he insisted. “The basis of neutrality is sympathy for mankind.” The phrase was rapidly taken up in the name of isolationism, however, and by 1916 “America first” had become so popular that both presidential candidates used it as a campaign slogan. When the US joined the war in 1917, “America first” was transposed into a jingoistic motto; after the war, it slipped back into isolationism. In the summer of 1920, Senator Henry Cabot Lodge delivered a keynote speech at the Republican National Convention, denouncing the League of Nations in the name of “America first”. Harding secured the Republican nomination and promptly sailed to victory that November using the slogan, which his administration would invoke ceaselessly before it collapsed amid the ruins of the US’s greatest political bribery scandal to date. By 1920, “America first” had joined forces with another popular expression of the time, “100% American”, and both soon functioned as clear codes for nativism and white nationalism. It is impossible to grasp the full meaning of “100% American” without recognising the legal and political force of eugenicist ideas about percentages in the United States. The so-called “one-drop rule” – which said that one drop of “Negro blood” made a person legally black – was the foundation of slavery and miscegenation laws in many states, used to determine whether an individual should be enslaved or free. The logic of the one-drop rule extended from the notorious three-fifths compromise in the constitution, which counted slaves as three-fifths of a person. Declaring someone 100% American was no mere metaphor in a country that measured people in percentages and fractions, in order to deny some of them full humanity. In 1920 Upton Sinclair published a furiously satirical novel called 100%: The Story of a Patriot, inspired by the case of a radical, Tom Mooney, who was sentenced to hang for a 1916 bombing on charges widely viewed as spurious. Sinclair’s novel is told from the perspective of Peter, “a patriot of patriots, a super-patriot; Peter was a red-blooded American and no mollycoddle; Peter was a ‘he-American’, a 100% American ... Peter was so much of an American that the very sight of a foreigner filled him with a fighting impulse.” Peter fully believes that: 100% Americanism would find a way to preserve itself from the sophistries of European Bolshevism; 100% Americanism had worked out its formula: “If they don’t like this country, let them go back where they come from.” But of course, knowing in their hearts that America was the best country in the world, they didn’t want to go back, and it was necessary to make them go. But “100% American” was not only xenophobic and nativist. When Senator Knute Nelson died in 1923, he was hailed in obituaries across the US as “100% American” – despite having been born in Norway. Why? Because Nelson was descended from “the true Nordic line”, “from the race which set up strong gods and bred strong men”. “Nordic” was yet another code, used in the same ways that the Nazis would use “Aryan”. “Nordicism” held that people of northern Europe were racially superior to those of southern Europe (and everywhere else), a theory espoused by white supremacists such as Lothrop Stoddard and Madison Grant, whose The Passing of the Great Race: or The Racial Basis of European History (1916) became one of the most influential works of eugenicist scientific racism. But in practice, Nordic was used to describe anyone who was blond, white, Caucasian or Anglo-Saxon. Colloquially, “Nordic”, “100% American” and “America first” were used all but interchangeably. It should come as little surprise, then, that the Ku Klux Klan also adopted “America first” as a motto. In 1919 a Klan leader gave a Fourth of July speech declaring: “I am for America, first, last and all the time, and I don’t want any foreign element telling us what to do.” The fantasy of a US once populated solely by the racially pure Nordic “common man” was the Klan’s genesis myth as well, the prelapsarian past to which they intended to force the country to return – by violence if necessary. In January 1922, the Klan staged a parade in Alexandria, Louisiana, bearing two flaming red crosses and banners with slogans including “America First”, “100% American” and “White Supremacy”. That summer the Klan took out an advertisement in a Texas newspaper: “The Ku Klux Klan is the one and only organization composed absolutely and exclusively of ONE HUNDRED PER CENT AMERICANS who place AMERICA FIRST.” Within months, Americans were watching the rise of fascism in Europe, as Mussolini took power in Rome. Explaining “fascists” to American readers that year, the press found an obvious example ready to hand. “In our own picturesque phrase,” wrote the New York World, “they might be known as the Ku Klux Klan.” It does not require hindsight to view the Klan as a crypto-fascist organisation: their contemporaries could instantly see the likeness, and the danger. In November 1922 a Montana paper noted that, in Italy, fascism meant “Italy for the Italians. The fascisti in this country call it ‘America first’.” There are plenty of the fascisti in the United States, it seems, but they have always gone under the proud banner of “100% Americans”. The autumn of 1922 also saw the first mention of a rising German fringe politician called Adolf Hitler in the US press. At the time, a young American journalist named Dorothy Thompson was living in Vienna, where she was reporting on the rise of antisemitism. By November 1923, she was in Munich trying to interview Hitler following his abortive Beer Hall Putsch, filing articles on the way he had updated German nationalism thanks to “suggestions from Mussolini”. Meanwhile, the Brooklyn Daily Eagle warned its readers that the KKK was no different from “100 % patriotism in Europe”: There should be no misunderstanding about the Klan. It represents in this country the same ideas that Mussolini represents in Italy; that Primo Rivera represents in Spain. The Klan is the American Fascista, determined to rule in its own way, in utter disregard of the fundamental laws and principles of democratic government. If such people were allowed to take over the US, it cautioned, “we shall have a dictatorship”. By 1927, the Klan had spread across the country. That May, roughly 1,000 Klansmen gathered to march in the Memorial Day parade in Queens, New York, many in white robes and hoods, accompanied by 400 members of their women’s organisation, the Klavana. Some of the reported 20,000 spectators in Queens that day objected to the Klan’s presence in a civic parade; fights broke out, and it turned into a riot. In the days that followed, the New York papers revealed the names of a total of seven men who had been arrested in Queens. Five of them were identified as “avowed Klansmen” who had been marching in the parade and were arrested for “refusing to disperse when ordered”. A sixth was a mistake – a car had run over his foot – and he was immediately released. The seventh, a 21-year-old German-American, was not identified in the press as a Klansman. The reports only stated that he was arrested, arraigned and discharged. No one knows why he was there. His name was Fred Trump. * * * In September 1935, a month after announcing he would run for president, Senator Long of Louisiana was assassinated. Called “America’s first dictator”, Long had worried many observers with his blend of populism and authoritarianism. After his death, one writer referred to Long as “the Mississippi valley rendering of Il Duce”. Despite assurances from many Americans that it can’t happen here, Long’s rise to power had shown just how it could. Its growing presence was so clear that at the end of 1935 Sinclair Lewis published a novel inspired by Long’s career (but written before his murder), in which he imagined what American fascism would look like. The title of It Can’t Happen Here was “ironical”, Lewis told reporters: “I don’t say fascism will happen here,” he said, “only that it could.” Lewis and Thompson had married in 1928, and his novel was heavily influenced by her circle’s conversation about the situation in Europe. She had just become the first American foreign correspondent to be ejected from Germany by Hitler, making her an international celebrity. “Whatever else the Hitler revolution may or may not be,” she wrote, “it is an enormous mass flight from reality.” On her return to the US, Thompson was given a nationally syndicated newspaper column; immediately she began writing about the emergence of bands of loosely organised fascists around the US, where a “Union party” had assembled to unite the right, creating an amalgamation of white supremacist fascist groups. One of Thompson’s columns on American fascism was titled “It Can Happen Here”, in which she asked: Whom do they hate? Life, which has treated them badly. Who is to blame? Some scapegoat is to blame. The Negroes working in the fields that should be theirs? Or the Jews? Do they not keep the prosperous shops? Or the Communists … or the trade unionists … Or the Catholics who have a Pope in Rome? Or the foreigners who take the jobs? These are to blame. Therefore exterminate them. We are poor and dispossessed. But we are white, Anglo-Saxon, Protestant. Our fathers founded this country. It belongs to us. Just as Thompson’s column was published, in May 1936, William Faulkner finished Absalom, Absalom!, a novel driven by the proposition that what had defined southern history was the fact that poor white people gained self-respect and racial pride from their belief in their inherent superiority to black people. If that sense of racial superiority were ever threatened, the story predicted, they would erupt in violence. A year earlier, WEB Du Bois had explained that “white laborers were convinced that the degradation of Negro labor was more fundamental than the uplift of white labor”. Although white labourers remained poor, Du Bois wrote, they were “compensated in part by a sort of public and psychological wage”, the wage of racial superiority. * * * In the autumn of 1940, a coalition of Americans against US entry into the second world war formed the America First Committee. Charles Lindbergh would become their spokesman, Thompson perhaps their fiercest opponent. “I am absolutely certain in my mind that Lindbergh is pro-Nazi,” she wrote in 1941. “He hates the present democratic system and … intends to be President of the United States, with a new party along Nazi lines behind him.” By May 1941, Lewis had joined the America First Committee, while he and Thompson had quietly separated. According to Lewis’s biographer, he was “at that time vigorously opposed to American intervention in the European war … his sympathies with the America First people”. In August 2017, seven months into Donald Trump’s presidency, a coalition of American fascists calling themselves Unite the Right staged a rally in Charlottesville, Virginia. It came as a shock to many observers that the Klan and neo-Nazis could march in modern America, shouting: “Jews will not replace us.” It came as a greater shock that Trump refused to condemn them. When the story emerged during the 2016 campaign that Trump’s father had been arrested at what was often described (erroneously) as a “Klan rally”, Trump at first denied that the Fred Trump in question was his father, saying they’d never lived at the address named in the newspaper reports. But although Donald never lived there, the Trump family did. There is no evidence that Fred was at the 1927 Memorial Day parade to support the Klan. What’s remarkable is that, of the parade’s 20,000 spectators, the only six who were arraigned after the riots were five “avowed Klansmen”, and Fred Trump. Donald has spoken often, and proudly, of the father he idolised. “My legacy has its roots in my father’s legacy,” he stated in 2015. There is good reason to think eugenics plays a role in that legacy. “The family subscribes to a racehorse theory of human development,” said one of Trump’s biographers, Michael D’Antonio. “They believe that there are superior people and that if you put together the genes of a superior woman and a superior man, you get a superior offspring.” Trump also endorsed a garbled version of eugenics in a 2010 interview: “I think I was born with the drive for success because I have a certain gene. I’m a gene believer.” And while it is true that no one knows why Fred Trump was arrested along with five members of the Klan in 1927, it is also true that his later record would not suggest he was there to protest against the Klan. Maybe it was all just a coincidence. Or maybe not. In October 2017, the New York Times reported that Trump’s close adviser, Stephen Miller, chose “100% Americanism” as a quotation for his high school yearbook page. Trump made international headlines in January 2018 when he demanded during discussions of immigration from Haiti and Africa why he would want “all these people from shithole countries”, adding that he wanted “more people from places like Norway”. Commentators noted that Norway is overwhelmingly ethnically white, but many were puzzled by what seemed an arbitrary preference. “Why Norway?” asked a Houston Chronicle report, highlighting the “racialism” of the choice; it added that the neo-Nazi website Daily Stormer had approved Trump’s remarks, which indicated: “Trump is more or less on the same page as us.” The Chronicle did not, however, mention that the page in question continues to specify Nordicism per se – and “America first” – as its racial ideal for the US. We cannot hear a dog whistle if we are not in its range. We cannot understand the subtexts of our own slogans if we do not understand their contexts; we risk misreading our own moment if we don’t know the historical meanings of expressions we resuscitate, or perpetuate. We are all asking urgent questions about the present, but there are far more surprising answers than many think to be found in the past. The backstory of loaded phrases can help us understand how we found ourselves facing these problems today – and even, perhaps, how to stop them from detonating into violence once more • Sarah Churchwell’s Behold, America: A History of America First and the American Dream is published by Bloomsbury (£20).

Appearance: A black croissant. Easily done. I once left one in the oven all day. It looked just like that when I found it. How did it taste? No idea. You can’t eat a burnt croissant. This one isn’t burned. It has been made with activated charcoal. You can certainly eat it. That doesn’t mean I will. No. That’s a common reaction. A woman called Amy Charlotte Kean posted a photograph of a charcoal-activated vegan croissant on Twitter on Tuesday morning. She had seen it on sale in a branch of Coco di Mama in east London. The croissant is now a global hate object. Splendid. But some people have enjoyed eating it. “We can promise you that it 100% tastes better than it looks,” says Coco di Mama’s website. I’m glad that it tastes better than an incinerated croissant, but I suspect it still tastes worse than an ordinary one. Why on earth did they add charcoal in the first place? It’s a food fad right now. What? Oh yes. There are charcoal bagels, ice cream, burger buns, smoothies, pizzas ... plus charcoal toothpaste and face masks. Listen, I’m as open-minded as the next person ... No you’re not. All right. I’m not. But still, why add charcoal to your food? Some people say it imparts the unmistakable aroma of smoke. Cynics suggest there’s a novelty factor in eating something that looks uneatable. Yeah. That’s going to be my hypothesis, I think. Others claim that eating charcoal is actually good for you. How? “The charcoal in the croissant helps to detoxify any poisons or toxins in your body – for example, alcohol,” claims Coco di Mama. I’m getting the unmistakable aroma of hogwash. Yeah. They’re talking skilful nonsense there. Skilful in what way? Well, “activated” charcoal means it has been treated to make it extremely porous and therefore very absorbent. So yes, if you have literally just been poisoned, eating charcoal might be good for you because it could absorb some of the poison in your stomach before your body did. But what if I haven’t been poisoned? What then? Well, it will just absorb whatever, including water, nutrients and medicine, that your body might actually need. You might as well say that chopping someone’s head off helps to release the toxins from their body. I might just do that. Say it, I mean. That’s a relief. Do say: “Try our pain au bitumen.

What an instrument of torture I have acquired in you,” Byron famously exclaimed on first beholding his baby daughter Ada, leaving it unclear whether he saw himself as the scourger or the scourged. In truth, it was probably a bit of both. Within six months the poet had left Britain and would never see either his daughter or his wife Annabella again. He spent the next decade racketing around the continent writing verse that was beautiful and scabrous by turns, and intervening in foreign conflicts that were actually none of his business. Annabella Byron, meanwhile, morphed from wretched bride into a queenly philanthropist, who was equally certain that she knew what was best for other people. Baby Ada, by contrast, grew up to be mostly interested in herself. She was, she announced proudly, a genius. The story of this unhappy trio has been told before, but seldom with as much brio as it is here. Miranda Seymour’s particular aim is to rescue Annabella from over a century’s worth of bad press. Everyone, detractors and advocates alike, agrees that at the age of 22 she was too naive to see how stupid it was to pester Byron into marrying her when he was clearly only after her fortune. She’d always had a thing about Jane Austen’s Mr Darcy and thought Byron was cut from the same cloth. But Darcy didn’t go in for incest, nor did he (as far as we know) express a preference for sodomy or greet the news of his engagement by muttering “it never rains but it pours”. In short, Byron was not the delicious hero of a romantic novel but a broken soul whose death at the age of 36 was a mercy to everyone concerned. Once Annabella was legally separated from him the moral scales started to quiver: she began to let everyone know how impeccably she had behaved throughout the whole ghastly business. She leaked information that revealed Byron as a beast who got up to all sorts of unnatural practices, including sleeping with his half-sister Augusta Leigh. Perversely, Annabella then went out of her way, at least initially, to be gracious to the hopeless Augusta and bailed out the even more awful Medora, the daughter born from the incestuous affair. Seymour is alive to all the self-serving bluster here, but she is equally keen that we should hear about Annabella’s generosity towards people who neither knew nor cared about her year of living dangerously with a naughty poet. Inspired by the educational reformer Johann Pestalozzi, she built schools for the poor that sensibly banished religion, prizes or corporal punishment and featured lots of fresh air instead. Yet within months of her death in 1860, Annabella’s good deeds were getting buried under a slurry of gossip, and she was retrospectively accused of having concocted dirty stories about Byron as a way of besmirching the great man’s name. Only now, in Seymour’s careful hands, is she finally allowed to emerge as a figure who was neither saint nor sinner but somewhere in between. If Annabella’s story is a warning about how quickly posthumous reputations can warp into ugly new shapes, her daughter’s case demonstrates the exact opposite. At the time of her death in 1852, also at 36, the name “Ada Lovelace” meant nothing to the general public. Yet to a small group of established scientific figures including Mary Somerville, Charles Babbage and Augustus de Morgan she was simply extraordinary. At the age of 11 she designed a flying machine based on the structure of a crow’s wing. When still in her 20s she translated Luigi Menabrea’s seminal article on Babbage’s Analytical Engine, supplemented by her own dense appendices, one of which has been described by people who know as the world’s “first computer program”. Among those knowledgeable people are three academic mathematicians who have collaborated to produce a short account of Lovelace’s intellectual development, organised around reproductions of key documents from her archive in the Bodleian Library in Oxford. Particularly fascinating is her correspondence with De Morgan, in which strings of numbers, signs and equilateral triangles dance excitedly across the page. It’s so easy, given our current desire to turn Lovelace into a poster girl for women in science, to lose sight of the exact flavour of her talent. Christopher Hollins et al conclude that, while she was a promising mathematician, her particular genius lay in her ability to make imaginative leaps between parts of the mathematical universe that were, according to her pleased observation, “seldom or never brought into juxtaposition”. How ironic, then, that it was this tendency to skitter sideways that accounts for the great calamity of Ada’s life. Seymour explains that her mathematical confidence meant that she was convinced she had found a surefire way of betting on racehorses. She hadn’t, and ended up having to pawn the family jewels twice – a scrape that you tend not to read about in the current crop of “Clever Girls in History” primers aimed at fostering the female scientific stars of the future. • In Byron’s Wake is published by Simon &amp; Schuster.

Experts told the work and pensions select committee that universal credit’s single monthly household payment made it easier for domestic abusers to seize and regulate family income and prevent partners from leaving the home. Marilyn Howard, a financial abuse expert at the University of Bristol, told MPs: “Our concern is the one payment of universal credit can concentrate power and resources in the hands of one partner, and that carries the risk that abusers can take advantage.” Asked by the committee chair, Frank Field, whether the switch to universal credit increased the risk of women being bullied by their partners, Howard replied: “Yes, I believe it would do.” Witnesses from grassroots domestic violence refuges and charities giving evidence to the committee said the single universal credit payment allowed abuse perpetrators to “distribute family income in the way they see fit”. Universal credit rolls six working-age benefits into a single monthly payment with the aim of simplifying the social security system. However, MPs heard this in effect “de-labelled” constituent payments, such as child tax credits, that were previously earmarked for children, and paid to the main carer, normally the mother. Howard said: “With the [universal credit] online system abusers may be a click away, where under previous systems it may have taken more a bit more time and effort to obtain someone’s benefit entitlement.” Concerns over domestic abuse and universal credit were raised at prime minister’s questions on Wednesday, where the the Scottish National party MP Philippa Whitford appealed to the prime minister, Theresa May, to end the practice of single universal credit payments. May replied that single payments were available on request, but Whitford said changing the claim in this way made women more financially vulnerable. “Eighty-five percent of abuse survivors say they wouldn’t have dared to request single payments as a special measure as it would have worsened abuse.” This month the family support minister, Kit Malthouse, told the work and pensions committee that it was “completely without foundation” that universal credit would exacerbate domestic violence and insisted that single payments could be made on request. The committee heard that frontline domestic abuse workers were spending increasing amounts of time trying to sort out universal credit problems for victims of domestic violence, at the expense of the wider direct support they could offer. Delays and bureaucracy experienced by universal credit claimants had driven some domestic abuse victims back to their abuser, Nicola Kyser-Forrest, the homelessness service manager at Calderdale council, told MPs. In one case an abuse victim had lost a place in a refuge because it was impossible to get officials to rule whether the woman, an European Economic Area national, qualified for universal credit housing costs. “We couldn’t speak to anybody to get that confirmation, and so the refuge were unable to offer her a place, knowing that she may not be eligible for assistance. That led to the lady returning to her partner,” she said. Demelza Lobb, the technology abuse lead at the Refuge charity, said the uncertainty and stress caused by universal credit delays had led to several women going back to their abusive partners. “They say: ‘It might be easier, at least I’ll have an income, I’ll be able to get food,’” she said. A DWP spokesperson said: “Abuse in any form is completely unacceptable, and Jobcentre Plus staff do everything they can to make sure people fleeing domestic abuse get the help they need as quickly as possible. “That includes fast tracking advances so that people are not left without money and transferring a person’s claim to a different Jobcentre.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2018/apr/18/de-la-rue-chief-chose-wrong-card-to-play-passport-contract-battle","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-18T12:15:11Z","webTitle":"De La Rue chief chose wrong card to play in passport contract fight | Nils Pratley","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2018/apr/18/de-la-rue-chief-chose-wrong-card-to-play-passport-contract-battle","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2018/apr/18/de-la-rue-chief-chose-wrong-card-to-play-passport-contract-battle","fields":{"headline":"De La Rue chief chose wrong card to play in passport contract fight","bodyText":"De La Rue’s explanation of why it now accepts defeat in the contest to print the UK’s post-Brexit blue passport is feeble. Apparently, the company has engaged in intense consideration for the past four weeks and received clear legal advice. Come on. Five minutes of casual reflection in the boardroom a month ago should have been enough to recognise the reality of the situation. The bid from Gemalto, the Franco-Dutch rival, was £120m lower than De La Rue’s over the 11-year contract, so the UK government was never likely to perform a protectionist U-turn that would have made a nonsense of ministers’ rhetoric about the UK being open for business after Brexit. A pause for thought might also have saved Martin Sutherland, De La Rue’s chief executive, from making himself look a fool. Sutherland started the process of working the nation, or part of it, into a fine frenzy last month by grumbling about how it was terribly unfair that Gemalto had got the gig. He challenged the prime minister to visit De La Rue’s factory in Gateshead to explain to workers why she thought it sensible “to offshore the manufacture of a British icon”. Now, after talking up the prospects of an appeal, he’s capitulated. Bidding for contracts, and sometimes losing, is deemed to be part of the rough and tumble of business. As for the threat to jobs in Gateshead, Sutherland points out that the current contract with the Passport Office has another 18 months to run, which leaves plenty of time to find alternative contracts to fill the gap. The government’s position has been more clear-sighted from the outset. This was an open competitive tender. Quality was prioritised and the savings from Gemalto’s bid were substantial. The new supplier already produces UK driving licences. Some of the new passports will be produced by Gemalto in its factories in Britain. Sutherland, one must assume, was hoping that the bizarre excitement over the return of the blue(ish) passports would somehow override the extra costs to taxpayers. For a company that boasts about its global footprint and work with governments, central banks and commercial organisations in over 140 countries, it was the wrong card to play. It is equally odd that Labour shadow ministers, from Keir Starmer to Diane Abbott, thought it wise to back a doomed campaign to impose extra costs on the public purse for the sake of symbolism. There are interventionist industrial causes that are worth backing. This was not one. Hammerson pair in last chance saloon In a strong day for corporate about-turns, Hammerson abandoned its £3.4bn bid for its shopping centre rival Intu, more than four months after terms were agreed. The target squealed about the explanations being unsatisfactory and, strictly speaking, Intu has a point. The Hammerson chairman, David Tyler, and the chief executive, David Atkins, were banging on about how they were fully committed to the deal a month ago. For practical purposes, though, Intu shouldn’t waste its breath. This deal has been dying for weeks, for the reason given in my previous column: too many Hammerson shareholders hate it. They didn’t want an acquisition that involved printing new shares at a heavy discount to asset value to buy an Intu estate they regard as inferior. The heaviest blow was struck by the Dutch pension fund APG, Hammerson’s second biggest shareholder, which said last week it would vote its 7% stake against the deal. Even JO Hambro, with a 1.8% holding and trying to sound supportive of the board, could only rouse itself to say it was not negative on the Intu idea, which was some way short of being a positive endorsement. Hambro’s stance, however, suggests heads won’t roll. The Intu saga, interrupted by the brief excitement of French group’s Klépierre’s bid approach to Hammerson, has embarrassed Tyler and Atkins, but they’ll probably be allowed to attempt a plan B. So far, that involves reassessing “the optimal portfolio mix” and accelerating the delivery of value to shareholders, which is far too woolly to be useful. But at least the pair appear to realise they are in the last chance saloon. Poor excuse over timing of another M&amp;S departure Another reason for executives to avoid Twitter. Patrick Bousquet-Chavanne contrived to announce his departure as Marks &amp; Spencer’s marketing chief before the company had made its formal stock exchange announcement, which is procedural no-no for a main board director. Nobody really cares because management rejigs at M&amp;S arrive at a rate of about one a week these days, but Bousquet-Chavanne’s excuse was particularly poor. He was in Spain and didn’t take account of the time difference."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"teacher-network/2018/apr/28/secret-teacher-i-fear-for-the-wellbeing-of-students-under-pressure-to-perform","type":"article","sectionId":"teacher-network","sectionName":"Teacher Network","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-28T06:30:07Z","webTitle":"Secret Teacher: I fear for the wellbeing of students under pressure to perform","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/teacher-network/2018/apr/28/secret-teacher-i-fear-for-the-wellbeing-of-students-under-pressure-to-perform","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/teacher-network/2018/apr/28/secret-teacher-i-fear-for-the-wellbeing-of-students-under-pressure-to-perform","fields":{"headline":"Secret Teacher: I fear for the wellbeing of students under pressure to perform","bodyText":"As exam season looms into sight, the stress is ramping up. This is nothing new, of course, but the way students are being treated at my school is a cause for concern. We’re showing a complete disregard for their mental health and wellbeing. The school’s leaders seem to have no reservations about working our young people into the ground. The school day has been extended for some year groups, while a huge number of regular sessions outside school hours have been made compulsory. Students who don’t turn up can expect detention and a phone call to their parents. Teachers, under pressure from leadership, are using fear to motivate students in lessons. Students are frequently told exactly how many days or hours of study time are left until exams, and some less-experienced teachers are directly transferring the pressure they feel on to students through frustration and anger. As a result, pupils are appearing increasingly anxious. The stress is showing in some worrying ways. Fights, erratic behaviour and even self-harm are becoming more common. I recently found one pupil sitting catatonic in the playground after it all got too much. It’s clear that students aren’t really learning under these conditions. My school seems to have forgotten that these are people we’re working with, not robots who can be programmed with all of the information needed to pass the exams. PE lessons and extra-curricular clubs have been cancelled, and students are timetabled instead to do extra work for academic subjects. It seems ludicrous to take away such important outlets for combatting stress. Even PSHE and tutor time sessions have been cut. My concern for my pupils’ safety and wellbeing is exacerbated by the fact that I don’t feel confident addressing some of the issues they’re facing. Although we have safeguarding training, we’ve not been given the tools to adequately deal with mental health problems. There is a counsellor on site who will take on cases of huge concern, but what about the majority? Pupils aren’t given advice and strategies to help them cope, and staff don’t have the capacity or time to focus on the bigger picture. The school’s leaders don’t seem able to see that good results are the product of happy, emotionally resilient students. With the former headmaster of Harrow suggesting that teenagers should be revising for seven hours a day during the Easter holidays, it’s important that we think about the pressure we’re putting on our young people. There are schools doing lots of great work on mental health. I just wish my school would recognise the importance.

A lot of us play in probably the best league in the world. “We’ve got the players to do it, but have we got the experience going further along in competitions? No we haven’t. Not in recent years. “We need to be realistic. There are a lot of good teams out there and our record in tournaments has not been fantastic.” England had a shambolic Euro 2016 and were beaten by Iceland in the last 16 in France, and Walker says winning a match at that stage of the tournament should be the focus. “We’ve had a lot of conversations inside the camp - England haven’t won a knockout game for God knows how many years, so for us to go there and win a knockout game, that would be a step in the right direction.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"politics/2018/apr/19/ministers-braced-for-new-vote-on-customs-union-after-lords-defeat","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-19T09:47:14Z","webTitle":"Ministers braced for new vote on customs union after Lords defeat","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/apr/19/ministers-braced-for-new-vote-on-customs-union-after-lords-defeat","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/apr/19/ministers-braced-for-new-vote-on-customs-union-after-lords-defeat","fields":{"headline":"Ministers braced for new vote on customs union after Lords defeat","bodyText":"Ministers are bracing themselves for a new vote on a customs union in the Commons in the aftermath of Wednesday night’s thumping defeat in the Lords. An amendment to the EU withdrawal bill was carried by a majority of 123 in one of the largest votes ever recorded in the Lords. Former Conservative cabinet ministers were among the amendment’s backers. The amendment only commits the government to making a statement about the steps it has taken on a customs union. Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, said support was growing for staying in some form of customs union. “There is a growing view, I think a majority view in parliament now, that it is in our national interest and economic interest to stay in a customs union with the EU. We’ve got a huge manufacturing sector in the UK that needs to be protected,” he said. Michael Gove, the environment secretary and a leading Brexiter, acknowledged the lack of a majority made it difficult. “We are always going to rely on the persuasive powers of ministers to get colleagues to support the government,” he said on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. “But I think the case for being outside the customs union, being able to sign our own free trade deals is a compelling and persuasive one and I know when that case is put to the Commons that it will rally Conservative MPs and others behind it.” Starmer was also pressed on last week’s row in the Labour party, when shadow cabinet colleague Barry Gardiner dismissed Starmer’s six tests for any deal as “bollocks”. Starmer insisted that Gardiner had retracted the comment and apologised for his off-the-cuff remarks made in an informal Q&amp;A session at a meeting in Brussels. “That test and all of the six tests I set were taken from the government; they weren’t plucked from thin air. That phrase, exact same benefits, was David Davis’s assurance from the dispatch box. The prime minister says ‘we are determined to beat them’ so the idea that they’ve been plucked out the air, that they can’t be met, is completely wrong.” The amendment passed by the Lords would commit the government to report to parliament “outlining the steps” it had taken to secure “an arrangement which enables the UK to continue participating in a customs union with the European Union”. A spokesperson for the Department for Exiting the European Union (DexEU) said: “We are disappointed that parliament has voted for this amendment. The fundamental purpose of this bill is to prepare our statute book for exit day, it is not about the terms of our exit. This amendment does not commit the UK to remaining in a customs union with the EU, it requires us to make a statement in parliament explaining the steps we’ve taken.” But opposition peers hope the substantial support for the amendment could strengthen the hand of pro-customs union Conservative MPs, who have said they plan to force the issue in the Commons."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/apr/19/has-your-financial-future-been-destroyed-by-a-bank","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-19T07:05:24Z","webTitle":"Has your financial future been destroyed by a bank?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/apr/19/has-your-financial-future-been-destroyed-by-a-bank","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/apr/19/has-your-financial-future-been-destroyed-by-a-bank","fields":{"headline":"Has your financial future been destroyed by a bank?","bodyText":"The royal commission into banking and financial services has uncovered shocking misconduct by some of Australia’s largest companies.

Celino Villanueva Jaramillo, whom the Guardian met and interviewed last year, died on Wednesday in the southern Chilean town of San José de Mariquina. The centenarian, born on 25 July 1896 but who had not been recognised by Guinness due to the lack of official verification of his date of birth, had fallen out of bed a week previously and broken three ribs, one of which pierced a lung. After an emergency operation and being placed in intensive care, doctors were originally optimistic he would survive. But in the last couple of days his damaged lung became critical, and on Tuesday a priest was called to deliver the last rites. “We’re very sad,” said Ivonne Morales, who together with her mother Marta Ramírez had adopted Celino when he was 99 years old and destitute. “He was an integral part of our family, the man of the house.” Although feted by politicians, including Chile’s billionaire president, Sebastian Piñera, as the country’s oldest recognised citizen, Villanueva never received any specialist care, or the family that had adopted him any institutional support or the provision of geriatric home-helps. A hospital stay in July 2017 also proved to be traumatic and debilitating for the centenarian, who ended up strapped to his bed and heavily medicated for two weeks to stop him demanding to be allowed to use the bathroom. In an interview in February, Marta Ramírez, herself a spritely 85 years old, was adamant she would not put her very elderly guest into an old-people’s home: “I’m tired and it’s not easy looking after him with no support – but he just wouldn’t survive in a home, they die there so quickly,” she told the Guardian. Celino Villanueva, a farm worker who had never married and had no known living relatives, will be buried on Friday morning in the Indigenous Cemetery of Mehuín."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/apr/19/japans-metoo-senior-bureaucrat-resigns-over-sexual-misconduct-allegations","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-19T05:14:20Z","webTitle":"Japan's #MeToo: senior bureaucrat resigns over sexual misconduct allegations","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/19/japans-metoo-senior-bureaucrat-resigns-over-sexual-misconduct-allegations","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/apr/19/japans-metoo-senior-bureaucrat-resigns-over-sexual-misconduct-allegations","fields":{"headline":"Japan's #MeToo: senior bureaucrat resigns over sexual misconduct allegations","bodyText":"Japan’s most senior finance ministry bureaucrat has resigned over allegations of sexual misconduct, in what is being described as the country’s #MeToo moment. Junichi Fukuda, the vice minister of finance, said he would quit after a weekly magazine published allegations he had sexually harassed a female reporter. Fukuda’s resignation will come as a further embarrassment to the prime minister, Shinzo Abe, who is struggling to contain a cronyism scandal that centres on finance ministry officials. Fukuda has denied allegations carried in last week’s Weekly Shincho magazine that he sexually harassed a reporter in a bar. The magazine, which also released an audio clip of the incident, claimed he told the journalist he wanted to kiss her. “I’ll tie up your hands. Can I touch your breasts?” a voice allegedly belonging to Fukuda is heard saying on the recording. “Shall we have an affair once the budget is approved?” The magazine alleged Fukuda made similarly inappropriate remarks to other female journalists covering the ministry. The finance minister, Taro Aso, drew widespread criticism for resisting calls to sack Fukuda, who initially said he would launch a libel suit against the magazine. On Wednesday, Fukuda said he would step down because the allegations were affecting his ability to do his job. He told reporters he could not confirm if it was his voice in the audio clip. “But at least I have no recollection of making an outrageous conversation like that,” he said. “I am not aware of making any remark that could be taken as sexual harassment.” The finance ministry has launched an investigation and urged the alleged victim to come forward so it can determine if Fukuda was guilty of sexual misconduct. Aso, who conceded the remarks on the audio were unacceptable, said Fukuda could not be accused of sexual misconduct until the unnamed female reporter, an employee of the private broadcaster TV Asahi, comes forward. “Because no victim has come out, only the wrongdoer has been put on the spot and it’s a one-sided story,” Aso said. “Fukuda could be the victim instead of a wrongdoer.” In another allegation of sexual impropriety, the governor of Niigata prefecture, Ryuichi Yoneyama, said he would resign over claims in another magazine that he had paid money and given gifts to women with whom he had sex after meeting them on an internet dating site. Yoneyama, who is single, insisted he had not paid for sex with the women, but acknowledged his actions could “look to some like prostitution”. His resignation could create confusion over contentious plans to restart a nuclear power plant in his prefecture. Yoneyama has said he will resist the restart of two reactors at Kashiwazaki-Kariwa – the world’s biggest nuclear power plant – until a prefectural panel has completed its investigation into the cause of the March 2011 triple meltdown at the Fukushima Daiichi plant. Both plants are operated by Tokyo Electric Power. The #MeToo movement has been slow to gain traction in Japan, where victims are often reluctant to speak out. But criticism of how the country’s authorities handle allegations of sexual harassment and violence has risen since last year, when Shiori Ito, a journalist, claimed she had been raped by a high-profile TV journalist with close ties to Shinzo Abe. The police suddenly dropped their investigation into the case and Ito is now suing her alleged attacker, Noriyuki Yamaguchi, in a civil lawsuit. She claims Yamaguchi raped her in a hotel room in 2015 after they had met for a meal and drinks to discuss a job opportunity. She alleges Yamaguchi dragged her to the hotel room and sexually assaulted her after she passed out while they were dining."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/apr/18/uk-basks-in-the-sun-with-temperatures-set-to-get-even-higher","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-18T19:00:01Z","webTitle":"UK basks in balmy weather – with temperatures set to rise further","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/apr/18/uk-basks-in-the-sun-with-temperatures-set-to-get-even-higher","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/apr/18/uk-basks-in-the-sun-with-temperatures-set-to-get-even-higher","fields":{"headline":"UK basks in balmy weather – with temperatures set to rise further","bodyText":"The UK basked in the warmest weather of the year so far on Wednesday, with temperatures forecast to rise even higher on Thursday – and stay high into the weekend. The south-east of England enjoyed the warmest of Wednesday’s weather, with a high of 25C recorded in both Gravesend in Kent and St James’ Park in London. But Thursday’s temperatures are forecast to be even higher as the UK enjoys an unseasonably warm spell – way above April’s average maximum temperature of 11C. Temperatures reached 21.2C in Plymouth, in Devon, and 21.8C in Cardiff, south Wales. They were slightly cooler in Scotland and Northern Ireland, which saw highs of 19.7C in Kinloss, in Moray, and 18.7C in Derrylin, in County Fermanagh. Warm air from the Azores, 950 miles off the coast of Portugal, has been dragged up towards the UK by the combined efforts of an area of low pressure over the Atlantic and high pressure over western Europe, a Met Office spokesman said. But the arrival of spring sunshine should be treated with caution following the cold start to the season, Oli Claydon from the Met Office said. “After quite a dull and chilly start to spring, this is the first bout of real warm sunshine that we’ve seen. “The sun at this time of year is nearly as strong as it can be in the summer, so people just need to be cautious of that and make sure that they do look after themselves.” Runners getting ready for Sunday’s London Marathon could face challenging conditions as the temperatures threaten to beat the 1996 record of 22.7C. Offering some comfort to those competitors keen for cooler conditions, Claydon said there was a chance of some cloud cover. But he added: “There is a chance equally that we could see temperatures of 22C and maybe higher.” Sun worshippers are being advised to make the most of the warm weather, with temperatures expected to fall across the UK from the beginning of next week, and some showery outbreaks predicted."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2018/apr/18/single-use-plastics-could-be-banned-in-england-next-year","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-19T07:36:15Z","webTitle":"Cotton buds and plastic straws could be banned in England next year","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/apr/18/single-use-plastics-could-be-banned-in-england-next-year","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/apr/18/single-use-plastics-could-be-banned-in-england-next-year","fields":{"headline":"Cotton buds and plastic straws could be banned in England next year","bodyText":"Cotton buds, plastic drinking straws and other single-use plastics could be banned from sale in England next year in the next phase of the campaign to try to halt the pollution of the world’s rivers and oceans. Theresa May hopes to use the announcement to encourage the Commonwealth heads of government to join the fight as the meeting opens formally on Thursday. “The Commonwealth is a unique organisation with a huge diversity of wildlife, and environments – so it is vital we act now,” the prime minister will say, urging all Commonwealth countries to participate. Cotton buds, often flushed down the lavatory, are one of the most serious sources of marine pollution. They are small enough to be eaten by birds and marine life. Altogether it is estimated that there are 150m tonnes of plastic in the world’s oceans, and over 100,000 sea mammals die from eating or getting tangled up in plastic waste. Plastic microbeads have already been banned, and the introduction of the 5p plastic bag charge in England has led to a dramatic fall in their use: 9bn fewer bags have been distributed, Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) figures show. Michael Gove, the Defra secretary, called single-use plastics a scourge. “It is only through government, business and the public working together and the public working together that we will protect our environment for the next generation,” he said. A consultation will start later in 2018, and a ban could be enforced as early as next year. Scotland has a head start on England: the Scottish government announced a consultation on plans to ban the manufacture and sale of plastic-stemmed cotton buds in January. Campaigners said it would cut the country’s sewage-related marine plastic pollution by a quarter. Other work, such as the Treasury’s research into the impact of a levy on disposable coffee cups and a deposit return scheme on plastic bottles, is also under way in a bid to wean Britons off their polluting habits. But sources say behaviour will not be changed through regulation and compulsion. Ministers are keen that the public should be better informed about plastics that are reusable and recyclable, and want the process to be incremental and well supported, as the plastics bag levy was when it was finally introduced. A further incentive to avoid the use of plastics is the impact that reduced demand for the oil-based material would have on the fossil fuel industry. BP announced recently that it would “dent” demand. There is evidence that increasingly prosperous countries of the global south are beginning to react to environmental damage and pollution. Earlier this year, China cracked down on imports of plastic rubbish, revealing how much the UK relied on sending its waste offshore. In India, Delhi banned all forms of disposable plastic more than a year ago after complaints about the illegal mass burning of plastic and other waste at local rubbish dumps, and the air pollution it caused. The sites were supposed to operate as waste-to-energy plants. The evidence of the damage that plastics do not just to wildlife and the food chain but to some of the world’s most beautiful places is now widely reported. The government has committed £61.4m to its latest initiative, some of which will be used for research and to help Commonwealth countries develop ways of stopping plastic waste entering oceans. • This article was amended on 20 and 30 April 2018. Campaigners have suggested that a ban on plastic-stemmed cotton buds could cut sewage-related marine plastic pollution in Scotland by a quarter, not all forms of plastic pollution as an earlier version of the article said. A previous amendment said sewage-related pollution would be cut by half, this has been corrected to a quarter."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/apr/18/chris-appleby-soliloquy-winning-pitch-1000-guineas","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-18T17:47:00Z","webTitle":"Charlie Appleby’s Soliloquy makes winning pitch for 1,000 Guineas","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/apr/18/chris-appleby-soliloquy-winning-pitch-1000-guineas","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/apr/18/chris-appleby-soliloquy-winning-pitch-1000-guineas","fields":{"headline":"Charlie Appleby’s Soliloquy makes winning pitch for 1,000 Guineas","bodyText":"Charlie Appleby has yet to win a European Classic since taking over from his former boss Mahmoud al‑Zarooni but his string have started the season in outstanding form and the wait may not be long delayed if his run can extend through the next few weeks. Soliloquy’s win in the Nell Gwyn Stakes at Newmarket on Wednesday increases Appleby’s options and he should now have a live runner in the 1,000 Guineas in England and France. How his hand will be played remains to be seen. Soliloquy made all the running over seven furlongs and none of her rivals could offer a serious challenge as she stayed on well for William Buick to beat Altyn Orda by one-and-three-quarter lengths. A mile is unlikely to stretch her but it could yet be around a bend at the new Longchamp as Appleby also has Wild Illusion, the Prix Marcel Boussac winner last year, to consider after a racecourse gallop at Newmarket earlier in the day. The going at the course in a fortnight’s time could be decisive, as Soliloquy will need to be supplemented wherever she runs. “We’d like to keep the two fillies apart and we’ll see where we are in the next couple of weeks,” Appleby said. “This filly [Soliloquy] goes on a quicker surface whereas Wild Illusion broke her maiden on soft and won on soft in the Boussac as well. Wild Illusion’s priority is the English Guineas but if it is quick ground, we’d have to have a chat nearer the time. This filly then potentially may come into the reckoning. “We were confident today. Soliloquy’s work recently has done nothing but impress us. In the last three weeks, she’s blossomed and speed has come where we haven’t seen speed before.” The chance Soliloquy will go to Longchamp is factored into her price for Newmarket and she can be backed at up to 16-1 to win over an extra furlong on 6 May. Wild Illusion, who “handled the dip very well” in her gallop, according to Buick, is a 12-1 chance, behind three Aidan O’Brien-trained fillies in Happily, September and Clemmie, and the 8-1 chance Veracious. Veracious, from the Sir Michael Stoute yard, was another Classic contender sent for a racecourse gallop during the morning rather than a trial in the afternoon. She finished well clear of a galloping companion under Frankie Dettori, who has been confirmed as her rider in the Classic. “It was the first time I’d ridden her and she’s fit and well,” Dettori said. “She comes into the race as a bit of an unknown quantity but she gave me a decent feel and it’s an open Guineas now.” Anna Nerium, a 25-1 outsider, took the Listed European Free Handicap by three lengths and is quoted at around 33-1 for the 1,000 Guineas, but it is 23 years since Harayir took the Classic after finishing second in the Free Handicap and it is hard to see Anna Nerium being the one to break the barren run. “We’ll sleep on it but I imagine we’ll go for the 1,000 Guineas,” Richard Hannon, Anna Nerium’s trainer, said. “I thought if she reproduced her Salisbury form [when winning a Group Three at 40-1 last season] then she’d have a chance [but] I didn’t expect her to win like that. I thought she was very impressive and I think she’ll get a mile. It’s not always the strongest of the Guineas trials, but I thought that wasn’t a weak one.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/blog/2018/jun/03/free-to-access-and-fun-to-listen-to-why-football-podcasts-are-on-the-rise","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-03T18:00:53Z","webTitle":"Free to access and fun to listen to: why football podcasts are on the rise","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2018/jun/03/free-to-access-and-fun-to-listen-to-why-football-podcasts-are-on-the-rise","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/blog/2018/jun/03/free-to-access-and-fun-to-listen-to-why-football-podcasts-are-on-the-rise","fields":{"headline":"Free to access and fun to listen to: why football podcasts are on the rise","bodyText":"During Brendan Rodgers’ final, full season in charge of Liverpool, a rumour did the rounds suggesting he had started listening to podcasts made by the club’s supporters. Results were going badly and as criticism of the manager and his players rose, Rodgers, it was said, became increasingly keen to know what those who watched the team week in, week out were thinking and so turned to the likes of Anfield Index and The Anfield Wrap to find out. The rumour was never confirmed or denied but it is telling that it could be true – partly because Rodgers comes across as the type of man who would want to know what others think about him and partly because it reflects the growing strength and influence of football podcasts. Once the domain of a small number of amateur broadcasters, podcasts are now, to borrow Chorley FM’s catchphrase, “coming in your ears” from a range of sources. Fans, former players, journalists and pundits are all getting in on the act and for an increasing number of people, ‘pods’ have become the destination for football discourse, which in turn has allowed some of those involved to turn what started out as a hobby into a full-time profession. In part this reflects the boom of podcasts in general, fuelled by an improvement in the quality of available recording equipment as well as the ease with which people can, for free, download and listen to shows ranging from true-crime stories (Casefile) to the diary entry of a teenage girl growing up in a historic market town (Berkhamsted Revisited). “The majority of our listeners come through iTunes and our listening figures continue to grow year on year,” says Jon Teague, executive producer of The Football Ramble, which started in 2007 and has gone on to become a well-established, twice-weekly show. “That growth is encouraging as the market is now incredibly saturated. “There wasn’t a scene to speak of in 2007; most people didn’t even know what a podcast was back then. And we had no specific purpose for starting the Ramble – we liked talking about football and having a laugh and thought it would be fun to combine the two.” It is that sense of fun, emanating from the Ramble’s on-air team of Marcus Speller, Luke Moore, Jim Campbell and Pete Donaldson, which explains why it has thrived having been part of the initial wave of football podcasts that included the Guardian’s award-winning Football Weekly. Both proved football fans like listening to other football fans talk about football and thus inspired the creation of similar shows. Yet, as Teague has observed, there have been as many failures as successes. “While the barriers to recording and releasing a podcast are pretty much non-existent, the barriers to producing listenable content and getting it discovered by an audience are significant,” he says. “If you’re looking to compete in a crowded marketplace, you need to make sure your offering is a compelling enough pitch. It’s not enough these days to sit a few heads in a room and have them talk football.” The broad-ranging, talking-heads format remains popular, as seen by the popularity of podcasts such as Second Captains, but Teague is right in suggesting that with increased competition comes a greater need for ‘podders’ to nail down a niche. Hence the success of club-specific pods, such as AI and TAW, as well as those that tackle specific subjects, such as The No 1 Podcast, which focuses exclusively on goalkeeping. Then there are podcasts which tap into people’s love of nostalgia, among the best examples of which right now is Quickly Kevin, Will He Score? Hosted by Chris Scull, Josh Widdicombe and Michael Marden, it provides a weekly reminder of football in the 1990s through a mix of interviews, discussions and correspondents. Highlights have included Paul Merson recounting the time Alexi Lalas sung to him in a hotel lobby and a Norwich fan emailing in to accuse Efan Ekoku of stealing his Drifter bar during a school trip to Carrow Road. “On average, our audience has increased by 15% after every episode, and one of the coolest moments was discovering someone in every country had listened to the show. Well, everywhere except in North Korea,” says Scull. “Football discussion has become increasingly analytical and what Quickly Kevin has shown is there is a group of people out there who have a real interest in the personalities that make up football; was a certain player good at school? Who did the manager tell that player to take out before a certain game? They want stories and the funnier and stranger they are, the better.” The idea of a sizeable audience preferring anecdotes over analysis is one Kait Borsay shares. Along with her fellow broadcaster Lynsey Hooper, she created The Offside Rule podcast in 2011 with the intention of “creating a space for women with a passion for, and insight into, football to discuss the sport”. They were soon joined by Sky Sports presenter Hayley McQueen and the trio are now focusing their attentions on what Borsay describes as “long-form, in-depth content”. She adds: “We’ve loved sitting down with the likes of Joe Hart and Sven-Göran Eriksson and getting some amazing insight from them. For instance, Joe spoke to us about how he feels he’s been a failure with England, which was then picked up by nearly all of the major print and online outlets. “Podcasts are undoubtedly becoming more popular. One of the reasons for this is because they can be listened to on the move - they’re convenient. But it also comes down to people having got fed up with the ‘snacky’ journalism they’ve increasingly been fed in recent years and wanting something more substantial and personal – podcasts provide that.” Such has been the success of The Football Ramble and Quickly Kevin, helped to different degrees by the use of social media and advertising, that both have been able to expand and branch out. The Ramble produces its own merchandise and regularly holds live shows, which Scull, Widdicome and Marden have also begun to do, as well as entering into discussions with a production company regarding turning Quickly Kevin into a television show. “I was a DJ at university and wanted to have a national radio show but it didn’t happen because of the various gatekeepers you have to go through, so it’s wonderful to live in a time when you can produce your own content,” says Scull. “In some ways I’ve helped create something which is better than radio – more intimate and more of a meritocracy.

Now, each morning, lines of rough sleepers and the hidden homeless spill out the doors of local access centres, waiting to be triaged and linked with housing support. Those in line play a cruel game of chance. Help is prioritised to the worst crises but there are rarely enough beds or appointments with support providers to go around. “If you can get through the whole line and everyone gets an appointment, that’s a good day,” one homelessness support worker said, speaking to the Guardian anonymously. “And that maybe happens once every two to three weeks.” Hotels refuse to take clients when homelessness services call. Many real estate agents won’t touch applications from those on welfare and the wait for public housing can stretch out for years. Often, support workers say they have little choice but to send people to the unstaffed, unregulated private rooming houses that have flourished in the area, run by unscrupulous landlords who allow drug use and violence to go unchecked. Those who miss out simply come back tomorrow, to try their luck again. Melbourne’s west stood out in an analysis by Guardian Australia of the most recent recent census homelessness data, which has been mapped to show trends across the country. The census data – which also reveals spikes in homelessness for those aged 19-24 and 25-34 – shows significant increases in homelessness rates in Footscray, Sunshine and Laverton. The forces driving homelessness in Melbourne’s west are not unique. But the situation begs a question that must be asked in all of Australia’s major cities. Where do the poorest go when even the most affordable rents rise beyond their means, the social housing supply fails to keep up with demand and funding for crisis accommodation remains stagnant? Across Australia, the census figures showed an overall increase of 4.6% in the rate of homelessness in the past five years. There were about 116,000 people experiencing homelessness on census night, or about 50 for every 10,000 people. That was up from 102,439 in 2011. One in four were aged between 20 and 30 years. About 70% of young people experiencing homelessness had originally left home to escape family violence. Sarah Langmore is the coordinator of the Western Homelessness Network, which covers Melbourne’s west. She says the loss of rental affordability in the area is the main cause of the homelessness spike. In the Wyndham area, the percentage of rental properties affordable to those on low incomes had fallen dramatically, from 56% in 2011 to 27% in 2017. “It’s a devastating area to be working in,” Langmore said. “I spent two days at one of our access points interviewing consumers about their experiences. Two days of hearing the stories, I was just devastated [about] what’s happening to people when they can’t find housing.” She spoke to a woman who fled domestic violence to a friend’s house, only to be told there was a minimum wait of two years for social housing. Another man, a student, had his food stolen repeatedly while living in a private rooming house. It happened so frequently that he ran out of money and began to starve. Others have simply fallen into a routine of homelessness and are struggling to find a way out. Steven*, aged 26, has been couchsurfing and in rooming houses for years in the area around Sunshine. He left school at age of 15 for a mechanics course but experienced mental health and drug issues and could not hold the job. Violence at his home saw his parents take out an intervention order, he said, preventing him from going home. “It’s not like I had to sleep on the street in the city,” he said. “I’ve always had a friend or something, a house I can go to, someone saying ‘You’re welcome’. The community is pretty willing to help. “If I could get a job, I’d get a job. But you have to have a reliance on someone giving you the job and they have got to be able to rely on you. “Once you fall out of touch with your friends you start to make your own pattern, I guess, hanging around with your friends again and your pattern either gets worse or it gets better, depending on who you hang around with.” The Council to Homeless Persons said the increasing homelessness in Melbourne’s west had long been recognised by local support services. The council’s chief executive, Jenny Smith, said it was a consequence of private rental increases, a lack of social housing and sluggish wage growth. “So people move further out to chase cheaper rent but just face fiercer competition from other low-income earners,” Smith said. “It’s a game of musical chairs and the poorest are left without a home.” The vast majority of those experiencing homelessness remain hidden in the area. About 70% of clients surveyed by the North and Western Homelessness Networks said they had stayed with friends or family. The responses in the survey reveal disturbing stories about private rooming houses. One respondent said the landlord had threatened them with violence. Another said: “Unsafe for kids in Rooming House. Got robbed there.” Langmore said the private rooming houses were of significant concern. “We have hundreds of private rooming house landlords who are just completely exploiting people who get trapped,” she said. “They are so costly but often really poorly run and not safe.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2018/apr/19/debenhams-profits-slump-52-beast-from-the-east-sales","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-19T10:34:29Z","webTitle":"Debenhams profits slump 85% after being bitten by 'beast from the east'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/apr/19/debenhams-profits-slump-52-beast-from-the-east-sales","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/apr/19/debenhams-profits-slump-52-beast-from-the-east-sales","fields":{"headline":"Debenhams profits slump 85% after being bitten by 'beast from the east'","bodyText":"Debenhams is to cut the size of at least 30 stores as it blamed “profound change” in shopping habits and bad weather for an 85% slump in pre-tax profits. The department store group said sales at established stores declined 2.2%, or 2.8% at constant currencies, in the 26 weeks to 3 March, against a challenging UK market background. Underlying sales in the UK slid 4.1% as the “beast from the east” forced the retailer to temporarily shut almost 100 stores. The temporary closures during the final week of the six-month period, when large parts of the UK were brought to a standstill by heavy snow and bitter cold weather, accounted for about a 1% fall in underlying sales in the first half. Digital sales fared better, rising 9.7%. Pre-tax profit slumped to £13.5m, from £87.8m in the same period a year earlier, a decline of 84.6%. The pre-tax figure includes an exceptional charge of £28.7m relating to the cost of a strategic review and restructuring the company’s warehouse and logistics operation. Excluding these extra costs, underlying profit before tax was £42.2m, down 51.9%.Debenhams admitted that for the full year, profit before tax was expected to be at the lower end of forecasts of £50m to £61m. Debenhams’ share price fell as much as 10% in early trading but by late morning it had recovered nearly all its losses for the day. The share price has fallen by a third since the beginning of the year. It slumped 20% on the day in early January when Debenhams issued an unexpected profit warning owing to poor Christmas trading. The Debenhams chief executive, Sergio Bucher, said: “A combination of a disappointing Christmas and structural change in the market means it has not been an easy half year.” He admitted that Debenhams’ products had not been good enough at Christmas and the company was revamping its fashion ranges, ending collaborations with Jeff Banks and John Rocha and bringing in a new line by Richard Quinn. “The UK retail environment is undergoing profound change ... We expect no help from the external environment, so we are focused on delivering our Debenhams redesigned strategy, aiming to mitigate difficult trading conditions through self‐help initiatives,” Bucher said. The retailer is talking to landlords about reducing space at 30 stores as shoppers switch to buying online. Cutting the size of its Uxbridge site in west London by a fifth improved profits and there are plans to shrink the Wimbledon store by nearly a third this year. Debenhams said 25 stores were up for lease renewal in the next five years, giving it an opportunity to renegotiate rents or potentially move out. It has identified eight stores that could potentially close, on top of two that shut last year, but Bucher said the focus was on reducing store size. As clothing sales continue to shrink, Debenhams is handing over space to restaurants and other food businesses and planning to revamp its beauty halls to bring in more services such as blow-dry bars. “The high street needs to embrace shopping as leisure activity,” said Bucher. But he added that government could also help the high street, which is suffering from mass store closures and administrations. “Paying taxes is something we all should be proud of as we all deserve great healthcare ... [but] the government is responsible to make sure we have an even playing field. Right now business rates give an unfair advantage to online pure-play competitors and that needs to be addressed.” The group’s chief financial officer, Matt Smith, is leaving after less than three years in the job for rival Selfridges, where he will become finance director."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/apr/19/bill-shorten-calls-for-suspension-of-live-sheep-exports","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-19T05:44:02Z","webTitle":"Bill Shorten calls for suspension of live sheep exports","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/apr/19/bill-shorten-calls-for-suspension-of-live-sheep-exports","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/apr/19/bill-shorten-calls-for-suspension-of-live-sheep-exports","fields":{"headline":"Bill Shorten calls for suspension of live sheep exports","bodyText":"Bill Shorten has demanded a suspension of shipments of live sheep during the northern summer and blasted the Coalition for failing to update standards to protect sheep. On Thursday the bipartisan consensus to wait for a series of reviews before intervening in the industry began to fracture, with the Liberal MP Sussan Ley proposing a private member’s bill for a total ban, the Labor MP Josh Wilson backing a ban and Shorten warning the government his patience is “running very thin”. The agriculture minister, David Littleproud, said results of a review into the sheep trade during the Middle Eastern summer were just three weeks away. He accused Labor of a “kneejerk reaction” that would “punish farmers” and expressed disappointment in Shorten for breaking bipartisanship on the issue. The latest debate about live exports was sparked by footage of about 2,400 sheep that died on an Emanuel Exports ship from Fremantle to the Middle East in August 2017. Sign up to receive the top stories in Australia every day at noon “I felt sick to the stomach when I saw the vision,” Shorten said. “Only a monster would think it’s fine for this to continue without any change. “The industry has had plenty of chances to clean up its act and it’s failed. The government has had plenty of chances to properly regulate and it’s failed.” Shorten called on the Turnbull government to immediately adopt Labor’s plan to appoint an independent inspector general of animal welfare. Labor will honour its commitment to wait for a review into the northern summer trade of live sheep but Shorten said it was “unlikely to conclude [it] is sustainable” and all northern summer shipments of sheep not already beyond the farm gate should be suspended. “We are absolutely open to working with the government on bipartisan reforms but it’s not acceptable to allow deaths and shocking mistreatment to occur just because we are waiting for a report to be handed down.” On Thursday Littleproud announced terms of reference for a separate review to be completed by August and appointed a former public servant, Philip Moss, to conduct it. “What we saw on film this past fortnight must never happen again,” Littleproud said. “Those who do the wrong thing must be caught and nailed. “The review will assess the powers available to the department to make sure exporters obey the regulations. “It will also consider whether an inspector general of livestock exports would be useful and effective. I don’t care who thought of the idea – let’s see if it’s a good one.” Although Labor is wary about a kneejerk reaction after its scarring experience suspending the live cattle trade during the Gillard government, Shorten’s move was prompted by growing concern about animal welfare in its ranks. The West Australian agriculture minister, Alannah MacTiernan, has called for a two- to three-month suspension in the summer trade from 9 April. On Thursday, Wilson told Guardian Australia he had “always opposed the live sheep export, a trade that occurs almost exclusively out of my electorate of Fremantle”. “The community I represent knows this trade is inherently cruel and that animal suffering on these journeys is not the exception but the rule,” the Labor MP said. “It’s time for the trade to end ... The government should abandon its role as an apologist for the systemic mistreatment of animals and work to create a transition package as a matter of urgency.” The Labor senator Lisa Singh said the Turnbull government must accept that animal welfare standards “don’t and can’t meet reasonable animal welfare conditions nor community expectations” and must be updated. At the National Press Club the acting prime minister, Michael McCormack, said the footage was “disturbing” and “appalling for everybody who saw” it. But the Nationals leader warned that if Australia abandoned the live export trade the gap would be filled by “countries who do not place animal welfare first and foremost in their exporting”. McCormack said after the review the government would follow through to make animal welfare standards “front and centre to all export opportunities”. “I don’t believe that we should ban the trade holus-bolus,” he said, citing sharp drops in cattle prices after the Gillard-era ban. Labor wants new industry standards to address reducing stock densities, increasing access to water, increasing the numbers of crew to care for sheep and improved waste management standards so sheep are not expected to stand, sit and sleep in their own waste. The live export industry has proposed a range of changes to reduce the number of animals allowed on ships and permit independent inspectors on vessels in a concession to public concern. The Australian Live Export Council chairman, Simon Crean, said changes proposed by industry were adopted at a meeting in Brisbane on Wednesday to help drive cultural change in the industry."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/apr/23/number-of-australians-with-tertiary-education-qualifications-to-plunge","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-22T18:00:29Z","webTitle":"Number of Australians with tertiary education qualifications to plunge","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/apr/23/number-of-australians-with-tertiary-education-qualifications-to-plunge","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/apr/23/number-of-australians-with-tertiary-education-qualifications-to-plunge","fields":{"headline":"Number of Australians with tertiary education qualifications to plunge","bodyText":"The number of Australians with tertiary education qualifications will plummet in the next decade unless current funding arrangements are overhauled, new research has found. A new report released by the Mitchell Institute in Victoria on Monday warns that by 2031 participation in Australia’s tertiary education sector could fall to as low as 6% of the population aged between 15 and 64, down from about 10.5% in 2016. Driven by a combination of the government’s freeze on the demand-driven university enrolment system and a sustained period of cuts to vocational education and training (VET) funding, the report cautions Australia could be “about to enter a decade of declining participation in tertiary education”. Sign up to receive the top stories every morning Written by respected tertiary education expert Peter Noonan, the report paints a stark portrait of falling enrolments, particularly driven by a marked decline in the vocational sector. “Really if we look at the tertiary education sector as a whole – both VET and higher education together – and think ahead, then we face a significant risk of declining participation rates in post-school education on current settings, and that’s mainly because of the alarming decline in VET enrolments and participation,” he told the Guardian. Noonan’s report warns that based on current trends VET sector enrolments would fall from 5.3% of 15 to 64-year-olds in 2016 to 1.3% by 2031. That equates to more than half-a-million fewer enrolments in the sector in a 15 year period. “Assuming the ongoing decline in student enrolments is not reversed ... in effect, VET would become a residual sector,” the report states. “While this scenario may seem implausible, governments will need to act quickly and decisively to arrest the continuing decline in public investment in VET and the ongoing decline in publicly funded student enrolments.” Noonan has long been critical of current funding arrangements for the vocational sector, and has called for a complete overhaul of the way the system is run between the states and the commonwealth. Data from the National Centre for Vocational Education Research has previously shown that VET operational funding from the states and territories has fallen steadily over the past four years, from $4.3 billion in 2012 to $2.9 billion in 2016. He says current funding arrangements allow the states to match commonwealth funding allocations by taking money from their other parts of the VET system, and thinks the federal government needs to take a stronger hold of a sector he says has been allowed to fall into crisis. “If you were a casual observer you’d think that the education system consisted of schools and universities because all the debate has been around Gonski and the various iterations of university reforms,” he said. “At the same time the VET sector has been in free fall and no one has either noticed or cared.” While the decline in VET enrolments means that even on current trends the number of students enrolled in tertiary courses will continue to fall, the report states that the freeze on demand-driven funding will impact on university enrolments. The report’s modelling predicts the cap will see the proportion of 18 to 64-year-olds enrolled at university staying at below 5% by 2031, rather than lifting to above 6% based on previous trends. “In a period when successful mass participation in tertiary education is essential to the country’s economic and social wellbeing ... this decline would, over time, also result in a decline in qualification attainment levels in the Australian workforce,” the report found."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/apr/19/island-of-no-return-vanuatu-evacuates-entire-population-of-volcanic-ambae","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-19T04:41:32Z","webTitle":"Island of no return: Vanuatu evacuates entire population of volcanic Ambae","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/19/island-of-no-return-vanuatu-evacuates-entire-population-of-volcanic-ambae","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/apr/19/island-of-no-return-vanuatu-evacuates-entire-population-of-volcanic-ambae","fields":{"headline":"Island of no return: Vanuatu evacuates entire population of volcanic Ambae","bodyText":"Thousands of south Pacific islanders at the mercy of an active volcano will be permanently resettled by the end of May, the Vanuatu government has said. Ambae Island is home to 11,000 people, and for the second time in six months Ambae’s Manaro volcano on top of Mount Lombenben has started rumbling, spewing torrents of ash and gas from its crater and burying vegetable plots and crops, causing breathing and health problems for locals, and threatening their lives and livelihoods. People living in the north, west and south of the island are worst affected by the ash and began being evacuated on Thursday after a state of emergency was declared on Tuesday. Ash as deep as 30cm had already settled on many parts of the island, and people were experiencing breathing difficulties, skin reactions and illnesses such as chest infections as they waited to leave. One Ambae resident, Nadia Kanegai, said islanders were frightened and could not wait to get away. “The ashfall, like part of west Aambae was covered and it was dark [because] of the smoke and the population there was remaining inside and could not come outside,” she told RNZ Pacific. “And there was a gas emission as well. So the people are scared.” A local priest said the situation was “desperate” for locals as food supplies and animal feed were beginning to run out, water was contaminated by ash and disease was spreading among the evacuees, most of whom are subsistence farmers. Police and some aid agencies are already in place, with the army expected to arrive later this week to orchestrate the mass evacuation which this times looks to be permanent. “In times like these, it is always the vulnerable sections of our communities being the women, the children and the elderly, that are most affected,” Avio Roberts, national coordinator for the Vanua’aku party, told the Vanuatu Daily Post newspaper. Negotiations are under way between landowners and central government to acquire land for Ambae evacuees on either Maewo or Pentecost – the two closest islands to Ambae, but a safe distance from the volcano, which is one of the most active in the world. “People’s lives must be our first priority,” said prime minister Charlot Salwai during the October evacuation, in which planes, ships and barges were used in the DIY effort. Vanuatu is no stranger to natural disasters, and the the south Pacific nation was rated the most at-risk country in the world in a 2016 UN study. Its 83 islands are stuck in the middle of hurricane alley and they dot the border of the “ring of fire” – a belt around the Pacific prone to earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. The Australian government provided AU$3.2m to support early recovery efforts for those affected by the Ambae volcano last year, and is ready to give further assistance, a spokesperson said. The New Zealand government has provided more than NZ$1.5m in assistance, as well as technical support and relief supplies."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2018/apr/19/gdpr-facebook-google-amazon-data-privacy-regulation","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-19T07:01:09Z","webTitle":"How Europe's 'breakthrough' privacy law takes on Facebook and Google","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/apr/19/gdpr-facebook-google-amazon-data-privacy-regulation","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2018/apr/19/gdpr-facebook-google-amazon-data-privacy-regulation","fields":{"headline":"How Europe's 'breakthrough' privacy law takes on Facebook and Google","bodyText":"Despite the political theatre of Mark Zuckerberg’s congressional interrogations last week, Facebook’s business model isn’t at any real risk from regulators in the US. In Europe, however, the looming General Data Protection Regulation will give people better privacy protections and force companies including Facebook to make sweeping changes to the way they collect data and consent from users – with huge fines for those who don’t comply. “It’s changing the balance of power from the giant digital marketing companies to focus on the needs of individuals and democratic society,” said Jeffrey Chester, founder of the Center for Digital Democracy. “That’s an incredible breakthrough.” Here’s a simple guide to the new rules. What is GDPR? It is a regulation that requires companies to protect the personal data and privacy of residents of EU countries. It replaces an outdated data protection directive from 1995 and restricts the way businesses collect, store and export people’s personal data. “Consumers have been abused,” said David Carroll, an associate professor at Parsons School of Design in New York. “Marketers have succeeded in making people feel powerless and resigned to getting the short end of the bargain. GDPR gives consumers the chance to renegotiate that very unfair deal.” Does it only affect European companies? No. It applies to all companies that process the personal data of people residing in the European Union. What counts as personal data? Any information related to a person that can be used to identify them, including their name, photo, email address, IP address, bank details, posts on a social networking site, medical information, biometric data and sexual orientation. What new rights do people get? Under GDPR, people get expanded rights to obtain the data that a company has collected about them for free through a “data subject request”. People will also have the “right to be forgotten”, which means companies must delete someone’s data if they withdraw their consent for it to be held. Companies will only be able to collect data if there’s a specific business purpose for it, rather than collecting extra information at the point of sign-up just in case. “It makes companies become much more thoughtful and rigorous about the data they collect and what they use it for,” Carroll said. Companies will have to replace long terms and conditions filled with legalese with simple-to-digest consent requests. It must be as easy to withdraw consent as to give it. Finally, if a company has a data breach, it must inform users within 72 hours. “What makes this a potential game changer is the amount of power it places into the hands of the public,” said attorney Jason Straight, who is chief privacy officer at legal services company UnitedLex. What about people outside of Europe? Although it only applies to people located in the EU, the new rules will probably put pressure on companies to offer further protections for the rest of their users. Facebook, for example, has pledged to offer GDPR privacy controls globally. “This will be good for everyone,” said Kris Lahiri, co-founder at the cloud-sharing company Egnyte, pointing out that global customers will demand the same rights as their European counterparts. Which companies have the most work to do? The big data-hungry technology platforms like Amazon, Google and Facebook and advertising technology companies such as Criteo, whose technology powers those ads featuring products you’ve browsed online that follow you around the internet. What is Facebook doing to comply? Having said it would follow GDPR “in spirit”, Facebook’s actions tell a different story. On Wednesday Reuters reported that the company would change its terms of service so that its 1.5 billion non-European users would no longer be covered by the privacy law. Until now, all users outside of the US and Canada have been governed by terms of service agreed with the company’s international headquarters in Ireland. Since any user data processed in Ireland will soon fall under GDPR, Facebook is changing the agreement so users in Africa, Asia, Australia and Latin America are governed by more lenient US privacy laws. Where it needs to comply with GDPR, Facebook seems to have focused its efforts on getting user consent for its data collection practices (including facial biometric data) rather than reducing the data it collects. It has developed a sequence of consent requests that explicitly outline how each type of data will be used. However, as TechCrunch highlighted, the company has designed these requests in a way that makes it harder to opt out than opt in. What about startups who don’t have the same resources? Complying with GDPR may be a little onerous for companies that don’t have the engineering resources of Facebook or Google. According to a PwC survey, 68% of US companies expect to spend between $1m and $10m to comply with GDPR. And there’s another way they’ll get stung: GDPR consultants charging enormous fees for patchy advice. What are the penalties for companies that don’t comply? Companies can be fined up to 4% of annual global revenue, but it will come down to how regulators in individual countries choose to enforce the law. When does it come into effect? The twenty-fifth of May 2018. That’s too early for some: “There’s a panic mode setting in as everyone is getting closer to this deadline,” said Lahiri. This article was amended on 19 April 2018 to clarify that GDPR protections apply to anyone located within the EU, not just residents."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/apr/19/government-owes-voters-apology-opposing-banking-royal-commission-was-wrong","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-19T01:24:05Z","webTitle":"The government owes voters an apology.

Opposing this banking commission was wrong","bodyText":"Given this isn’t complicated, here’s what should happen now. The Turnbull government, if it has any sense of right and wrong, and any remaining shred of political judgment, should say to voters, without dissembling or weasel words: “Sorry, we got this one badly wrong.” The collective mea culpa needs to be short and sharp, given we were all here and we all saw what happened. We all saw the Turnbull government resist consistent calls for a banking royal commission after a string of damaging reports about scandals in the financial services industry. We saw that stonewalling play out for months. Then we saw the government forced into having an inquiry because the prime minister and the treasurer got overrun by restive Nationals MPs while their then leader, Barnaby Joyce, was trying to clean up his self-created mess on dual citizenship in the New England byelection. • Sign up to receive the latest news in Australian politics every weekday We saw Malcolm Turnbull and Scott Morrison produce an inquiry through gritted teeth in response to Nationals running down the executive in full public view. The banking royal commission has produced, in its opening stages, ample evidence to justify its own existence, and to validate all the news reporting and the political advocacy from Labor, the Greens and others that preceded its establishment. So instead of being too tricky by half, and suggesting now it is marvellous we are having the inquiry, and signalling you are, of course, open to extending it, while conveniently omitting the back story – the government needs to eat crow with some humility and sincerity. It is, frankly, ridiculous for senior government figures to demand financial institutions justify their conduct while declining to explain their own. In professional politics, admitting you were wrong is the hardest thing to do, particularly in an age where the public space of politics is consumed by ad hominem insults and vicious put-downs, lobbed either by the protagonists themselves, or a chorus of onlookers chattering ceaselessly 24/7. The government won’t want to hand that victory to Labor. It won’t want to confess fallibility before the voting public, preferring to project the sense that the emperor is still clothed. But there are bigger issues at stake here than being seen to capitulate, or losing a 24-hour news cycle. What’s in play right now in Australia is trust: whether voters can trust institutions, both private and public. What this royal commission does is underscore the deep concerns Australian voters have about the health of our institutions, and whether or not our governments have the right priorities and focus. Any politician paying attention right now will tell you that Australian voters are in a mood, worn down by the grim circus in Canberra, by the sense the country is drifting and political leadership in Canberra is little more than a ghost ship; and by the nagging sense that there was an age of prosperity and tranquility that has now been replaced by an age of contingency and shrieking. When many voters looks at the cadre of leaders in this country they see politicians indulging intrigues at the expense of meaningful progress, and businesses entirely out for themselves. That’s the context sitting behind the financial services inquiry. It is not happening in a vacuum. What’s in play right now is trust, and collective faith in representatives politics – and without it, governments have nothing."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/apr/19/alex-ferguson-arsene-wenger-manchester-united-arsenal-tv-documentary-feud","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-19T08:50:46Z","webTitle":"When Arsène Wenger and Alex Ferguson fought bitterly to be top dog | Rob Smyth","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/apr/19/alex-ferguson-arsene-wenger-manchester-united-arsenal-tv-documentary-feud","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/apr/19/alex-ferguson-arsene-wenger-manchester-united-arsenal-tv-documentary-feud","fields":{"headline":"When Arsène Wenger and Alex Ferguson fought bitterly to be top dog","bodyText":"The Premier League is the richest league in the world but money cannot buy hate. English football is crying out for an immense, sprawling rivalry between two great teams. There have been some interesting conflicts in recent times but nothing close to the epic nine-year war between Arsenal and Manchester United from 1996 to 2005. It’s the rift that keeps on giving. Five years after ITV’s memorable Keane &amp; Vieira: Best of Enemies, Channel 5 is to broadcast a documentary on the broader rivalry between the sides, and especially the managers. Fergie v Wenger: The Feud (Monday 10pm) is an exhilarating hour of time travel that includes interviews with more than a dozen players, coaches and journalists – and a series of clips that instantly evoke the nuclear intensity of the time. The rivalry ached with such importance, from the football field to the school playground, as to make a pacifist throw the first punch. It included everything from allegations of racism by Ian Wright against Peter Schmeichel to a pizza fight. There was also the Battle of Old Trafford, when Arsenal’s players manhandled Ruud van Nistelrooy after the final whistle; Roy Keane literally offering Patrick Vieira outside during a legendary row in the Highbury tunnel; and Jaap Stam being restrained by half of Highbury as he rumbled towards Vieira with extreme prejudice. “It’s funny,” Paul Scholes says. “In team talks against Arsenal, the ball was rarely mentioned.” That does not mean it was rarely used. The quality of football was through the roof, even if that is sometimes obscured by memories of the rucks and rows. There had never been such technical quality in English football, and the FA Cup semi-final replay of 1999, featured in depth in the programme, has an outstanding case for being the greatest game ever played in England. There are forgotten classics too, such as a primal 1-1 draw at Old Trafford on a filthy Wednesday night in 1999 and United’s 2-1 win at Highbury later that year, when both teams created an endless stream of chances in a first half that flowed like basketball. Some of the matches will never be forgotten. Arsenal won the league at Old Trafford in 2002 (and, effectively, in 1998). United beat Arsenal 6-1 in 2001, when Arsène Wenger went postal in the dressing room at half-time, and ended their 49-game unbeaten run in a bitterly controversial match in 2004 – a savage injustice from which Arsenal never truly recovered. “If you don’t feel pain when you’re being conned,” Sol Campbell says, “when are you gonna feel pain?” Both teams frequently took the moral high ground, often at the same time. With United and Arsenal the only teams to win the league from 1996 to 2004, the rivalry had a chance to develop and intensify. There were some monumental losses of temper from both managers and a set of characters on both sides – winners bursting with personality – any scriptwriter would kill for. The Feud neatly conveys the mass of contradictions in a rivalry that simultaneously bred hate and respect (when United won that immense FA Cup semi-final in 1999, Lee Dixon and Tony Adams dragged themselves into the tunnel to shake the hand of all their opponents and wish them well in the final). The players on both sides get on well these days, the experience of sharing punditry studios helping them realise how much they have in common. Yet this documentary dredges up plenty of competitive fire. Scholes, a superb Phil Neville and Martin Keown get in plenty of digs, and Keown is magnificently unrepentant about the incident with Van Nistelrooy. The extreme masculinity may offend some but those who prefer a bit of needle in their sport will probably love every minute of a superb documentary. The war between Arsenal and United is seen as a symbol of a good old days, yet there is more to it. It was a finite window in a rapidly changing world where the values and intensity of Old Football met the skill and diversity of New Football to produce a biblical struggle. Old Football is gone, so it can never happen again. In many ways, The Feud is a love letter to two men. Wenger 1.0, the imperturbable outsider who showed English football that the future is also a foreign country; and especially Sir Alex Ferguson, the emphatic genius who outlasted Wenger to win multiple titles after Arsenal started to fade. He had a degree in people and an addiction to competition. “The Gaffer loved a challenge,” says Steve McClaren, who was Ferguson’s assistant from 1999 to 2001. “He had to have somebody to fight. He had to have somebody to complain about. Arsenal. Arsenal. ARSENAL. WENGER!” Each defined the other for a decade; it was the same with their teams. The signature achievements – United’s Treble and Arsenal’s Invincible season – were only possible because a Dutchman missed a last-minute penalty against them for their greatest rivals: Dennis Bergkamp in 1999 and Van Nistelrooy in 2003. It’s an apt reflection of a rivalry in which every achievement was heightened by the quality and hatred of the opponent. Without each other they would have won so much more – but the triumphs would not have been nearly as sweet.

Top stories Scientists have chronicled the “mass mortality” of corals on the Great Barrier Reef, in a report that says 30% of them died in a catastrophic nine-month marine heatwave. The study, published in Nature, examined the link between the level of heat exposure, subsequent bleaching and coral death. The extent and severity of the die-off surprised even the researchers. Prof Terry Hughes told Guardian Australia the 2016 marine heatwave had been far more harmful than historical bleaching events, where an estimated 5% to 10% of corals died. Sign up to receive the top stories every morning “When corals bleach from a heatwave, they can either survive and regain their colour slowly as the temperature drops, or they can die,” Hughes said. Researchers were also surprised at how quickly some corals died in the extreme marine temperatures. “The conventional thinking is that after bleaching corals died slowly of … starvation. That’s not what we found. We were surprised that about half of the mortality we measured occurred very quickly.” The Labor states will seek a watertight undertaking that their renewable energy schemes and targets will remain undisturbed by the Turnbull government’s proposed national energy guarantee, at a critical meeting today. Victoria’s energy minister, Lily D’Ambrosio, told Guardian Australia she would work constructively towards achieving a national consensus “but we’ve got thresholds – red-line issues – that we are not going to compromise on”. State and territory energy ministers will meet tomorrow with their federal counterpart, Josh Frydenberg, to determine whether the guarantee proceeds to the next stage of work – detailed design. The start of the wet season in Bangladesh is exposing the 150,000 Rohingya refugees to increased risk of disease, infection and mudslides as their basic camps begin to turn to slush. The first bout of rain lasted an hour but left destruction in its wake. Cox’s Bazar is the most densely populated refugee camp in the world. Fiona MacGregor of the International Organisation for Migration said water-borne diseases and infection would spread quickly in the stagnant, unclean water. A $50-a-week increase to the minimum wage would create up to 87,000 jobs in the first two years, unions have claimed. The Australian Council of Trade Unions has made a submission to the Fair Work Commission, which is considering its claim for a uniform 7.2% increase to the minimum and award wages to take effect from 1 July. Unions have argued that low-paid workers spend most of their extra income, meaning an increase to the minimum wage would boost aggregate demand and create jobs. In its reply submissions the Australian Industry Group called the ACTU claim “manifestly excessive and completely unrealistic”. The Queen’s last remaining corgi has died, leaving the monarch without a corgi for the first time since the second world war. Willow, 15, was the 14th generation descended from Susan, a corgi given to the then Princess Elizabeth on her 18th birthday in 1944. The Queen has owned more than 30 dogs of the breed during her reign. It was reported in 2015 that she had stopped breeding corgis because she did not want to leave any behind after she died. Two dogs remain in the royal household – Vulcan and Candy – which are informally known as “dorgis”, a cross-breed between a dachshund and a corgi. Sport Expect the unexpected for AFL in 2018. With all teams displaying early vulnerabilities and opponents capitalising on any error or weakness, the 2018 AFL season is already defying prediction. This week our cartoonist David Squires reviews the final regular season round of the A-League and welcomes Mike Mulvey back to the competition. Thinking time Only 1% of clothing is recycled and this isn’t good enough, says Stella McCartney. The British fashion designer sits down with the Guardian’s fashion editor to discuss her cruelty-free, sustainability-minded clothes – and why it is crucial they are also beautiful garments to treasure for a lifetime. “I come at fashion with lightness of heart. I shot my last ad campaign in a landfill site for a reason, and to make a point, obviously. But the models looked happy, there was lightness, there was colour. My messaging is not the kind that is going to make you panic or feel rubbish about yourself or not sleep at night, because I don’t think that achieves much.” The Brisbane metro and cross-river rail projects are designed to work together – if only the federal and Queensland governments could do likewise, writes Ben Smee. Guardian Australia understands that the federal government will allocate $300m in funding for the Brisbane metro bus project, with the rest of the $1bn total cost coming from the Brisbane city council. This week federal Labor promised $2.2bn for cross-river rail, a project the Queensland government is committed to financing without federal help. So far, the Turnbull government won’t help pay for the rail plan, citing problems with the state’s business case. So what’s going on? The IMF outlooks have gone from pessimistic to more upbeat. But the good times might not last, writes Greg Jericho. The risks ahead include higher debt levels and scepticism about policymakers’ ability to generate growth: “It’s not that all the economics’ policies of the past 30 years have failed to deliver – the problem is what they failed to consider – that growth needs to be inclusive, not geared towards the top end.” What’s he done now? Donald Trump has contradicted numerous earlier statements and said the former FBI director James Comey was not fired because of the Russia investigation. “Slippery James Comey, the worst FBI Director in history, was not fired because of the phony Russia investigation where, by the way, there was NO COLLUSION (except by the Dems)!” Trump tweeted. Trump told NBC news last year – among other outlets – that he fired Comey because “of the Russia thing”. Media roundup The West Australian reports that the state’s reputation is being compromised by an increasing number of shark attacks, and more research needs to be pumped into understanding shark behaviour and finding methods to deter them from popular beaches that doesn’t involve slaughter. Malcolm Turnbull is courting Pacific Island leaders at Chogm this week, the Australian Financial Review reports, in an effort to combat China’s growing influence.

For the British Museum to open its inaugural music festival, Europe and the World, with this piece, played in the gallery that hosts its greatest, most discussed treasure, the Parthenon sculptures, was a master stroke. Strauss’s haunting, impassioned late work was written in elegy to the opera houses, Vienna and Dresden among them, razed by allied bombing in the second world war. In the years he was composing it, the “Elgin marbles” were buried in a disused tunnel in London’s underground to protect them from German air raids. The mutualities of war and art and civilisation could not be more tightly knotted. The British Museum has subtitled its two-week series “a symphony of cultures”, which it is: curated by Daniel Kühnel, intendant of Hamburg Symphony Orchestra, it features Spanish flamenco, Japanese spiritual music and traditional Chinese kunqu opera alongside Ligeti, Cage and Stockhausen. Most concerts in galleries are important chiefly as a way of cross-fertilising one art form with another, more novelty than major musical statement. The BM series, instead – following similar projects in museums in Jerusalem and Dresden – has visionary ambition and flair, its style of programming unlike any existing UK festival. The first evening was conceived as a whole, one piece running into another, without interval. As chairs and music stands were still being cleared after the Strauss, with witty theatrical haste, as soon became clear, the thrilling tones of mezzo-soprano Susan Bickley burst forth at the start of Recital I for Cathy (1972) by Berio, written for his ex-wife, Cathy Berberian. Bickley demonstrated astonishing mimetic range, and memory, in a part as long and wordy as any of the largest operatic roles. A singer-actress plays the part of a singer giving a recital, with all the histrionics and musical variety that might call for. The pianist hasn’t turned up, there are noises off – the sound of 17 musicians making merry havoc, mostly out of sight. Berio’s humour is theatrical as well as aural. He forges some four dozen musical fragments together, ranging with quicksilver speed from a Monteverdi lament to Rossini to Wagner to Bernstein, sometimes a mere flicker of a quotation. Bickley sailed through with wit and aplomb, the reverberant acoustic adding epic vocal bloom, with John Constable her game pianist, sharply directed by Lucy Bradley and conducted by Geoffrey Paterson. Finally, Giacinto Scelsi’s Xnoybis for solo violin (the flawless Diego Tosi), an intense, microtonal, whispering masterpiece, made the fitting conclusion. Scelsi (1905-88), a pupil of Schoenberg, friend of Virginia Woolf, mystic and ace ballroom dancer, was central to the second British Museum concert, on Tuesday night, a piano recital by the American 20th-century specialist Jay Gottlieb. The focus was spirituality, the venue the Hotung gallery of South Asian and Chinese cultures. Scelsi’s Four Illustrations on the Metamorphosis of Vishnu, growing from its opening chords in static meditation, seemed to have found its rightful home among the Buddhas and dancing Shivas. Works by George Crumb, Maurice Ohana and Messiaen, with some slightly extraneous Liszt, completed this thoughtful programme. The curiosity was The Temple Is Measured, the Spirit Is Incarnate by the underappreciated Russian Nikolai Obukhov (1892-1954). It sounded like Messiaen – nearly half a century early. In an all-round top week, Shostakovich’s Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk was revived at the Royal Opera House in Richard Jones’s 2004 production, conducted with explosive energy by Antonio Pappano. Eva-Maria Westbroek, as Katerina Ismailova, conveyed every ounce of her character’s boredom, sexual hunger and destructive self-obsession. John Tomlinson, celebrating 40 years of performing with the Royal Opera, returned as her revolting father-in-law, Boris Ismailov: a mesmerising spectacle. Brandon Jovanovich as sordid, deluded Sergey, John Daszak as the cuckolded, soon to be headless husband, and a sterling ensemble cast, chorus and outstanding orchestra (with excellent onstage brass band) make this an unmissable production. Last chances are on Tuesday and Friday. Shostakovich’s Symphony No 9 is the latest, and possibly the hardest, in Aurora orchestra’s brave annual Proms tradition of playing a score from memory. It’s a highlight of the 2018 season, announced last week: 90 concerts in 58 days with 42 premieres, including commissions from Anna Meredith on first night and Roxanna Panufnik on last. The Berlin Philharmonic with its new music director, Kirill Petrenko; Andris Nelsons and the Boston Symphony; Daniel Barenboim, Yuja Wang and, with more late-night Bach, András Schiff are among bill-topping names. Centenaries account for some of the most mouth-watering offerings: Debussy’s Pelléas et Mélisande; works by Lili Boulanger; and a generous splash of Bernstein: Antonio Pappano conducting the Orchestra of the Academy of Santa Cecilia, Rome, in a programme that includes Bernstein’s Symphony No 1, and the John Wilson Orchestra in West Side Story.

During the winter insects could be accused of having resorted to being life in the undergrowth, but the freezing easterlies have passed and the gentle warmth of the sun releases the bees and flies from their deep slumbers to again become life in the air. Ferry Meadows is busy with families enjoying the open air and strolls around the meadows and flooded gravel pits. A young girl and boy, engrossed in play, pick a few daffodil heads and marsh marigold flowers and cast them on to the surface of a pond. The spring flowers are as attractive to us as they have been to pollinators for 80m years – although in truth some of the less conspicuous flowers are the most appealing to the emerging bees. The bumblebees – the common carder bees (Bombus pascuorum) in their golden fleeces and the big bumbling buff-tails (B terrestris) – favour the dead nettles and sallow blossom, while the various fluffy brown mining bees (Andrena spp) frequent dandelions and blackthorn blossom. The mining bees could be mistaken for small, hairy honeybees, but the green furrow bee (Lasioglossum morio) could not be confused with a honeybee. She is less than 6mm long, not at all furry, and glistens metallic green. Despite being common, the little furrow bees are rarely observed, and most people are surprised to see how small a bee can be. This lack of familiarity is a pity as they exhibit plenty of endearing beeish behaviour. This one allows me to watch up close as she ferrets about in a daisy for her pollen and nectar sustenance. Nearby there must be an area of bare ground where she and her kin will soon start to dig their nesting burrows. Although each female furrow bee builds her own nest into which she will lay eggs and place provisions, the bees nest close together and cooperate, sharing foraging and nest protection duties. Her first offspring will be all female, which enables a deepening of their egalitarian society when her daughters then help their mother to provision their next brood."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/apr/19/emmanuel-macron-moderate-owen-jones","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-19T05:00:07Z","webTitle":"Don’t be fooled by Emmanuel Macron the ‘moderate’ | Owen Jones","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/19/emmanuel-macron-moderate-owen-jones","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/19/emmanuel-macron-moderate-owen-jones","fields":{"headline":"Don’t be fooled by Emmanuel Macron the ‘moderate’","bodyText":"The world has gone mad, the fanatics of left and right are on the march, the voices of reason have been sidelined. This is the view of the self-styled “moderates” or “centrists” of the political world and the commentariat. There has been little reflection about how the broken economic model they defended unleashed so much anger and disillusionment. Rather than debating ideas and policies, they longingly gaze after allegedly charismatic men who might act as saviours. David Miliband is the eternal prince over the water. But their international icon, France’s Emmanuel Macron, provides an instructive lesson in what “centrist” politics means in practice. Macron is far more popular internationally than in France, where dissatisfaction with his presidency has surged to 58% less than a year after his election. Here is a man who owes his power to good luck rather than any vindication of his political philosophy. In the first round of the French presidential election, he scored less than a quarter of the vote, and not dramatically more than three other candidates including the far-right Marine Le Pen and radical left Jean-Luc Mélenchon. Macron’s thumping second-round victory was less an endorsement and more a rejection of fascism. French scepticism towards Macron contrasts sharply with his own lack of self-doubt. He refused to be questioned by journalists because his “complex thought processes” were ill-suited for such a setting. His denunciations of his opponents would not be out of place on Donald Trump’s Twitter feed: they are “slackers” and “do-nothings”, while workers protesting over job losses should stop “wreaking havoc” and look for a job elsewhere. Macron is a pound-shop Margaret Thatcher, redistributing wealth to those with too much of it, while assaulting workers’ rights and France’s hard-won social model. His tax changes have gifted the hundred wealthiest households more than half a million euros a year: the top 1% captured 44% of his new tax breaks. For the less affluent, it’s a different story. This former investment banker has slashed housing benefit, and hiked taxes on pensioners – in a country where the average monthly pension is just €1,300 (£1,100). His policies have shifted the workplace balance of power from workers to bosses. French students are staging occupations and protests against more selective entry requirements for universities, derided as an attack on free universal education and France’s social model. Another pillar of his agenda is privatisation, including of France’s airports and part of the national energy utility. His confrontation with rail workers is seen as an attempt to lay the foundations for a catastrophic British-style privatisation of the railway industry. EU-mandated deregulation will mean foreign companies can soon compete with the state rail company SNCF, and Macron is transforming it from a state enterprise into a limited company; exactly what happened with the formerly state-owned France Télécom. So-called centrists are supposed to be socially liberal. Macron exposes this pernicious myth for what it is. A man who courted left-leaning voters by promising a humane policy towards migrants and refugees now has them firmly in his sights. The number of days a person without papers can be imprisoned in a detention centre is to be doubled; the consideration time period for asylum has been halved, meaning fewer refugees will be accepted. Charities warn that refugees fleeing war will be deported. Macron’s interior minister, Gérard Collomb, claims that communities are “breaking up because they are overwhelmed by the inflow of asylum seekers”. No wonder the far-right Front National has described his policies as a “political victory”. Macron offers no future for France, let alone any other western society. There is hope, however. For years after François Hollande betrayed his 2012 election pledge to break with austerity, the French left was in the doldrums. Polls showed that the far right was strongest among the disillusioned, insecure younger generation. The rise of radical left politician Mélenchon changed that: he won nearly a fifth of the vote in the first round of the presidential election, partly by prising some of the disaffected from the jaws of the far right. Macron is presented as an oasis of moderation, a bulwark against the extremes. But there is nothing moderate about slashing taxes on the wealthy, attacking workers’ rights or demonising refugees. He represents a doubling down on an economic model that bred mass insecurity and proved an essential ingredient in the revival of French fascism. It is the same across the west. An unjust economic model long defended by parties of the centre right and centre left – one that brought an economic crash that led to austerity and attacks on living standards – is squarely responsible for the polarisation of politics. If the left fails to provide an inspiring, coherent alternative, it will be the radical right that will triumph. • Owen Jones is a Guardian columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"education/2018/apr/19/teachers-in-uk-report-growing-vocabulary-deficiency","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-18T23:00:36Z","webTitle":"Teachers in UK report growing 'vocabulary deficiency'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2018/apr/19/teachers-in-uk-report-growing-vocabulary-deficiency","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/education/2018/apr/19/teachers-in-uk-report-growing-vocabulary-deficiency","fields":{"headline":"Teachers in UK report growing 'vocabulary deficiency'","bodyText":"Teachers are encountering increasing numbers of children with stunted vocabularies – haunting many pupils from primary to secondary school – and they fear “vocabulary deficiency” will hold them back educationally and socially. In response some schools said they had adopted approaches such as highlighting pupils’ use of informal words such as “innit” and encouraging them to improve and widen their use of language. A survey of 1,300 primary and secondary school teachers across the UK found that more than 60% saw increasing incidents of underdeveloped vocabulary among pupils of all ages, leading to lower self-esteem, negative behaviour and in some cases greater difficulties in making friends. The report, commissioned by the Oxford University Press, found the word gap for many pupils remained “stubbornly high” at secondary schools, where teachers say they have less time and fewer resources to tackle the problem. “This is significant because while language development is a key focus in early years education, relatively little research has been conducted into language deficit as children progress through secondary education,” the report’s authors noted. Secondary school teachers said that vocabulary deficiency held back pupils’ progress not just in English but also across a range of subjects, including history and geography. Those with a low vocabulary were also less likely to do well in national tests such as GCSEs, struggling to understand instructions and questions included in papers. Worringly, a third of secondary school teachers reported a widening vocabulary gap between the first and last years of secondary school. The majority of teachers surveyed blamed declining numbers of children reading for pleasure for shrinking vocabularies, especially among older pupils. Kate Nation, professor of experimental psychology at the University of Oxford, said that language variation in children was complex and difficult to attribute to a single cause. “Regardless of the causes, low levels of vocabulary set limits on literacy, understanding, learning the curriculum and can create a downward spiral of poor language which begins to affect all aspects of life,” Nation said. Both primary and secondary teachers agreed that the impact on pupils was potentially severe, with more than 80% agreeing that children with vocabulary deficiency were likely to have lower self-esteem. Teachers from schools with a high proportion of pupils eligible for free school meals were more likely to encounter children with low vocabularies but experts who contributed said the results suggested limited vocabulary was “a general problem and not specific to any one group of pupils”. Greater involvement by parents was seen as the key to helping children improve their vocabulary, according to a majority of teachers. In response, a Department for Education spokesperson said: “Every child, no matter what their background, should be able to master the basics of reading and writing. But still, too many children from disadvantaged backgrounds start school with poorer vocabulary and language skills than their better-off classmates. “That is why we are taking action to tackle the word gap once and for all – and earlier this year we announced a £26m network of specialist English hubs around the country, along with a £5.7m fund to improve literacy and numeracy in early years and primary education.” Another report - from the Education Policy Institute and UCL Institute of Education - found that England has a poor track record in improving the educational attainment of its most disadvantaged pupils compared with developed countries such as Canada and Denmark. The report found that selection by ability, for grammar schools or classroom streams or sets, widened the performance gap between better-off pupils and those from poorer backgrounds. “Our research finds that high performance and greater equity in educational opportunities and outcomes are not necessarily mutually exclusive,” the authors said. The best performing countries “tend to have policies which avoid selection by ability and segregation between schools. They also tend to have a significant focus on attracting, supporting and retaining high quality teachers.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/apr/18/the-guardian-view-on-the-tax-credit-rape-clause-a-disturbing-part-of-a-greater-wrong","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-18T17:33:03Z","webTitle":"The Guardian view on the tax credit ‘rape clause’: a disturbing part of a greater wrong | Editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/18/the-guardian-view-on-the-tax-credit-rape-clause-a-disturbing-part-of-a-greater-wrong","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/18/the-guardian-view-on-the-tax-credit-rape-clause-a-disturbing-part-of-a-greater-wrong","fields":{"headline":"The Guardian view on the tax credit ‘rape clause’: a disturbing part of a greater wrong","bodyText":"A year ago, a repugnant policy now known as the “rape clause” came into force.

Women’s groups and medical staff warned that, among many other problems, this risked retraumatising victims by forcing them to disclose assault against their wishes. But the measure received relatively little attention, in part because it received no parliamentary debate or vote. Alison Thewliss, the sharp-eyed Scottish Nationalist MP who spotted it, was right to describe the policy as immoral. But she was wrong to say that smuggling it into law via a statutory instrument was the “final insult”: for another came this week, when the work and pensions secretary, Esther McVey, was challenged on the policy. Ms McVey declared that when victims make the declaration, to a third party such as a health worker, they could find “an opportunity to talk about, maybe, something that has happened that they never had before so it is potentially double support … getting the money they need and maybe an outlet which they might possibly need”. Theresa May avoided such extraordinary insensitivity when the issue was raised at prime minister’s questions, but made no concessions. This was an attempt to recast the ruthlessness of austerity as an act of munificence. The government gave, but only after taking away from a much wider group – and on the cruellest terms. It discriminates against many victims, since the exemption does not apply to mothers living with their rapist; officials appear unaware of how many assaults occur within relationships. Forcing women to name the child conceived during rape increases the risk that child will discover their origins and be stigmatised. And in Northern Ireland, where failure to report a crime is an offence, the medical or other staff told about the rape should inform police of the allegation – even if victims do not wish to pursue it. That puts both in an invidious position. But the rape clause is only one element, albeit an especially pernicious one, within a rotten policy penalising many more families. Households with more than two children are hit when a parent loses a job or falls ill. Women who become pregnant unintentionally may find financial pressures tip their decision about whether to continue the pregnancy. Northern Ireland’s abortion laws mean few women there have such a choice. And though the government presents the cap as a matter of holding adults to account for their decisions, it is children who pay. The Child Poverty Action Group says that estimates suggest more than 250,000 children will be pushed into poverty by the end of the decade, representing a 10% increase in child poverty, and a similar number will fall deeper into poverty. Judgment on its legal challenge to the policy is due on Friday. This affair has sinister resonance with the current Windrush scandal. In that case, too, the government initially refused to acknowledge a glaring injustice; and it did so because the particular injustice stems from a far broader one: a harsh regime pursued for political advantage with a spurious rationale of fairness. The creation of a “hostile” immigration regime is paralleled by the imposition of austerity in the welfare system and its justification with a similarly divisive ethos separating “deserving” and “undeserving” candidates for state support. In its impact assessment, the Department for Work and Pensions said the two-child cap would ensure that the system “is fair to those who pay for it, as well as those who benefit from it, ensuring those on benefits face the same financial choices around the number of children they can afford as those supporting themselves through work”. In fact, 70% of those claiming tax credits are already working. This government fosters suspicion and division, setting people against one another. By immiserating families, it also erodes wider bonds and diminishes society. Scrapping the rape clause would alter, not eradicate, the unfairness to victims. Getting rid of the cap that produced it would be to everyone’s gain."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"politics/2018/apr/19/tessa-jowell-visits-parliament-cancer-debate","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-19T16:21:14Z","webTitle":"Tessa Jowell hailed as an inspiration during MPs' cancer debate","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/apr/19/tessa-jowell-visits-parliament-cancer-debate","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/apr/19/tessa-jowell-visits-parliament-cancer-debate","fields":{"headline":"Tessa Jowell hailed as an inspiration during MPs' cancer debate","bodyText":"Tessa Jowell, the former Labour minister who helped bring the Olympics to London, has been praised by MPs across the parties as an inspiration. Before the debate began the Speaker, John Bercow, welcomed Jowell and her family to the gallery in a highly unusual intervention. “I hope you feel fortified and inspired by the warm embrace of parliamentary love,” he said Lady Jowell, who was diagnosed in May last year with a high-grade brain tumour, is now terminally ill. But she had come into the House of Commons to meet the health secretary, Jeremy Hunt, and his Labour opposite number, Jon Ashworth, to continue her campaign for better support, more research and better access to clinical trials for brain cancer patients. Many speakers praised Jowell’s own speech in the Lords in January. James Brokenshire, the former Northern Ireland secretary who resigned to undergo cancer treatment early this year, said he listened to it while he was recovering from surgery to remove a tumour from his lung. “What Tessa’s speech did was to focus on the human condition – what gives it purpose – and the overriding power of human kindness, compassion and love.” One MP who worked with her on the Games, Sarah Jones, described her on Thursday as “a woman who walked through walls,” first to win the Olympics for London and now to improve care and treatment of patients with brain cancer. Jones said Jowell’s speech talked of hope. “Hope for cancer patients across the world. That the revolution we need is close at hand. Hope that we can live well together with cancer, for longer, and not just die of it.” Brain tumours are the biggest cancer killer of children and adults under the age of 40 in the UK, and across the population reduce life expectancy by, on average, 20 years. That is the highest of any cancer. More than half of the 11,000 people diagnosed with a high-grade brain tumour will die within one year and less than one in five survive for five years or more Jowell’s speech led to a meeting in February with ministers, cancer campaigners and charities where some of her objectives such as measuring improvements in the quality of life lived with cancer were agreed. Work is under way to improve access to data and analysis, and to improve diagnosis. The meeting coincided with an announcement of £45m of research funding into brain tumours supported by Cancer Research UK and the Department of Health. Steve Reed, the Labour and Co-operative MP for Croydon who knew Jowell as a councillor in south London, said she had always been a fighter. “Now she’s in the fight of her life. But how typical that she’s turned it into a fight to allow everyone to live well, to live better and to live longer,” he said. At the end of the debate, with Jowell looking on, Sarah Jones read a note from the former MP thanking everyone for their love and support. “It was the honour of my life to be one of you. I shall cheer on from the sidelines as you keep fighting the good fight. Remember our battle cry – living with, not dying from cancer, for more people.” Tonight, the Global Universal Cancer Databank will be launched at Westminster to catalyse data sharing across the world. Jowell is committed to being the first donor."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"money/2018/apr/26/opodo-mistakes-refund-tickets-forward-airline","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-26T11:58:39Z","webTitle":"Opodo didn’t make my booking – and it won’t give me a refund","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2018/apr/26/opodo-mistakes-refund-tickets-forward-airline","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2018/apr/26/opodo-mistakes-refund-tickets-forward-airline","fields":{"headline":"Opodo didn’t make my booking – and it won’t give me a refund","bodyText":"We used Opodo to buy two airline tickets from Florence to Nice, and received a confirmation email.

Speaking at a press conference to mark the start of the IMF’s spring meeting in Washington, Lagarde said breaking up companies was not the solution, but added that her organisation was monitoring their impact on prosperity, financial stability and the workplace. “Competition is needed. From competition you get productivity growth and innovation. Too much concentration, too much market power in the hands of the few is not helpful to the economy or to the wellbeing of individuals.” Pressure has been building in the US for antitrust laws to be used to break up some of the biggest companies, with Google, Facebook and Amazon all targeted by critics. Lagarde said: “I am not sure breaking up some of the tech titans in this country [the US] or in other countries will be the right answer. It used to be the right answer, but when most of the assets are intangible, how do you break them up? How do you facilitate access and allow market disruptors to operate? I think that is where a lot of new thinking has to be done.” The IMF is carefully monitoring new digital currencies such as Bitcoin, which it says are prone to fraud and can be used for money laundering. “We have seen a flourishing of cryptocurrencies. There are now more than 100. That has stability implications eventually. We do not think it is systemic at this point in time but regulators and supervisors have to be watchful.” Lagarde expressed concern at the growing threat of a trade war between the US and China, saying that protectionism posed a threat to the upswing in the global economy and to an international system that had served countries well. She said the actual impact of the proposed US and Chinese tariffs would be small. “It is more difficult to measure the erosion of confidence. When investors don’t know the terms on which they are trading, they are reluctant to invest. Growth is being driven by more investment and trade, so why damage those engines?” Britain is one developed country that has not seen its growth prospects upgraded by the IMF over the past year. The Washington-based organisation expects growth of around 1.5% this year and next. Although the UK economy has performed better than the IMF expected prior to the EU referendum in June 2016, Lagarde said there had been a negative impact from Brexit. “The cloud of uncertainty that covers the British economy is one reason the UK is not enjoying the same upswing as other advanced countries. Hopefully it will clear up as time goes by.” Lagarde said the UK needed to sort out its new trading arrangements with the European Union and 150 countries around the world. “Once that has been settled, once the cloud has been dissipated, hopefully Britain will be in a better position to benefit from the upswing.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"media/2018/apr/19/wpp-contacted-by-fca-to-check-if-it-is-in-breach-of-laws","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-19T15:12:23Z","webTitle":"WPP contacted by FCA to check if it is in breach of laws","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/apr/19/wpp-contacted-by-fca-to-check-if-it-is-in-breach-of-laws","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2018/apr/19/wpp-contacted-by-fca-to-check-if-it-is-in-breach-of-laws","fields":{"headline":"WPP contacted by FCA to check if it is in breach of laws","bodyText":"The financial services watchdog has contacted WPP to check if it is in breach of laws relating to insider information regarding the amount of company money that Sir Martin Sorrell is alleged to have misused. The WPP board has closed down the investigation into Sorrell as part of his deal to leave the company he founded 33 years ago, and has told shareholders the “allegations do not involve amounts that are material to WPP”. Sorrell described the allegations as “financial impropriety by me, specifically as to the use of company funds”. The 73-year old has unreservedly denied misconduct allegations, and WPP’s board has said it would not be publishing the outcome of an independent law firm’s investigations into them. The Financial Conduct Authority does not directly regulate companies that are not in the financial services industry, but it does have a duty to monitor the behaviour of publicly listed companies to make sure they comply with market abuse regulations. It has questioned WPP to make sure its announcement about Sorrell meets disclosure and transparency requirements, specifically that the sums of money are not large enough to be classified as a breach of insider information rules. A breach would be not disclosing information that might have a material impact on WPP’s share price. “It is the responsibility of a listed company to ensure that they identify potential inside information and take steps to disclose it appropriately to the market,” an FCA spokesman aid. “The FCA routinely contacts firms or their advisers to clarify press commentary, announcements and events and did so in this case.” The FCA would not comment on whether its approach to WPP could lead to further investigation. The top WPP executive tasked with keeping the business running after Sorrell’s abrupt departure said on Thursday that a break-up of the marketing services giant made no sense. WPP moved to immediately name Mark Read, seen by many as the leading internal candidate to take over as chief executive, as joint chief operating officer to steady the ship following Sorrell’s resignation on Saturday night. The global chief executive of Wunderman and WPP Digital, who has previously served on the company’s board, sent an email to the company’s 200,000 global workforce to try to calm nerves about the uncertain future WPP faces. “There’s been speculation about breaking up the group,” Read said. “We don’t believe this makes sense. In a world where clients need faster, more agile, integrated solutions, we need to get closer together, not further apart. There’s a huge amount of support and goodwill for the company, and no shortage of confidence about the future.” Read is running the business day-to-day alongside WPP’s senior executive for Europe, Andrew Scott. The Sky chief executive, Jeremy Darroch, tipped as a well-qualified contender to take over from Sorrell, ruled himself out of the running on Thursday."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/apr/19/ivan-mauger-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-19T16:16:14Z","webTitle":"Ivan Mauger obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/apr/19/ivan-mauger-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/apr/19/ivan-mauger-obituary","fields":{"headline":"Ivan Mauger obituary","bodyText":"When speedway’s popularity as a spectator sport was eclipsed only by football, Ivan Mauger was its greatest star. In an era when the sport, and many of its participants, were a little rough round the edges, Mauger pioneered hitherto undreamed-of levels of professionalism on and off the track, which he allied to perfectionism in the preparation of his machinery, and a clinical riding style. Mauger, who has died aged 78, won the world championship six times between 1968 and 1979 and led his British clubs to four league titles. The first three of those championships came in consecutive years with the Manchester team the Belle Vue Aces, when their home was the 40,000-capacity Hyde Road stadium, part of a 68-hectare (168-acre) amusement park that included a zoo, fairground and dance hall. A good night out in Manchester in the early 1970s started with the Aces, whose management ensured at all costs that racing was over by 9pm so the crowd could get spending in the fair. It was an unusual weekend if the spectators had not seen Mauger score maximum points for winning all his races. Ivan was born in Christchurch, on the South Island of New Zealand, to Alice (nee Forscutt) and Edwin Mauger, and grew up obsessed with sport. He was a talented rugby and hockey player – good enough to represent Canterbury at rugby and hockey as a schoolboy – as well as a cross-country runner. Unsurprisingly, he was a lifelong All Blacks supporter. In a precursor of his later attitudes to turnout, he would not just clean his boots before a match, he would launder the white laces. Edwin liked bikes and American cars, and took the family to the new Aranui track that was part of the postwar speedway boom. Ivan took his first steps in oval racing shortly afterwards with a cycle speedway team and from there it was just a matter of adding an engine. Mauger arrived in the UK in 1957 as a newly married teenager with his wife, Raye, and they headed for south London, to Wimbledon speedway, where their fellow Kiwis Ronnie Moore and Barry Briggs, both multiple world champions, had started their UK careers. Mauger got a job helping with track maintenance but did not make much of an impression as a rider. At the end of 1958, disillusioned, he and Raye went back to Christchurch. They returned in 1963, fortified by competition in Australia and advice from the Aussie world champ Jack Young. The results started to come, as Mauger helped Newcastle Diamonds to the 1964 Provincial League (the second-tier) title, but the money took longer. The Maugers shared a flat in the Whalley Range area of Manchester with an assortment of aspiring riders. Visitors remember a loaf and jam on the table, but no butter, and children sleeping in the bath. Up until 1995, speedway’s world championship was run along similar lines to the FA Cup. Riders worked their way through qualifying events and regional finals until just 16 were left to contest the world final. Mauger made it for the first time in 1966, finishing fourth, and went one place better next time. In 1968, still a Newcastle rider, Mauger went through the card winning all five of his races. In 1969 he did it again, dropping a point only in his final race as, with the title already retained, he shepherded his Belle Vue team-mate Sören Sjösten home to put him in a run-off for second place with Briggs. He was now the fully formed professional, just in time to ride a popularity boom as the days of baggy black leathers gave way to TV coverage and colour. Mauger was indisputably the best in the world, but he was not universally popular with fans. Neither his personality nor his riding were theatrical. There were no wild broadslides on full lock – he dealt in beautifully traced arcs precisely calculated for maximum efficiency. Winning was more a cause for relief than joy. No detail was too small to escape Mauger’s attention. Racing, he said, was a jigsaw puzzle; every piece had to fit perfectly without being forced. Diet, sleep patterns, travel schedules were all planned with the world title in mind. Throughout his career he had just one engine builder, one wheel builder and one mechanic. In 1970 he was champion again, and again with a maximum score. Mauger is still the only rider to have won three consecutive world titles. His other wins came in 1972, 1977 and 1979; between 1968 and 1974, he was never out of the top three. On the domestic front, now comfortably ensconced in Cheshire, he captained the Belle Vue Aces to a hat-trick of titles, forming them into the best team the UK had seen. Mauger demanded high standards from other riders but was a generous team leader. One junior Ace was shocked when Mauger let him take first pick for grid position and on summoning up the courage to ask why was told: “They won’t let me pick my starting position in the world final.” He was not given to sentiment. He won the league again in 1974 with Exeter, again with a squad he moulded. Next season, after he was booed at Belle Vue, he took cold satisfaction in Exeter winning the return fixture to prevent the Manchester club becoming champions. By contrast, he was always generous in his assessment of Jerzy Szczakiel, the Pole who beat him in the controversial run-off for the 1973 world title: “I made a mistake, he didn’t.” On Mauger’s retirement from racing in 1985, he and Raye moved to the Gold Coast, Queensland. She survives him, along with their children, Julie, Kym and Debbie. • Ivan Gerald Mauger, speedway rider, born 4 October 1939; died 16 April 2018"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2018/apr/20/syrian-army-bombards-yarmouk-refugee-camp-in-damascus","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-20T14:27:35Z","webTitle":"Last Damascus rebels bombarded as Assad presses advantage in Syria","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/20/syrian-army-bombards-yarmouk-refugee-camp-in-damascus","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/apr/20/syrian-army-bombards-yarmouk-refugee-camp-in-damascus","fields":{"headline":"Last Damascus rebels bombarded as Assad presses advantage in Syria","bodyText":"The Syrian army has bombarded jihadis and other rebels in the last area outside government control near Damascus, as President Bashar al-Assad moved to strengthen his position around the capital after the defeat of rebels in eastern Ghouta earlier this month. The bombing came as inspectors from the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) remained stranded in Damascus almost two weeks after a chemical attack on a town in Ghouta that precipitated the rebel collapse. Airstrikes and shelling hit the Yarmouk Palestinian refugee camp and al-Hajar al-Aswad area, part of a small enclave divided between warring jihadis and other rebels south of the capital. Live state television footage of the area showed a plume of smoke billowing across one district as guns boomed in the distance. The US, British and French missile strikes designed to punish Assad for the use of chemical weapons have done nothing to slow the advance of his forces, now in their strongest position since the early months of the seven-year war. Efforts to investigate the chemical attack in Douma on 7 April have been repeatedly delayed, leading to suspicions that the regime and its ally Russia were stalling the OPCW team into order to tamper with evidence at the site. Russia’s official position, citing the tests done by its own military, is that the attack never took place, and that no one died as a result. Moscow has said that armed rebels forced local residents to take part in staged filming of the alleged attack’s aftermath, including by faking symptoms of chemical poisoning. However, if the inspectors find evidence of chemical weapons, officials are primed to deflect blame from Assad and try to pin the attack on rebels. Russian state media is pushing two lines: that they have spoken to witnesses who deny any attack took place, and that they have found canisters filled with chlorine in Douma, which were used for rebel attacks later blamed on the regime. On Wednesday, Russian state TV broadcast interviews with a Syrian boy it said was featured in a hospital video taken by the Syria Civil Defence, a volunteer organisation known as the White Helmets. The boy, whose name is Hassan Diab, said he was in a bomb shelter with his mother and felt fine, when people on the street told everyone to go to the hospital. There, they were filmed being doused in water and given other simulated medical treatment. A state television reporter, citing Diab’s father, said the boy was given rice and figs for his part in the video. The boy’s father, who was not present at the time of the attack, said he later found his son at the hospital. He said that no chemical attack took place in Douma that night. That contradicts accounts by victims given to a number of western outlets, which put the death toll from the attack at more than 40 people, many trapped in the basement of a three-storey house. CBS News, reporting from Douma, published a photograph of the missile said by locals to have carried the chemical payload lodged in the building’s facade. Doctors responsible for treating patients in the hours after the 7 April attack said they faced government intimidation to stay quiet. The World Health Organisation said that 500 people sought medical treatment with “signs and symptoms consistent with exposure to toxic chemicals”. “It’s absolute misinformation and a cover-up,” said Hamish de Bretton-Gordon, an adviser to the Union of Medical Care and Relief Organizations, of the Russian denials. “But I know that a number of samples have gotten out of Syria and have been tested, and I’m hoping they will confirm what happened.” In another Russian state TV programme broadcast one day before Diab’s interview, Russian soldiers on the ground in Douma said they found underground rebel labs for producing chemical weapons, including chlorine. A Russian official showed state journalists chemical equipment and materials, which are needed to produce sulfur and nitrogen mustard gas. Key among the findings was a chemical cylinder, which a Russian official said was filled with chlorine gas, and which was nearly identical to the ones used in the 7 April video that Russia accused of being fake. “Thanks to these instructions, using this equipment, the fighters made the gas they later used in their provocations,” a state TV journalist reported. Later in the report, he referred to the cylinder: “The rebels pumped chlorine into similar vessels, took it to the city, and then presented it all as an attack by the Syrian army.” Russia said that the Khan Shaykhun nerve gas attack, which killed at least 87 people in 2017, occurred because a government airstrike had hit a rebel depot for chemical munitions. The Assad government denied at first that any incident had taken place. In October 2017, the OPCW-UN Joint Investigative Mechanism found that Assad’s forces launched the attack. One month later, Russia vetoed the renewal of the inquiry, calling it biased. The inquiry had identified multiple instances when the Syrian government stood behind chemical gas attacks in the country, as well as attacks carried out by Isis. With the OPCW fact-finding mission only capable of confirming the use of chemical weapons and not assigning blame, de Bretton-Gordon said Russia’s response was predictable. “The US, the British and the French will have a UN resolution to sanction the Syrians and no doubt the Russians will veto it,” he said. “We’ll be back in our cycle.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2018/apr/19/allergan-hovers-as-takeda-fails-with-44bn-shire-takeover-bid","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-19T17:15:00Z","webTitle":"Shire rebuffs Takeda takeover bid as Allergan drops out","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/apr/19/allergan-hovers-as-takeda-fails-with-44bn-shire-takeover-bid","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/apr/19/allergan-hovers-as-takeda-fails-with-44bn-shire-takeover-bid","fields":{"headline":"Shire rebuffs Takeda takeover bid as Allergan drops out","bodyText":"The drugs company Shire is at the centre of a multibillion-pound takeover battle after the Botox-maker Allergan emerged as a rival suitor to Japan’s Takeda, which is also hoping to clinch a deal. Shire, which makes the ADHD drug Adderall and focuses on rare diseases, was the top FTSE 100 riser on Thursday after Allergan said it was considering making an offer. Shares rose nearly 6%. It followed Takeda’s revelation that although the board of Shire had rejected a £44bn offer, talks with the company were “ongoing”. Allergan, a global company listed in New York and with its headquarters in Dublin, said it was in the early stages of considering a possible offer for Shire. It added: “No offer has been made. There can be no certainty an offer will be made nor as to the terms on which any such offer would be made. A further announcement will be made as appropriate.” Later on Thursday, Allergan Chief Executive Brent Saunders decided to drop his pursuit of London-listed Shire after receiving pushback from some of his shareholders, who were concerned about the company overstretching its resources, according to people familiar with the matter, who asked not be identified discussing confidential talks. Allergan then issued a second announcement stating it did not intend to make an offer for Shire. It is the latest twist in the battle to take control of Shire after Takeda said at the end of March it was considering making an offer. Updating the market on Thursday, the Japanese firm revealed Shire’s board had rejected its offer, which was equivalent to £46.50 a share. Shire responded with its own statement saying that the board had considered three separate offers from Takeda, unanimously rejecting them all on the grounds that they “significantly undervalue the company and Shire’s growth prospects and pipeline”. However, Shire suggested it would be willing to consider an improved offer: “At the board’s request Shire’s advisers entered into a dialogue with Takeda’s advisers to discuss whether a further, more attractive, proposal may be forthcoming and to understand the basis on which such a proposal would be made. “The board and management of Shire remain committed to enhancing shareholder value and are focused on fully evaluating internal and external opportunities to maximise value for shareholders, including any further proposals from Takeda.” Shire was founded in Basingstoke, Hampshire, in 1986, but the company has scaled back its presence in the UK and most of its operations are in the US. It has its headquarters in Dublin for tax purposes but is mainly from Boston. Takeda is focused on expanding overseas and initially said an acquisition of Shire would allow it to grow in its core areas of oncology, gastrointestinal and neuroscience. However, Shire announced on Monday that it was selling its oncology business to the French firm Servier for $2.4bn (£1.7bn). “Shire’s latest refusal, as well a deal to offload its oncology division, a prize asset that would have been complimentary to Takeda’s portfolio, could be the final nail in the coffin of the merger,” Jasper Lawler, head of research at London Capital Group, said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"culture/2018/apr/22/your-pictures-share-your-photos-on-the-theme-of-quick","type":"article","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-22T08:00:17Z","webTitle":"Your pictures: share your photos on the theme of 'quick'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2018/apr/22/your-pictures-share-your-photos-on-the-theme-of-quick","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/2018/apr/22/your-pictures-share-your-photos-on-the-theme-of-quick","fields":{"headline":"Your pictures: share your photos on the theme of 'quick'","bodyText":"The next theme for our weekly photography assignment in the Observer New Review is ‘quick.’ Share your photos of what quick means to you – and tell us about your image in the description box.

I was 14 and went with my dad. He wasn’t really a Cash fan. He liked light operatic tenors like Josef Locke and Mario Lanza. He once, after several drinks, was unable to bring Lanza’s name to mind. In desperation, he asked my mum for help. “I don’t remember,” she said. “Well, of course you don’t remember,” he replied. “That’s because you’re rubbish and all your family are rubbish.” At the time, it seemed unnecessarily harsh but now I can’t help thinking that, if he’d lived, he could have completely revitalised the quiz show format. I’d got into Cash after I’d used my pocket money to buy his Live at San Quentin album, just because I liked the cover. It turned out I liked the record inside even more. There were songs about being on the run from the law, one about a train wreck in which the driver was “scalded to death by the steam”, and another about a man called Sue brawling with his estranged father. It was recorded live at San Quentin State Prison in California and the whole atmosphere of the album was electric, with whoops of approval for any reference to casual violence and/or reform of the penal system. They loved him. Cash was in with the locked-in crowd. The Birmingham gig was amazing as well. To my delight, Cash began the show with his catchphrase: “Hello. I’m Johnny Cash.” As catchphrases go, it’s not a complex construction but it had the advantage of being very hard to plagiarise. Cash did all his best-loved songs. Even my dad liked it. It could be said that it was Cash who, just a few months later, started me on the rocky road to alcoholism. Hearing that I’d been to the Odeon show, my elder brother, Terry, suggested we visited a nearby pub in Smethwick to see a Johnny Cash impersonator. I’d never been in a pub before so I was a bit scared, but I couldn’t resist the opportunity to relive that glorious first gig, albeit with a stand-in for the great man. It was a rites-of-passage night for me. My brother laughed off my request for dandelion and burdock and got me a big, dark pint of beer. I didn’t much like the taste but my whole body tingled with excitement, like when you put the last piece into a jigsaw. The counterfeit Cash was good. He even did the catchphrase, thus destroying my anti-plagiarism theory. When he stepped off stage, my brother called him over. Faux Cash looked at me and said: “He’s a bit young.” “Yeah,” said my brother, “but he’s seen the real Johnny Cash live on stage.” Copy-Cash looked crestfallen. “Why did you bring him here then?” he said and walked away. I learned a valuable lesson that night: when you meet a big fish in a small pond, never acknowledge the existence of a larger body of water. I also learned, after three whole pints, that alcohol made life lovely. I don’t know if country music often leads to heavy drinking, but I’d say the reverse is certainly true. The more I drank, the more country I listened to and Cash was my soundtrack of choice. Alcoholism and country music are both tremendous aids to self-dramatisation. I saw myself as an outlaw, someone outside the polite norms of society. I never actually, as the Cash lyric goes, “shot a man in Reno, just to watch him die”. But then again, even if I had, I probably wouldn’t have remembered it. Meanwhile, Cash was also living on the slippery slope, though obviously he had a much more interesting life than me. So he messed it up in much more interesting ways: popping pills, wrecking hotel rooms and getting ripped down the middle in a fight with his own ostrich. He was the Man in Black, I was only the Man in Black Country. By the time I quit drinking in 1986, Cash’s career had nosedived. His brand of “shot my woman down” theatrics was no longer in vogue. I was mocked when I told people he was my first gig. Sans booze, Cash’s troubled outsider lyrics didn’t move me as much as they had, but I still loved him. Over the space of a few long drives, mainly to and from West Bromwich Albion matches, I listened to him recite the entire New Testament on 16 CDs. The themes of being on the run from the law, gruesome death and father-son relationships still featured. After I became a professional comedian, I took to listening to Cash’s classic hit Ring of Fire before I went on stage. I always found it completely exhilarating. Some comedians used Bolivian marching powder before they went on. All I needed was Mexican trumpets. In the 1990s, the music producer Rick Rubin saw past the cheesy Christmas-specials sparkle and country music bouffant and treated Cash like a real musician again. He redefined him as the primal American folk singer. Suddenly, he was a cool “first-ever gig” story again. Cash died in 2003. I shed a tear. It’s what country music fans do. I still get a pain in my heart when a checkout person asks me if I’d like cash back. So I decided to write a half-hour TV comedy about the man. The fight with the ostrich was my first thought. Not only does it feature a music legend battling with a creature whose natural design is fundamentally comic, the story is also further enriched by the fact that Cash’s resulting injuries led to a painkiller addiction. Obviously, on one level, this is a tragic set of circumstances, but I can’t help thinking, for Cash, it must have been almost worth having the addiction for the anticipatory thrill of that moment when yet another doctor asks you what triggered it. The script knits together the ostrich encounter from 1981 with a second incident from 1983, when Cash wrecked a Nottingham hotel room during a UK tour. He suffered from hallucinations in Nottingham. It seemed to me that the nature of these hallucinations was open to speculation. So I put two and two together and got ostrich. I’ve even been allowed to play the lead. I don’t naturally look like Cash, but a prosthetic version of his much-broken nose and a wig that looked almost as bad as Cash’s real hair in the early 1980s helped towards the final transformation. I figured we could explain any further shortfall by the fact that addiction to painkillers can really change a man. Also, just as we began shooting, I was struck down by a horrible virus. Lying on my dressing room floor, being sick into a bin while fully made-up and costumed as Cash, is the sort of preparation for a part that even Daniel Day-Lewis might balk at. We lost three days filming and I returned with a voice that sounded like a late-night message from the underworld. It was perfect. Of course, Cash was the subject of an award-winning movie, Walk the Line, but I have to say, though I probably shouldn’t, that I prefer my portrayal to Joaquin Phoenix’s. He goes for the sexy gunslinger aspect of Cash. I concentrate on Cash the decidedly unstable Old Testament prophet, a sort of Isaiah on analgesics. That said, I still think the best Cash portrayal I ever saw was that singer in the Smethwick pub. He really got the inner-torment thing. What I didn’t want to do, in all this, is mock a great man’s addiction. I love Cash and the stories of him being a drug-crazed destroyer are massively outnumbered by stories of his kindness and social conscience. It’s just that those latter stories aren’t funny. Still, I think his better side is apparent in the show. As is his amazing music. Anyway, I spent a day as Cash, in a field of synthetic snow, fighting with an ostrich puppet operated by the man who controls BB8, the droid in Star Wars. It’s not as good a story as “an ostrich got me addicted to painkillers” or even “Johnny Cash got me addicted to alcohol” – but it’s not bad.

The young Dutchman has carried this self-assurance since he began in karting and it has been part and parcel of his career in F1. With the new season about to begin, he told my colleague Donald McRae that he felt no need to overthink his craft. “I never even think of the mental side of things because I never had any issues,” he said. But his poorly judged attempt at overtaking Sebastian Vettel in China suggests perhaps now is the time for the youngster to add a more considered, cerebral approach to his undoubted raw talent. The season has not begun well for the 20-year-old Red Bull driver. He spun at the opener in Melbourne, albeit after taking damage to the rear diffuser, and then in Bahrain he crashed in qualifying. During that race an over-ambitious move on Lewis Hamilton caused the puncture that forced his retirement. Hamilton referred to him as a “dickhead” when he watched the incident immediately after the race. However, it was his move on Vettel in Shanghai that has once again brought into question his credentials as a potential title winner. On fresher, softer tyres than the German, Verstappen was on a charge and determined to make up for the error that led to his going wide earlier in trying to pass Hamilton. Vettel was circumspect and, with the big picture of the championship in mind, he gave Verstappen room up the inside but the Dutchman still clipped him, causing them both to spin. Verstappen’s hopes disappeared and Vettel, with damage, ultimately finished in eighth. Verstappen has since held his hands up and apologised to Vettel, accepting that it was a mistake. But now in his fourth season in F1, the unnecessary clash in Shagnhai is not an error that he should be making. The contrast with his team-mate Daniel Ricciardo, who scythed from sixth to victory without incident, was hugely instructive, the question is whether Verstappen has learned from it. Without doubt his self-belief and confidence in his own ability has enabled him to deliver some stunning races, Brazil in the wet in 2016 and his debut victory in Spain that year, not least. His overtaking has marked him out as a future champion. He knows the hairpin in China well, having dispatched Sergio Pérez and Marcus Ericsson there with superb moves in 2015. The pass round the outside of Nico Rosberg at Becketts at Silverstone in 2016 was breathtaking and, rightly, taking Felipe Nasr round the outside of Blanchimont at Spa in 2015 was voted overtake of the year. All of which he summed up in March before Melbourne, emphasising he was sticking to trusting his racing instinct. “I just enjoy it and drive as fast I can,” he said. “But so many people think your psychology is such a massive thing. For me, it’s not necessary.” If he wants to win titles, however, a little bit more thought and mental awareness is without doubt going to be necessary. His father Jos, who competed in more than 100 grands prix, was blunt in summing up where his son was going wrong. “The overtake on Vettel really wasn’t on,” he said. “That wasn’t possible. It was an error of judgment. In some circumstances Max just has to think more. I don’t want him to change his driving style. He passed two people at the start. He did that perfectly. That’s what we all want to see. But we don’t want to see these kinds of actions. He needs to have it under control. He needs to think.” Verstappen may not be interested in the psychological battle that is often part of racing but inherent to it is the honing of mental skills to measure risk and reward in split seconds, to see a bigger picture beyond just the next corner and, if necessary, show patience as well as verve. The Red Bull team principal, Christian Horner, has compared what Verstappen is going through to Vettel’s early career at the team, which was marked by similar errors of judgment. But Horner also believes the Dutchman is taking on board the lessons from these incidents. “I think he’d have learned a lot. He will put that to good use in the future, in the coming races,” Horner said. “His talent is extremely obvious, his bravery and racing instinct is not in doubt. Obviously he was too impatient, and he will for sure learn from that, I’ve got absolutely no doubt.” Jos has refereed to the critical attention his son is receiving as being “butchered by the press”. Which is unfair. He has attracted attention because of his talent. There is so much hope that if Verstappen fulfils expectations he will be one of the most exciting drivers in Formula One, long after Hamilton, Vettel and Fernando Alonso have departed, and it is only fair that he faces scrutiny when failing to match his own lofty ambitions."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"environment/2018/apr/19/birders-everywhere-are-playing-their-part","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-19T17:17:06Z","webTitle":"Birders everywhere are playing their part | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/apr/19/birders-everywhere-are-playing-their-part","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/apr/19/birders-everywhere-are-playing-their-part","fields":{"headline":"Birders everywhere are playing their part","bodyText":"It was encouraging to read your item on birding becoming mainstream (Shortcuts, G2, 19 April).

The National Audit Office (NAO) has warned that the UK could pay an extra £3bn more in budget contributions as well as an additional £2.9bn to the European Development Fund. Auditors have concluded that the Treasury’s estimate includes £7.2bn of receipts which will go directly to the private sector and not to the government’s accounts. The findings will anger Eurosceptic Tory MPs who have previously questioned whether the government should pay the lower estimate of £35bn. Philip Hammond, the chancellor, will be questioned about the NAO’s conclusions next Wednesday when he appears before the Treasury committee. Responding to the report, Meg Hillier, the Labour chair of the public accounts committee, said there could well be an increase in the overall costs. “Whereas the promises made by some Brexiters of the bounty that our public services would receive post-Brexit are likely to be downgraded, I fear the cost of the UK leaving the EU could increase further.”May told parliament in December that the bill would be between £35bn and £39bn, a fee jointly agreed in a meeting between the Treasury and the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier. Auditors found that the total amount that the UK would contribute to the EU annual budgets in 2019 and 2020 would be calculated on the basis of the UK’s economic outlook, which would also partly determine Britain’s share of outstanding commitments and liabilities after 2020. Britain’s exit settlement could not be defined until there was more certainty in areas such as the economy’s performance in 2019 and 2020, auditors said. Costs still to be worked out include those relating to pension liabilities, the amount British organisations will receive in EU funding after withdrawal and exchange rate fluctuations because the divorce bill will be paid in euros, according to the study. “Relatively small changes to some assumptions about future events could push the cost outside of HM Treasury’s £35bn to £39bn range,” the report says. Due to EU financial rules, the UK could have to pay up to £3bn more in budget contributions than Treasury estimates after formal withdrawal in March 2019. The UK might have to pay towards other costs, which are not in the government estimates, such as potential liabilities that could depend on future events. The UK will also pay £2.9bn to the European Development Fund for overseas aid, which is not featured in the exit settlement estimate because the fund was not established under EU treaties. Britain’s contribution to the EU pension scheme might last until 2064 unless the government decides to pay off its commitments earlier in a lump sum, which would present “risks and opportunities to the total value the UK may be liable to pay”. The NAO states: “The terms of the settlement, which mark 31 December 2020 as a key date for determining the UK’s share of liabilities, mean the EU commission could skew future decisions and impact the total value the UK will have to pay back.” Britain is seeking a transition period between officially exiting the EU in March 2019 and the end of 2020. The government is dependent on information it receives from the EU to calculate the final settlement, but can appoint auditors to review such figures, according to the NAO. The government should consider “how it will update parliament with revised estimates as new information becomes available”, it said. Sir Amyas Morse, the head of the NAO, said the £35bn-£39bn estimate was “reasonable” but could have been wider to reflect the many “moving parts”. He added: “As the vote on the draft withdrawal agreement approaches, we expect that government will provide a substantial amount of material for parliament to consider.” Nicky Morgan, the chair of the Treasury select committee, said the costs would be examined further when Hammond and Morse gave evidence on Wednesday and Tuesday respectively. She said: “[The NAO] has judged that the government’s estimate of the UK’s withdrawal payment to the EU is ‘reasonable’, but it appears to be shrouded in uncertainty. “As the report states, the Treasury didn’t incorporate some of the main uncertainties – of which it was aware – in its figure. For example, the settlement estimate doesn’t include the UK’s commitments to the European Development Fund, which the Treasury expects will cost £2.9bn after the UK leaves the EU.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"money/2018/apr/21/amazon-why-am-i-deluged-by-unwanted-parcels","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-21T06:00:07Z","webTitle":"‘Amazon, why am I deluged by unwanted parcels?’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2018/apr/21/amazon-why-am-i-deluged-by-unwanted-parcels","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2018/apr/21/amazon-why-am-i-deluged-by-unwanted-parcels","fields":{"headline":"‘Amazon, why am I deluged by unwanted parcels?’","bodyText":"When Tiffany Crow’s doorbell rings, her heart sinks and she immediately wonders: what will it be this time? A box of £25 wireless speakers, more fitness wristbands, or a further batch of projectors? What is certain is she will have to spend more time disposing of the item, as well as all the packaging. Since January, Crow has been bombarded with hundreds of parcels from Amazon, which despite her repeated pleas, have not stopped arriving at her home in Greenwich, south-east London. What started as a minor inconvenience has over the past few months turned into “a bit of a nightmare” as she has been forced to spend hours each week dealing with the unwanted packages. Can she, and others receiving unsolicited and unwanted goods keep them? The law is complex but it would appear that she is completely within her rights to keep the stuff. She has started giving the goods away, in an unexpected boon for her neighbours. However she says she’s finally had enough and contacted Guardian Money to bring an end to the torrent. She says her house has repeatedly filled up with the “crazy” amount of packaging that accompanies every delivery. And, in case you are wondering, she does not have Alexa – Amazon’s voice-activated system that has been implicated in unwanted deliveries of dolls’ houses. “It started off as a bit of weird thing, but has spiralled out of control,” says Crow, who works full time. “When the postman arrives he now has a big grin on his face as he hands over the latest parcel. “I must have had 30 wireless speakers, all worth £25 each. A similar number of fitness bracelets, globes … Well over 100 items all addressed to me. I haven’t ordered or paid for any of this stuff. They appear to come from Dumfries, and just keep on coming. “I have called Amazon more than 10 times, talking to customer services in India and the Philippines. I have sent emails, posted on social media, but no one can shed any light on why it’s happening, or better still, get them stopped.” She says the local council is very strict on recycling, meaning she has spent hours separating out the items and packaging that can’t be recycled. The final straw came when she was expecting a real Amazon delivery, and she drove to the post office depot to pick up the item, only to find it was another set of unordered projectors. “You’d think that Amazon would want to get to the bottom of it but I’ve got nowhere with them. After all someone must be paying for all this stuff. I stopped seeing the funny side many weeks ago. It’s crazy and I really resent the intrusion,” she says. She says she considered cancelling her Prime account but was reluctant to because she would lose the £79 she had paid. And as a working single mum, she needs to be able to buy online, she says. This is not the first time this has happened. In 2014, Robert Quinn, then an engineering student, received 46 items worth £3,600, including a 3D TV worth £889, tablets, a games console and even a heater. In his case they were “returns” meant for an Amazon depot but ended up at his Bromley home. A spokesman for Amazon declined to offer an explanation as to why the Crow family had been sent the parcels. All it would say was: “We have apologised to the customer and taken measures to stop the deliveries.” Money understands the company has also refunded Crow’s Prime membership worth £79 a year, and made a further goodwill gesture. Can you keep it? Unordered items are considered “unsolicited goods”, and can be kept but only if they are addressed to you and there has been no previous contact with the company relating to the item. If you have been sent items by mistake it is a different story. So if you were sent a duplicate order or additional items this is not deemed unsolicited, and the company can ask for them back. The same applies to an item sent to someone else that arrives at your house. You should to inform the company and it is up to them to do the rest. In 2103 the online retailer Zavvi sent customers games consoles worth £170, instead of the £20 games they had ordered. It threatened customers with legal action claiming the items were not unsolicited. The recipients in this case had no right to retain the consoles. It is rare for genuinely unsolicited items to be delivered. It does happen, but often it is a marketing gimmick with an item of very low value. Under the Consumer Contracts Regulations 2013 you can keep the freebie. With an item of value it is worth contacting the trader to check. Citizens Advice has a template letter pointing out that the trader can collect the item at its expense in the next 14 days “but after this time I will treat the goods as my own”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/apr/19/corrupt-met-officers-protected-family-of-stephen-lawrence-murderer","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-19T16:40:34Z","webTitle":"Corrupt Met officers 'protected family of Stephen Lawrence murderer'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/apr/19/corrupt-met-officers-protected-family-of-stephen-lawrence-murderer","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/apr/19/corrupt-met-officers-protected-family-of-stephen-lawrence-murderer","fields":{"headline":"Corrupt Met officers 'protected family of Stephen Lawrence murderer'","bodyText":"The father of David Norris, one of the men who murdered Stephen Lawrence, used a network of corrupt Metropolitan police officers to protect himself and his close relations from justice, according to claims made by his family. Victoria and Naomi Smith, who are related to the Norris family by marriage, have broken 25 years of silence to allege that Clifford Norris used corrupt officers to thwart a murder inquiry four years before Lawrence was stabbed to death in Eltham, south-east London, in 1993. Lawrence’s parents, Doreen and Neville, have long suspected that Clifford Norris and police corruption played a part in their son’s killers evading justice for almost two decades. Doreen Lawrence said if the new claims were true her “sense of outrage will have risen to new heights”. The 25th anniversary of Stephen’s murder is on Sunday, reigniting scrutiny of errors made by police in the initial investigation, and what may have caused them. The extent of Clifford Norris’s reach into the Met has long been a matter of controversy. The Smiths now allege that Norris used his influence with police after his brother, Alex, became a suspect in the 1989 shooting of Tony Smith following a pub fight. No one was ever charged, and the Smiths allege sensitive information given to police ended up being passed to Norris. The family of Tony Smith are related to Clifford Norris through his marriage to Theresa, a cousin of Tony and Victoria Smith and the mother of David Norris. Police intelligence shows detectives believed Clifford and Alex Norris had worked together in their criminal enterprises. Clifford Norris, a convicted former drug importer, denies ever having corruptly influenced police officers. A document obtained by the Guardian shows that Alex Norris was the prime suspect for the Tony Smith shooting. Smith is said to have stabbed Norris, who allegedly then shot him dead. The Smith family say that after Alex Norris became a suspect in the shooting, Clifford Norris, who lived on the south London and Kent border in Chislehurst, used his influence to intimidate witnesses. The links to the police were well known within the family, according to Tony and Victoria Smith’s mother, Naomi: “It was known as the cocaine mile: from Bermondsey to Greenwich, Clifford Norris had the old bill in his pocket in every nick.” The Smiths also say Clifford Norris used his influence with the police after Stephen Lawrence’s murder; Norris’s son David was among the men jailed in 2012 for the racist killing after 19 years of evading justice. Victoria Smith said: “If the police had done their job after my brother was killed, then [Doreen] Lawrence would not have gone through what she went through. They left Clifford Norris at large and untouched to use his influence with the police.” The Smith family say they told the Met about their corruption claims, and were not taken seriously. The new allegations point to the Norrises having a much greater reach into the Met than previously believed, or has ever been admitted by police chiefs. Doreen Lawrence told the Guardian: “I thought that after 25 years I could no longer be shocked by the conduct of the Metropolitan police. However, if it is true that they did this, my sense of outrage will have risen to new heights and I will want immediate answers from them as to why it happened and why I was not told.” Connections between Norris and the police were also suspected by a former senior investigator in HM Customs and Excise who feared corruption was blocking the agency’s efforts to look into his drug-smuggling operations. Former Met officers have also revealed longstanding concerns about Norris’s reach into the force, with one claiming it went back as far as 1978. Stephen Lawrence was attacked by at least five white youths, who were shouting racist abuse, on 22 April 1993; three of the attackers are still to be brought to justice. Clive Driscoll, the former Met DCI who in 2012 helped secure two convictions for Stephen’s murder – including that of David Norris – believes a proper re-examination of the Smith case could help investigators in the Lawrence case, which the Met has said is stalled. Driscoll told the Guardian that examining how Clifford Norris operated after the Smith killing may help investigators hoping to bring new charges in the Lawrence murder: “It is important because there are nominals [people of interest to the police] in the Tony Smith murder that are also nominals in Stephen’s murder. “It gives an insight into criminal activity in that area and how they operated, which may be relevant to both cases.“It’s always intrigued me that anyone would think that [the Norrises] would not try to influence the investigation. If they had the links already, common sense tells me they would use them.” The new corruption claims involve a police officer never previously named as having suspected links to the Norrises. The claims that Norris had officers in his pocket are also made by a former senior investigator for HM Customs and Excise, which believed Norris had a substantive reach into the Met. Furthermore, a former associate of Clifford Norris alleges he bribed officers and claims to be able to name a specific premises where payments were made. The witness says they went to the Met to offer this information but their testimony was not acted upon. Doreen Lawrence told the Guardian: “What this shows is that practically everybody seems to have known about this corrupt relationship. It appears to have been an open secret. It therefore beggars belief that those investigating corruption in the police did not know. “I don’t accept that they didn’t know, especially when it now appears that the police refused to act upon this information when it was handed to them on a plate.” The Guardian has also learned that: A detective involved in the inquiry into Tony Smith’s killing had close links to an associate of the Norris brothers. Information was passed to police after the Smith murder that a new witness was prepared to name Clifford Norris in another shooting; the next day, it is claimed, she received a death threat if she went to the police. A police intelligence report showed that Clifford Norris had “an active criminal involvement with his brother” Alex. Tony Smith’s mother, Naomi, said Clifford was known to pass information to the police and recalled a local saying in south London: “There goes Clifford, giving up bods”, a slang term meaning giving up fellow criminals to the police. Victoria Smith said in 2014 the Met was told of their claims about the Norrises and the corrupt links to police officers: “They did not seem interested. We told them everything. They did not press us on anything to do with Clifford Norris.” Alex Norris denies being present when Tony Smith, then aged 24, was shot twice at close range on 16 May 1989, in the Old Manor pub in Deptford, south London. Despite there reportedly being around 20 people in the small pub at the time, no one saw the shooting. The Smith family claim potential witnesses were intimidated.One female associate of the Norrises was so appalled by Smith’s killing that she decided she would give evidence to the police claiming that Clifford had shot her in the throat in January 1989. The woman was Christine Clapp-Smith, who had an affair with Clifford, sold drugs for him and was his sister-in-law. Two days after the pub shooting, Clapp-Smith visited the Smiths and said she would go to the police. The information was passed to Naomi Smith, who in turn told the police that they were about to get a new witness about the Norrises. The next morning, the Smith family allege Clapp-Smith was visited at her home and told at gunpoint she would be killed unless she kept silent. Alex Norris was arrested on suspicion of the murder of Tony Smith, but the case against him was dropped. He was later jailed for drug offences following an investigation by HM Customs and Excise, who operate separately to the Met. The Smith family say the conviction of David Norris for murder, 19 years after he was part of the gang that attacked Stephen, has given them the confidence to come forward. “They never got done for anything,”, said Victoria Smith, a teacher. “Dad believed if we did anything we would be at risk.” The claims about the Tony Smith case is the latest example of the alleged influence of the Norrises over the Met. The former Met deputy assistant commissioner John Grieve, who led the third investigation into the Lawrence case, said in 2006: “During the investigation I led, we feared corruption might have played a part in the failure of the first investigation.” In 2002 the Guardian reported claims of corruption in the Lawrence case from Neil Putnam, a former detective. He alleged that John Davidson, a key detective in the first investigation into Stephen’s murder, had admitted being paid by Norris. Davidson has always denied all wrongdoing. In 2006, the BBC prominently reported the allegations. It would take until 2014 for an official report ordered by Theresa May, to find there was “reason to suspect” Davidson of corruption in the Lawrence case, some 12 years after the allegations first surfaced. The potential fear the Norrises were able to exert on a murder investigation was noted by the Macpherson inquiry. Macpherson described Clifford Norris as an “evil influence” and a “malign influence”. The report said that in the Lawrence case “officers were aware of threats coming from him which were discouraging the witnesses who were so desperately sought”. Another Met officer, David Coles, was seen meeting Clifford Norris and exchanging packages, the Macpherson inquiry heard. In a 2006 interview with the Observer, Clifford Norris denied he ever had corrupt influence with police officers: “I never became involved with underhand dealings or giving money to coppers. Never did I give the police any money or a retainer to get them on the payroll. I don’t know any bent coppers.” Norris admitted, however, that he was aware of corruption between officers and other criminals in the period around Stephen’s murder. The National Crime Agency is investigating claims of corruption in the Lawrence case. After the Lawrence murder in April 1993, Clifford returned to Eltham from a self-imposed exile overseas to threaten a witness, Stacey Benefield, who was alleged to have been stabbed by David Norris with a sword, the Macpherson inquiry heard. The threats against Benefield were made three days after he had picked David Norris out of an identity parade as the person who had allegedly attacked him. Clifford and an associate even knew what room the identity parade had taken place in, according to the Macpherson report and witness statements from Benefield."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2018/apr/19/michael-cohen-drops-libel-suits-buzzfeed-fusion-gps","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-19T14:26:52Z","webTitle":"Michael Cohen drops libel suits against BuzzFeed and Fusion GPS","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/apr/19/michael-cohen-drops-libel-suits-buzzfeed-fusion-gps","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/apr/19/michael-cohen-drops-libel-suits-buzzfeed-fusion-gps","fields":{"headline":"Michael Cohen drops libel suits against BuzzFeed and Fusion GPS","bodyText":"Michael Cohen, Donald Trump’s embattled legal fixer, has dropped libel lawsuits against BuzzFeed and a political research firm over the dossier that alleged collusion between Russia and Trump’s presidential campaign. Cohen voluntarily dismissed his lawsuits against the news website and Fusion GPS on Wednesday, according to documents filed by his attorney, David Schwartz, at federal court and state supreme court in Manhattan. His decision to abandon the legal actions followed the raiding of his home and office by the FBI and the confirmation by US prosecutors that Cohen is the subject of a criminal investigation relating to his private business interests and personal finances. Cohen sued after BuzzFeed published the dossier compiled for Fusion by Christopher Steele, a former British spy, which alleged Cohen met Russian operatives in the Czech Republic in August 2016 as part of an effort by the Kremlin to assist Trump’s campaign. Cohen has repeatedly denied the allegation. The alleged trip to Prague, the Czech capital, was said by Steele’s sources to have been “a cover up and damage limitation operation”, after news reports had disclosed payments made to Trump’s campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, by pro-Kremlin authorities in Ukraine, and meetings held in Moscow by Carter Page, an adviser to the Trump campaign. Both deny any wrongdoing. Cohen’s complaint against Fusion GPS and its founder, the former investigative reporter Glenn Simpson, said that he was “collateral damage” in a hostile political operation conducted by the company. The withdrawal of Cohen’s lawsuits also followed a report by McClatchy that said Robert Mueller, the special counsel investigating links between Russia and the Trump campaign, had found evidence suggesting that Cohen did, in fact, make the trip to Prague. Cohen again denied this, claiming the report was based on “bad information”. Cohen’s team did not immediately respond to an email asking whether his decision related to the McClatchy report. “The decision to voluntarily discontinue these cases was a difficult one,” his attorney Schwartz told Politico, which first reported that the lawsuits had been dropped. “We believe the defendants defamed my client, and vindicating Mr Cohen’s rights was – and still remains – important. But given the events that have unfolded, and the time, attention and resources needed to prosecute these matters, we have dismissed the matters, despite their merits.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2018/apr/19/oil-price-hits-three-year-high-at-74-a-barell","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-19T17:37:09Z","webTitle":"Oil price hits three-year high of $74 a barrel","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/apr/19/oil-price-hits-three-year-high-at-74-a-barell","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/apr/19/oil-price-hits-three-year-high-at-74-a-barell","fields":{"headline":"Oil price hits three-year high of $74 a barrel","bodyText":"Oil has hit a new three-and-a-half-year peak, and other commodity prices – notably nickel and aluminium – moved sharply higher as Donald Trump’s sanctions and the continuing conflict in Syria fuelled fears of supply shortages. Brent crude rose 1.7% to $74.74 (£52.67) a barrel on Thursday, the highest level since November 2014 when oil group Opec began increasing production to protect its market share, a move that subsequently led to a supply glut and a price slump to $27 a barrel just over a year later. More recently Opec had agreed with Russia, another major supplier, to cap output and protect prices, even though growing production from US shale companies threatened to undermine this strategy. However a surprise drop in US oil inventories this week, along with concerns about Middle Eastern supply following the military strikes on Syria by the US, the UK and France, have kept crude prices buoyant. Meanwhile, ahead of an Opec meeting on Friday, Reuters reported that Saudi Arabia wanted to see prices as high as $100 a barrel. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, said: “Friday sees a host of energy ministers from some of the most influential oil producing nations meet in the Saudi city of Jeddah, heightening anticipation of what could be yet another production freeze/cut extension in the offing.” Lee Wild, head of equity strategy at Interactive Investor, said: “Despite the influence of US shale, Saudi Arabia still calls the shots on global oil markets, and it’s increasingly obvious the Saudis are comfortable with oil at $80 or more. Add a drop in weekly US oil reserves to the mix and the only way for crude prices is up. Saudi bullishness should be no surprise given it must somehow bankroll Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s expensive reforms and modernisation at home.” There is also the prospect that the US might reinstate sanctions next month on Iran, the third largest producer in Opec, over its nuclear programme. Even if Iran escapes renewed sanctions, Trump’s moves to impose tariffs on steel and aluminium and on 1,300 Chinese products – prompting fears of a global trade war – and his actions against Russian metal companies have already had a major effect on other commodity prices. Earlier this month the US imposed sanctions on a number of Russian oligarchs and companies, including aluminium-producer Rusal, and there are suggestions that these could be broadened to include key Russian nickel supplier Nornickel. The company is linked to both Rusal and the oligarch who controls it, Oleg Deripaska. UBS analyst Lachlan Shaw told Reuters: “A logical extension would be if you were to broaden sanctions, then Norilsk would fall under that remit.” Nickel – used to make stainless steel and is a key component in rechargeable batteries used in mobile phones and electric cars – surged as much as 9.3% to $16,690 a tonne on Thursday, the highest since December, 2014. That followed a 7.5% rise on Wednesday. Aluminium rose 5% on Thursday, making a 32% rise this month. But Julius Baer analyst Carsten Menke said the recent moves in metals like nickel could be due to speculation rather than fundamental issues. He told Reuters: “If any commodity moves more than 10% in two days, it’s either a severe disruption to supplies, which we don’t have in this case, or it’s speculators. In the case of nickel it’s the latter, the rally is absolutely overdone.” The Trump tariffs on steel and aluminium have already prompted complaints to the World Trade Organisation from the European Union, India and China, and on Thursday they were joined by Russia. The complaint argues that the tariffs are aimed at protecting US domestic producers from surging imports rather than – as the US argues – for national security reasons. A number of countries, including Canada, Mexico, South Korea and Australia – as well as the EU, have won temporary exemptions from application of the tariffs, pending talks with the US."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/apr/19/the-fiver-big-sam-rides-again-regardless-of-how-low-opinions-might-have-plunged","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-19T15:52:20Z","webTitle":"The Fiver | Big Sam rides again regardless of how low opinions might have plunged","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/apr/19/the-fiver-big-sam-rides-again-regardless-of-how-low-opinions-might-have-plunged","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/apr/19/the-fiver-big-sam-rides-again-regardless-of-how-low-opinions-might-have-plunged","fields":{"headline":"Big Sam rides again regardless of how low opinions might have plunged","bodyText":"SPINAL PRAT The Fiver has always felt a certain kinship with Big Sam. For starters nothing is ever our fault, not even the holes our boss punches in his desk every time a carefully-scrawled teatimely newsletter lands in his inbox for consideration. For seconds, we might cut a hangdog and browbeaten figure but our bulletproof sense of self-worth means that, going on two decades after our top-flight career began, we’re still here merrily revisiting the same old tropes whether anyone else likes it or not. In fact we’d probably award ourselves 11 out of 10 for survivability, which is further proof that Everton’s supremo is bound to us by happy conjunction of the stars. “I’d give myself an 11,” was Sam’s retort to the appalling news that people might actually be asked what they thought of him. On the braggadocio scale it slides comfortably beneath: “I wouldn’t say I was the best manager in the business, but I was in the top one.” And, if we are being kind, nudges just ahead of: “That was me on a seven”. Allardici plays to bigger galleries than David Brent, after all, and has never had to resort to riding a fluffy emu to attract attention. The problem he has is that most Everton fans would probably be quite happy for him to ride out of town on one. They’d put him on a three or a four; the torpor at Goodison Park might, if we are being fair, be chiefly attributable to a lack of cohesion and foresight above him but it hardly lets the standard of football at the School of Science off scot-free and the chance to dish out a few ticks in the right boxes in a special club survey was not one that supporters were about to pass up. Except it was all an accident, naturally, and Big Sam rides again regardless of how low opinions might have plunged. See more parallels with the Fiver; see some in politics if you want, that’s up to you. This little episode appears to have been tied up in a bow with an apology from Bill Kenwright, who would struggle to create a West End hit out of his club’s distinctly average story from the past few years but rode to the rescue of his bristling manager in short order. “If that happened, I’d be more than disappointed,” Sam said of the prospect that this summer might, after all, bring notice that his services are no longer required. If only there was a way to find out whether that might be a good idea; just don’t tell any of the Fiver’s overlords if you discover one.

Andrew Gwynne, who is also the shadow communities secretary, said there was a danger that the young voters who backed in Labour at the general election would stay at home. “That’s why we’ve been trying to make the case that local councils have a big impact on young people’s lives,” he said. “It is so important for young people not to leave local elections just to the over-55s.” In an interview during which he also suggested that Ken Livingstone should be kicked out of the party , Gwynne said that “odd things can happen” in local elections and that they were a chance to send powerful messages to the national parties. Labour is expected to perform strongly on 3 May, particularly in Tory “crown jewel” London seats such as Westminster and Wandsworth. It faces tougher contests elsewhere in the capital, such as in Barnet, which has a large Jewish vote, and in the north-west in Trafford, which is currently a speck of Tory blue in a sea of red. Gwynne said the polls had been “incredibly unhelpful” to Labour because they raised expectations when the last time the councils had been up for election four years ago the result was generally regarded as a high-water mark for the party. “We are cautious, we think there will be a good set of local elections for us, but some of the swings required go beyond even the huge swings we saw at the last general election,” he said. He made it clear that Labour would not reverse the much-criticised cuts to local government funding, but said that money would be committed to areas such as children’s services and adult social care, while the party has embarked on its own review of local government finance. Gwynne, who represented the Labour leadership in the Commons during the debate on antisemitism earlier this week, acknowledged that the party had been far too slow to recognise the problem within its own ranks. He said Labour had a responsibility “not just to call it out, but to root it out” and that outstanding cases could be resolved by the new in-house legal team and disciplinary panel within weeks. “That should have been done long before,” he said. “We’ve got to get our act together and I’m sure that is happening now. It’s going to take time to rebuild confidence in the Jewish community, I accept that.” Asked whether Livingstone, who suggested that Hitler was a Zionist, should be expelled from the party as a symbolic gesture to show it had got to grips with the issue, he said: “It’s a matter for the disciplinary panel, but I don’t think there’s any place in the Labour party for antisemitism. End of.” Pressed over whether he believed that the former London mayor was an antisemite, he described his remarks as “abhorrent and reprehensible”: “Certainly, the views that led to his suspension I would consider to be antisemitic.” Gwynne’s comments came as Labour published an analysis showing that Tory cuts to local government are hitting Labour areas, the north of England and the most deprived councils hardest. Local authorities’ spending power per household is on course to fall by an average of 23% between 2010/11 and 2019/20, the research showed, but Labour councils will see a fall of 28 per cent average, compared with 20% for the Tories. Gwynne said that Labour councils were less able to rely on council tax and business rates to plug the gap."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"fashion/2018/may/04/jess-cartner-morley-midi-skirts-asymmetric","type":"article","sectionId":"fashion","sectionName":"Fashion","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-04T11:59:22Z","webTitle":"What I wore this week: an asymmetric skirt","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2018/may/04/jess-cartner-morley-midi-skirts-asymmetric","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/fashion/2018/may/04/jess-cartner-morley-midi-skirts-asymmetric","fields":{"headline":"What I wore this week: an asymmetric skirt","bodyText":"I hope below-the-knee skirts stay in fashion for ever. It won’t happen, but I can dream. I love these skirts with a passion, because they make life easier. A below-the-knee hemline minimises the need for depilation and tanning-related leg admin, saving precious time, money and headspace. Also – and it is hard to overstate the importance of this – a longer skirt hemline works with flat shoes. If you are wearing a knee-length skirt, changing from a high-heeled sandal to a flat loafer can take you from Carine Roitfeld to Mrs Doubtfire with alarming speed, but a shoe change is a breeze in a longer skirt. I’m going to assume that you have mastered the midi-length skirt by now. The default skirt length has been well below the knee for a good three years now, so there is no excuse for not having grasped that this once frumpy look is the height of chic. Fashion years are a bit like dog years, so this is a reign of Ming dynasty longevity. Anyway, the point is that it’s no longer enough to be, like, I’m wearing a long skirt, check out how on-trend I am, job done. Just getting the length right isn’t impressing anyone in summer 2018. You need to add some detail. Let me take a wild guess about the midi skirt you already have in your wardrobe. Does it have pleats? Knew it! The pleated skirt has long been the thinking fashionista’s go-to midi. A long, full skirt without pleats can look a little bit too self-consciously ultra-feminine in a 1950s throwback kind of a way. Pleats are slightly nerdy, slightly bookish, and take a skirt from Christian Dior’s flower women to Miuccia Prada’s gallery curators, in a good way. But your next midi skirt doesn’t need pleats. What it needs, in order to be truly fashionable, is to be asymmetric in some way. It could be buckled at one hip, like a kilt. It could be tied at one side with the hem falling in a diagonal line, like a sarong. It could be a simple A-line up top with a hemline falling at jagged angles. (There are some great floral ones in Zara) Or it could be swagged and gathered to one side, like this one from Cos, which I have fallen in love with. An off-centre skirt may look challenging on the hanger, but it is, in fact, easier to wear than a simply cut one, because of the way it handily draws the eye away from the waistband and tummy area. And because you have Fashion Content (technical term for Stuff To Look At) on your bottom half, you can go with a plain T-shirt or white shirt and sweater. No need for stripes, or frills, or any other jazz hands. This skirt has got your back . • Jess wears skirt, £69, cosstores.com. Poloneck, £60, frenchconnection.com. Heels, £55, marksandspencer.com.

Two women, in all likelihood repeatedly raped by their father as children, are humiliated, dehumanised and ultimately disbelieved in proceedings in which they did not stand a chance. Thousands of people every year are convicted of crimes by magistrates whose qualification for dispensing justice is filling out a form, passing an interview, doing some charity work and being willing to sit for 13 days a year, with 18 hours’ worth of training. A man whose innocence should have been easily established in court is convicted of sexual assault because relevant evidence was not disclosed by the police. And meanwhile hundreds of hardworking, dedicated professionals are toiling in near impossible conditions. This is a portrait of the criminal justice system in England and Wales today, as seen by the Secret Barrister, a criminal advocate who keeps his identity a closely guarded secret so that, he argues, he can be unrestrained in his critique. And unrestrained it is. The book is in part a guide to the system – a reminder of how few of us understand it – and in part a first-hand account of the personal dilemmas facing someone whose professional life is spent in and out of crown courts, police cells and prisons. It is above all a plea to rescue a justice system that has become utterly broken. “Hell” is the word used by one supreme court judge. “Despair” is the experience of another in the court of appeal. Over the last near decade of austerity, justice has endured the deepest cuts of any departmental spending in the UK. Whole areas of law, including family, housing, immigration, debt and employment, have been taken outside the realm of publicly funded legal representation, leaving some of the most vulnerable people at the mercy of a system that is designed to be incomprehensible to even the most highly educated lay person. Since 2010, 258 courts have shut across England and Wales. Rape trials have collapsed because police and prosecutors – all victims of the same, sabotaging cuts – have failed to disclose key evidence on which a fair and robust defence depended. Some of this will come as no surprise. As a former criminal barrister myself, I expected this book to communicate how little we value the people and institutions so vital to our liberty. But what’s so powerful about The Secret Barrister is its ability to connect the dots – from changes to something as seemingly mundane as criminal procedure rules, to the state of prisons – revealing a picture that is more a commentary on society as a whole than it is on robing rooms full of horsehair wigs. In one of its most effective passages, the author points to platitudes about putting victims first, now such a staple of government rhetoric, contrasting them with the actual preference of political leaders, which is to offer taxpayers one penny off the price of beer rather than invest the equivalent amount into a system without which rights can never be properly upheld. How did we let this happen? The author argues that the lack of legal education in the UK has led a distressing number of people to believe that the work of a barrister involves “strutting around a courtroom barking ‘Objection’ while spinning deliberate lies to a jury as a judge in a full-bottomed wig twirls his gavel”. (None of these things happen in the courts of England and Wales.) But political bad faith is also part of the answer. For instance, the claim in 2010 of justice minister Jonathan Djanogly that our legal aid system is “the most generous in the world” – I remember his words well, as I was the Guardian legal affairs correspondent at the time. It sounded wrong to me then, but is now, as this book makes clear, “demonstrably, palpably false”. The Secret Barrister writes compellingly about issues as varied as the treatment of vulnerable victims in rape trials and the state of sentencing law – no mean feat. His style is a blend of pomposity and self-deprecation that is remarkably evocative of many characters at the bar. In seeking new allies, he tends unashamedly to appeal to the middle-class, school run mother or the junior doctor – the subtext being “it’s not only those poor black people who can get caught up in this stuff”. On the question of ethnicity – the hugely disproportionate appearance made by people of colour in the system, and the historical failure of the bar itself to recruit and nurture ethnic minority talent – the book is largely silent. But at its deepest level, it is not about the criminal justice system at all. The Secret Barrister writes about our idea of ourselves as a nation, an England still so confident in its principles and workings of democracy and justice. When in practice it is now less of a model for others to aspire to than a dire warning as to what can go wrong. • The Secret Barrister: Stories of the Law and How It’s Broken is published by Macmillan.

The struggle for a healthy planet may sometimes feel like a series of defeats, but this year’s Goldman environmental prize celebrates six remarkable success stories, five of them driven by women. From an anti-nuclear court ruling against former South African president Jacob Zuma and Russian leader Vladimir Putin to a campaign that nudged the Vietnamese government from coal to renewable energy, the winners – unveiled on Earth day yesterday – are all grassroots activists who have taken on powerful vested interests. In Latin America, the winner is Francia Márquez, an Afro-Colombian community leader who led a 10-day, 350-mile march of 80 women from the Amazon to Bogotá that prompted the government to send troops to remove illegal miners who were polluting rivers with cyanide and mercury. Like many previous winners, she faces immense risks. The dangers of environmental activism have been evident in the murder of two Goldman-prize recipients in the past two years. The 2015 winner Berta Cáceres – a Honduran indigenous rights and anti-dam campaigner, was killed less than a year after collecting the award. Ten months later, a 2005 winner – Mexican activist Isidro Baldenegro López – was gunned down in the Sierra Madre mountain range. Earlier this month, one of last year’s winners, Rodrigue Katembo – a park ranger in the Virunga sanctuary for mountain gorillas – lost six of his colleagues in a massacre by militia groups. Márquez said insecurity is also a fact of life in her campaign. “We constantly receive death threats from militias, leaders, organisations and communities. Protecting the environment and land will always result in dispute between those who want the territory to live and those who want it to fill their pockets with money,” she told the Guardian. “This award is a recognition of the collective struggle of all peoples in the world who care for the environment ... and all the leaders who have been killed for the cause of caring for our common home.” A law student and a single mother of two, the 35-year-old has been an environment and community activist since she joined a campaign against a hydroelectric dam at the age of 13. The increasingly prominent role of women in environmental activism has been recognised by this year’s prizes. Since 1990, six awards – one for each habitable continent – have been announced by the Goldman prize foundation, which was set up by an member of the Levi Strauss family who made a fortune in the insurance business. This is the first time that five of the six are women. The winners include South African anti-nuclear activists Makoma Lekalakala and Liz McDaid, Vietnamese clean-energy advocate Nguy Thi Khanh, US clean-water defender LeeAnne Walters, and French marine-life champion Claire Nouvian. The one male winner is Philippine anti-lead campaigner Manny Calonzo. Márquez says she will use the award to promote a new mode of economics and politics based on life-giving “maternal love” rather than “dead” extractivism. “The first thing we need is to be more aware of the historical moment in which we find ourselves: the planet is being destroyed, it’s that simple, and if we do nothing to avoid it we will we will be part of that destruction,” she said. “Our time has come, we must act, we have a responsibility to future generations to leave a better world, in which taking care of life is more important than producing cumulative wealth.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/apr/19/uk-france-germany-joint-statement-urge-us-trump-not-scrap-iran-deal","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-19T16:51:09Z","webTitle":"Don't scrap Iran deal, MPs from UK, France and Germany urge US","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/19/uk-france-germany-joint-statement-urge-us-trump-not-scrap-iran-deal","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/apr/19/uk-france-germany-joint-statement-urge-us-trump-not-scrap-iran-deal","fields":{"headline":"Don't scrap Iran deal, MPs from UK, France and Germany urge US","bodyText":"More than 500 parliamentarians from France, Germany and the UK have written to their US counterparts urging them to persuade Donald Trump not to abandon the Iran nuclear deal. In a joint statement published in the Guardian, Der Spiegel, the New York Times and Le Monde, they urged a White House rethink before the 12 May deadline set by Trump to pull out of the deal, known as the joint comprehensive plan of action (JCPOA), unless Europe can come up with a new policy that will meet his concerns. “The US government threatens to abandon the JCPOA, although Iran fulfils its obligations under the agreement,” the letter said. They warn that “an exit from the US would have fatal consequences”. France, Germany and the UK negotiated the landmark deal in 2015 that lifted sanctions on Iran in exchange for strict limits on its nuclear programme, and are using all their leverage to try to persuade Trump that the deal is salvageable. “The short-term impact of this move would put an end to Iran’s nuclear programme controls, which could provide a new source of devastating conflict in the Middle East and beyond,” it said. But it said even more serious were the long-term risks: damage to the credibility of the signatories as partners in international negotiations and more generally to diplomacy as a tool to secure lasting peace and security. “Leaving the agreement would diminish the value of all the promises and threats our countries make,” the parliamentarians said. They added that if the deal broke down it would be nigh on impossible to assemble another grand coalition built around sanctions against Iran. Trump is concerned by an Iranian ballistic missile programme, the speed with which Iran could obtain a nuclear capability at the end of the 10-year deal and more broadly Iran’s interventionist stance around the Middle East – notably in Yemen, Lebanon and Syria. The campaign was organised by the German Green MP Omid Nouripour, the French MP Delphine O of Emmanuel Macron’s En Marche! movement, and the British Conservative MP Richard Bacon. Prominent signatories from Germany include the Green party leader, Annalena Baerbock, the leftwing politician Gregor Gysi, the FDP parliamentary group vice-president, Alexander Graf Lambsdorff, and the Bundestag vice-presidents Thomas Oppermann (SPD) and Claudia Roth (Green). There were no signatories from the CDU. In an attempt to mollify the White House, the governments in Berlin, Paris and London have been pushing for sanctions against Iran to be stepped up rather than for the cancelling of the deal. And the letter’s signatories criticised Tehran’s “aggressive policies” at home and abroad. “As much we share the concerns expressed by many about Iran’s behaviour,” the parliamentarians said, “we are deeply convinced that these issues must be treated separately … and not within the context of the JCPOA.” Intensive contacts on a near-daily basis are under way between British and French diplomats who are seeking to come up with a formula, ideally ahead of a meeting next week between Macron and Trump in the White House. The diplomats are looking to see whether the current inspection system agreed under the deal could be extended to military sites, laboratories and universities. France is trying to lower expectations for the Macron meeting, saying there was a large ceremonial element to the state visit, but the French were looking at a possible joint EU-US statement reinterpreting aspects of the deal without tearing it up. EU diplomats were not able to agree a new round of sanctions against Iran at their meeting on Monday, partly due to Italian objections that the sanctions might damage Russia. Delphine O, a French politician and expert on Iran, said: “We hope that as fellow parliamentarians the US Congress will listen to us. We are stressing that issues outside the JCPOA, such as the Iran missile program or behaviour in Yemen must be handled separately. There is complete unity on this in Europe.” She added it was possible a delegation of European parliamentarians will travel to Washington to reinforce the message. If Trump was not to renew the waiver on Iran, she pointed out, it will be for Congress the decide what sanctions should be imposed."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"games/2018/apr/26/dan-hett-indie-games-designer-manchester-arena-bombing","type":"article","sectionId":"games","sectionName":"Games","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-26T14:18:06Z","webTitle":"Games console: Dan Hett, the indie game designer pouring his grief into interactive art","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2018/apr/26/dan-hett-indie-games-designer-manchester-arena-bombing","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/games/2018/apr/26/dan-hett-indie-games-designer-manchester-arena-bombing","fields":{"headline":"Games console: Dan Hett, the indie game designer pouring his grief into interactive art","bodyText":"Scrolling through Twitter on his phone before going to sleep on 22 May 2017, Dan Hett saw a few vague mentions of an accident of some sort in Manchester: “no details, no actual news, just busybodies speculating.” He rubbed his eyes, removed his glasses and lay down without thinking about it any further. It wasn’t until he picked up his phone the following morning and saw hundreds of notifications that he realised something real had happened, that there had been an explosion, and that his brother Martyn was missing. “The messages, the ones you read … they were right, and you went to sleep,” said a voice in his head. “You went to fucking sleep.” Hett describes this and his other experiences in the days following the Manchester Arena bombing in harrowing detail in his autobiographical hypertext game c ya laterrrr, which was released in December 2017. Written in the second-person, the game puts you in Hett’s shoes, combining detailed descriptions of what was going on in his head as escalating panic gave way to fear and anger, with small decisions for the player to make about how to behave. Do you call your mum or your dad? Do you press the police for more information or sit in numb silence? Do you wait for news at the emergency zone, packed with other exhausted, terrified families, or go home and wait there? C ya laterrrr is the first in a series of experimental games that explore Hett’s grief – named after the last message that he ever received from Martyn. For Hett, a digital artist and programmer whose previous work making children’s games at the BBC won a Bafta, games were a “natural and obvious” way to talk about what happened to his brother and his family. “Ultimately, everyone has different ways of dealing with grief and trauma, and this is mine. If I were a painter or poet or something, then it would be wholly reasonable for my painting or poetry to take on a different tone based on this kind of massive life experience. Unfortunately I’m neither a painter or a poet, but I certainly do design video games, and here I am.” Hett feels that video games are particularly suited to narratives of grief. “Although my work spans all sorts of media, games in particular grant the ability to create a particular sort of abstracted narrative,” he explains. He values games for their ability “to examine the what-ifs and the unseen parts of an experience”. Much of c ya laterrrr’s intimacy comes from its interactivity. Composing the tweet that was seen by hundreds of thousands of people in the hours before Martyn was identified as one of the 23 fatalities at the arena (“my brother @martynhett was at the #manchester arena last night and hasn’t checked in. if anyone has seen him in any way *please* contact me”), you are given a choice: do you choose the most recent picture of Martyn or the happiest? Each path gives a different glimpse into Hett’s relationship with his brother. Pick the most recent: “The photo is blurry and framed weirdly, taken on a train. They’re drinking wine and grinning. Just another day in the life.” Pick the happiest: “He probably photoshopped it himself, the vain wanker. You smile thinking about it. Absolutely ridiculous.” Later, at the emergency zone, Hett’s inner monologue marvels at the sheer Englishness of his responses to his family: “Never mind me, how are you?” Mundane conversations and duties are rendered farcical by the weight of what has happened. The dreadful moment when an officer explains that the scene is now “one of recovery”, and the moment shortly afterwards when another officer informs Martyn’s family they found his ID in the pocket of one of the bodies pulled from the scene, are rendered more potent by the player’s foreknowledge of what happened. C ya laterrr incorporates not only Hett’s lived experience but also the what-ifs and regrets that have run through his mind ever since. “It was this narrative flexibility that drew me to the [video game] medium for this project,” he says. “All the identifying information is stripped out (names, locations), and I don’t denote which of the pathways are based on reality and which aren’t. Ultimately the game always takes you to the same end point, and although there is one path through it that completely reflects my actual experience, other players will all take different routes based on their own decisions. It’s been played something like 12,000-plus times, and I do wonder how many of those plays took my path.” Hett chose interactive fiction as a form because of its immediacy: “it felt natural to just write, without having to interrupt myself to make artwork or write code or any of the things you need to do to make a normal video game,” he says. “Some of the most meaningful games experiences I’ve had over the last few years have been hypertext games or similar. I’m hugely influenced by creators like [radical game designer] Anna Anthropy. There’s a directness to interactive fiction, a laser-focus on the words and no distractions: I wanted anyone to be able to sit down and experience this piece of work, without having to learn how to work it.” His second game about Martyn’s death, The Loss Levels, was exhibited this month at the Now Play This festival at Somerset House in London. It takes just three or four minutes to play, and the heaviness of the subject matter is juxtaposed with its cheerful colours and 8-bit simplicity. Here, events written about in great detail in c ya laterrrr are condensed into 10-second play vignettes and stark commands: driving to the emergency zone in the back of a police car; tapping furiously on a keyboard to keep up with the search on social media; walking through the arena, weeks after the attack, to find the red rose and small candle placed there to mark the spot where Martyn was recovered. (“This is where it happened. Roses mark the dead. Find his.”) It looks and plays like a normal arcade game – quick, colourful, simplistic, frictionless – but, of course, it is anything but. Its bewildering speed and fuzzy visual effects give it the quality of something half-remembered and uncomfortable. Video games were not a passion that Hett shared with his brother. But he vividly recalls them playing together when they were young. “As adults, we could not have been more different – as far as I know he didn’t play any video games. As kids it was different though. We played for hours on the Snes – I have a really vivid memory of the first time we got to the end of Super Metroid together, screaming and shouting as we escaped after slaying Mother Brain. We were big Zelda fans too, we used to copy my stepdad’s save file on Link’s Awakening on the Game Boy once he’d solved the dungeons. Martyn used to sound confused about my work, and I suppose that’s not much different to my confusion over most aspects of his usually insane life. The thing that bound us as adults is that he definitely forged his own path through things, and in that regard we’re more similar than not.” Hett hopes to release the third game in the series in the next few months. Entitled Sorry to Bother You, it focuses on press intrusion, and how the Manchester bombing was viewed through the prism of technology. (He and his family have spoken at length about press intrusion, and the media’s behaviour in the wake of the bombing is now the subject of an inquiry.) A graphical game focused on Hett’s hands and a phone, it will inundate players with social media messages, some of which are thinly veiled requests from journalists that must be filtered out. All the journalists’ messages in the game are real, and Hett hopes it will expose some of what families of victims are forced to deal with. These three small autobiographical games, c ya laterrr, The Loss Levels and Sorry to Bother You, will be followed by a more technically ambitious one, Closed Hands – a fiction game that “examines the dozens of human stories that are suddenly entwined during a major attack”. It will be part-funded by the Arts Council, and Hett hopes to make up the rest with crowdfunding. “Using games to start exploring this experience has been really valuable to me,” he says. “Particularly in the case of c ya laterrrr, where I was writing lots and lots of notes and thoughts down within a few days of everything happening. I just felt this insane desire to capture all these details right away before they were pushed out of my brain by something else. I found writing to be really centering and in some ways quite cathartic. Turning these masses of notes into an interactive was only a small step after that really.” Visit Dan Hett’s Patreon to help crowdfund his games. Play c ya laterrrr.

They weave a lexicon of feelgood terms – “fresh”, “handmade”, “artisan”, “local”, “farmhouse”, “healthy”, “natural” – into their marketing messages, which just happens to encourage us to assume that two and two makes five, or even six or seven. It’s known as the halo effect: by highlighting one appealing selling point you erect a canopy of goodness around the entirety of the product, irrespective of whether it is merited. Challenging such terms is tough. Regulations covering them are sketchy and open to legal argument on a case-by-case basis, which makes the Real Bread Campaign’s latest victory against the Pret a Manger chain all the more impressive. Most people believed Pret a Manger when it trumpeted that it shunned “the obscure chemicals, additives and preservatives common to so much of the ‘prepared’ and ‘fast’ food on the market today”. But in fact some of its breads contain artificial additives commonly used in industrial bakeries, such as E472e (diacetyl tartaric acid esters of mono- and diglycerides) and E471 (mono- and diglycerides of fatty acids), that most certainly don’t fit snugly with any commonsense definition of that term. The Real Bread Campaign called Pret out by complaining to the Advertising Standards Authority, and won. The ASA rejected the chain’s defence that this statement should be read by consumers as more of an aspiration, “an ideal state, or their ultimate goal”, not a hard guarantee. It told Pret to ensure its ads did not imply food was “natural” unless its products and ingredients were in line with consumer expectations of that term. This successful complaint from the Real Bread Campaign reinforces the crucial distinction between small, independent bakeries that genuinely make all-natural bread using traditional ingredients and methods, and industrial imposters. It also constitutes a highly effective citizen-organised act of resistance against Big Food’s appropriation of the language of small-scale food production. But is it really such a big deal if retailers are less than candid about a few E-numbers? In the modern food system, where supermarkets now routinely and legally market products from nonexistent “fake farms”, it has been tempting to dismiss any attempt to restore authenticity to nebulous terms such as “natural” as futile or irrelevant. Yet an informed appreciation of the nitty-gritty composition of our food is surely a requisite of exerting some personal sovereignty over what we eat? While every food additive has been approved by regulators for use in specified “safe” quantities, no systematic research has been done into any cocktail effect that might cumulatively harm our health. Since the 1960s, the population has played laboratory rat in an agro-chemical food experiment involving the regular consumption of unprecedented combinations of hi-tech ingredients and additives. Such products now form the basis of lots of people’s diets. Others prefer to stick with tried and tested “natural” foods made by traditional methods because they quite legitimately interpret the presence of multiple additives in products as signifiers of debased factory food, mainly used for purposes of fakery: adding volume, ensuring “machinability”, extending shelf life, disguising off-flavours, adding phoney colour to compensate for the loss of natural ones, and more. That is their prerogative, just as it is their absolute right to be alerted to the presence of additives in any products they might buy. Proponents of our industrial food system slur defenders of traditional food standards and practices as luddites, hopeless romantics, scientifically incompetent scaremongers railing against technological progress. They would love to tie us up in a never-ending philosophical debate about what “natural” means. The Food Safety Authority of Ireland has made the best stab at a definition: “The ingredients are formed by nature and are not significantly interfered with by man.” But even then, the question of what constitutes “significant interference” is thorny. So-called natural flavourings are approved under current regulations yet the physical, enzymatic and microbiological processes used to make them would scarcely fit most people’s understanding of “natural”. We live in a world where big food manufacturers and retailers constantly use our food vocabulary to fit their own agenda. The word “natural” is in the frontline of our battle to reclaim it. • Joanna Blythman is a food writer, investigative journalist and broadcaster.

Everything was there, just as I remembered it – the Halloween scene, the trail of Skittles, Drew Barrymore’s “Is he a pig? He sure eats like one” – but while I was prepared for the film to make me nostalgic, I didn’t anticipate this: that it would unleash a surge of love for America. It is a strange thing to live in a country for which one has no native affection – or rather, for which one’s affection has been dismantled over the years by the creeping understanding that it is founded on bogus mythology. The American dream is rigged and rooted in rightwing ideology; modern America’s origin story underplays or overlooks slavery; all roads, in the current mindset, lead to Trump. You might think the exceptionalism of New York could survive this, that for those living in the city, some of the old romance of the American self-image might persist. And perhaps for liberal Americans, it does – after all, post-Brexit, I don’t “hate Britain”. For outsiders, however, the US is a tough place to love at the moment, and I find myself frequently saying I can’t stand it. Of course ET, or rather Steven Spielberg at his height, is just the vehicle for getting around this. I was six years old when the film came out, and it set up the quaint and now very unfashionable delusion that America is a place where you leave the house on a pushbike and at some point break free of gravity to fly across the moon. I thought of other American things that I love: big fridges, free refills, the expectation that things that are broken might one day be fixed, not having to preface every request with a sheepish apology. In the final 10 minutes, as John Williams’ score soared, I found myself welling up. (It had been a long week.) Kneejerk anti-Americanism is as tiresome as flag-waving, but there is still a sense that only a sucker would fall for all this. And yet the American style can be hard to resist. If British self-esteem is based on the power of understatement and the American ego is full of hot air, Trump’s presence at the helm cannot obliterate America’s material vastness: this country is a place where the optimism is brighter, the pessimism more violent, where weather systems in every sense are more extreme than elsewhere and transcend the smallness of the man in the White House. It was the camerawork in ET that got me in the end – the way Spielberg inhabits the kids’ mental space by shooting so much of it from waist height, making those in charge seem like clumsy behemoths with no idea of what’s going on at ground level. And while the impulse of Elliott and his siblings to protect the alien in their midst now looks innocent to the point of obscenity, as a fairytale it’s still there, tugging at one’s imagination. • Emma Brockes is a Guardian columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2018/apr/19/why-homeland-deserves-to-go-out-on-top","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-19T12:27:18Z","webTitle":"Why Homeland deserves to go out on top","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/apr/19/why-homeland-deserves-to-go-out-on-top","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2018/apr/19/why-homeland-deserves-to-go-out-on-top","fields":{"headline":"Why Homeland deserves to go out on top","bodyText":"The rumours have been circling for a while, but it now seems that a final decision has been made. Claire Danes this week confirmed that Homeland’s eighth season would be its last. For many, this announcement will be greeted with nothing more than the Alan Partridge shrug gif. After all, everyone knows that watching Homeland stopped being a thing with the exit of Nicholas Brody, played by Damian Lewis, dangling 100ft in the air from a crane. Some even stopped watching at the end of season one, apparently appalled at Brody’s failure to assassinate the president and his cabinet when he had both proximity and a perfectly good suicide vest on his side. Homeland, the story runs, is old news. I submit that this is fake news. The truth is, a few wobbles aside, Homeland has maintained a high standard throughout its run. It is true that the chemistry between Danes’ brilliant but erratic Carrie Mathison and Lewis’s damaged beyond repair Brody was spectacular. It’s also true that very few shows could survive the exit of such a compelling figure as Brody. In Homeland’s case, though, Brody leaving was the making of it, forcing it to be recalibrated as an intense, thrill-a-minute roller coaster ride. It also retained an almost spooky relevance. Indeed, Homeland’s ability to mirror current world events is unrivalled in TV. Right from the start, events such as the mysterious circumstances of Bowe Bergdahl’s captivity were described by CNN as being “straight out of a Homeland episode” and the media delighted in pointing out similarities between his case and Brody’s. In season five, an attack on a European capital chillingly echoed the Paris attacks that took place that very same month. Then, in season six, an embattled president-elect at war with the National Security establishment offered an eerie parallel with President Trump’s woes. For a show that frequently took liberties with plausibility, it had an uncanny knack of looking like the real world. This was no accident. The show’s consultant, John MacGaffin, is a former CIA station chief. Each year before production begins, he brings together the Homeland writing team, along with Claire Danes and her fellow star Mandy Patinkin, and they conference together with intelligence professionals to get a sense of what their concerns are and what may be the big topics in the coming year. It’s due diligence such as this that has kept the show meaningful. Homeland began in the middle of Obama’s first term, in a world that now seems like a different century. Back then, the idea of a White House with a reality-TV star incumbent would have been laughed out of even the most outlandish writers’ meeting (and Homeland has had a few of those). That the show has managed to predict so much of the changes ahead of time is testament to its research and its purpose beyond the magical Carrie and Brody relationship. Homeland never needed a doomed romance to justify our love. Although it is still one of the better dramas on TV, I can accept that the cracks are starting to show. The generally strong current season has been hampered by an all-too-familiar subplot involving Carrie going off her meds and off the rails. Storylines repeat themselves first as tragedy, then as farce, and even though Danes is an actor gifted enough to sell anything, it’s hard to escape the sense that the show might be running out of ideas. Similarly, there are only so many times her lovers can die in horrible circumstances before it starts losing emotional impact. She is now statistically a more dangerous girlfriend than Downton Abbey’s Lady Mary, and when you’re in that company, self-parody is never far away. So the timing is right. I don’t ever want Homeland to be that washed-up pug, convinced that they’ve got one last fight left in them. . And as berserk and implausible as it often was, it will still go out feeling more realistic than the clown show currently playing out on the world stage."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"global-development/2018/apr/20/congo-drc-award-winning-digital-activists-speak-out-president-joseph-kabila","type":"article","sectionId":"global-development","sectionName":"Global development","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-20T06:00:14Z","webTitle":"'Congo needs another voice': bloggers talk art, sex and football in DRC | Peter Beaumont","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2018/apr/20/congo-drc-award-winning-digital-activists-speak-out-president-joseph-kabila","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2018/apr/20/congo-drc-award-winning-digital-activists-speak-out-president-joseph-kabila","fields":{"headline":"'Congo needs another voice': bloggers talk art, sex and football in DRC","bodyText":"In the midst of the Democratic Republic of the Congo’s dangerous political crisis, the main media outlets have split almost entirely into pro-government and pro-opposition camps, most concentrated in the capital, Kinshasa.

Launched in 2016, Habari RDC is a collective of more than 100 Congolese bloggers and web activists, who use Facebook, Twitter and YouTube to give voice to the opinions of young people from all over the DRC. The collective won the Index on Censorship’s digital activism award at a ceremony in London on Thursday. The aim of these citizen bloggers is to bear witness to what is happening in every corner of the country, which is plagued by extreme poverty, corruption and violence. It is a bold and ambitious project in a country where, as Reporters without Borders notes: “Freedom of information is constantly violated and journalists are exposed to threats, physical violence, arrest, prolonged detention and even murder.” Habari’s digital presence brings a clear advantage – using virtual private networks to circumvent censorship, while hosting debate on the big social network used in Congo, Facebook, where its posts often attract 200 comments. In London last week to receive the award, Guy Muyembe, one of Habari’s founders, said: “We decided about two years ago that Congo needed another voice. It was important to us because our media tends to report only about the main Congolese leaders. The one voice you never hear is the voice of our country’s young people … what their experience is.” And in a country whose population is overwhelmingly young – with some 64% of its citizens under 24 and 42.2% under 14 – it is a crucial point. Habari RDC, as Muyembe explains, has emerged at a key juncture in DRC’s fraught politics. Hopes of a new era of political stability under Joseph Kabila is under threat amid Kabila’s unwillingness to stand down after he completes two terms as president. Instead, despite the St Sylvestre agreement of 2016 – which had foreseen Kabila’s departure and elections in 2017 – Kabila stayed in power amid a deteriorating environment for human rights and freedom of expression. That has coincided with a worsening humanitarian and security crisis that has seen tens of thousands of refugees flee into Uganda, Angola, Tanzania and Zambia in recent months to escape violence. Last week, the country’s leadership decided to boycott a humanitarian donor conference, after arguing there was no urgent need in DRC. “It’s fair enough,” Muyembe says drily, adding briskly, “but then it is not in their interest to witness the country going badly.” Muyembe is alarmed by the current political trajectory. “The country is not doing well and the political crisis is leading the economy to be degraded. Prices are going up every day. The cities are safe but that can’t be said for the places in the country where there is conflict. “The 2016 agreement needs to be respected. The president can only be in power for 10 years and if it is not respected the situation will only get worse. I don’t see the regime organising elections and relinquishing power.” Muyembe believes that one important aspect of Habari is that it allows ordinary Congolese to express their views on what is going on in the country, unmediated by the political factions. “The worry is that if Kabila stays in power until 2020 or 2022 it will be like the past when the country was torn apart. And that feels like a real risk.” Muyembe insists that Habari RDC is about more than the crisis. It also helps individuals – for instance, raising the plight of a woman who had been raped and was rejected by her family. It has reported on the suppression of the internet; and the use of road taxes to arm militias. “The point of the the site is to talk about life in DRC,” he says. To that end, the site posts stories and cartoons about the country’s politics, but it also covers football, the arts and subjects such as domestic violence, child exploitation, the female orgasm, and sexual harassment at work. Habari’s impact has already gone beyond its vibrant commentary to effecting genuine change. One of its recent achievements was encouraging voter registration in Walikale Territory where, in the past, not only has engagement been low but people have disappeared from the register. An article about registration resulted in a voter enrolment campaign that saw 290,000 people signed up to vote, including 140,000 women. Commenting on the value of Habari’s work in DRC, Jodie Ginsberg, chief executive of Index on Censorship, said: “Habari RDC brings young people’s voices to the attention of decision-makers in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The internet is one of the few areas where the government hasn’t been able to exercise as much control, so it’s a really important vehicle for free expression in the country.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"science/brain-flapping/2018/apr/19/forensic-science-the-tip-of-the-iceberg","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-19T10:48:40Z","webTitle":"Forensic science: the tip of the iceberg?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/brain-flapping/2018/apr/19/forensic-science-the-tip-of-the-iceberg","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/brain-flapping/2018/apr/19/forensic-science-the-tip-of-the-iceberg","fields":{"headline":"Forensic science: the tip of the iceberg?","bodyText":"We all want to live in a world where there is justice; where wrongs are righted, where the system is trustworthy and just works. But we have seen a growing body of reports that raise questions about that system. I was particularly challenged when I started doing research that was based on a murder case tried in 2002, which centred on the presence of trace particles on the victim and in the suspect’s vehicle. In court, the jury heard that these particles were very rare and wouldn’t last on clothing for a very long time – just for a matter of minutes. This indicated that the victim must have made contact with the vehicle seat shortly before their body was deposited at the site where they were ultimately found. On this basis, the jury delivered a guilty verdict. When we started exploring and carrying out some experiments on these particles we discovered that they were in fact not rare, but abundant. And they lasted a long time on clothing – many hours rather than minutes. The significance of these particles in that case was completely changed by a series of experiments. The big challenge for Forensic Science We have recently seen huge challenges exposed in the justice system; the Randox laboratory cases, the issues around disclosure that have been highlighted by the case of Liam Allen, and the recent headlines on the ‘disclosure crisis’. These appear against the backdrop of the warnings given about the impact of budget cuts on the justice system and on the quality of forensic science. These are all incredibly serious issues, but there is another issue that hasn’t made the headlines, yet. In 2015, the FBI identified that in 96% of the cases that they had looked into where hair analysis was critical, the evidence had been overstated or misinterpreted. Last year, a study that looked at cases upheld by the UK Court of Appeal found that 22% of those cases had ‘criminal evidence’ that had been misinterpreted. Of the reasons cited as to why evidence was misleading in those cases, nearly a third of the reasons were identified as misinterpreted forensic science evidence. The technological capabilities to measure and classify trace materials have increased, and the accuracy of the measurements that can be made is greater than ever before. But as the Chief Government Scientific Advisor said in his annual report, “New capabilities create other challenges for our existing systems; in particular, our ability to analyse may outstrip our ability to interpret.” When we find trace evidence, such as explosive residue particulates or a trace DNA profile, at a crime scene or on a suspect, we can often provide good indications about what it is or who it came from. But there are big questions that still need to be answered for us to be able to know what that trace evidence means and how significant it is for a case. There is more on this in my TED talk. The scale of the problem: the dark figure of misinterpreted forensic science evidence An added issue is that we don’t know the actual scale of the problem. Studies carried out in the US and the UK have illustrated the cases where evidence was misinterpreted, which have resulted in exonerations. But these are only the cases where the misinterpretation was identified and the appeal case was successful. We are left with a ‘dark figure’ of cases (similar to the ‘dark figure of crime’) where we don’t know if the evidence was misinterpreted nor how many cases this may affect. The cases that have been identified so far are simply the tip of the iceberg. At the moment, that iceberg isn’t fully acknowledged, and the scale of the problem we face hasn’t been addressed. The significant cuts across all the sectors that have a bearing on the justice system have meant that the research that is needed to answer these questions is not being prioritised and funded. But just as the breath-taking scale and complexity of icebergs and the oceans are being realised (as the 10.6m viewers of Blue Planet II can attest to), so the scale of the iceberg of misinterpreted forensic science evidence needs to be understood and, critically, it needs to be addressed. To do that we need to harness the best scientific approaches and enable high quality research within the professional and academic science communities. A solution? We need a change in our traditional focus, and we need data. We need to focus on the activities and factors that influence the presence of the forensic science evidence, rather than predominantly addressing where or who that evidence originated from. If we can understand these movements and factors better, we can start to provide data to inform the interpretation of what a piece of forensic science evidence means, and its significance when it is found in a certain place at a particular time. We are showing that it is possible to carry out systematic experimental studies that can offer this type of evidence base that can guide the interpretation of what trace evidence means in a case context, and we have a vision to do a lot more in a dedicated forensic science evidence interpretation lab. For example: We can show when gunshot residue can undergo multiple transfers on intermediary objects (such as door handles and shopping trolleys) and between people. The data indicates that you can have gunshot residue particles on you even if you’ve never fired a gun. We have data now that indicates that trace DNA can be identified on weapons. The research is showing that DNA can be transferred indirectly, and that your DNA can be on a knife that you’ve never even touched. We are seeing when environmental indicators, such as minerals and microscopic algae that are specific to particular environments, transfer to footwear and clothing. Critically the data show that this kind of trace can also persist over long periods of time and can be preserved even if the shoes or jacket are put through the washing machine. This indicates that just because something looks clean, there may still be valuable forensic evidence to be collected. Forensic Science has a huge amount of value to offer the justice system, but it needs to have a robust and transparent empirical foundation that can underpin the interpretation of what forensic science evidence means in a specific case. To secure this for the future we need to ensure that the resources needed are made available. Until we can do the research to create that foundation, we will continue to face a very significant problem. Without that research, your DNA found on clothing at a crime scene that you’ve never touched or worn, or explosive residue found on your hands on your way through an airport scanner, or the presence of trace particles on a seat in your car, may not be interpreted correctly.

The Australian Local Government Association is calling on state governments to stop treating hundreds of millions of dollars in landfill levies collected when rubbish was dumped as general revenue, and to instead invest it in long-term recycling and other sustainable waste solutions. On Wednesday Ipswich city council in Queensland announced it would no longer send kerbside waste to be recycled due to skyrocketing costs. The mayor, Andrew Antoniolli, said the cost of recycling in recent contract negotiations had increased fivefold and would have required the council to charge ratepayers an extra $2m a year. On Friday Max Spedding, from the National Waste and Recycling Industry Council, warned that Australia would run out of space to store recycled waste in just a few months. He said three months’ worth of waste had already been stockpiled after China changed its standards for imported waste. Recycling costs have increased since January when China signalled it would not accept shipments of some categories of contaminated waste, with warnings consumers would carry the cost. Ipswich council said it hoped to eventually replace recycling with a waste-to-energy project, announcing a call for tenders. On Friday the environment minister, Josh Frydenberg, said he was keen to see waste-to-energy projects developed. “I think this is a very prospective area and it’s one that I’m focused to see projects rolled out across the country,” he told the ABC. The Clean Energy Finance Corporation has committed up to $100m to an new equity fund that aims to create bioenergy and energy from waste. The Australian Council of Recycling and the Waste Management Association of Australia has called on federal and state governments to spend $150m to “reboot” the recycling industry by developing infrastructure needed to process recyclable waste domestically. Frydenberg said recycling would be top of the agenda at next week’s meeting of state and territory environment ministers. Sign up to receive the top stories in Australia every day at noon The Local Government Association of Queensland has warned that other municipalities would be forced to follow Ipswich’s lead, though several councils immediately ruled it out. The Australian Local Government Association president, David O’Loughlin, said China’s decision had effectively withdrawn the demand for 30% of Australia’s plastic recycling waste. He said in time it would affect every council across the country. He said China had effectively introduced a ban on accepting plastics for recycling under another name by tightening the allowed contamination rate to an unachievable level. He said the association would raise the issue with the trade minister, Steve Ciobo. “We have trade arrangements with China and there are trade implications here that I think the Australian government should be mindful of,” O’Loughlin said. “If it could be part of a trend that should at least raise concern. What if they changed contamination standards for coal, iron ore and wheat to a point where ships were turned around at port?” O’Loughlin said the government might need to consider whether it accepted from China new plastics that were costly or difficult to recycle, or placed conditions on how they would be recycled before they were brought into the country. At a domestic level, he said he planned to raise the issue of how landfill levies are spent at next week’s meeting of environment ministers. He said New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia had raised hundreds of millions in levies that were largely not returned to councils or spent on recycling on other sustainable solutions. NSW and Victoria have offered recycling rescue packages worth $47m and $13m respectively to cover increased costs but O’Loughlin said they would need to do more to establish a long-term solution. He said landfill levies were designed as a deterrent to waste going to landfill but that worked only if there was an alternative. “In the absence of these levies being used to increase recycling in another way it’s just a tax on households,” he said. O’Loughlin’s call follows the Queensland environment minister, Leeanne Enoch, blaming the federal government and former LNP state government for Ipswich council’s decision. “The decision of China is at a federal level,” she told ABC radio on Thursday. “Where is the federal leadership on this? It is affecting all of Australia.” Enoch said NSW and Victoria were able to assist with millions of dollars because they had money saved from a waste levy, whereas Queensland’s had been abolished by the former premier Campbell Newman."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/may/03/russia-propaganda-war-skripal-poisoning-embassy-london","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-03T14:00:43Z","webTitle":"'Deny, distract and blame': how Russia fights propaganda war","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/may/03/russia-propaganda-war-skripal-poisoning-embassy-london","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/may/03/russia-propaganda-war-skripal-poisoning-embassy-london","fields":{"headline":"'Deny, distract and blame': how Russia fights propaganda war","bodyText":"The Twitter account of the Russian embassy in London has been busy over the past two months, offering numerous explanations for the poisoning of Sergei and Yulia Skripal in Salisbury. All hint at a dark and sprawling British conspiracy. Since the Skripals were found stricken on a park bench, Downing Street has stuck to one version of events. Theresa May says it is “highly likely” Moscow carried out the attack using a Soviet-made nerve agent. Only the Kremlin had the motive to kill its former officer, she argues. The embassy, and its boss, Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, have offered alternative scenarios. Lavrov has said a Swiss laboratory used to test the poison identified another toxin called BZ. Russia did not have it. The US, UK and Nato did, he said. Moscow has further claimed the Skripals were not poisoned, Yulia has been abducted and hidden, and someone injected her with “chemicals” before tests were carried out. Meanwhile, the British have “destroyed evidence” and refused to abide by international norms, it has alleged. The embassy has published letters from what it claims are UK citizens expressing sympathy with Vladimir Putin. “Why include to poison his daughter Yulia who is Russian citizen and lives in Moscow?” one “correspondent” asks. The Skripal case vividly illustrates how the Kremlin has abandoned conventional diplomacy. Its foreign emissaries are now full-time trolls, with the ambassador to the UK, Alexander Yakovenko, personally approving many tweets. Moscow’s tactics include sarcasm, denial, innuendo and noisy counter-accusation. David Clark, a former special adviser to the late foreign secretary Robin Cook, said Russia’s strategy is to lead people into “a wilderness of mirrors”. “There is an endless loop of disinformation and half-formed opinions. It gets echoed and replicated artificially, by Russian bots, as well as by genuine means,” he said. Clark is sceptical that Kremlin propaganda works. He noted that “most people in the world are not on Twitter” and pointed to a recent YouGov poll that found 75% of Britons thought the Russian state was probably behind the poisoning. This included 37% who thought Moscow was “almost certainly” responsible. Only 5% believed Russia was innocent. On the continent, there were similar suspicions. Almost 60% of Germans, and just over half of French people, believed the UK government’s case. This was also true at an official level. In March, more than 20 western countries expelled dozens of Russian diplomats. Still, the Kremlin’s protestations have had some impact on UK politics. In the House of Commons, Jeremy Corbyn appeared reluctant to blame Russia. Boris Johnson then claimed the government science facility at Porton Down had identified Russia as the source of the novichok poison. But it had not: the UK’s case was based on intelligence and analysis of previous Kremlin assassinations, including the 2006 murder of Alexander Litvinenko, killed with a radioactive cup of tea. Nataliia Popovych, the co-founder of the Ukraine Crisis Media Center, said Russia’s Skripal playbook was previously seen in Ukraine. Dutch investigators found that in 2014, Kremlin-backed rebels shot down Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 over eastern Ukraine, killing all 298 people on board. Moscow supplied the Buk missile. Russian state TV offered a series of wildly implausible counter-claims. It said the passengers were already dead, a Ukrainian fighter jet shot the plane down, and the CIA and other western intelligence agencies were in on the plot. “We monitored all the lies the Russian media were pushing. Their modus operandi is to deny, distract and blame,” Popovych said. These tactics may have limited impact internationally, but are pretty effective inside Russia, she said. Even critics of Putin seem unpersuaded of Moscow’s guilt. “It’s about broadcasting thoroughly tailored narratives, which are not even based on the news. This happens on purpose on major TV channels controlled by the Kremlin,” Popovych said. Russian broadcasters wage a relentless campaign against Europe, she said, with an average of 18 negative references a day. Europe is depicted as dangerous, decadent, immoral, and home to fascism and revisionism. The EU is falling apart. Germans and Scandinavians routinely take children away from Russian families and give them to “gays”, state TV claims. The depiction of Britain inside Russia is worse, analysis of more than three years of content suggests. The UK is portrayed as Europe’s most Russophobic country and an insidious and unreliable partner. A report by the Rossiya 1 channel referred to Theresa May’s “pale, tired flesh” and hinted that she had a drinking problem. Only Belarus and Switzerland get positive coverage. So far, the Foreign Office has taken baby steps to fight back. It has released a mini-film setting out how Moscow spreads fictitious stories. The video identified three “tried and tested” steps. These were “inventing multiple theories to mask the truth”, getting officials to endorse them as credible, and “using bots and fake accounts to amplify fake information”. None of this, the government says, changes facts. The Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons confirmed novichok was used in Salisbury. Russia’s identification of BZ was false – a “malign” and “craven” attempt to shift the blame elsewhere, according to the EU and OPCW delegates. The UK’s national security adviser, Sir Mark Sedwill, took the unusual step of releasing classified intelligence. In a letter to the Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, Sedwill said Skripal’s former spy agency the GRU had targeted Yulia Skripal’s email account. Over the past decade, Russia had produced small amounts of novichok, he said, and used special units to test the poison on door handles. Despite this openness, critics say Downing Street has been slow to respond to cynical Russian attacks. “They haven’t been proactive,” Clark said of the Foreign Office and politicians from all sides. “Despite everything, the British elite is still conflicted about how to deal with Russia. War has been declared, but we’re not fighting a war back.” The government should enlighten Russian citizens about the Kremlin’s multiple abuses at home, he said. These included “genuine conspiracies” such as the political murders of Kremlin critics, as well as corruption at the highest levels, typically featuring Putin’s friends and billionaire cronies. “I see no evidence so far we are proactively hitting back,” Clark said. No one can accuse Moscow of a lack of energy. Yakovenko has held multiple press conferences at the Russian embassy in Kensington. On Wednesday, it launched an attack on Sedwill and claimed the Skripals were being “forcibly isolated”. Their poisoning on 4 March was a “staged provocation”, it said. The UK’s behaviour continues to be obstructive, Yakovenko complained. He blamed British “secret services”, which had misled the government. “They are making an independent and transparent investigation impossible,” he added."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/apr/24/home-office-faces-court-action-over-asylum-children","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-24T14:06:45Z","webTitle":"Home office delays traumatising child victims of rape and torture experts warn","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/24/home-office-faces-court-action-over-asylum-children","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/apr/24/home-office-faces-court-action-over-asylum-children","fields":{"headline":"Home Office faces court action over asylum children","bodyText":"The British government will face legal action on Wednesday over extensive delays in child asylum cases amid mounting criticism of the way the Home Office is dealing with thousands of unaccompanied minors in the UK. Lawyers and mental health experts are warning that child survivors of rape, torture and trafficking are suffering mental health problems because they must wait months, even years, for their cases to be addressed. Even the young people brought by the Home Office directly from Calais are affected by delays and wider problems in the asylum process. The Guardian has heard of least two cases of young people threatened with removal despite being brought over legally to join their family. Now delays have become so widespread, lawyers say, that they are bringing a judicial review case against the Home Office, based on two test cases. The Home Office says it is committed to resolving 98% of cases within six months, but says some child asylum cases are complex and take longer to resolve. The government moved in late 2016 to rescue 750 children from Calais and reunite them with family members in the UK. A further 350 came on the “Dubs” scheme that Lord Dubs championed in order to bring over some of the most vulnerable unaccompanied children. But those children, and about 5,000 more who have arrived in Britain irregularly since early 2016, have faced a difficult reception in the UK. There have been delays of up to two years in cases being resolved. One boy, whom the Home Office brought to the UK from Calais in order to join his brother, faces the prospect of being sent back to Afghanistan. His sibling has full refugee status in the UK because he was targeted by the Taliban for working closely with Nato troops in Afghanistan. Elaine Ortiz of the Hummingbird Project in Brighton knew the boy in Calais and went to his Home Office interview with him. “When he got here the Home Office said he was 19 and he was refused. He had evidence of his age that he had already shown as part of the process of coming to the UK. We knew him in Calais and never doubted he was a child.” She told the Guardian the interview process was upsetting for the boy. “He was so deeply traumatised he couldn’t remember really simple information like the date he left. He was really, really nervous but the questioner wasn’t child-friendly at all. The whole family are totally crumbling at not knowing what will happen and his mental health is deteriorating.” The Guardian also spoke to brothers reunited through the family reunion process who were told their case would be resolved in six weeks but have not had an outcome 18 months later. Annette Elder of Elder Rahimi solicitors has been collecting evidence on the mental health impact of delays of up to two years on vulnerable young asylum seekers. She sees the impact clearly in her young clients. She said: “It’s just horrific; you have a distressed angry young person who says why aren’t you doing anything? We say we will escalate this, so we threaten to take the Home Office to court, we get a letter back saying ‘a decision will be taken in six months’... the date comes and the date goes and the young person thinks you have been lying to them.” Elder added: “Damage is being caused but the Home Office is not giving these requests individual consideration. We just get standard responses that bear no relation to the facts of the case and that is not compliant with their legal obligations.” The number of applications from unaccompanied asylum seeking children in the UK was 2,206 in 2017, down from 3,290 the previous year. The Home Office has a published target for completing asylum claims of all kinds within six months, but freedom of information requests made by Elder and her colleagues showed that between 2015 and the end of 2017 most child cases were not processed from claim to decision within that target. The Guardian spoke to the young man whose case is being looked at as part of the judicial review to be heard at the high court on Wednesday. The boy, known as N in court proceedings, is from Eritrea and arrived alone in the UK at 15. His asylum claim took two years to be processed and was only resolved after lawyers brought legal proceedings against the Home Office. This was despite him being recognised as a victim of trafficking. N first waited three months for a screening interview and was then given a date for a substantive interview. “When I was told that there was a date for asylum interview to take place I was so happy, so very happy. I felt that I could begin to finally look towards the future. “I was also told that the decision on the asylum claim would come within 21 days of the asylum interview, so by 25 October 2017.” But N was identified as a victim of trafficking and he was referred into the national referral mechanism, causing further delays. “Of course I was disappointed when by 25 October there was still no decision. I felt so bad and confused. Then we received a letter from the Home Office saying that there was no time frame for a decision. I would just have to wait. Things just went black for me then. “It is like the indefinite Eritrean national service, it is endless. I have problems with my sleep, sometimes I didn’t sleep for 24 hours I just stayed awake worrying.” N has now been given asylum although he has yet to receive his papers that allow him to move on with his life. Sheila Melzak is consultant child and adolescent psychotherapist at Baobab, a group supporting young refugees in London, and has submitted evidence to the judicial review hearing at the high court. She told the Guardian that the young people being affected by delays were being traumatised by the uncertainty in the asylum system. “I’ve been in this field a long time I’ve never seen young people waiting so long for their substantive interview. There are delays at every level, some of the [children who came legally from Calais] are still waiting for substantive interviews, many are still waiting for results, others are still waiting for court hearings. “Mental health issues to do with trauma and loss are exacerbated by these incredible delays.” Elder said she was concerned that the situation would get worse when free movement came to an end. “Given the pressures the Home Office will be under in the coming years with the demands of Brexit this raises concerns about the risk of the situation for young people deteriorating even from what it is now.” A Home Office spokesperson said: “The Home Office is committed to ensuring all those awaiting asylum decisions do not face unnecessary delays. However, cases involving unaccompanied asylum-seeking children are often more complex. A number of barriers can prevent an initial asylum decision being made, including the resolution of medical issues or the preparation of reports to support the individual’s claims.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"stage/2018/apr/19/much-ado-about-nothing-review-mel-giedroyc","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-19T15:00:09Z","webTitle":"Much Ado About Nothing review – Mel Giedroyc blazes through Great Sicilian Bake Off","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/apr/19/much-ado-about-nothing-review-mel-giedroyc","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2018/apr/19/much-ado-about-nothing-review-mel-giedroyc","fields":{"headline":"Much Ado About Nothing review – Mel Giedroyc blazes through Great Sicilian Bake Off","bodyText":"The Rose theatre marks its 10th anniversary with a lively revival of Shakespeare’s crowd-pleasing comedy starring Mel Giedroyc. But while Simon Dormandy’s production, set in a luxury Sicilian spa hotel, fizzes with invention, it boasts one too many bright ideas and doesn’t always reconcile the play’s melodramatic and festive elements. Dormandy’s basic notion is that the play offers a running critique of a brutally patriarchal culture. Thus Don Pedro becomes a black-suited mafia boss, surrounded by armed guards and enjoying a few days’ rest and recreation after a bout of gang warfare. Leonato fits into the pattern as his obliging hotel manager, who apes the clan-chief’s cruelty by rejecting his daughter, Hero, the second her honour is called into question. Unusual attention is also given to normally marginal figures such as Borachio and Margaret: not only are they sexually hyperactive, but the latter’s delight in donning Hero’s wedding dress gives a spurious credence to the absurd idea that, by night, the two women are mistaken for each other. No one, however, goes to see Much Ado for its main plot: ever since Charles I identified the play as the story of Beatrice and Benedick, they have been its star attraction, and Dormandy has to work hard to fit them into his scheme. Giedroyc’s Beatrice, plausibly enough, becomes part of the hotel staff and a woman of fiercely independent character. At one point she brandishes a kitchen knife at Benedick as if taking part in The Great Sicilian Bake Off. She also blazes with fury at Hero’s wedding-day humiliation and scoffs derisively when the Friar suggests the battered bride be hidden away in “some reclusive and religious life”. What I missed in Giedroyc’s performance was any hint of a bruising past liaison with Benedick: when Beatrice, speaking of her heart, says “Marry, once before he won it of me with false dice”, the line goes almost unnoticed. Giedroyc is good but, even to the last, a bit too relentlessly aggressive. John Hopkins fits more easily into the pattern by playing Benedick as Don Pedro’s consigliere, who has absorbed his boss’s misogyny. But Hopkins makes something funny out of the device by which Benedick is tricked into believing Beatrice carries a torch, rather than a carving knife, for him: “Love me? Why?” he asks in tones of total bewilderment. Hopkins also suggests the injunction to “kill Claudio” is something to be taken seriously and displays real violence towards a man who has broken the honour code. It is a performance that confirms Hopkins as one of our best Shakespearean actors. Dormandy has more difficulty accommodating Dogberry: never the most hilarious of Shakespeare’s clowns, he is dutifully played by Stewart Wright as a Sicilian word-mangler with mysterious leanings towards t’ai chi. There are, however, sharply defined performances from Peter Guinness as a Don Pedro straight out of The Godfather, David Rintoul as a savagely authoritarian Leonato and Kate Lamb as a Hero rightly defiant towards the men who destroyed her reputation. Naomi Dawson has also created a massively detailed hotel set complete with fitness zones, sun terraces and disco-parlour. But, while the audience had a good time, I feel the play is more a celebration of Beatrice and Benedick’s unacknowledged love than an attack on an inflexible patriarchy. • At the Rose theatre, Kingston, until 6 May.

But HBO’s 2016 flagship, Westworld, was in the rudest of health. By many people’s reckoning the best sci-fi show since Battlestar Galactica, Westworld was an entrancing, intelligent parable on consciousness, the nature of reality and the ethical minefield that comes with creating life. Mysterious by design, it almost yearned for the forensic examination that often accompanies modern TV viewing. The fan base eagerly accepted the challenge, poring over every detail, ransacking the narrative for clues and constructing byzantine fan theories, many of which were proved true in the final reckoning. Critics gushed and the season finale broke HBO ratings records. The machines had won. So, its return on Sunday night in the US and Monday night in the UK is slam-dunk, must-watch appointment TV, right? Not so fast. Many shows come hard off the heels of a victorious first season, clutching awards and plaudits to their chests, only to fluff their lines in the second. The notion of the sophomore slump has become a cliche, but it is one that has some mileage. Take the shambling parody of Hollywood noir that replaced the glorious southern gothic of True Detective’s season one as a recent example. Of all its crimes, the biggest was that it was incomprehensible. Westworld confuses, yes, but it does so through captivating philosophical riddles. True Detective confused through storytelling incompetence. The challenge for Westworld is to ensure that its complex mythology doesn’t end up strangling its narrative. HBO should know better than to scrimp on spending this time around. After the stunning success of the Walking Dead’s debut season, AMC took the bizarre decision of slashing the show’s budget, sending showrunner Frank Darabont into a rage and the show into crisis. The result was a season heavy on dialogue and low on the zombie carnage that is the show’s bread and butter. Set-piece spectaculars help create your legend, but they don’t come cheap. No show lives on dough alone, though. One of the most impressive aspects of Westworld’s first season was the pacing. It knew when and how to hit the storytelling beats. It kept the killing of Robert Ford, the defining point of the robot rebellion, until the very end – the perfect payoff for everything that had gone before. This seems like entry-level stuff, but Twin Peaks seemed to miss that fundamental lesson. Its second season flatlined after they revealed who killed Laura Palmer seven episodes into a 22-episode run; viewers switched off in droves as Catherine Martell dragged up as Mr Tojamura, Ben Horne came to believe he was General Lee and Josie Packard became a drawer knob. “The second season sucked,” David Lynch said recently, blaming the early detonation of the Laura Palmer bomb forced by ABC executives. If Westworld remembers how to marshal and deploy its big artillery, it has a fighting chance. Likewise, it needs to remember that one of its big strengths is its compelling characters – the philosopher-king Ford, the sweet-then-homicidal Dolores, the sadistic, scheming Man in Black. Keeping them sympathetic, relatable and explicable is crucial to the show’s continued success. Friday Night Lights went off the rails second time out by having previously peaceable characters Landry and Tyra commit and cover up a murder respectively. The guy had it coming, but fans disapproved of their inspirational small-town drama turning itself into a corny telenovela. Ultimately, Westworld needs to remember what got it to the dance. It delivered a beautifully photographed prestige TV show with epic world-building that was emotionally powerful and often profound. Its fans were demanding, but devoted. If it steers clear of the major hazards outlined here, there is no reason why it can’t build on its success and ultimately become a multiseason franchise with all the spin-offs, merch and video games that go with that. The stakes are high and it needs to deliver. It would be a terrible shame if these violent delights had a silent end."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/apr/21/rolan-adams-murdered-1991-father-richard-adams-chiling-similarities-stepehen-lawrence-killing","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-21T05:00:05Z","webTitle":"For father of Rolan Adams, murdered in 1991, anger and pain are undimmed","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/apr/21/rolan-adams-murdered-1991-father-richard-adams-chiling-similarities-stepehen-lawrence-killing","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/apr/21/rolan-adams-murdered-1991-father-richard-adams-chiling-similarities-stepehen-lawrence-killing","fields":{"headline":"For father of Rolan Adams, murdered in 1991, anger and pain are undimmed","bodyText":"The candlelit vigils for Rolan Adams stopped seven years ago in Thamesmead. Ever since the 20th anniversary of his murder turned ugly, his family have felt unable to return to the south-east London street where the 15-year-old was fatally stabbed 27 years ago. The last time they gathered at the murder scene, on 21 February 2001, they were pelted with abuse. Some passersby jeered and honked horns as the mourners prayed and laid wreaths. A McDonald’s milkshake was hurled towards them as they stood in quiet reflection. “There’s still this little culture of overt racism in Thamesmead,” said Rolan’s father, Richard Adams, in the living room of his mid-terrace house in Southend. Equally insulting was the no-show by local councillors and police who had been invited to the roadside vigil. “It would have been nice if we had some police protection.” It is 27 years and two months since Rolan was fatally stabbed in the throat with a butterfly knife while waiting at a bus stop with his 14-year-old brother, Nathan. In a murder that had chilling similarities to the nearby killing of Stephen Lawrence 20 months later, the siblings had played table tennis and swapped records with school friends at the Hawksmoor youth club before the fatal blow. Rolan and Nathan were approached then chased by a gang of 15 white teenagers, some shouting “niggers”. Nathan managed to escape but returned to find his brother dying in a pool of blood, his table tennis bat at his side. Rolan’s murder brought to a head simmering racial tensions on the south-east London streets of Eltham, Thamesmead and Welling. There had been a 140% increase in racist attacks since the BNP had moved its headquarters to nearby Bexley, anti-fascist groups reported at the time. Fifteen black families were driven out of their home on the Thamesmead estate in the year after Rolan’s killing. BNP stickers even appeared in the magistrates court where Rolan’s killer, the 19-year-old Mark Thornborrow, had first appeared. Thornborrow was sentenced to life for murder and served 13 years. Four other men were found guilty only of public order offences and were given community service. The US civil rights activist Al Sharpton flew to London for a memorial rally as protests over Rolan’s murder grew. A 17-year-old Lawrence was one of those at Sharpton’s rally, which was vilified on the front page of the Daily Mail as “Race preacher from hell comes to the UK”. The 25th anniversary of Lawrence’s death on Sunday will focus the spotlight on race relations in today’s Britain. For Richard Adams, now 61, little has changed from the toxic days that claimed his son’s life. “We should never forget. We should never forgive,” he said. “I haven’t got the power to forgive them and I will never forget. I will never forget until I see that there is real repentance and atonement. There is none of that.” The softly spoken father of three said he had made a “conscious decision to remain as angry as I can – a productive anger”. He is angry that only one young man was ever prosecuted for Rolan’s murder. He is angry at the “culture of denial” that has seen the killing airbrushed from history. And he is angry about today’s knife crime crisis, which he believes is a manifestation of the “targeting” of young black boys in the aftermath of the racist murders in the early 1990s. “Who was protecting our young black boys?” he asked. “We tried our best to keep my surviving son, and all the other black boys and girls who were affected, from becoming [knife-carrying] perpetrators to protect themselves. Because of that lack of police protection they encouraged, inadvertently, young black boys to start carrying knives to protect themselves.” Like the Lawrence family, Adams said he feels let down by the police, justice system and politicians. He said there was a reluctance to go after anyone else for Rolan’s murder. Out of the 15 white teenagers, only one was convicted of murder and four others were given community service for violent disorder. It has been suggested that some of the gang had known Lawrence’s killers, Adams said. A year later another teenager, Rohit Duggal, 15, was stabbed to death by a white teenager in the same area. The relatively small number of prosecutions in the murders of Rolan, Rohit and Lawrence cuts into an open wound for Adams. “There was about 25 perpetrators in those three cases. Only four went to prison,” he said. “That’s where they could have started nipping this knife crime culture in the bud. Instead they created that vacuum where black boys needed to protect themselves.” Despite some advances since the 1990s – the police, Crown Prosecution Service and politicians take racism “a little bit more seriously” – there remains a hidden culture of racism inBritain, Adams said. It is more “covert and sophisticated” than it was nearly 30 years ago, but it exists nonetheless. His new home in the Essex town of Southend-on-Sea is barely 30 miles from the streets of Thamesmead, but it feels like a world away. For Adams, a member of the Windrush generation who arrived in Britain in 1964, even walking into a restaurant in a white area feels the same as it did half a century ago. “You get the stares. It’s exactly the same,” he said. “I’ve been in Britain now for 54 years and to be honest I feel exactly the same.” Neville Lawrence this week said he had forgiven his son’s killers. But for Adams, whose anger and grief is undimmed after 27 years, it is more difficult to show clemency. “You cannot forgive and forget until there is change and atonement for the distress – and the establishment has allowed them to do it,” he said. “It feels as though they understand it and condone it and connive in it. Otherwise it would be eradicated, not pushed under the carpet. “Remember, that’s why you don’t hear nothing about my child dying. That’s why you don’t hear nothing about Rohit Duggal, Ruhullah Aramesh, all the others that have died before. It is this culture of suppression and I hope it goes away.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2018/apr/19/nick-clegg-targets-brexiters-in-drive-by-shooting","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-19T17:20:35Z","webTitle":"Nick Clegg targets Brexiters in drive-by shooting  | John Crace","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/apr/19/nick-clegg-targets-brexiters-in-drive-by-shooting","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/apr/19/nick-clegg-targets-brexiters-in-drive-by-shooting","fields":{"headline":"Nick Clegg targets Brexiters in drive-by shooting","bodyText":"Vince Cable had spent the morning giving a speech on Taming the Tech Giants. Almost entirely for his own benefit as the event went almost entirely unnoticed and unreported. Taming indifference is Vince’s real problem these days. Hard to believe given the party’s standing under Tim Farron, but the Liberal Democrats have slid even further into irrelevance with Cable as their leader. Over at the Institute for Government, an upstairs room was packed for a lunchtime discussion with the former Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg. It was so rammed that latecomers were forced to watch proceedings on a TV in the annexe. Say what you like about the man who set his party back a generation by taking it into coalition with the Tories, but he’s still got pulling power. Not that Clegg has any interest in being anyone’s leader in exile. He’s got over the disappointment of losing his seat at the last election and now has a full-time career being a professional Nick Clegg. He is seldom off the airwaves, has written a book called How to Stop Brexit and has now even got this season’s must-have accessory for the celebrity politician: a podcast. The first episode on anger management with special guest Nigel Farage has just been recorded. Apparently the earth moved for both of them. Since the referendum, Clegg has been a poster boy for remainers everywhere. Wind him up and off he goes. Sure enough, within seconds of his introduction, he was up and running on Brexit. At the start it felt as though Clegg was on autopilot, delivering a performance he had given dozens of times before as he played his greatest hits. Brexit was a disaster, but it could still be stopped if MPs were brave enough to vote with their conscience. The negotiations were doomed because British politicians fundamentally did not understand the nature of trade and were constricted by their own policy narcissism. All familiar stuff, but no one minded as this was what they had come for. To hear their views articulated and to be offered just a chink of hope that it was not all going to end catastrophically. It was only about halfway in that Clegg appeared to get fully engaged. At that point, he chose to engage in a spot of drive-by shooting. First in his sights was Liam Fox. The international trade secretary was a useless halfwit who could probably be duped into accepting a customs union providing he was allowed to still ponce around the world clocking up air miles on imaginary deals with imaginary friends. Bang, bang. Next to take the hit were David Davis and John Redwood. Both were hypocrites for having completely forgotten they had once called for a second referendum. Bang, bang. Jeremy Corbyn? The nostalgia choice for “small C conservatives” with a preference for sepia-tinted socialism. If Labour had a halfway decent leader, it would be 20 points ahead in the polls right now. Bang, bang. As the body count crept up, Clegg began to look more engaged. Almost as if he was enjoying himself. In a supreme act of deferred gratification, he chose to save the best till last. Theresa May had allowed herself to be guided by two immature and overexcitable special advisers. Clegg smiled. Who wouldn’t enjoy taking out Nick Timothy and Fiona Hill as collateral damage? Whatever. During her time as home secretary, May had introduced stupid and nasty immigration policies and the blame for the treatment of the Windrush generation fell entirely on her. Three for the price of one. Bang, bang. Bang, bang. Bang, bang. With his bloodlust sated, the interview came to a close and Clegg made a dash for the exit, only to re-emerge a couple of minutes later and sprint out another side door. It never hurts to stay one step ahead of his enemies. Especially when there were so many."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/apr/19/ecb-100-ball-plans-gimmick-kill-off-county-championship","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-19T16:40:51Z","webTitle":"ECB’s 100-ball plans are a gimmick likely to kill off County Championship | Vic Marks","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/apr/19/ecb-100-ball-plans-gimmick-kill-off-county-championship","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/apr/19/ecb-100-ball-plans-gimmick-kill-off-county-championship","fields":{"headline":"ECB’s 100-ball plans are a gimmick likely to kill off County Championship","bodyText":"Even the curmudgeons, a band I am in danger of joining, admit Twenty20 cricket has the capacity to be the saviour of the modern game. So what does the England and Wales Cricket Board decide to do? Abandon T20 cricket, which we all understand, for something it describes as “simpler” but which is undeniably shorter – 20 balls. Such is the ECB’s staggering diffidence to T20 cricket as it now exists the board has opted for a gimmicky imitation. But the sad fact is however good the marketing men and women – and they will be working overtime to save the faces of those in charge at the ECB in the months leading up to the launch of this competition – I don’t think anyone is going to care. The ECB will tell us how it wishes to distinguish this competition from the T20 Blast between the counties, which has become increasingly successful in recent years; it says it wants to give families time to get home before it’s too late. And the board may mention the broadcasters – especially the BBC – need to be off air by 9pm so their schedules are not disrupted. One suspects the last factor is the one that counts. It seems the ECB will do anything to satisfy the whims of the broadcasters and this includes introducing yet another format of the game, which is already overloaded with matches of so many different durations. And it has the gall to call this a simplification. The ECB now prostrates itself at the knees of the broadcasters even if this means prostituting the game. So if one of the TV companies decided the launch of Strictly Come Slogging was a good idea, a neat half-hour slot in which two professional cricketers and two enthusiastic celebrities combined in a T2 match – they should be able to fit four overs into 30 minutes – or a T10 (that’s 10 balls rather than 10 overs) – then one suspects the ECB would be more than happy to deliver that “concept” (there has been much talk of concepts) asap. The ECB board, which keeps losing key figures such as Andy Nash and Richard Thompson, who are disenchanted by the way the game is being run, has offered “overwhelming support” for the new competition. We do not yet have such a clear idea what the counties think. Ten of them, those not chosen to host the new competition, are probably not bothered. They have already been marginalised and they await their £1.3m per annum for signing up but not hosting. They may even tacitly admit the new plans have some virtue since the Blast, now described as “popular” by the ECB rather than “mediocre”, will be not so readily overshadowed by the new competition, despite all the marketing. Their fans may keep turning out at Hove, Chelmsford and Taunton. They are far less likely to make the trek to the cities to watch the latest craze. Those counties with Test grounds, who are actually hosting the new competition, will be more nervous. Some of them, especially those outside London, are banking on it being a success to bail them out of considerable financial strife. They should realise that gimmicks seldom work in England. When T20 started here all sorts of razzmatazz was introduced but the tournament took off when it became clear it mattered to the players and the supporters who won. We need a contest not a circus. However, the format is not the biggest issue. Whether an over lasts six balls or 10 does not matter much – except for the confusion this might cause to all the new cricket fans the ECB is expecting to entice. We can cope with 100 balls rather 120. The real problem with the new competition is it leaves us with a domestic schedule likely to kill off the longer form of the game. By 2020 the months of , June to August will predominantly be given over to T20 cricket and T16.4 cricket (they may unearth a catchier title before long). Two such tournaments in one season is too much. That does not adhere to the Australian model so beloved by the ECB. In 2020 we will be saturated by the short-form game throughout the heart of the season. Championship and 50‑over cricket will be downgraded even further. We desperately need one all-singing, all-dancing T20 tournament, into which the ECB can pour all its marketing resources to the extent that it can sell it to the TV companies. Instead they are hawking a gimmicky new game involving teams who at the outset will prompt no loyalty from the fans in the cities, let alone those ignored in the shires. Those marketing men and women had better set to work now."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/apr/20/ant-mcpartlin-ant-and-dec-drink-drive-case-celebrity-fame-dark-side","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-20T05:00:13Z","webTitle":"Ant McPartlin is a celebrity, but do we forget he’s a human being? | Ros Coward","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/20/ant-mcpartlin-ant-and-dec-drink-drive-case-celebrity-fame-dark-side","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/20/ant-mcpartlin-ant-and-dec-drink-drive-case-celebrity-fame-dark-side","fields":{"headline":"Ant McPartlin is a celebrity, but do we forget he’s a human being?","bodyText":"Ant McPartlin’s celebrity has been built on a perennially boyish, cheeky-chappy image, always at ease in front of the camera. The image he presented following his sentencing for drink-driving, after a collision in which other people were injured, could not have been more different. Gaunt face, furrowed brow, and dark bags under worried eyes, he looked in no fit state to have cameras shoved in his face. But a press that has built him up is not going to miss the opportunity for close-up scrutiny of his downfall to addiction and depression. His haggard face covered front pages: “Ant’s court shame”, “Ant’s guilt”, “Shamefaced!” chorused the captions. The Daily Mail had the nastiest dig at its former darling: “A picture of self-pity, drink drive Ant fined £86,000 (and that’s just 4 days’ wages).” These same papers have recently reported, with approval, attempts to improve the treatment of mental health, including Theresa May’s rhetorical promise to transform how the issue is dealt with. But when it comes to their relationship with celebrities, self-awareness and responsible reporting of psychological distress is too much to expect. Celebrities are the lifeblood of much of our popular journalism, and ambivalence is the name of the game. Personalities are elevated through endless attention to every detail of their lives – look no further than the current obsession with Meghan Markle’s every outfit, her dogs’ names and her estranged relatives. But this is envious attention, waiting – even hoping – for the celebrity to crash and suffer, or to behave in ways that will justify spiteful commentary. When celebrities really come down to earth, or even die, there is a ghoulish interest in the details of their suffering, especially if there’s a suggestion that they were, after all, not happy with their previously enviable celebrity lives. The bear-baiting treatment of Amy Winehouse and Frank Bruno were examples of this. Dale Winton’s death this week offers the opportunity for a sort of voyeuristic interest in the details of his depression. Ant, particularly as part of Ant and Dec, plays an interesting role in the machinery of British celebrity. The duo’s core television work has been precisely in the area of celebrity making and breaking. They are the front team for Britain’s Got Talent, a show where celebrities are discovered among “ordinary” people and become fodder for the popular press. The pair’s sensitive handling of Susan Boyle after her first performance turned her into a megastar. But they also front I’m a Celebrity … Get Me Out of Here, where famous people are tested and hopefully – from the perspective of “good” television – broken. Created or destroyed, all of it feeds the needs of the celebrity media conveyor belt. Ant and Dec are the innocent face of this celebrity supply machine. They are boyish and good natured, they put participants at ease and guide them through tantrums and disappointments. They have an unusually benign rapport with each other – most showbusiness couples have more edge. Away from the shows, their lives have, until now, been relatively blameless: they don’t behave badly; they take their mothers to the Palace for their gongs; and, phew, they have even married women just when the tabloids were beginning to wonder. Their brand of wholesomeness, playful entertainment and sympathetic rapport with participants is massively important for ITV. By appearing decent and deserving themselves, they make this kind of entertainment, even through its low points, seem acceptable: a quest for innocent celebrity fun. In some respects, Ant and Dec really are deserving. They have certainly worked hard. Ant was brought up by a single mother in Newcastle, and first came to fame as a child actor in the TV series Byker Grove, which is where he met Declan Donnelly. They became friends and after a brief detour into pop, found TV presenting. They’ve lived their lives in the spotlight ever since. And while they now earn fabulous amounts, as the Mail was quick to remind us, their work is far from glamorous. They deal with the unedifying process of celebrity making and breaking from the inside. On Britain’s Got Talent this means dealing with the casting of suitable subjects, and all the artificialities behind the scenes. On I’m a Celebrity, they hang around in sordid conditions outside a fake jungle, holding at bay teams from countries waiting to take over the set, and witnessing endless negotiations with the celebs. This may be enough to drive anyone to drink or to something worse, which itself provides new script lines for a macabre and interactive public soap opera. It’s more than just a powerful irony that McPartlin’s downfall played out this week in the media’s full glare. His clean personality has helped to mask the darker process of celebrification, and made the goal of fame seem unproblematic. His cheerfulness has hidden the downside of fame, the envious hostility it awakens. So perhaps it’s also poetic justice he finds himself mocked by a media that cares little for his distress. There’s an obligatory sequel to the celebrity narrative of “Build them up and knock them down”, an episode called “Let’s see if they can get up again”. McPartlin’s tortured appearance suggests he knows the arc as well as the public. But what does our appetite for this recurring drama say about us? We could look away now and not allow ourselves to get caught up in the process of another human unravelling. Once we might have done so. At least we might have seemed reluctant to be part of the cavalcade. Now we are integral to it. Is that where we want to be? • Ros Coward is a professor of journalism at Roehampton University"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/apr/20/tech-monopoly-apple-facebook-data-extreme-content","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-20T07:00:15Z","webTitle":"The tech titans must have their monopoly broken – and this is how we do it | Vince Cable","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/20/tech-monopoly-apple-facebook-data-extreme-content","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/20/tech-monopoly-apple-facebook-data-extreme-content","fields":{"headline":"The tech titans must have their monopoly broken – and this is how we do it","bodyText":"Data is the new oil. Just as John D Rockefeller’s Standard Oil swept up the spoils of the – initially competitive – oil rush, the future of the internet will be shaped by a handful of tech titans, including Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon and their Chinese equivalents Tencent, Alibaba and Baidu. Today, around 90% of internet searches are via Google, and 94% of young people who use social media have a Facebook profile. Just 1% of smartphones use an operating system that isn’t iOS or Android – made by Apple and Google. But the challenge we now face has one key difference to that posed by the oil barons. Rather than price-fixing, many of the tech titans provide a largely “free” service to the public. Facebook and Google don’t make most of their money through selling services to users, but through advertising. Amazon and Apple, meanwhile, do make money the traditional way, but corner their markets through other means, by squeezing suppliers in the former case or locking in users through software and hardware exclusivity in the latter. So why do these new monopolies pose a problem? Firstly, because they hold back innovation. By acquiring potential challengers before they become a threat, spending millions lobbying governments to ensure their economic interests are protected, and tying in users through the sheer scale of features and social interaction they offer, the tech giants’ dominant position often leaves entrepreneurs feeling they have no choice but to sell up, or close up. This is bad for innovation and bad for consumer choice – two things the tech giants once stood for. In addition, the tech titans have lost the ability to monitor what content gets put on their own platforms. A small minority of users are posting terrorist propaganda, depictions of child sex abuse, and hate speech. State and non-state actors use these platforms to spread false information and influence elections, including the Brexit referendum and the recent US presidential election. Facebook, YouTube and Twitter are either unable or unwilling to curb the misuse of the data they collect, and are increasingly seen as part of the problem. Finally, the new internet giants operate in a largely borderless world where their main source of profit is intangible intellectual property rather than measurable “things”. This is difficult to track and quantify, and has turned national tax authorities into largely powerless bystanders. Of course, any new technology is open to abuse, and the internet has also been an outstanding force for good in its short history. It has empowered activists and investigative journalists in fighting for democracy and exposing corruption, and amplified important campaigns like the #MeToo movement and recent anti-gun marches in the United States. But we stand at a crossroads. One way leads to monopoly and abuse. The other way continues the road to empowerment and liberation. How should we respond? As liberals we must show that to be radical in this field is not to be statist. We do not accept a Hobson’s choice between the entrenched private monopolies which are becoming the status quo, or direct state control over the internet, as is being developed in China. First, we must revive the trust-busting spirit of previous generations. Competition authorities should be primarily concerned with takeovers which stifle innovation or involve the acquisition of large quantities of valuable data. More radically, companies should be broken up when their size becomes economically detrimental. One could imagine Amazon being split into three separate businesses: one offering cloud computing, one acting as a general retailer and one offering a third-party marketplace. Facebook could be made to sell off Instagram and WhatsApp, Google could divest itself of YouTube – in the process creating new competitors for themselves. Second, internet companies should be held accountable for extreme content posted on their platforms through the establishment of a new independent standards body governing the handling of such content. This would put an end to the current “wild west” approach of self-regulation and haphazard government responses to tech-company failures. This is preferable to the draconian system recently put in place by Germany, which has already led to excessive censorship by private companies and a backlog of court appeals and disputes. Third, concerns over the manipulation of data can be met in part through greater transparency, requiring search algorithms to be made available to the authorities and by requiring commercially used databases to be available for a variety of uses. Such principles become even more important as the data giants develop the use of AI, where there is even more potential for monopoly abuse and manipulation. Finally, we must entrench and expand the rights of people to own their personal data. The EU’s new General Data Protection Regulation is a big step forward in this direction, but it clearly needs to be tested in practice. And it is just the beginning, not the end of the story. We should seriously consider the possibility of compensating people – or society more broadly – financially for the data they currently hand over for nothing. All four of these suggestions require Britain to be a truly global nation, leading these debates rather than following on the coat-tails of others. The UK cannot do this alone. It will require a regulatory authority with far more clout. How tragic then, that the most effective competition authority in the capitalist world – one that has already fined Google €2.4bn for market abuse – is the European commission. As the world grows closer together, Britain commits an act of serious self-harm by doggedly setting itself apart from the power of shared sovereignty with our neighbours. When it comes to regulating the new oil – data – Brexit is the equivalent of giving up shared influence over where, when and whether it rains, in return for absolute power over a compact umbrella. • Vince Cable is leader of the Liberal Democrats and former secretary of state for business"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/apr/19/leaseholders-of-flats-face-40000-bills-over-grenfell-type-cladding","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-19T17:53:29Z","webTitle":"Leaseholders of flats face £40,000 bills over Grenfell type cladding","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/apr/19/leaseholders-of-flats-face-40000-bills-over-grenfell-type-cladding","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/apr/19/leaseholders-of-flats-face-40000-bills-over-grenfell-type-cladding","fields":{"headline":"Leaseholders of flats face £40,000 bills over Grenfell type cladding","bodyText":"Residents of 80 flats whose freeholds are managed by a company owned by David Cameron’s half brother-in-law are each facing bills of up to £40,000 because the building is clad with flammable panels similar to those used on Grenfell Tower, in London. Leaseholders of the Sesame apartments in Battersea, south London, fear they are trapped in unsellable homes and William Astor’s company claims it is not responsible for the costs. A spokesman said the firm’s duty was to the unnamed pension fund which owned the freehold and on whose behalf the firm managed the building. Astor’s company is about to send the leaseholders £8,000 bills to cover a new fire alarm and the cost of a 24-hour watch in the building, following the fire on 14 June 2017 at Grenfell Tower, North Kensington, which claimed 71 lives. Leaseholders fear a further £2.2m bill for replacing the combustible panels that failed fire tests last year could also fall to them. Astor’s company has said it hoped insurers and warranty providers would pay the bill. Across England 306 residential buildings, with a height of more than 18 storeys, have been identified as having cladding that has failed fire tests. In common with many other blocks the cladding at the Sesame apartments is still in place but the “stay-put policy” for residents in the event of a fire there has been abandoned in favour of evacuation. According to the planning documents the cladding specified on the building was made by Alucobond, a Germany-based company, which said that it withdrew aluminium composite cladding panels with a combustible polyethylene core in 2014. The same brand of cladding was used at a complex including 1,000 flats at New Capital Quay, Greenwich, where one residentwas told by a surveyor that her £475,000 flat had been slashed in value to £50,000. The Sesame apartments case was debated in parliament on Thursday. The Labour MP for Battersea, Marsha de Cordova, said: “Leaseholders are still being left in limbo about whether they will be footing the bill. But it is not leaseholders who have failed to upgrade buildings or cut corners with safety regulations. The burden should not fall on them. The government says it would be morally wrong for leaseholders to be held liable for the costs, but these must not be empty words. It has the power and it has the duty to intervene.” Several of the residents own only a fraction of their flats under a shared ownership scheme, but have told de Cordova that they have been informed they will be liable for 100% of the remedial costs. One said: “I am facing being trapped in an unsaleable property for which I’ll likely have to pay service charges that I cannot afford. I thought I was doing everything right when I saved up in my 20s to buy a home, and now my future looks dire.” Astor, whose full title is The Hon William Waldorf Astor IV, is the owner of two companies which manage the block as part of his freehold property business, which includes freeholds of 150,000 properties, his spokesman said. He is a scion of the wealthy Astor family and half-brother of Samantha Cameron, the wife of the former prime minister. This article was amended on 20 April 2018.

He was flamboyant, personable and sensitive, once saying: “Every guy in the world would love to be Mr Macho, but I am camp and you cannot lie to the public. If you’re yourself, they’ll either love you or they won’t.” The British version of Supermarket Sweep, based on an American format, featured contestants answering questions and riddles, giving them the opportunity to run around the studio supermarket filling their trolleys in a bid to get through to the final Super Sweep, with a £2,000 prize at stake. It ran in ITV’s daytime schedule from 1993 to 2001 and was revived in 2007, with the top prize value increased to £5,000. After hosting national lottery results shows from 1996, Winton had a long run on peak-time television as presenter of The National Lottery: In It to Win It (2002-16), with contestants battling on winners’ row for a potential prize of £100,000. Dale was born in London to Gary Winton, who owned a furniture shop, and Shirley (nee Patrick), who acted as Sheree Winton and was dubbed “the English Jayne Mansfield” for her appearances in film and TV comedies alongside stars such as Spike Milligan, Bing Crosby, Bob Hope, Terry-Thomas, Sid James and Frankie Howerd. Dale was named after Dale Robertson, star of the TV western Tales of Wells Fargo. His parents divorced when he was 11 and his father died two years later. At the age of 21, Dale found his mother – who had depression – dead in her bedroom after taking an overdose of barbiturates. It was her fourth attempt to take her own life. Winton revealed in his 2002 autobiography, My Story, that he had never told her that he was gay. He also talked on the TV programme Loose Women in 2016 about having depression himself while coping with the end of a relationship. “I should have taken myself off the TV, but I didn’t,” he said. “I always thought, ‘Get over yourself.’ But my mum died of it. It exists and anybody out there who has had it knows it exists. I would not leave the house. Five years. I’ve totally got through it. It was triggered by a very bad break-up.” Although his mother hoped he would become a lawyer or accountant, Winton left Aldenham school, Hertfordshire, at 16, determined to have his own career in show business. He went through a string of jobs, including selling timeshare apartments abroad, while working as a DJ in clubs in Richmond upon Thames and other parts of London. In 1974, he was given his own radio show on the United Biscuits Network, which broadcast to the company’s employees in factories across Britain, then three years later joined Radio Trent in Nottingham. Stints followed at Radio Danube in Yugoslavia, Chiltern Radio in Luton and Beacon Radio in Wolverhampton. By then, he had broken into television with Pet Watch (1986), appearing alongside the vet Bruce Fogle – father of the presenter Ben – in a Sunday early-evening show about keeping domestic animals, and had his own chatshow on the Lifestyle Channel a year later. Following the launch of Supermarket Sweep, he hosted The Weekend Show (1995) for the BBC, featuring quirky and feelgood stories from around the country. At the same time, he presented Pets Win Prizes (1995-96), with animals in games such as owl races and Hard Hat Hamster, and Terry Nutkins adjudicating. Winton also hosted The Other Half (1997-2002), with the challenge of guessing opponents’ partners, Touch the Truck (2001), an endurance game featuring a group of 20 people touching a stationary truck, with the last one left being the winner, and the first series of Hole in the Wall (2008), where contestants contorted themselves to fit through holes in a moving wall. Proud to have lost more than 32kg (5st) since weighing 114kg (18st) as a teenager – “I was like a walking blancmange,” he said – Winton presented Weight of the Nation (1999), encouraging people to lose the pounds in the BBC’s Fighting Fat, Fighting Fit season. He also hosted three series of Celebrity Fit Club between 2004 and 2006. He presented several editions of Top of the Pops in 1995 and 1996. His BBC Radio 2 shows included Pick of the Pops (2000-10) – taking over from a retiring Alan Freeman – and he occasionally stood in for Steve Wright and Liza Tarbuck. The star even scraped into the singles charts with Supermarket Sweep (Will You Dance with Me), reaching No 72 in 1994. Celebrity status also led Winton to be cast as an irritating gameshow host in the 1996 film Trainspotting and he had fun on TV playing Lord Saruman the White in a 2002 French and Saunders Easter special, and Thomas in the 2011 Comic Relief spoof Uptown Downstairs Abbey. He appeared as himself hosting Our Lady Air’s annual steward of the year competition in Matt Lucas and David Walliams’s mockumentary account of airport life, Come Fly With Me (2010-11). The first episode of a new series, Dale Winton’s Florida Fly Drive, was shown in February. The remaining three episodes will follow in early summer. • Dale Jonathan Winton, television and radio presenter, born 22 May 1955; died 18 April 2018"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"money/2018/apr/21/renting-property-how-does-it-compare-around-the-world","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-21T06:00:07Z","webTitle":"Renting property: how does it compare around the world?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2018/apr/21/renting-property-how-does-it-compare-around-the-world","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2018/apr/21/renting-property-how-does-it-compare-around-the-world","fields":{"headline":"Renting property: how does it compare around the world?","bodyText":"Germany In the former textile quarter of the southern German city of Augsburg, Matthew Robinson, a 35-year-old school teacher, his wife Karoline and their two toddler daughters live in a three-room flat with a balcony that runs almost the entire length. It looks out over former brick factories-turned-flats, a park and a stream, along which Matthew cycles to work. The monthly rent for the 80 sq metre space is €1,090 (£948), made up of €780 in net “cold” rent, €200 for all the amenities, €60 for a garage parking space and €50 for the built-in kitchen. “Having rented in the UK before where I always had the feeling it was in my interest to keep the landlord happy and if anyone complained I could get turfed out. Here it feels a lot more secure,” the UK-born German citizen says. “Our landlord sent us a present when our daughter was born, and doesn’t forget us at Christmas, and he sorts repairs out immediately. I get the feeling he wants to keep us happy and that’s a good feeling.” The law would not allow their landlord, a police detective, to get rid of them on a whim, even if he wanted to. He is also restricted by law as to how much he can raise the rent. Despite their contentedness over renting – which most Germans tend to do all their lives, typically downsizing once the children have flown the nest and when a wage-related pension has to cover the monthly payments – the Robinsons admit they would like to own their own place one day. But for now, as has been the case over the past eight years, renting feels like a safe and cost-efficient option for them. This remains the choice for the majority of Germans, who are at the bottom of the list of European homeowners, with just 46% of households owning their own home. People much prefer to rent, for a number of reasons which range from the historical to cultural and economic. Wartime bombing destroyed about 20% of residential areas in German towns and cities, at the same time as refugees from eastern parts of the former Reich who had lost everything, streamed into the country and in 1950 there was a drastic lack of living quarters. Culturally, there is nothing like the drive to want to own as there is in other countries. Banks do not help by being unlikely to give a mortgage to anyone unless they can provide 20% of the purchase price, and on top of that high add-on costs such as extortionate estate agent fees (typically 7.14%) and stamp duty of up to 6.5% do little to entice people to buy. Renters have felt safe in the knowledge that the law is more on their side than that of the landlord. However in recent years soaring rents in many German cities – often fuelled by largely foreign buyer-driven property booms currently being experienced in cities such as Berlin and Munich – have led to increasing social disgruntlement, sparking a recent wave of street protests across the country. However, the percentage of their income Germans pay for rent is still relatively low compared with other countries – 25% in Munich, 21% in Berlin, Cologne and Frankfurt, while the national average is 27%. This compares favourably with London, Warsaw, Madrid or Rome, where it is more than 40%. While this remains the case, few people will have an incentive to buy, experts believe. Spain Spain has traditionally had a high rate of home ownership, about 80% in 2008, when the building boom ended and the bubble burst. It has now slipped back to about 78% but is likely to fall further as unemployment remains high and mortgages difficult to obtain. An inevitable result has been a rise in rentals and rents. Rents have been pushed up by demand but also by Airbnb and other holiday rental platforms. According the housing platform Idealista, rents in Barcelona have risen 55% since 2012 (23% in Madrid). Rental contracts tend to be for one or three years, after which they may be terminated or renewed and the rent renegotiated. Rent-controlled apartments dating back to the Franco era have mostly disappeared. Increasingly landlords in tourist areas are demanding excessive rents to force tenants out, so they can turn apartments into lucrative holiday rentals. A flat with a rent of €1,000 a month can make five times that as a holiday let. Eviction also continues to be a serious problem as lenders are reluctant to negotiate terms. Ireland Price controls were introduced in early 2017 amid soaring rents in Dublin’s super-heated property market. The “rent predictability measure” caps increases to 4% a year for three years. But, one year later, the rent controls have done little to halt rises. According to website daft.ie, rents jumped 10.4% in Dublin in 2017, and at an average of £1,476 in the north of the city and £1,675 in the south, are now substantially higher than the average for London (£1,276). Like the UK, high deposits and high house prices – along with strict lending rules – are turning home ownership into a distant dream for many young Irish workers, particularly in the capital. Home ownership rates peaked at 80.1% in 1991, but have now fallen below 70%. Amid a worsening homelessness crisis and a lack of housebuilding since the country’s economic crash in 2007-08, housing has moved to the top of the political agenda. Stories of desperate queues at new housing developments abound, while just a fortnight ago more than 10,000 marched through the capital demanding action on housing. United States Rent controls and tenancy protections in the US are decided at the state level. In dozens of states, laws promoted by the conservative American Legislative Exchange Council, such as Illinois’ 1997 Rent Control Preemption Act, prohibit municipalities from passing laws that regulates rent. Last month, an advisory referendum in Chicago to lift the ban on rent control won 77% approval. The “Lift The Ban” coalition says a third of Chicago households cannot find affordable housing, and that a minimum wage worker will have to work 106 hours a week to afford the average city rent. Elsewhere in the US, New York has the longest history of rent controls. More than 1m apartments in the city are rent-regulated under a complex set of laws. A tiny number have full rent control, with rents substantially below commercial levels. The vast majority enjoy rent stabilisation, controlled by the Rent Guidelines Board. It froze rents in 2015 and 2016 but in 2017 voted to allow landlords rises of up to 2%. Home ownership levels have been falling in the US in common with much of the developed world. It peaked in 2004 at 69.2%, then fell to 62.9% in 2016, though it has recovered mildly since then. France French tenants benefit from much stricter rules on landlords than in Britain. Rents on unfurnished dwellings are only allowed to be increased by an index, called the IRL. This year it permits an annual increase of 0.51%, and was close to zero for much of 2015 and 2016. Anyone renting an unfurnished property as their main residence is given a minimum three-year tenancy with an automatic right of renewal after three years, or must give three months’ notice if they want to leave. If the landlord wants the tenant to leave, they must give them a minimum of six months’ notice. Landlords must also give the tenant a first right of refusal if they wish to sell. What’s more, eviction is forbidden in the winter months. A rule called la trêve hivernale (the winter truce) runs for five months from 1 November when landlords are not allowed to evict their tenants for any reason. It is meant as a humanitarian measure, but it also means evictions jump on 1 April."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"politics/2018/apr/19/robert-halfons-views-on-education-cause-concern","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-19T17:17:17Z","webTitle":"Robert Halfon’s views on education cause concern | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/apr/19/robert-halfons-views-on-education-cause-concern","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/apr/19/robert-halfons-views-on-education-cause-concern","fields":{"headline":"Robert Halfon’s views on education cause concern","bodyText":"Robert Halfon’s quaint notion that vocational training should pass the “dinner-party test” is an indicator of how shallow his supposed blue-collar Conservatism is (‘The Tory party should change its name to the Workers’ party. I am 100% serious’, 17 April). How many people bringing children up in poverty are going to dinner parties where they would be looked down on because their child is an apprentice? His concern seems to lie with middle-class children in degree apprenticeships for lucrative, skilled jobs such as coding. The concerns of working-class parents and students are far more pragmatic, and many of them arise from the past eight years of Tory government: reduced access to free school meals, dwindling school budgets, the discriminatory and repressive use of Prevent in education, and higher tuition fees. Nor do working-class students want access to university education only on the proviso that they study highly employable subjects like engineering, while their middle-class peers can afford to study medieval history. Subjects like classics and ancient history might be seen as a luxury by some, but it has served Mr Halfon’s colleagues Michael Fallon and Boris Johnson well in their careers. A society serious about democratic representation and equality of opportunity must offer working-class students the option of pursuing the same path to government. Robert Halfon may be right that the Conservative party would be better represented by a “ladder” – the one that they have been pulling up after them since Thatcher. And finally, lifted from the text to the headline, like a jewel gifted from the gods of comedy, is the laughable, suggestion that the Tories should rebrand themselves “The Workers’ party”. Pure Orwell. Laura McAlpine Labour PPC for Harlow and the Villages • A working-class Tory he may be, but Robert Halfon is dragging out the same outdated Victorian philanthropy in his views on education . He belatedly discovers that abolishing the charitable status of private schools would be dauntingly complex. Does he perhaps mean that it would also be dauntingly complex to explain it to some of the Tories’ own rich donors and voters? Bursaries and assisted places do not solve the problem. In the end only 7% of children attend these schools. This is why, in 1944, another Tory (a grandee interestingly, RA Butler) wanted to abolish them outright but was talked out of it by Churchill. Can Radical Robert explain why no other country in developed Europe has our ridiculously fractured system of education? David Redshaw Gravesend, Kent • In Peter Wilby’s account of his interview with the education select committee chair, Robert Halfon MP, we learn that Halfon has voiced a distinct antipathy to medieval studies. Unlike university students of healthcare, coding, construction or engineering, who in Halfon’s view should be given discounted fees, undergraduate medievalists should, according to him, “pay full whack”. I wonder what Halfon would make of Carly Fiorina, who was CEO of the computer giant HP from 1999 to 2005 and the first woman to lead a Fortune Magazine top-20 company? Her first degree was in philosophy and medieval history. Small wonder that Wilby points out Halfon has “near-zero experience of business”. David Head Peterborough • Despite his “ladder of opportunity”, laying out “the statistics of educational inequality”, Robert Halfon’s desire for a “more socially just system” is clearly yet another example of empty Tory rhetoric. He might well suggest that A-levels should be replaced, but knows full well that, in many public schools, the process has already started. Following the cheating scandal exposed by the Guardian last summer, Halfon’s select committee questioned the head of Eton, a director of Ofqual and the chief executive of Cambridge Assessment International Education (CIE), which runs the Pre-U examinations, around which the cheating was focussed. Even when the head admitted seven of his staff were involved in these examinations, either marking or setting papers, and the CIE chief admitted his organisation was not a member of the Joint Council for Qualifications, which inspects and regulates all other public examinations, the committee displayed none of the indignation or disgust one would expect at the revelation of such unfairness. Not one member of the committee, Halfon included, thought it necessary to delve deeper, and ask, for example, about why so many public schools prefer Pre-U exams to the traditional A-levels. Wilby and others may not regard Halfon as an “orthodox Conservative”, but someone in a position of authority who refuses to challenge instances of obvious unjustness sounds pretty typical of 21st-century Toryism to me!

But to influence Russia may require a very different approach from the west and a better understanding of what drives Russia to act in the way it does. While in no way wishing to defend or excuse the Russian support for Assad, it is perhaps understandable why Russia, a proud but economically weak country (GDP similar to Italy), should use every means to reassert its position as a “great power” capable of influencing the course of history in the 21st century. Is it unreasonable for Russia to want to maintain its naval base in Syria when the UK has a military airfield in Cyprus and France stations its warplanes in Jordan? In a recent tweet, Donald Trump said the US would be prepared to help Russia to restore its economy. If America and the west could go further and assure President Putin that they genuinely pose no threat to Russia it might be the first step to bringing Russia back into greater cooperation in global issues. To seek a genuine rapprochement with Russia would require a statesman or woman with both vision and courage, but if we want to avoid the worsening of relations over issues such as Syria, someone has to do it. Mick Penney Dronfield, Derbyshire Technology trumps all John Naughton is right that dubious social media activity wasn’t the only factor in the Brexit and Trump election results (“Why we should stop panicking about robots stealing our jobs”, The Networker, New Review). Inequality and austerity were big drivers. But was it so “implausible that the technology was the key element”? It depends what you mean by “key”. In each case, the winner just managed to get their nose in front – Trump didn’t even secure a majority of the votes. It’s in just such circumstances, where the result is extremely close but the winner takes all, that stratagems like those that were used can be so effective. From what we know now, thanks in large part to the Observer, it seems entirely plausible that, to adapt the now legendary Sun headline, “It’s Cambridge Analytica wot won it”. Ron Glatter Hemel Hempstead, Herts Memories of cardboard city Your archive photo brought back memories of my time with the City of London cleansing department during the hot summer of 1989 (“The cardboard city they called home”, Comment, last week). It was shortly before the service was privatised. I had recently finished college and was saving to go travelling. The job was basically sweeping the streets at night and was a real insight into how people lived on the streets. The culture was very much Thatcherism, upward mobility and the accumulation of wealth by “yuppies”. What an eye-opener to go down into a subway to be confronted by 20 people lying on cardboard with an old blanket or sleeping bag. We would have to wake them and ask them to clear all their possessions before another team came to hose the area down. This happened nightly. I don’t remember anyone moaning at us too much; they would be lying back down on the floor of the subway still soaking. Even sadder is the fact that today the situation seems just as bad. How can a country of our wealth accept this? There seems so little will to improve the lot of homeless people that I doubt anything will have changed in another 30 years’ time. Bruce Wells Haywards Heath, West Sussex A good use for £1bn I have a suggestion on how to deploy the unspent £1bn allocated to the failing National Citizen Service holiday programmes (‘‘Financial doubts over ‘big society’ flagship scheme’’, News). Allocate it to the country’s underfunded local youth work services, decimated since 2010. These could then provide young people with the facilities they routinely seek all year round: somewhere to meet, something interesting to do and a skilled adult to talk to about their hopes and fears. Tom Wylie Oxford Powell has a lot to answer for Michael Savage’s article (“Rivers of blood? The school that fought back against the rhetoric of Enoch Powell”, special report, last week) certainly resonated with me. In 1968, I was a trainee social worker in Sheffield, working among West Indian immigrants. One couple I was involved with had recently arrived from Grenada with their four children; I was helping them to settle into their strange new country. A fifth child was on the way. A day after Powell’s “rivers of blood” speech, I called to see them. They had read the speech in the papers and listened to it on the radio. I can see now in my mind’s eye the look of bewilderment and hurt in their eyes. They had genuinely believed they were wanted in Britain and had been encouraged to leave their native island by the British government. For the past half century, I have lived in rural Cumbria where there is only a small minority of people of colour. I firmly believe that prejudice is invariably based on ignorance: people who have always belonged to an all-white community inevitably harbour misconceptions about those of a different skin colour. Rightwing parties such as Ukip are adept at playing on this ignorance. Powell and his views on immigration were the precursor to Nigel Farage and his claims that immigrants, and foreigners in general, are largely bad news. Alison Thompson Thursby, Carlisle Suffragette or suffragist? Caroline Criado-Perez is undoubtedly a formidable advocate for women’s issues (“The feminist activist putting women in their proper place”, New Review). However, the campaign to put a statue of Millicent Fawcett in Parliament Square was not as smooth as presented. Her petition was to put a statue of a suffragette in Parliament Square to mark 100 years of female suffrage. A total of 84,734 people signed it. However, the statue is not of a suffragette, but of the suffragist Fawcett. “Suffragettes”, members of the Pankhurst-led Women’s Social and Political Union, believed in direct action, even engaging in law-breaking from 1912. The “suffragists”, under Fawcett, adopted only constitutional, law-abiding tactics. Did Criado-Perez not know the difference? Certainly many of those who signed her original petition did. Yet they were not consulted about her change of focus.

The Penn Museum in Philadelphia has long been home to one of the world’s most significant collections of ancient artifacts from the region – but for years, only a limited number of pieces were shown in encyclopedic, old-school displays that did not do them justice. Now, after a $5m renovation lasting more than three years, the museum is reopening its Middle East galleries, having substantially expanded and completely reconceived them – with more than half of the nearly 1,200 objects on view to the public for the first time. “This is one of the most important collections from the Middle East anywhere in the world,” said the Penn Museum director, Julian Siggers. “The material here is in every single art history textbook.” The centerpiece is the section on the Royal Cemetery at Ur, in what’s now southern Iraq, which Penn excavated in partnership with the British Museum from 1922 to 1934. Agatha Christie herself visited during the legendary expedition, which inspired her novel Murder in Mesopotamia. Dating to about 2,450BC, the site contained more than 2,000 Sumerian graves, of which 16 were determined to belong to royalty. Little is known about the woman known as Queen Puabi, but her burial finery – a stunning gold headdress, elaborate jewelry and a “cloak” made of more than 50 strands of carnelian, lapis lazuli and agate beads – is so sumptuous that the dozens of alabaster vessels and bowls and jars made of precious metals that she was buried with utterly pale in comparison. Other highlights of the Royal Cemetery are a lyre decorated with a huge bull’s head in gold, silver and shell mosaic that is one of the oldest known musical instruments and the famous Ram in the Thicket, one of a pair of exquisite gold and lapis lazuli statuettes, whose mate is at the British Museum. The sinister side of all of this wealth and finery was a “death pit”, where dozens of royal attendants were buried after being killed by blows to the head after the death of their master. But the new permanent Middle East galleries are not just about riches and treasure – though there is plenty of it. Through artifacts both extraordinary and commonplace, the exhibits chart the course of human development in the Fertile Crescent over a period of almost 10,000 years, examining the transition to farming and sedentary life, along with numerous associated inventions. “The first cities, the first writing, first irrigation, first metallurgy – all of these innovations which our own people have built on – start right here in this region, and here is the tangible evidence of that,” said Siggers. The exhibits draw from Penn’s collection of more than 100,000 artifacts from the Middle East, the result of decades of research there. In 1889, the university sponsored an expedition to Nippur – the first American-led excavation in Mesopotamia – and it later went on to explore some 40 sites in what is now Iraq and Iran. While the oldest items on display are charred seeds from about nine millennia ago that indicate early crop cultivation, the story really gets under way with a pottery jar, circa 5,400 to 5,000BC, that’s one of the world’s earliest known wine vessels. Sections on tools, illustrated seals and sacred objects show how, within another two millennia, the inhabitants of Mesopotamia had begun to organize their settlements into cities, with established political, economic and religious structures. By around 3,000BC, the Sumerians had developed cuneiform – first, pictographic symbols, and later, wedge-shaped markings. “This is the moment when writing is invented,” said curator Holly Pittman. “This is a period when [people] visually describe a lot of the world that they live in. It’s a technology of knowledge. And it happens really fast.” An array of cuneiform tablets demonstrate how the use of writing spread, first for trade and economic needs and later for religious and literary purposes. A “spreadsheet” from 1,400BC Nippur, for example, lists 3,000 cattle coming from other sites to be used for a plowing project, while a medical text describes recipes for poultices. Several pieces narrate parts of the epic of Gilgamesh, considered one of the world’s first literary works. An animated projection simulates the experience of walking through Ur – at one point home to more than 20,000 people – showing merchants conducting business, the courtyard of the sacred moon god and a panoramic view from the roof of a temple. The last 3,000 or so years are covered in less depth, but significant works include a monumental relief of a genie, circa 883 to 859BC, from the palace of Assyrian king Ashurnasirpal II in Nimrud – a site the Islamic State largely destroyed in 2015. From the Islamic period come gorgeous tiles and ceramic dishes, mainly from Rayy, once a thriving city near modern-day Tehran until it was sacked by the Mongols in the early 13th century. Some of the most evocative objects aren’t the elaborate jewelry or monuments to kings or gods but the mundane articles of daily life, such as a baby’s footprint lovingly preserved in clay nearly 4,000 years ago by a new parent, or the 3,750-year-old school tablet on which a student practiced the same cuneiform letter 360 times. In the end, what’s most compelling about these rooms of ancient artifacts is the vast sweep of human history they narrate – and the commonalities it reveals between our lives today and those of people millennia before us."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/apr/25/save-rare-estate-houses-demolition-demo-communities-in-it-together","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-25T14:15:50Z","webTitle":"How do we save our estate from demolition?

We’re trying everything from a local demo to a bat survey","bodyText":"Our community of 70 families is facing being made homeless by our landlord, who wants to knock down our estate to build executive-style houses to sell for profit. They are rare houses of a specific construction – built by the National Coal Board in the 1950s – and can be modernised without being knocked down. We have organised a lot around this application. We’ve put signs up with our “Save our homes” logo and have a banner prominently displayed. We have residents’ meetings, a regular newsletter updating residents, a website and a change.org petition, as well as a Facebook account and are hoping to have a local demo in May. We have even organised a bat survey on the building to see whether any bats shelter in the property – which protects a building from being demolished, as a last resort. We feel our landlord is making contradictory statements about whether we will get to keep our tenancies. In some cases they say they won’t be able to decide on the tenure of the new homes until they have planning permission, but at other points they have said it is unlikely we will be forced out or that we would be made to leave at all. This is confusing, as the planning application – to bulldoze over where we live and replace it with new houses – has always stayed the same. Our campaign has had some success so far. There are lots of objections on the planning site, not just from our estate but from friends and family outside, and others who have heard about our campaign. Due to the large number of objections the decision will go before a panel where we will get the chance to have our say, probably in June. But amid all this campaigning, we are fearful it may amount to nothing. While many of us on the estate are low-income families, we are all private tenants, and feel it is harder to get the same national attention and outrage that is received when social housing is being demolished. How can we protect our homes and stop the demolition of these rare, truly affordable homes that are so vital to our sense of community, home, and the right to be housed for low-income groups in Leeds? What an impressive campaign, and what a sad situation. A local demo will be a good way to broaden your appeal. Think about holding it earlier – with local elections coming, you can show politicians you are serious, and that local people care about this campaign. Look through Leeds council’s local plan, and check whether this development disagrees with its aims in any areas, be it around affordable housing, the environment, or conservation – this is important for the panel. Refurbishment is generally a greener option than demolition, and that should play a strong role in the council’s considerations. And think about other possible interest groups you can bring in, like ex-mining communities that care about the legacy of these properties. I spoke to successful housing campaigners for you. Glyn Harries, from the New Era campaign says to start thinking about direct action. Decide for yourselves: what happens if push comes to shove? What are you willing to do? And are there concrete actions you can start developing now? Make it clear that you are willing to take non-violent direct action. One simple thing, is deciding to make a clear statement on whether you plan to leave your homes. Dr Stuart Hodkinson from Leeds University says: “They might be private renters with fewer rights, but if all 70 say they have no plans to leave, it will be a big financial operation to evict them all.” Consider your options: could you create a non-profit organisation and seek to buy the homes yourself, with fundraising? If you don’t want the homes to be demolished, you should also get expert advice. Find out what all the costs will be – of eviction, redevelopment, or potential homelessness – so you can make people aware of what costs the private developer may be avoiding, and who will end up paying for it – for example, in their tax bill. And look at the cost of alternatives, like bringing these homes up to a decent standard instead of demolition. Look into the developer too: find out what other companies it has links with, look into its accounts at companies house, see what other developments it owns, and talk to residents from those homes to see how they live – all these things will help you to know what you’re up against, and just what kind of company it is. You have a lot of friends out there – activists who have won successful campaigns, like New Era and Sweets Way have offered their contacts, and the Butterfield estate could have good advice. Let me know if you want more details. Generation Rent has agreed to put you in touch with individuals where you are. Hodkinson has asked me to pass on his number. Finally, say Harries and Hodkinson, celebrity doesn’t hurt. You’re a well-oiled machine, but if you had a well-known Yorkshireperson backing your cause, it would bring huge public attention. Think about who that might be. • What do you think? Or have you got a question for Poppy and readers to consider?

It was part of the buildup to the Commonwealth heads of government meeting, the summit of leaders of 53 countries representing more than 2 billion people. I shook the prince’s hand with my right hand. In my other, I was holding a copy of an anthology, We Mark Your Memory: Writing from the Descendants of Indenture, in which I have an essay published. I told him that my mother was born in Guyana and that the anthology had collected hidden histories of indenture. “And where are you from?” asked the prince. “Manchester, UK,” I said. “Well, you don’t look like it!” he said, and laughed. He was then ushered on to the next person. Although I have experienced such off-the-cuff, supposedly humorous, comments before, I was stunned by the gaffe. Prince Charles was endorsed by the Queen, in her opening speech to the heads of government, to be the future head of the Commonwealth: it’s her “sincere wish” that he become so. That the mooted next leader of an organisation that represents one-third of the people on the planet commented that I, a brown woman, did not look as if I was from a city in the UK is shocking. This is exactly why some people, including the prince, urgently need a history lesson about immigration, the British empire, the Commonwealth and colonialism. Because I do look like I’m from Manchester, actually – a city in which many people of colour have been born and bred. Growing up in Manchester, and going to school in Rusholme, a multicultural area in that city, I remember being taught nothing in history lessons about the Commonwealth (I have four different Commonwealth countries in my heritage). If such vital knowledge was more ingrained there would not be so much racism and ignorance. Whatever the prince meant or didn’t mean in our fleeting encounter, since it happened I have been through all the feelings – from shock to humiliation to rage. Most of all, I feel angry that there could be such casual ignorance in the corridors of power, an ignorance that also permeates society – not least because some British people of colour invited here have been threatened with deportation. They don’t look like they are from here, according to some. So what does a British person look like? A British person can look like me. A British person can have black or brown, not only white, skin and still be just as British (this shouldn’t need to be spelled out in black and white). I could have proven that I was born in Manchester and that I am British, as I had my passport in my handbag – I’d needed it to get through the venue’s security. Yet I can’t tell Prince Charles exactly where I am from originally – that old chestnut. Why? Because the British destroyed much of the evidence that my ancestors were shipped over from India in the 19th century to toil for the empire as indentured labourers on sugar colonies in the Caribbean. I have been to the National Archives in Georgetown, Guyana, to search for my ancestral history and stared down a gaping hole where records of lives should have been. The British destroyed so much that could properly explain and evidence our identities. Of course, allegations of racism are not new for the royal family. The Duke Of Edinburgh has made numerous contentious comments; and only last year Princess Michael of Kent wore a blackamoor brooch while meeting Prince Harry’s fiancee, Meghan Markle. We need to skip a generation so that Prince Charles does not become king of the UK or head of the Commonwealth, and these privileges pass to leaders more enlightened (don’t forget, the role of head of the Commonwealth is not hereditary). I have a message for Prince Charles. Your Royal Highness, you asked me: “Where are you from?” To adapt a phrase from the late Ambalavaner Sivanandan: I am here because you were there. •Anita Sethi is a writer and has contributed to the forthcoming anthology, We Mark Your Memory: Writing from the Descendants of Indenture • This article was amended on 23 April 2018 to correct “king of England” to “king of the UK”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"film/2018/apr/22/obey-review-jamie-jones-london-riots","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-22T21:00:32Z","webTitle":"Obey review – powerful, emotional debut dramatises 2011 London riots","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/apr/22/obey-review-jamie-jones-london-riots","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/apr/22/obey-review-jamie-jones-london-riots","fields":{"headline":"Obey review – powerful, emotional debut dramatises 2011 London riots","bodyText":"This movie, from first-time feature director Jamie Jones, takes place amid the London riots of 2011 and the white noise of rage and desperation they both caused and fed off, as the police shooting of Mark Duggan in Tottenham triggered angry protests that degenerated into nationwide violence and looting. As the title implies, the film is about power. It is about submitting to the imperatives of sex, friendship and family, and asks what it was like to live in that atmosphere, to inhale its microbes of anger and fear, and to contend with the decibel count of aggression on the streets. One of the film’s most insightful moments comes when the three main characters go on a bucolic narrowboat ride along the River Lea; the sudden calm and silence are startling and healing. It is the noisy and clamorous city that is poisoning people’s hearts. Obey is a well-directed, well-acted film that cleverly meshes news footage of the riots with staged fictional scenes, and there is a strong central performance from Marcus Rutherford as Leon, a young man just out of care, back at home with his caring but lonely and alcoholic single mum, Chelsea (an excellent performance from T’Nia Miller) and channelling his energies into boxing. When social tensions escalate, Leon finds himself in a crisis of loyalty among his friends, while falling for a beautiful social justice warrior/trustafarian white girl, Twiggy (Sophie Kennedy Clark), who is temporarily in a squat, though with the safety net of a comfortable family home out in the shires. My reservations about the film centre on its tendency towards gender cliches and to fetishise the dangerous blondeness and sexiness of its female lead; and also the way it ends on a macho flourish of violence that has no consequences other than the final credit roll. The violence has kept it real – end of story. Yet what leads up to all this is powerfully and emotionally presented. Leon is a thoughtful, intelligent guy dealing with complex emotions. The film reveals that his going into care at 15 was a voluntary decision, and his return home four years later is conditional on his mother dealing with her drinking issues now his abusive father is off the scene. But his mother has a new boyfriend, who is another bully and addiction enabler. Leon hangs out with his friends, who drift around getting into trouble almost accidentally. James has a very interesting opening shot, showing them all ambling up the street talking about all sorts of lightheartedly outrageous stuff before stealing something from a car seemingly on a whim. Sucking up nitrous oxide from balloons is their chief leisure activity, and there is a nice moment when Leon morosely plays with some Scalextric in his flat – a reminder of fleeting childhood happiness. Fate turns when he goes to a squat party and meets the elegant Twiggy, who has an activist boyfriend, Anton (Sam Gittins), clearly from the same side of the tracks as her. Leon finds himself drawn shyly into their ambit, to the suspicion of his friends. His feelings for Twiggy are one source of tension, his loathing of his mum’s obnoxious boyfriend is another, and then, when the riots cause the boxing gym to close its doors, the frustration climbs to dangerous levels. The disorder causes a serious split among his friends, some of whom believe the riots are about “revenge” and some whom think it is about “stealing stuff”. When Twiggy shows up at Leon’s flat, her encounter with his mum is uneasy. “Where d’you spring from?” asks Chelsea. “Same place as you, I guess,” says Twiggy insouciantly, to which Chelsea replies: “We ain’t from the same place, darling.” And they certainly aren’t. Jones gets some nice shots and shrewd moments. I was intrigued when he showed two police officers in an alley, one getting the other to drink some water – they are just as scared as everyone else.

Green Tomato Cars, which calls itself “London’s green and ethical car service”, luxury airport transfer specialist Blacklane and Birmingham’s A2B are facing claims from former drivers who say they are “workers” and not independent contractors as the car firms insist. The cases are backed by the Independent Workers Union of Great Britain (IWGB) union, which has won a string of successful cases on worker status, including against Uber. The ride-hailing app is to challenge the ruling at the court of appeal. An employment tribunal test case backed by the GMB union also found that some Addison Lee drivers had been wrongly classed as self-employed. Addison Lee has been granted the right to appeal against the case. “The bogus classification of private hire drivers as independent contractors in order to deprive them of employment rights is rampant across the sector. It’s not just Uber and Addison Lee,” Jason Moyer-Lee, the general secretary of the IWGB, said. Nelson Salei, a former driver for Green Tomato, says he is a worker and so is entitled to be reimbursed unpaid holiday pay. Salei worked for the private hire group for several months last year, usually on five-day rolling contracts. He left after claiming he was not paid for several days of a contract after a dispute over a fare that was booked but did not turn up. He said the non-payment just before Christmas “was really frustrating”. “I wanted to have a comfortable Christmas but I had to ask people to lend me money,” he said. Salei earned £20 an hour on the contract, under which he promised to work only for Green Tomato and turn down work from other companies such as Uber, but estimates that he took home less than half of that after paying for petrol, insurance, maintenance and leasing his car. He says he never asked for holiday pay. “I didn’t know much about my rights,” he said. Green Tomato Cars said it “prides itself on being an ethical company and, in particular, in our relationship with drivers”. “We have discussed the situation with Mr Salei and his union representative through the Acas mediation process, and maintain our position that there are no grounds for his claim,” it added. “We will of course comply with the requirements of the tribunal, where we expect to successfully defend the claim.” Mariusz Jakubowski, who worked for Blacklane in Glasgow, until just before Christmas last year, said he didn’t receive a set rate for jobs. The app works by offering a rate for a job in a particular area that gradually increases until a driver takes it up. Jakubowski left after he was fined by the company when a customer complained he handed them a personal business card, something he denies doing. He said he had rented out his car and stopped private-hire driving after leaving Blacklane. “I was earning good money,” he said. But after receiving the fine and being assaulted by a passenger while working for another taxi service he said: “I realised it wasn’t worth it.” Berlin-based Blacklane, which operates in more than 250 cities around the world and is partly backed by the carmaker Daimler, said: “We have not received any official information, documentation or filings about this case. Therefore, we cannot comment in any meaningful way.” A2B’s owner Veezu, which owns several private hire firms, did not respond to a request for comment. The gig economy has proved to be a battleground for disputes about employment status involving firms such as takeaway company Deliveroo and courier firm CitySprint. Its emergence also prompted a full-blown government review into modern employment practices, led by Matthew Taylor, a former adviser to Tony Blair. Bogus self-employment is thought to deny basic rights to about 1.1 million couriers, minicab drivers and other workers. Moyer-Lee said that the government had been slow to act on the prime minister’s promise to help workers and offered little in concrete action in response to the Taylor review. He called for better enforcement of employment rules. “What we’ve seen in case after case is that the tribunal finds these people are workers, often in scathing terms, and that shows we’ve got a serious problem in enforcement of the law,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"public-leaders-network/2018/apr/23/english-local-elections-democracy","type":"article","sectionId":"public-leaders-network","sectionName":"Public Leaders Network","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-23T06:57:05Z","webTitle":"English local elections: the best face of democracy | Jonathan Carr-West","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/public-leaders-network/2018/apr/23/english-local-elections-democracy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/public-leaders-network/2018/apr/23/english-local-elections-democracy","fields":{"headline":"English local elections: the best face of democracy","bodyText":"If we have learnt anything about politics over the past few years, it is that predictions are foolhardy and good news is hard to find. Nonetheless I’m going to begin by predicting that if we remember them for nothing else, we will remember the 2018 local elections for ending the BNP’s presence in English local government. The party’s last remaining councillor is standing down in Pendle, Lancashire. He will not be replaced, none of the 16 BNP candidates in London will win, and a 25-year blot on the political landscape will be gone. Fortunately, this single BNP seat only represents 0.02% of the 4,000 councillors up for election on 3 May. The bigger picture is that Labour runs just under half of the 150 English councils holding elections. And of the 24 councils in no overall control, they have a hand in the running of just under half – two more than the Conservatives. So for the most part it will be a question of deciding (or spinning) how good is really good for Labour and how bad is really bad for the Conservatives. There’s been bullish talk about a “redwash” in London, where all councils and councillors are up for election. There’s even talk about Labour taking control of flagship Conservative boroughs Wandsworth and Westminster. Given that these boroughs have been under Tory control since 1978 and 1964 respectively, and have been seen as flag bearers for a low-tax, efficient services model of Conservative local government, their loss would be hard to spin, but the concentration of Labour votes in a relatively small number of wards mean it could be an uphill task for Labour even if it increases its share of the vote. Given that less than 40% of people vote in local elections there’s a lot of potential votes to play for and much will depend on which party is most capable of getting its vote out. But what is really at stake? People often see local elections as a simple proxy for national politics but it’s notable that in London, at least, Labour and Conservative candidates are distancing themselves from their national parties. And the feeling’s mutual if Sajid Javid’s comments in March about Kensington and Chelsea are anything to go by. Local issues are therefore highly salient. It’s an unfashionable thing to say but most councils do a pretty good job most of the time. They have reduced their spending by a quarter while maintaining public satisfaction. That favours existing councillors, which will favour Labour in these elections, but also means that an issue like housing, where people have very real concerns, especially in the big cities, becomes a key focus for opposition parties. Unless Labour does take Westminster or Wandsworth this probably won’t be the most surprising set of elections, but perhaps more important than the outcome is the process. In the wake of stories about Russian influence in the US presidential elections and the ongoing Facebook/Cambridge Analytica scandal, it’s important that these elections run smoothly and are seen to do so. An election has a thousand moving parts, all of which can go wrong. That they rarely do is thanks to the hard work and dedication of electoral officers. “Nothing happens” is not a news story, but, like the disappearance of the BNP from local politics, it is also a reason to be cheerful.

Comments 155 entries, no mistakes in the grid that I spotted, though a few inexplicably submitted a clue for APRIL FOOL’S DAY. Eighteen clues in the puzzle received one or more votes as favourite, the clear winner being ‘What stirs Othello with drama? This handkerchief, loathed maybe’ for ROMAL (a word I always associate in my mind with the Indian thugs, who are said to have used a romal/rumal to garotte their victims, having tied a stone in one corner of the cloth). The clue to PERICOPE was runner-up, Dreaming up new hoaxes whenever 1 April occurs on a Sunday becomes ever-more challenging. Keener solvers are on the look-out for a leg-pull from the start. The main thing is to hope that the penny drops without too much head-scratching, and this time I think I got it about right, many generously conceding that they were fooled for a time. One or two regulars grumbled a bit that I gave no indication that the four ‘dummy’ clues did not lead to the actual entries, and a further handful failed completely to spot that they led to two anagrams of APRIL FOOL. In the overall context of the spoof I feel that what I presented you with was legitimate if devious. And I could see no way of adding an Easter reference to the mix. Mr (not Dr) Simpson tells me that this was the first Easter Sunday April Fool’s Day since 1956, and that the next time 1 April falls on a Sunday (in 2029) will also be Easter. If I’m preserved I’ll then be 86, so I’ve got a bit of time to devise yet another seasonal joke! And while we’re on the subject of dates, John Tozer (the Bill Frindall of the Azed series?) kindly informs me that this was the 600th Azed competition puzzle. Onward and upward. There was a fine crop of good clues for me to judge, even if the size of the entry was a bit smaller than average. I’d forgotten that I asked you to clue POISSON D’AVRIL once before (in 2007), though on that occasion a ‘Letters Latent’ clue was required so something different was called for this time, even if an earlier idea might have been reworked. Mr Heald managed very cleverly to make oblique reference to this repetition of the clue word (and what a lovely anagram!). The first prizewinner won overall for me on the strength of its deceptive simplicity of wording. Why is it, I wonder, that everyone remembers Richard Dimbleby’s spaghetti trees as the archetypal April Fool’s joke, despite the many other equally good ones devised since, especially in the press? And finally, a very belated apology to Mr Barley for omitting his VHC clue for STRIPE (HARLOT) from the slip for Azed No. 2,382: ‘Rotten starts off the punk rock era singing in band’. It has been duly included in the records for the current honours list."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"film/2018/apr/18/grease-review-john-travolta-olivia-newton-john","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-18T14:00:26Z","webTitle":"Grease review – Travolta and Newton-John's summer lovin' still a blast","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/apr/18/grease-review-john-travolta-olivia-newton-john","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/apr/18/grease-review-john-travolta-olivia-newton-john","fields":{"headline":"Grease review – Travolta and Newton-John's summer lovin' still a blast","bodyText":"‘What happened to the Danny Zuko I knew at the beach?” With this stunned and plaintive cry, Olivia Newton-John introduces the main theme and narrative dynamic of this still very enjoyable 1978 movie based on the original stage musical, which is now on rerelease. Newton John plays Sandy, and she’d met such a sweet boy over the summer, enjoying a more-or-less platonic beachside romance and imagining she would never see him again once she went back to Australia. But her family’s plans changed and, with the new term, Sandy shows up at the local high school and is astonished to see Danny, played by John Travolta. Compelled to be super-cool in front of his gang buddies, he is crudely dismissive of Sandy, but secretly still in love with her. We hear the classic split-point-of-view song Summer Nights, in which Sandy regales her saucer-eyed friends with Danny’s gallantry and Danny jeeringly implies he’d had his way with her on the sand. The movie is all about male identity, peer pressure, sex in that pre-pill era and innocently imagined rock’n’roll. Grease was also about race: the title had overtones of “greaseball”. Blond Sandy is as Waspy as they come; Danny and some of his gang are regarded as outsiders partly because of their Italian American ethnicity – and the same goes for Rizzo, as tough as any boy, played by Stockard Channing. Grease broke John Travolta through to family audiences who might have been chary about his more adult movie sensation, Saturday Night Fever, the year before. It was part of the 70s fashion for 50s nostalgia that also had its expression in George Lucas’s American Graffiti and Garry Marshall’s longrunning TV show Happy Days, and survived in the form of Robert Zemeckis’s Back to the Future in 1985. Travolta’s effortless dancing here is different from his lithe and narcotically sexy disco performances in Saturday Night Fever. In Grease it is more family-friendly. Still superb, less about pelvic grinding than about the quiff, elbows and the knees rotating in 45-degree shunts, as if he were appearing in an Egyptian frieze. It’s still a sugar-rush of a film."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"film/2018/apr/20/never-steady-never-still-review-parkinsons-shirley-henderson","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-20T10:00:20Z","webTitle":"Never Steady, Never Still review – tough sledding in the snows of Alberta","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/apr/20/never-steady-never-still-review-parkinsons-shirley-henderson","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/apr/20/never-steady-never-still-review-parkinsons-shirley-henderson","fields":{"headline":"Never Steady, Never Still review – tough sledding in the snows of Alberta","bodyText":"This is a sincerely intended drama from Canadian writer-director Kathleen Hepburn, and it was a prizewinner on its home turf, but I have to admit to finding it tough sledding. It is plaintive and subdued, with a dual narrative focus that is not as satisfyingly developed or resolved as it might be. Judy, played by Shirley Henderson, lives near the oilfields of Alberta and has Parkinson’s. She has a supportive if withdrawn husband, Ed (Nicholas Campbell), though she seems also to have an emotional connection with her neighbour Lenny (Lorne Cardinal). Judy is worried and protective about her aimless teen son Jamie (Théodore Pellerin) who, quite aside from worrying about his mother, has his own issues with sexuality and identity, and who occupies half the film’s narrative space. (The feature was developed from an earlier short that was more centred on Jamie.) In the end, I got the feeling I hadn’t quite found out enough about either Jamie or Judy. The movie comes most alive in Judy’s Parkinson’s therapy group scenes, which have a wit and punch that the rest of the film lacks. There is a terrific exchange in which an older woman fiercely tells the group how annoyed she was when out shopping for socks for her husband, when her wobbly legs would suddenly fail to move at her bidding and she would be stuck making conversation with the town bore. There are some heartfelt moments, but this is an opaque and frustrating experience."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/apr/18/have-fees-stopped-you-from-applying-for-uk-citizenship","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-18T11:48:05Z","webTitle":"Have fees stopped you from applying for UK citizenship?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/apr/18/have-fees-stopped-you-from-applying-for-uk-citizenship","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/apr/18/have-fees-stopped-you-from-applying-for-uk-citizenship","fields":{"headline":"Have fees stopped you from applying for UK citizenship?","bodyText":"As home secretary in David Cameron’s coalition government, Theresa May was tasked with achieving a manifesto promise to reduce net immigration to the tens of thousands.

Human skulls from around the world, some dating as far back as almost 10,000 years ago, have been found with very similar holes – evidence, say experts, of a cranial surgery called trepanation in which humans scraped away at the skull, or drilled it, to form an aperture. But the cow skull, dating to at least 3,000 BC and found at the neolithic site of Champ-Durand in France, is the earliest example of such surgery on an animal. “I have analysed many, many human skulls ... all from the neolithic period and they all show the same techniques – and the technique you can observe in the cow’s skull [is] the same,” said Fernando Ramirez Rozzi, first author of the research from the French National Centre for Scientific Research in Paris. While removing part of the skull is a technique sometimes used in modern medicine to control pressure following a head injury that causes bleeding in the brain or brain swelling, the purpose of its precursor, trepanning, has been hotly debated, with some suggesting it was used as some sort of medical intervention, and others that it was a part of rituals. The cow skull is the earliest clear example of trepanation on an animal – while a wild boar skull with a hole, apparently made by cranial surgery, was reported in 1948, Ramirez Rozzi says it is not clear how old that skull is. Writing in the journal Scientific Reports, Ramirez Rozzi and co-author Alain Froment say they dismissed previous conclusions that the hole in the cow’s skull, which at its largest measures about 6.4cm by about 4.7cm, was made in a violent tussle with another cow as there was no sign of fractures or bone splinters. There was also no sign that it was the result of an infectious disease or a tumour. But careful examination showed the hole had the same sort of scrape marks as are seen in human skulls which have been trepanned. The team also found there was no sign that the hole had begun to heal, suggesting that it was made either when the cow was on its on its deathbed, or had already died. The researchers say it is unclear why the hole was made, but that there are two main theories: either stone age humans were honing their skills for making holes in the heads of their peers, making the latest find the earliest evidence of animal experimentation; or the hole is the earliest evidence of some sort of veterinary procedure and was carried out in an attempt to save the cow’s life. In the latter case, the authors say, the intervention would likely have been a response to a behaviour change, possibly seizures, suggesting that neolithic humans had made the link between the brain and such problems. However Ramirez Rozzi said the idea of a neolithic vet is the less likely of the two options: the cow was one of many and the animals were eaten for food. “I don’t see why they would save the one cow in the middle of hundreds of cows,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"cities/2018/apr/19/basel-in-the-spotlight-the-city-that-learned-to-love-lsd-albert-hofmann","type":"article","sectionId":"cities","sectionName":"Cities","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-19T10:00:04Z","webTitle":"Basel in the spotlight: the city that learned to love LSD","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2018/apr/19/basel-in-the-spotlight-the-city-that-learned-to-love-lsd-albert-hofmann","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/cities/2018/apr/19/basel-in-the-spotlight-the-city-that-learned-to-love-lsd-albert-hofmann","fields":{"headline":"Basel in the spotlight: the city that learned to love LSD","bodyText":"Seventy-five years ago, the Swiss chemist Albert Hofmann experienced the world’s first full-blown LSD trip on his way home from his lab in Basel. Hofmann had been researching the ergot fungus, hoping to develop a drug to treat fatigue. Among the compounds he was analysing was lysergic acid – Lysergsäure-Diethylamid in German, also known as LSD. On Friday 16 April 1943, Hofmann left the lab feeling a little dizzy: “I lay down and had these wonderful dreams – I saw every thought as an image,” he said in an interview for his 100th birthday. The chemist concluded that he had accidentally touched the substance, and was intrigued by its powerful effect. Three days later, on 19 April, he returned to the lab and swallowed a tiny amount just to see what would happen: “As it later turned out, it was five times too much and gave me a horror trip.” He asked an assistant to take him home by bicycle, and Basel transformed into a panorama of hellish and heavenly visions. The bike seemed to freeze to the spot; a friendly neighbour turned into an evil witch. Hours later, Hofmann felt wonderful. “LSD called me, I didn’t seek it out,” he recalled. “It came to me.” Loving LSD Today, Basel wears its psychedelic history with pride. Locals point out that the city has for centuries served as a safe haven for rebels and free thinkers. An exhibition at Basel’s Kunstmuseum celebrates Hofmann’s discovery in the context of the city’s creative history, pairing it with nightmarish, horror trip-like prints by Old Masters such as Bruegel. Thousands of visitors are expected to flock to Basel to celebrate “Bicycle Day”, as 19 April is known among the cognoscenti. And researchers are studying LSD’s medical properties again, shrugging off decades of stigma. Switzerland’s relatively permissive regulations around researching LSD have helped the renewed effort to understand its medical potential. New methods, including advanced brain scanners, also give unprecedented insights into its effects. One study by the Swiss psychiatrist Peter Gasser has recently shown that LSD can be used to reduce a sense of existential fear. Its capacity to induce feelings of deep bliss raise the prospect of therapeutic uses, for example to treat depression. “LSD is a Baseler product,” said Matthias Liechti, a clinical pharmacologist at University Hospital Basel, who leads a research project on the effects of LSD on the human mind and body. “It’s tied to Basel’s history as a centre of pharmacology and innovation.” Sandoz, the chemicals company in whose labs Hofmann discovered LSD, has since merged with its rival, Ciba, to create the chemicals giant Novartis. In general the chemicals and pharma business has shaped urban life in Basel, most recently through the Novartis Campus, a $2.3bn research and development centre in the St Johann neighbourhood, with a centrepiece designed by Frank Gehry. The campus has attracted global talent, but some locals warn that an influx of wealthy newcomers is pushing up prices and crowding out poorer locals. “From working-class area to hip chemistry-corner,” wrote local journalist Andreas Schwald about the rapidly changing neighbourhood last year. He points out that while the area offers a bustling, interesting mix of students and expats, cheap housing for poorer families is under threat. Overall, rents in Basel have risen 15% over the past decade, pushing up the general cost of living – which is rising faster than anywhere else in Switzerland. Basel in numbers 250 micrograms – the amount of LSD Hofmann ingested before his bike trip 200 micrograms – the amount of LSD participants take in the study at University Hospital Basel 19 - percentage of Baselers who “regularly ride bikes”, according to a survey. The Swiss national average is 7-8%. 40 – number of museums in Basel, which has Switzerland’s highest museum density 3 - percentage rise in housing costs (including rent and heating) in Basel over the last two years 35 – percentage of foreigners living in Basel History in 100 words Basilia was first mentioned in 374 CE, having started as a small Celtic settlement by the Rhine. Its reputation as an innovation hub began in 1460, with the founding of Basel University, Switzerland’s oldest, which in 1661 acquired the world’s first public art collection – setting Basel’s other big theme, fine art. During the Reformation, silk dyers arrived, laying the foundation for Basel’s pharmaceutical and chemicals companies. In 1897, Basel hosted the First Zionist Congress under Theodor Herzl. In 1996, Sandoz – in whose labs Hofmann discovered LSD – and its rival Ciba merged to create the chemicals giant Novartis. Basel in sound ... Musically speaking, Basel’s most important contribution to pop culture may indeed be LSD. Countless songs have been inspired by Hofmann’s discovery at the Sandoz lab, and it’s hard to think of a chemical compound with a broader and deeper musical influence. “Well I met a girl called Sandoz, and she taught me many, many things ...” sang the Animals. Even in current LSD studies, psychedelic music is played to the participants. On the other hand, John Lennon tried hard to dispel the rumour that the Beatles song Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds was a nod to the substance and its acronym. ... and vision Art Basel is one of the world’s most famous and extravagant art fairs, with off-shoots in Hong Kong and Miami Beach. But locals say there’s much more to Basel’s art scene than record prices. The city’s free-thinking legacy has inspired a robust counter-cultural tradition – with or without the help of mind-altering substances. Sebastien Pierre Portron, an art consultant, grew up here and returned to the city three years ago after some time abroad. “People from all over Europe have been coming here for centuries,” he said. “Not just artists but different people from all cultures, all religions. In the arts, people came to Basel from very early on. Holbein the Elder and the Younger came here to develop and promote their art, and many others followed – Picasso, and more recently, even Ai Wei Wei.” Portron works for Artstübli, a gallery set up by a local curator, Philipp Brogli, that promotes urban art. The gallery works with newcomers as well as more established urban artists. Among them is the French artist Invader, famous for his “space invader” mosaics in public spaces – of which there are 24 in Basel alone. Gen Atem, a Swiss urban artist based in New York and Zurich, remembers being one of the first contributors to Basel’s budding graffiti scene in the 1980s. “I used to take the train from Zurich to Paris or Amsterdam, because at the time, a lot of good sprayers were there,” he said. “My train passed Basel, and I looked out of the window and noticed that all the walls there were still empty. And that’s how it started.” He says now the urban art scene in Basel has overtaken that of Zurich, its longtime rival. Basel’s location helps – it sits between Switzerland, Germany and France, attracting artists from all over. And Art Basel is pulling in more and more graffiti artists as the boundary between commercial and street art increasingly dissolves. What’s on for Bicycle Day? The seriously committed will have already bought their tickets to the special anniversary congress in Basel that features some of the world’s leading LSD researchers – the event is sold out. Basel Art Center offers a special LSD night as part of its psychedelic retrospective of HR Giger, the Swiss artist known for his terrifying designs for Alien, the movie. Basel Short Stories, an exhibition at the Kunstmuseum, honours Hofmann as well as other Basel luminaries such as Erasmus and the feminist Iris von Roten. And, more prosaically, there are the many cycling routes in and around the city. What’s everyone talking about? Gentrification. “In Switzerland’s cities, entire neighbourhoods are changing: first they are cheap and attractive, then the new residents bring in more money, and in the end the existing population can hardly afford the rising rents,” wrote journalist Benjamin von Wyl. He sees Basel as a particularly striking example: the supply of available flats has shrunk by two-thirds since 2005. Amid local protests over the rising cost of living, Novartis and BASF are now planning to turn a 300,000 sq m industrial site in the Klybeck area into a whole new neighbourhood. According to Von Wyl, a spokesperson for the Baseler canton said the new community would not become an “urban monoculture for the better off” – without revealing concrete steps for preventing this from happening. Closer zoom Local papers Basler Zeitung and bz Basel, and Zurich’s Neue Zürcher Zeitung have run several in-depth features and interviews on the anniversary. In LSD, My Problem Child, Hofmann writes about his life, his discovery of LSD and his research into sacred plants. He warns against “mistaking this substance for a pleasure drug”. But with the right spiritual preparation and under the right medical conditions, he argues, his “problem child could become a wonder child.” Do you live in Basel?

Although reportedly written in a three-week burst and dismissed by its author as a “minor work”, the tale of ultraviolence and criminal correction kept tempting Burgess back to revise, adapt and comment on. In 1986 – more than two decades after the publication of the novel – he turned it into a play peppered with his own songs, now staged at the Liverpool Everyman. It makes a sharp contrast with the first musical offering of the Everyman Rep Company’s 2018 season, Lerner and Loewe’s foot-tapping Paint Your Wagon. Here, the tunes are discordant rather than catchy. Burgess’s music – inspired by and interwoven with his protagonist Alex’s beloved Beethoven – is brilliantly uncanny, only misfiring when it briefly strays into sentimentality. From the first, teasing call of “What’s it going to be then, eh?” it transforms the novel into a chilling, nightmarish cabaret. Troublingly, though perhaps aptly, Nick Bagnall’s production is never more stylish than when portraying Alex (a cold-eyed, sneering George Caple) and his droogs’ violent acts in the opening scenes. It takes a while to settle into the rhythms of this early, episodic section, which inducts us into teenager Alex’s world of random brutality. Spoken – or sung – on stage, Burgess’s invented Nadsat slang can be hard to catch, while Kay Haynes’s unsettling wash of ultraviolet light has a strange, distancing effect on the action. Afterwards, though, it is these striking, stripped-back moments that linger in the memory. When Alex is dispatched to the institutional settings of prison and treatment centre, the style becomes increasingly cartoonish, lampooning the authority figures for whom he is little more than an experiment. The action takes its lead from Burgess’s twisted music-hall tunes, with macabre prison-yard dances and a Muppet-style puppet standing in for the jail’s manipulated governor. It’s only after the interval, as Alex is given his “freedom”, that the pace begins to become sluggish. Without overreaching, Bagnall’s version finds plenty of contemporary resonances – never more so than when a “cured” Alex becomes a political plaything. The Minister of the Interior’s determination to cut crime rates at all costs feels worryingly plausible, as does the jockeying to use Alex as a vote-winning symbol. The one misjudged addition is a baffling and unnecessary visual reference to Jimmy Savile, which tips the scale from the intriguingly disturbing to the outright offensive. No doubt Stanley Kubrick’s film version will loom large in the minds of many audience members, but the Everyman team work hard to create a distinct aesthetic. The spare white frame of Molly Lacey Davies and Jocelyn Meall’s set, with its frequently opening and closing trapdoors, swiftly and seamlessly takes us from city streets to prison to the lab where Alex is conditioned to be repulsed by images of violence. And the music – impressively performed by multi-instrumentalist Peter Mitchell – imposes a compelling layer of strangeness between the violence of Alex’s world and those of us watching it. Perhaps Burgess’s greatest achievement with A Clockwork Orange remains its linguistic inventiveness, conveying the foreignness of adolescence with its own, unique lexicon. Despite some unevenness in the storytelling of the author’s adaptation, it is fascinating to experience that invented slang in song form, once again revitalising this much-adapted tale.

Its serial and increasingly lukewarm reinventions since the twilight of the British empire – from “British Commonwealth”, to Commonwealth, to its last repurposing in 2012 with the adoption of its first-ever charter – mirror that lack of a compelling raison d’être. When it is talked up – for instance by the BBC ahead of the meeting – it is in terms of a cheap tailor inviting us to “never mind the quality – feel the width”. The Commonwealth is “rather big”, we are reminded, home to a third of the world’s population with its constituent members living in countries that comprise a quarter of the world’s landmass. The odds are, however, that you could not name its secretary general (Lady Patricia Scotland) or say what the Commonwealth is actually for. Brutally, Boris Johnson, before becoming foreign secretary, suggested that the Commonwealth’s most useful function was to supply a backdrop of “cheering crowds” of Africans (he used racist and demeaning language) and as a feelgood fillip for the increasingly controversial then-prime minister Tony Blair. While Johnson may have moderated his troubling language somewhat in the intervening years, it appears that his view of the institution has not much improved, recently appearing to suggest to the cross-party foreign affairs committee that it was not much of a priority. And Johnson’s flip intimation that a key role of the Commonwealth is supplying a kind of existential meaning to the hollowed crown of Windsor (and troubled prime ministers) will not have been dispelled by the suggestion of new roles for Prince Charles (as its possible titular head) and Prince Harry and Meghan Markle as joint youth ambassadors. The problems with the Commonwealth are well-rehearsed. There was the accusation by Gambia on its withdrawal from the organisation that it was a “neo-colonial institution” and persistent charges of lack of imagination in its sometimes opaque bureaucracy. Then there has been concern about its vulnerability to exploitation for political gain by states stained with human rights abuse allegations – most notably Sri Lanka. But despite the periodic controversies, the real problem is how forgettable the Commonwealth has become, more associated with the quadrennial games in the public’s mind than with much else. In terms of global development – and at the centre of its renewed focus – ostensibly, its aims are admirable, not least the charter’s 16 values of democracy, gender equality, sustainable development and international peace and security. On climate change too, in particular ahead of the Paris agreement, the Commonwealth acted as a conduit for the views of smaller countries from the global south. In practical terms, much of what it does, not least in terms of the delivery of sustainable development goals, is open to the criticism that it only duplicates UK commitments whose main effort goes on in other forums like the UN. Perhaps most serious of all is the way in which – as Murphy intuited – the Commonwealth has become a vessel to be filled by the Conservative politics of Brexit, rolling a rose-tinted view of lost empire into the exigencies of finding new markets, gilded with a glib free market view of trade as the answer to poverty. What that means, as development secretary Penny Mordaunt and Liam Fox made clear in a joint article for the Telegraph this week, is what they described as “the beginning of a new approach to inclusive trade, development and prosperity”. In short that means increasing trade for the Commonwealth’s biggest economy – the UK post-Brexit – and pretending that is aid. It is the cynical papier-mache vision of not-quite-empire and of not-quite-development for a not-quite-important institution that only the dull fever dream of Brexit could inspire."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/apr/18/the-queens-corgis-are-dead-long-live-the-dorgis","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-18T10:24:19Z","webTitle":"The Queen's corgis are dead: long live the 'dorgis'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/apr/18/the-queens-corgis-are-dead-long-live-the-dorgis","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/apr/18/the-queens-corgis-are-dead-long-live-the-dorgis","fields":{"headline":"The Queen's corgis are dead: long live the 'dorgis'","bodyText":"The Queen’s last remaining corgi has died, it has been reported. Willow, who was almost 15, was put down after suffering from cancer, making it the first time the monarch has not owned a corgi since the end of the second world war. Willow was the 14th generation descended from Susan, a corgi gifted to the then Princess Elizabeth on her 18th birthday in 1944. The Queen has owned more than 30 dogs of the breed during her reign. It was reported in 2015 that the Queen had stopped breeding corgis because she did not want to leave any behind after she died. She still has two dogs, Vulcan and Candy, which are informally known as “dorgis” – a cross-breed between a dachshund and a corgi introduced to the royal household when Princess Margaret’s dachshund Pipkin mated with one of the Queen’s dogs. Vulcan and Candy appeared alongside Willow on the front cover of Vanity Fair in 2016, shot by Annie Leibovitz to celebrate the Queen’s 90th birthday. Willow was the last surviving corgi to have appeared alongside the Queen and the actor Daniel Craig in the 2012 London Olympics opening ceremony James Bond sketch. Willow, Monty and Holly had greeted the secret agent as he arrived at the palace to accept a mission from the Queen. The dogs ran down the stairs, performed tummy rolls and then stood as a helicopter took off for the Olympic stadium, carrying Bond and a stunt double of the Queen. Monty died a couple of months after the sketch was filmed, and Holly was put down in 2016. Holly and Willow also featured in the illustrated children’s book What the Ladybird Heard on Holiday by Julia Donaldson and Lydia Monks, where they help the ladybird foil a plot to steal the royal crown. The book was dedicated to them.

Staff, in fact, routinely used landing card information as part of their decision-making process, and saw the Windrush landing cards as a useful resource, according to information from two new Home Office whistleblowers. Their accounts have been further supported by the emergence of Border Force guidance, obtained under the Freedom of Information Act, that appears to contradict the government’s justification of a decision to destroy an archive of Windrush-era arrival slips. The Border Force note appears to undermine the Home Office and Downing Street’s rejection of the documents’ significance. Giving details of how landing cards are used currently, the document stated: “Information from a landing card may be used by an entry clearance officer in making a decision on a visa application.” A now-retired senior Croydon-based Home Office employee told the Guardian she had regularly used landing card information in decision-making work during the 1980s. “Landing and embarkation cards were kept in alphabetical order, and by month,” she said, adding that it was a very important database because “it would show who else arrived with you; it would show the parents and the children that they brought with them”. Former Home Office employees and immigration case workers have also expressed deep concern about a shift in the way officials have been handling undocumented Commonwealth residents, following tightened immigration regulations, with one describing a new “gotcha attitude” among staff, who enjoyed catching out applicants. Both Downing Street and the Home Office attempted to play down the significance of the revelation in the Guardian on Tuesday that an archive of landing slips documenting Windrush era arrivals had been destroyed in 2010. But on Wednesday the Home Office said the number of people calling a government hotline for members of the Windrush generation with concerns about their migration status had risen from 49 to 113. A Downing Street spokesperson said the documents did “not provide any reliable evidence of ongoing residence in the UK or immigration status and therefore would not have bearing on immigration cases whereby Commonwealth citizens are proving residence in the UK”. The Home Office said: “Registration slips provided details of an individual’s date of entry, they did not provide any reliable evidence relating to ongoing residence in the UK or their immigration status. So it would be misleading and inaccurate to suggest that registration slips would therefore have a bearing on immigration cases whereby Commonwealth citizens are proving residency in the UK.” But the second former Home Office employee said the information had been very useful and that it was wrong to destroy the archive. “It was a mistake. I used it when I was doing immigration work to check for people’s arrivals,” she said. Meanwhile, the Home Office is investigating 49 new cases of Windrush citizens experiencing immigration status difficulties, which emerged on Tuesday in the wake of the home secretary’s announcement of a new taskforce on the issue. Ex-Home Office employees said they hoped taskforce staff would be more sensitive in their handling of claims. One long-term former employee, who worked for the Home Office for many years in Liverpool, told the Guardian there had been a stark change among immigration staff‘s behaviour following Theresa May’s announcement of “hostile environment” immigration regulations when she was home secretary. “The introduction of the hostile environment policy meant the mentality was: ‘I’m going to say no, unless you can prove me wrong.’ Whereas before we’d been a lot more lenient towards the Commonwealth immigrants. We had no problem about going after everyone else, but the Commonwealth immigrants had always been a different kettle of fish,” said the official, who asked not to be named. “That changed about five or six years ago with the hostile environment. Some of the immigration people welcomed it. There was a ’gotcha attitude’ – some people enjoyed it; I didn’t like that.” The home secretary, Amber Rudd, appeared to acknowledge that this newly hardened culture within the Home Office was becoming problematic on Monday when she apologised for the “appalling” actions of her own department towards some Windrush-era citizens who have struggled to prove their right to live in the UK, and recognised that the Home Office had “lost sight of individuals” and become “too concerned with policy”. The Liverpool ex-Home Office worker said there was a younger generation of immigration employees who were more aggressive in their attitude to undocumented Windrush-generation residents struggling to establish their right to remain in the UK. “People who were coming into the department were new and didn’t have the background knowledge about immigration in the 1960s that I had,” he said. “I was saying to them: ‘Look they’re more British than you! How can you, a 27-year-old fellow, refuse a 54-year-old fellow, and say he’s not entitled to remain in a country he’s lived in for 51 years? It is madness. It upset me and a few of the older staff members when they started saying to these fellows: we want four pieces of information per year you’ve been here. “There were some people who enjoyed saying: I’ve caught you, you are illegal. But they weren’t illegal at all. I’ve got no issue with people getting rid of illegal immigrants but the Jamaican and Trinidadians – these are Commonwealth people, who were British subjects or citizens of the UK and colonies before their countries became independent.” He was “shocked and ashamed” to read about cases of Windrush-generation residents, who have been in Britain for over half a century, being detained. “I’m astounded by it all,” he said. “They’ve realised that they have made a complete mistake.” Previously staff had been allowed to apply reasonable discretion towards applicants in this group. “Some had come on their parents’ passport. Some of them came on their own passports – most of them didn’t still have them, of course they didn’t, they’ve been here for 40 years,” he said. “So the policy in the citizenship department was: if they say they have been here for that long, OK, provided they pass the character checks and they’re not mass murderers, then in they come, give them British citizenship.” The policy was “to accept that people were telling the truth because there was no reason to doubt them”, he said. The senior ex-Croydon immigration employee was also concerned by worsening Home Office attitudes towards people seeking to regularise their status. “In my day working in immigration we very much had the individual’s situation in our minds. We did not work from crib sheets or take a this-is-what-the-rules-say approach – you looked at each person’s case sympathetically and with discretion,” she said. Her account chimed with comments made on Tuesday by an ex-employee who said from 2013 onwards, staff were “given no leeway to make a judgment call on the balance of probability rather than the burden of proof”. Many experienced staff took redundancy because they disliked the new atmosphere. The people who remained were told: “These are the rules, stick to them”. Daniel Ashwell, a senior caseworker at the refugee and migrant centre in Wolverhampton, which has helped many Windrush-era citzens, said he was doubtful about whether Home Office attitudes would change after this week’s apology for the “appalling” treatment meted out to Windrush residents. “I am sceptical. This just illuminates how the whole system is set up – with staff not believing what people say, always questioning them and making people feel that their status is at risk. This is just a the tip of the iceberg example of the whole immigration system works,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/apr/18/north-korea-trump-south-korea-kim-jong-un","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-18T09:06:49Z","webTitle":"North Korea: can Trump succeed where so many others have failed?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/18/north-korea-trump-south-korea-kim-jong-un","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/apr/18/north-korea-trump-south-korea-kim-jong-un","fields":{"headline":"North Korea: can Trump succeed where so many others have failed?","bodyText":"On the same day that the White House confirmed that secretary of state nominee Mike Pompeo met the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, South Korea suggested that its president, Moon Jae-in, would seek a peace treaty with North Korea when he meets Kim later the month. That would replace the armistice that has been in place on the peninsula since the end of the 1950-53 Korean war. Events are moving rapidly. Given that barely four months ago we were debating war on the Korean peninsula, this is in equal parts a baffling and promising turn of events. Baffling, because diplomacy rarely moves this fast, especially in east Asia. The Korean stalemate has been frozen for almost 70 years. Peninsular deterrence has been stable, despite regular tension. The ideological and strategic divisions between the US and South Korea, and North Korea, remain deep. Given that the summits are occurring just a few months after the initial proposals for talks, it would be astonishing if the US or South Korea were ready in such a short time. The South Korean side is likely to be better prepared. Moon has been thinking about outreach to North Korea for most of his career. He has long sought a deal with the North, and he knows the issues well. But even Moon faces serious constraints. He only won the presidential election with 41% of the vote. That is nowhere near a mandate to turn cross-border relations upside-down or make massive concessions to North Korea. If Moon returns from his summit on 27 April with a deal full of South Korean give-backs and only vague commitments from North Korea, he will be pilloried in the conservative media, both here and in the west. Now Moon is talking about a peace treaty before even the denuclearisation issue is handled. This is unnecessarily accelerated. It would be a great achievement if Moon could simply move the ball forward on nukes alone. Even greater concern falls on the US side. Trump’s participation is a huge wild card. It is now very obvious that Trump will come to the meeting grossly unprepared. He does not read and often dismisses his talking points. He skylarks and wanders, and his extraordinary ignorance of the issues means he may well make a concession without realising he has done so. Indeed, he already has. In agreeing to the summit itself, he already made a major concession. A meeting between Kim, a vicious gangster-autocrat, and the US president is a huge win for the North. North Korea has explicitly sought a one-to-one meeting with the US president for decades to signal North Korea’s sovereign equality with the sole superpower. For this reason, no other US president has agreed to a meeting. Yet Trump gave this away just 45 minutes after the idea was put to him and without consulting his national security team. Since then his commentary on Korea has been bizarre – suggesting that the US needs something like the demilitarised zone along its border with Mexico – or unhelpful, such as holding up the South Korea-US trade deal as leverage to use against the South in the upcoming talks. In short, who knows what Trump will actually say to Kim when they meet – an offer to build a Trump Tower in Pyongyang? So the risks are high. Moon is dashing for a final deal just a few months after the talks were first suggested, despite huge North-South gaps in perception of security on the peninsula, while Trump is, well, Trump. All this is promising too though, given that just four months ago the region was on the brink of nuclear war. A showdown with North Korea would be extraordinarily dangerous. North Korea now clearly has the ability to launch nuclear weapons against regional targets. It also likely has the ability to strike the United States. A US-North Korean war would likely chaingang in Japan, and possibly China and Russia. At least we are no longer on that precipice. Jaw-jaw, as Churchill said, is better than war-war. Barring forced denuclearisation, negotiation was always going to be necessary. Now we wait to see what concessions the North Koreans will offer. That is the acid test to see if they are serious. My concern therefore is not the talks, but rather the speed at which they have been arranged. Previous rounds of negotiation with North Korea took years. The North Koreans were canny negotiators who played tough for good deals. It is highly unlikely they have changed. It is hard to believe that the issues which bedevilled negotiators for years in the past can be quickly wrapped up in a few months - unless the South and/or US were to make major unilateral concessions. That is my greatest concern: are Moon and Trump so anxious for a deal that they give away too much? This is still unlikely, but a far greater concern than in normal summitry, where much advance work would have been done. On the other hand, if these summits serve to kickstart deadlocked negotiations, rather than hurriedly solve huge issues like nuclear weapons and a peace treaty, then they will serve a good purpose.

At the beginning of his sold-out show, his dressed-down teen and young adult fans are transfixed by visuals portraying him being late to his own show, before he confidently emerges from the rafters. On his 20th birthday, the atmosphere is celebratory, and he is backed by a four-piece band that prove the night’s saving grace. They allow him to reach new musical depths, and his crystal-clear vocals – sharpened further when he delivers his song’s deft hooks – complete the package. Crooning through his set at a frantic pace, Not3s remains aloof throughout as an excited crowd clutching cameraphones churn below him. However, rarely does the show shift into second gear, even with cameos by fellow MCs Tinie Tempah, Shakka, Fredo and others. Despite a playful demeanour and nice-guy shtick, Not3s’ restrained crowd interaction and the plodding birthday acknowledgments (gifts of a high-end watch from Tempah and platinum plaques from label bosses) in the show’s second act slow down proceedings a tad. It’s the arrival of masked rapper SL, performing his own hit Tropical among others, that gets the night’s biggest reaction. Not3s initially drives through deeper cuts from 2017 EP Take Not3s and they keep the crowd’s attention, but the lack of rip-roaring moments means he continues to move at a pedestrian pace. The show reaches a crescendo with his most recognisable hits: Addison Lee, My Lover and final song Aladdin, as well as exclusives from his forthcoming mixtape Take Not3s 2. Gaining newfound energy thanks to the addition of backup singers, Not3s bounces up and down the stage with purpose, finally coming close to matching the crowd’s enthusiasm in the midst of balloons and confetti. It’s this kind of energy that was needed from the start. Luckily, the band’s synergy, and the closing upsurge of rowdy riffs, piano thumps and hard drums, turn an average set into a perfectly serviceable one by the end. At St Luke’s, Glasgow, on 18 April.

The Australian actor was awarded more than $4.5m in damages, plus interest and court costs, in her libel case against magazine publisher Bauer Media last year. The award comprised $650,000 in general damages, including aggravated damages, and $3,917,472 in special damages for opportunities of screen roles lost because of the articles. But legal counsel for Bauer, barrister Michael Wheelahan QC, spent six hours arguing the payment of special damages was unjustified and asked the three judges of the appeals court to reassess the amount awarded by Justice John Dixon in September. “There has been a denial of natural justice,” Wheelahan said. So significant was the amount awarded to Wilson that media companies News Corp Australia, Fairfax Media, Macquarie Media, the ABC and the Seven and Nine networks lined up in February to ask the Victorian appeal court for leave to intervene, in an effort to prevent defamation payouts escalating. The Hollywood actor entered the court with her mother, Sue Bownds, and her high-profile, $9,000-a-day barrister, Matthew Collins QC. Court of appeal justices Pamela Tate, David Beach and David Ashley will hear submissions from Collins on Thursday. Wheelahan did not argue that Wilson, 38, was not defamed by Bauer, which painted her as a serial liar about her age, real name and childhood, but that the amount of special damages was “manifestly excessive” and not supported by the evidence. Wheelahan said Dixon made errors of fact and law when deciding on the amount of damages – in particular in accepting that Wilson lost film roles in the period after the articles were published. “The jury found each of the articles was defamatory and rejected the defendants’ triviality defences,” Dixon wrote in his judgment. “The sting was serious, likely to be injurious and understood as such by the defendants prior to publication. “I do not accept that the articles were published for a local Australian audience. The internet cannot be so classified.” Bauer Media general counsel Adrian Goss said in a statement: “It is important for us today to revisit this decision on the quantum of damages, which also has broader implications for the media industry. “In the lead-up to today, major media organisations united in an unprecedented way to support a key point in Bauer’s appeal. “From here, the legal process will run its due course and we will await the final judgement on this matter.” Speaking outside court, Wilson said Hollywood had been well aware of her case. “Taylor Swift just congratulated me the other day, at Ruby Rose’s birthday party actually,” she told reporters. She said she was confident her team would successfully defend the appeal. “[Bauer] maliciously defamed me and I’m here to hold them accountable for that.” Last week Wilson’s application to have $1.3m of her $1.4m legal costs paid by Bauer was refused by the Victorian supreme court. However, it is expected that the actor will have at least 80% of those costs – or $1.123m – repaid."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"stage/2018/apr/18/tremor-review-two-exes-face-up-to-their-failed-relationship","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-18T16:00:28Z","webTitle":"Tremor review – two exes face up to their failed relationship","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/apr/18/tremor-review-two-exes-face-up-to-their-failed-relationship","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2018/apr/18/tremor-review-two-exes-face-up-to-their-failed-relationship","fields":{"headline":"Tremor review – two exes face up to their failed relationship","bodyText":"Tremor rests on a premise that audiences likely will have seen before: an ex-couple dissecting their past as emotions run high. But Brad Birch’s play still feels fresh, with conversations that veer towards the poetic but not the contrived. In the play, we learn that Sophie and Tom’s relationship failed after they were caught up in a public tragedy. But now Sophie has appeared at Tom’s door, disrupting the perceived normality he has forged in their four years apart. Tremor fits an awful lot of feeling into David Mercatali’s tightly directed 70 minutes. Sadness and anger, forgiveness and reconciliation, blame and bitterness – all are covered in Birch’s script. While this constant swinging of emotion is welcome, there are times when the imbalance between the characters doesn’t quite hit the mark. Lisa Diveney’s twitching, guilty, desperate Sophie is played well, as is Paul Rattray’s looming Tom, whose subtle movements hint at danger. But the different ways they move and speak often give the feeling they are in two separate plays, and it’s hard to imagine Sophie and Tom were ever a couple. As the play progresses, they also feel less like people and more like mouthpieces for differing political views. A lot comes up, from Islamophobia to media responsibility to “taking back control”. At times, though, their sermonising really works. The actors shine during their monologues, and the push and pull between them is amplified by stark, striking staging as they perform in the round. Encased in essentially a bare, grey circle, Hayley Grindle’s design leaves Sophie and Tom dancing around one another like sumo wrestlers. Props are kept to a minimum, but each one (an angry, red splodge of framed Ikea art, two toy dinosaurs facing one another) also hints at confrontation. Sam Jones’s purposeful sound design causes rumbles in the background as if an earthquake is about to hit. Engaging and politically astute, there’s a lot to like about Tremor. Its closing moments, while perhaps slightly heavy-handed, nevertheless pack a punch. At the Sherman theatre, Cardiff, until 5 May.

Was it when the first stone was thrown or the first shot fired? Or did they begin earlier with a police baton blow? Or earlier still with a peaceful march demanding civil rights? As with almost anything to do with Northern Ireland’s turbulent political past, the moment is contested. For me, they began on 30 November 1968, when, as a young lad, I attended a civil rights march in my home town, Armagh. The Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association (Nicra) had been formed the year before by a broad coalition – trade unionists, radical socialists, republicans and members of the Northern Irish Labour and Liberal parties – with the same basic aim: to challenge anti-Catholic discrimination in jobs and housing. One of its defining slogans was the now quaintly sexist “One man, one vote”, which demanded an end to the system of plural voting that prevailed in Northern Ireland long after it had been abolished in the rest of the UK. To be eligible to vote in a local election in Northern Ireland you had to be a homeowner, most of whom were middle- and upper-class Protestants. Many of them were business owners, which entitled them to several extra votes. To make matters worse, the state also employed gerrymandering (manipulating ward boundaries in local elections to maintain a false unionist majority). This meant that in 1968 in predominantly Catholic Derry, where the total nationalist vote was 14,000 and the unionist vote 9,000, the local council comprised 12 unionist and eight nationalist members. Since its inception in 1921, when Ireland was partitioned, Northern Ireland, though remaining part of the UK, was a place apart. One of its founders, Lord Craigavon, had promised “a Protestant parliament for a Protestant people”. Four decades later, the state was essentially and unapologetically biased in favour of its majority population in terms of the allocation of council houses and jobs. For the majority of working-class Catholics who took to the streets in support of civil rights, the cause was personal as well as political. After they married, my parents were on a council house waiting list for 13 years, living for most of that time with my maternal grandparents. For that period and longer, neither of them had a vote in a local election. As with many of their generation, the civil rights protests signalled to them an end to the soul-sapping collective acquiescence that had prevailed in the province for so long, and led to an embrace of a late-flowering activism that was profoundly empowering. I remember the day of the Armagh march well: the almost carnival atmosphere as the marchers, several thousand strong, set off from the Killylea Road, close to the housing estate I lived on. My parents joined the march, taking my younger brother and sister with them. My grandparents attended, as did most of my relatives and several of my school teachers and fellow pupils from the Christian Brothers’ grammar school. Almost everyone from Catholic housing estates in the town seemed to be there, as well as many prominent middle-class local figures. Protesters came from all over the north, and even from the south. Under the civil rights banner, trade unionists, Labour party members, radical socialists, communists and even anarchists united for a common cause, with ordinary, politically unaffiliated people believing, perhaps for the first time in their lives, that real change was a possibility. All this came back to me a few months ago when I was asked by the Gallery of Photography Ireland to put forward an idea for an exhibition. The more I thought about it, the more it seemed crucial to evoke the sense of excitement and empowerment of that lost moment in 1968, before the Troubles reinstated an older narrative of violent Irish republicanism against British colonialism. For many people, particularly in England, the Troubles are understood essentially as a war between the IRA, whose aim was to reunite Ireland, and the British security forces. The short-lived civil rights era of the late 60s and early 70s has been conveniently overlooked, perhaps because it illuminates the fact that the endemic discrimination in Northern Ireland was ignored for decades by successive Westminster governments of every political hue. In retrospect, though, it represents one of the great “what if?” moments when the violence that followed might have been averted through reform. I have called the exhibition The Lost Moment (having decided after much deliberation not to place a question mark after the title) and it will open on 28 April in the Nerve Centre in Derry, a gallery housed in the former Ebrington army barracks that looked over the city throughout the Troubles. The show will include work by local and international photographers as well as films, projections and ephemera from the time in the form of political posters, periodicals and pamphlets. It is an attempt to evoke not just the spirit of idealism and protest, but also the anxieties and anger of the unionist counter-demonstrations that sprang up in reaction to it. One of the aims of the exhibition is to place the Northern Irish civil rights movement in the context of other protest movements of the time. It was a struggle that adopted the nonviolent tactics espoused by Martin Luther King and his followers in America – even borrowing their gospel anthem, We Shall Overcome. Like that movement, it was a broad church – an approach with which its more radical supporters, particularly the young leftwing students who formed the more militant People’s Democracy party in 1968, quickly grew impatient. They looked instead towards the more confrontational actions on the streets of Paris and Chicago during the various revolutionary uprisings of that tumultuous year. Veteran Derry-based leftwing activist and political commentator Eamonn McCann, for instance, had attended the anti-Vietnam war protest in London’s Grosvenor Square in March of that year, which ended in a riot. Historian Paul Bew, one of several Protestant leftwing student activists at the time (and later an adviser to the former unionist leader David Trimble) says: “I don’t recall ever having a discussion about the border or the national question with any of the student protest leaders. It was all about Vietnam, Prague, Paris – those issues cut across the partisan politics of Northern Ireland and fed into the protests there.” One of the student leaders, Michael Farrell, later recalled how a group of activists went straight from an anti-Vietnam war protest outside Belfast city hall to the first civil rights march in Dungannon in August 1968, replacing the slogans on their placards along the way. The march from Coalisland to Dungannon on Saturday 24 August 1968 drew 4,000 people, and despite a government ban and a vociferous loyalist counter-demonstration organised by the Rev Ian Paisley, passed off peacefully. McCann and his fellow activists immediately contacted Nicra with a request to hold another march in Derry on Saturday 5 October. At the 11th hour, it was banned by William Craig, the minister for home affairs, after a local loyalist organisation announced that they would hold a march along the same route on the same day. The Derry activists decided to go ahead with the protest anyway, hoping their defiance would help attract an even bigger crowd. The ban had the opposite effect and only about 400 assembled at the start point, with another 200 curious onlookers lining the pavements. “It was a very disappointing crowd,” McCann later concluded. What subsequently happened, though, had a seismic impact way beyond Derry and Northern Ireland. The march ended almost before it began, when large numbers of Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) employed a tactic that decades later would be known as “kettling” – hemming in the protesters on Duke Street. Stewards urged the crowd to keep calm, but placards were thrown in frustration. Then all hell broke lose. Gaye O’Brien, a news cameraman from the Irish broadcaster RTE, was on hand to record the RUC’s response. The footage remains viscerally shocking to this day – baton-wielding officers wading into the crowd, felling young and old alike, cracking skulls as women scream and children scatter. An unsuspecting elderly man is struck from behind across the side of the face. Moments later, a breathless officer batons a marcher to the ground, his face twisted in fury, before he catches sight of the camera that has just captured his violence for posterity. Among those who escaped serious injury that day, but underwent a dramatic political epiphany, was a young woman who would soon become one of the key figures in the years of ferment that were to follow. “You could feel the hatred,” Bernadette Devlin said decades later. “That’s my recollection of that day. It was my first realisation that the police hated us.” Across the nationalist areas of the north, the scenes of police violence provoked a collective howl of anger. “People were outraged,” remembers Rory McShane, who in 1968 was president of the students’ union at Queen’s University in Belfast and a prominent civil rights activist. “When we saw the police laying into the marchers on the news, it was as if something hidden and hateful had suddenly been pushed out into the open.” Coverage of the violence achieved more in terms of highlighting the plight of Northern Ireland’s Catholic minority than decades of dogged, but unproductive, campaigning by nationalist politicians. Derry suddenly became synonymous with Selma and the US black civil rights struggle led by the recently murdered Martin Luther King. If, as Devlin later put it, “television brought the world to our doorstep”, it also brought the civil rights cause in Northern Ireland to a global audience. “The Bogside was deluged with journalists,” recalled McCann. “A journalist from the Daily Mail came to my front door asking for the name and address of an articulate, Catholic, unemployed slum-dweller she could talk to. Derry was big news.” The immediate effect was about 2,000 students organised a march from the university to the city hall in protest at police brutality. They were blocked by the RUC and another counter-demonstration organised by Paisley, who was fast become an imposing and divisive presence in Northern Irish politics. A four-hour sit-down protest ensued. It was against this backdrop of protest and counter-protest that the march in Armagh took place. I went to the assembly point early with a couple of friends and we attached ourselves to a group containing some older lads from school. They had congregated beneath a large red-and-black banner, which we soon discovered belonged to a small, but vociferous, local anarchist group. Ahead of them was a much bigger group of young radicals who belonged to the People’s Democracy party. They exuded a collective confidence that was in contrast to the more tentative demeanor of some of the older people there. As we set off towards the centre of town, the crowd sang We Shall Overcome. It is my recollection that the anarchists and student radicals didn’t join in, instead chanting “Ho Ho Ho Chi Minh! – We shall fight and we shall win!” and “Two, four, six, eight – organise and smash the state!” It was all very new and exciting, an event of almost epic proportions for those of us who had never witnessed such an energising disruption of the everyday. On we went, singing and chanting, until the march came to an abrupt halt. In the ensuing confusion, my friends and I negotiated our way through the throng to the corner of Thomas Street, which led to the town centre. A line of uneasy-looking RUC men stood in front of their vehicles, which blocked the street. Beyond them, at the other end of the street, another row of police was visible, and behind them a huge crowd of union jack-waving loyalists. They were “the Paisleyites” and they had somehow been allowed to commandeer the centre of town. The protesters were outraged, but the presence of the Paisleyites was not entirely unexpected: rumours had circulated though the Catholic housing estates earlier that a certain Protestant shopkeeper had been seen handing out pickaxe handles to a mob that had arrived in town the night before. There were indeed large sticks being brandished in Market Street alongside the union flags being waved. Another rumour quickly spread through the marchers that some in the loyalist mob were armed. The tone of the march changed quickly from celebratory to defiant. An RUC man addressed the crowd who, surprisingly, listened attentively. He assured us that we were not allowed to proceed for our own security, which elicited hoots of jeering laughter. Prominent civil rights figures Ivan Cooper and John Hume cautioned restraint through a crackling megaphone. Their pleas were successful and, after some debate and a few attempts by one boy to scale the police barricade, the marchers turned back, much to the disgust of the young militants. Later that day, police attacked a crowd of locals who had broken the windows of a departing bus full of Paisleyites. “I vividly remember the RUC arrived and the stewards tried to negotiate with them,” recalls Dermot Kelly, who attended the march as a young People’s Democracy activist. “It seemed to work, but then the RUC broke though their ranks and started batoning everyone in sight, including the moderators. It was vicious and indiscriminate.” A familiar narrative was being played out: loyalist triumphalism, aggressive policing of the protests, rising frustration among the protesters. For days afterwards, the question asked by the nationalist community in Armagh was: what would have happened if a nationalist mob had attempted to take control of the town centre to prevent a loyalist march? It was, of course, a rhetorical question: everyone knew the answer. It was clear too, that a sizable minority of the protesters were growing impatient with the perceived compliance of the civil rights association in the face of the police and loyalist tactics. Where I lived, the middle-class representatives of Nicra were now being referred to derisively as “green Tories”. What happened next, as 1968 gave way to 1969, and the schism between the moderates and the militants in the civil rights movement deepened, is viewed by some historians, including Paul Bew, as one of the crucial moments in the escalating drama that preceded the coming years of violence. On Monday 9 December 1968, the Northern Ireland prime minister, Terence O’Neill, made a television appeal to moderates of every political persuasion in what became known as his “Ulster stands at the crossroads” speech. It could be said, with hindsight, that the patrician and undoubtedly sincere O’Neill fundamentally misunderstood the depth of feeling on both sides, most crucially among the more hardline unionist forces that would soon topple him. Bew sees it differently. “One could view the events of early 1969 as the real lost moment,” he says. “O’Neill had come up with a modest reform programme that many on the unionist side, as well as the Catholic middle class and the church, had accepted as a step forward and a meaningful commitment to further change. Our march shattered the prospects of that change taking place.” The march Bew refers to was organised by the People’s Democracy party, of which he was then a member, against the advice of the civil rights association, who thought its route too provocative. Modelled directly on Martin Luther King’s Selma to Montgomery march from 1965, it began in Belfast on New Year’s Day, 1969, and ended four days later in Derry, its route taking the marchers through several rural Protestant areas along the way. For Michael Farrell and the party’s other young socialists it was a way of keeping the momentum of protest going in the face of reforms that they, like many in the nationalist community, thought of as too little too late. About 40 student protesters left Belfast, growing to about 200 over the following days. They were attacked by stone-throwing loyalists on several occasions, but nothing prepared them for what happened as they crossed Burntollet Bridge on the fourth day. Waiting in ambush was a crowd of about 200 loyalists, including off-duty members of the “B-Specials” (an all-Protestant auxiliary police force), who descended on the marchers with sticks, iron bars, bottles and stones. Panic ensued with protesters, including several injured women, running into the river and the nearby fields. Though 80 RUC officers had accompanied the march, they seemed unable or unwilling to provide protection. The Burntollet ambush, shown on television that evening, was etched on the nationalist psyche as another example of state collusion with loyalist mob rule. “No one did as much damage to the unionist cause as the people who attacked the marchers at Burntollet,” says Bew. In the months after, events in Northern Ireland accelerated. In early February, O’Neill announced the dissolution of Stormont and a subsequent election that would signal a major schism in the unionist party. On 17 April 1969, Bernadette Devlin stood as an independent Unity candidate in Mid Ulster. Aged 21, she became the youngest woman to be elected as an MP at Westminster and made her debut with one of the most stirring speeches ever made in the House. A few days later, serious rioting broke out in Derry after clashes between civil rights protesters and loyalists, who laid siege to the nationalist Bogside area. The following month, what came to be known as the Battle of the Bogside took place when RUC officers and loyalists once again attempted to enter the area. They were met with fierce resistance from locals, many of whom had been present when the police attacked the civil rights march on Duke Street less than a year before. As Bogside residents forced the RUC out of the area and declared it Free Derry, rioting spread across Northern Ireland. The most vicious outbreak of sectarian violence erupted in Belfast, where hundreds of families were driven from their burning homes by a large loyalist mob, an event that directly led to the IRA re-forming and recruiting younger volunteers in nationalist areas. In Divis flats, a nine-year-old boy, Patrick Rooney, became the first child victim of the trouble, killed by RUC machine-gun fire as he lay sleeping. On Thursday 14 August 1969, British troops were deployed on the streets of Northern Ireland. The darkness had descended with a vengeance. That same evening, in Armagh, a local man called John Gallagher was shot dead by members of the B-Specials on the Cathedral Road. He was the first of eight people to die by violence that month, five of them killed by security forces. Gallagher had unwittingly walked into a street disturbance that followed the cancellation of a civil rights meeting in Armagh city hall due to the escalating tension. I remember the utter bewilderment felt by many in the town when news of his death spread. Already, the carnival atmosphere that had prevailed on the day of the civil rights march just nine months previously had become a distant memory. There are those that still maintain that the people who took to the streets in peaceful protest share the blame for starting the Troubles. I, as you might have guessed, am not one of them. I leave the last word to someone from my home town who also marched on that day. “It seems to me now that we were idealistic to the point of naive in underestimating how violent the state’s response would be,” says Dermot Kelly. “But looking back, we were very clear in our aims. People have the right to aspire to equality in a democracy. You either believe that or you don’t. And, if you do, then marching for the rights denied you by a so-called democracy seems a perfectly reasonable thing to do.” The Lost Moment exhibtion opens at the Nerve Centre, Derry on 28 April"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/apr/18/alfie-evans-father-pope-francis-save-son-life-support","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-18T12:04:20Z","webTitle":"Alfie Evans's father begs Pope Francis to ‘save our son’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/apr/18/alfie-evans-father-pope-francis-save-son-life-support","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/apr/18/alfie-evans-father-pope-francis-save-son-life-support","fields":{"headline":"Alfie Evans's father begs Pope Francis to ‘save our son’","bodyText":"The father of a 23-month-oldboy at the centre of a life-support treatment battle has had a private audience with the pope during which he kissed the pontiff’s hand and asked him to “save our son”. Tom Evans, whose son Alfie has a rare degenerative brain disease, posted on Facebook that he had flown to the Vatican on Tuesday evening and met Pope Francis for 20 minutes. The trip came as Evans, 21, and his partner, Kate James, 20, filed an application to the supreme court to appeal against a ruling that stated life support should be withdrawn from their son. The couple are fighting to take the child to Rome for further treatment. The pair, from Liverpool, have lost cases in the high court, court of appeal, supreme court and European court of human rights after judges concluded that the child was in a semi-vegetative state and further treatment would be futile. Alongside photos on Facebook of him kissing the pope’s hand, Evans wrote: “Alfie, we will do everything for you … We won’t allow your life to be taken. Your holiness, save our son.” Francis used his most recent Sunday blessing in St Peter’s Square to say prayers for the toddler. He said he hoped Alfie would “always be respected in dignity and cared for in a way suitable to [his] conditions, with the agreement of family members, doctors and health workers”. The pope intervened in July in the case of Charlie Gard, a British toddler who died of a rare genetic disease after his parents fought a court battle to take him abroad for treatment. The basis of Evans and James’s latest legal appeal is that their son is being wrongly detained by Alder Hey hospital in Liverpool. They have made an application under the Habeas Corpus Act 1679, which allows the legality of a detention to be examined. An appeal court panel of Lord Justice Davis, Lady Justice King and Lord Justice Moylan upheld a ruling on Monday by the high court judge Mr Justice Hayden, who endorsed a detailed plan put forward by doctors at Alder Hey hospital for withdrawing life-support treatment. A spokesman for Alder Hey hospital said: “The supreme court will consider the application for permission to appeal [against] the decision of the court of appeal. Our priority is to continue providing Alfie with the best care possible.” The Catholic Bishops’ Conference of England and Wales said its members were praying for Alfie and his parents. “We affirm our conviction that all those who are and have been taking the agonising decisions regarding the care of Alfie Evans act with integrity and for Alfie’s good as they see it. The professionalism and care for severely ill children shown at Alder Hey hospital is to be recognised and affirmed. “With the Holy Father, we pray that, with love and realism, everything will be done to accompany Alfie and his parents in their deep suffering.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/apr/18/macron-gets-backing-from-parliament-in-tussle-with-rail-unions","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-18T12:32:16Z","webTitle":"Macron gets backing from parliament in tussle with rail unions","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/18/macron-gets-backing-from-parliament-in-tussle-with-rail-unions","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/apr/18/macron-gets-backing-from-parliament-in-tussle-with-rail-unions","fields":{"headline":"Macron gets backing from parliament in tussle with rail unions","bodyText":"France’s striking rail unions face a test of their popular support after Emmanuel Macron’s bill to reform the country’s debt-ridden state rail operator sailed through parliament and a poll showed a majority of the public backed his plans. One in three high-speed TGV trains and one in four inter-city services were running on Wednesday as striking workers disrupted services for a seventh day this month in protest at plans to phase out the SNCF’s passenger rail monopoly and end jobs for life and early retirement guarantees for new staff. Macron, elected president last year on a sweeping programme of pro-business economic and social reforms aimed at liberalising France’s economy, has insisted he will not back down, and won a convincing victory in the lower house on Tuesday night when his SNCF reform bill was passed by 454 votes to 80. “Unions are free to do as they see fit, but a majority of the French want this reform,” the labour minister, Muriel Pénicaud, told French television. “Democracy is calling on the unions to find a solution that moves things forwards, not backwards.” Public sector workers, care home staff and students have been urged to take to the streets on Thursday as trade unions seek to build a broad-based movement of resistance to the government’s plans. Students angry at changes allowing universities to select undergraduates, which they argue breach France’s principle of free education for all, occupied the elite Sciences Po university in Paris – once attended by Macron – in the latest of a series of sit-ins, including at the Sorbonne. The militant CGT union has also called for strike action on the Paris Métro, with the head of its energy branch, Sébastien Menesplier, saying his members could consider targeted power cuts, causing more disruption. But unlike in 1995, when rail workers spearheaded a mass public-sector walkout that eventually forced the centre-right government of Alain Juppé, the then prime minister, to call off its reform plans, the rolling programme of rail strikes – two days out of every five – has not yet secured majority public backing. As anger among rail passengers mounted, a survey published on Wednesday by pollster Ifop found 61% of the public wanted the government to push ahead and implement its planned reforms. Around 32% of rail workers walked out for Wednesday’s strike, compared with 48% on the campaign’s first day two weeks ago. Ifop’s deputy general manager, Frédéric Dabi, said public support for the protesters was “relatively low: this is seen as one of the least legitimate strikes we have worked on over the past 20 years.” While the unions’ campaign was not yet lost, Dabi told Le Monde, there seemed at present to be “implicit public support, beyond his political base, for Macron’s reforms”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2018/apr/20/lord-huron-vide-noir-review-pop-goes-the-astral-plane","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-20T09:00:18Z","webTitle":"Lord Huron: Vide Noir review – pop goes the astral plane","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/apr/20/lord-huron-vide-noir-review-pop-goes-the-astral-plane","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/apr/20/lord-huron-vide-noir-review-pop-goes-the-astral-plane","fields":{"headline":"Lord Huron: Vide Noir review – pop goes the astral plane","bodyText":"For all the appeal of Lord Huron’s elegiac, ethereal Americana, Fleet Foxes and Bon Iver were ahead of them in a very crowded field. So after two albums of hymnal beauty with acoustic guitars – and a track, The Night We Met, popularised by Netflix – the Michigan band led by Ben Schneider have changed course. Now on a major label, the songs no longer conjure up vast rural or mountainous landscapes but the even more widescreen spaces of the cosmos. The title means “black void”, and vast swaths of reverb and echo (sculpted by Flaming Lips’ producer Dave Fridmann) create a celestial wall of sound; many of the songs have astral themes or metaphors. Writing on bass guitar has given the music a more powerful chassis, from Killers-like throb to subtle funk. Any remaining acoustic guitars have been blasted beyond recognition. The Balancer’s Eye (“I will see you again on the astral plane”) is cosmic pop, while Wait By the River – all doo-wop croon and twangs – and Secret of Life are reminiscent of Roy Orbison and Chris Isaak respectively. Schneider’s best songs tap into the desolate beauty of the loner, who now has a much bigger universe to get lost in. Although Ancient Names (Part I) is a convincing surging rocker, Schneider is best at penning sparse, delicate songs, which gaze at the stars and ponder life, death, the universe and everything, and the likes of Lost in Time and Space are truly lovely."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"film/2018/apr/19/the-outsider-review-documentary-nobu-su-taiwan","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-19T08:00:01Z","webTitle":"The Outsider review – doc about shipping magnate needs bailing out","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/apr/19/the-outsider-review-documentary-nobu-su-taiwan","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/apr/19/the-outsider-review-documentary-nobu-su-taiwan","fields":{"headline":"The Outsider review – doc about shipping magnate needs bailing out","bodyText":"A rather parochial documentary about a flamboyant Taiwanese shipping magnate called Nobu Su. He got very rich supplying building materials during the Chinese construction boom, lost a great deal of his staggering wealth after the banking crash of 2008, and now alleges he was tricked by his bankers, who supposedly conspired to truncate his credit line and misuse his assets to get government bailouts and to help his more conventionally established competitors. So why is Su’s story interesting to the rest of us? Other than as a superrich-lifestyle snapshot? Exasperatingly, the film can never quite decide if Su’s conspiracy theories are justified, and therefore offer a valuable insight into gangster capitalism, or if they are not justified, and so give us merely a portrait of a self-pitying ex-mogul blaming other people for his business failures. The whole business cost him his marriage, but his ex-wife is not interviewed. The film never comments on that omission, but does come weirdly to life when Su crashes his estranged daughter’s graduation ceremony and she and her sister are visibly angry with him for abandoning them. But the documentary never quite succeeds in persuading a general audience that this is anything other than a story of a wealthy guy who is now less wealthy than he was, and less wealthy than he intensely feels he should be.

She is the worst person to run errands with in a hurry because she insists on idle chat with anyone who will listen. Fellow person at the bus stop: “Aren’t you glad it’s not raining?” Server at the butcher’s: “Has it been busy recently?” Woman she’s never met before but who happens to be taking the bins out as she passes: “Popped a little cat in there, have you? Haha, only joking, I love cats!” She tells me she’s just “being a good neighbour” in a tone I read to mean she thinks I am not. What an insult! I am a great neighbour, for your information, Brenda – I keep the garden tidy, have perfect timing with the refuse collection and I never, ever speak to anyone. Or give people reason to speak to me.

No date has been set for a vote because Hammerson delayed publication of documents relating to the acquisition earlier this month after receiving a takeover approach from the French shopping centre firm Klépierre. Nick Bubb, an independent retail analyst, described the about turn by Hammerson’s board on the Intu deal as “embarrassing”. The move comes after a series of mass store closures by retailers including New Look and Toys R Us, with more planned by Carpetright, Mothercare and Homebase. David Atkins, the chief executive of Hammerson, said: “It is clear that the heightened risks to the Intu acquisition now outweigh the longer-term benefits. We have a clear strategy that has delivered consistent, strong returns on a standalone basis.” Hammerson’s share price has fallen by 5.4% since the December announcement of the proposed tie-up with Intu as well as the collapse of the takeover approach from Klépierre. The French company ditched its takeover plans last week after Hammerson’s board rejected its £5.04bn offer as “wholly inadequate”. In an announcement to the stock market about the Intu deal on Wednesday, Hammerson said it “has proven its portfolio is well positioned to weather the current environment” but “the equity market now perceives a heightened level of risk associated with the UK retail property sector as a whole”. It added that “extensive engagement” with shareholders, particularly in recent weeks, had revealed a “wide range of views on the merits of the Intu acquisition”. Intu said it regarded Hammerson’s explanations for withdrawing its backing for the merger as unsatisfactory, adding that it had been pursuing the deal in good faith since its announcement on 6 December last year. “The board of Intu is entirely confident of Intu’s commercial future and prospects,” it said, adding that a trading update issued on Tuesday had “underlined the key strengths of Intu’s business”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/apr/22/everything-you-need-to-know-about-recovering-from-a-marathon","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-22T13:00:23Z","webTitle":"Everything you need to know about recovering from a marathon","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/apr/22/everything-you-need-to-know-about-recovering-from-a-marathon","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/apr/22/everything-you-need-to-know-about-recovering-from-a-marathon","fields":{"headline":"Everything you need to know about recovering from a marathon","bodyText":"Congratulations! You are a marathoner. For months, you’ve focused on that one goal – had nightmares about it, over-analysed every niggle and spent sleepless nights fretting about what shoes to wear. Well, now you’ve gone and done it. The box is ticked, the medal is hanging around your neck. So, what now? The chances are that having pored over every minute decision that went into running the race, you’ve given absolutely no thought to how to recover from it: you certainly won’t be alone. But if you want to recover in good speed, and get back out there – either to train for another marathon or just stop feeling like a bus hit you – then you should. Treat the recovery the same way as you did the training – as an integral part of the marathon process, and you’ll soon be back and raring to go. Get back too soon and push too early, and you risk injury. Immediately after the race The second you cross that line, your legs will go from running to “utterly incapable of movement”. But don’t stop. The best thing you can do is just keep moving – it doesn’t matter how slowly. Get into clean, dry clothes and comfy shoes: I’ll be staggering around slowly in Oofos slides, others swear by cheap flip-flops. Whatever you find comfortable. If you are a fan of compression gear, now is also the time to get into that (a challenge in itself, when it comes to climbing into those tights ... ). While the jury is out on the benefits of actually running in compression gear, it can definitely help aid recovery. Go for proper, quality compression like those from CEP. It’s one area where cheap options can be a false economy. If you have any very specific sore spots, noticeable immediately, you can try a topical product like a ‘freezing’ spray. Chris Roberts, a rehabilitation therapist, explains: “Cryotherapy products such as Biofreeze are topical analgesics, which work through a ‘counter-irritant’ mechanism. This creates a sensation that overrides pain signals to the brain. This process is known as ‘gate control theory’, where nerve impulses from one stimulus block the nerves containing pain signals to the brain. But it is important to remember that cryotherapy only provides temporary pain relief and is not a long-term solution if injury does occur.” A note on painkillers: please, please, think twice. NSAIDs – such as ibuprofen or aspirin – are a lot stronger than many people realise. No one wants to be in pain, but you also don’t want to mask injury and risk making it worse. Nor do you want to do damage to a body that’s just gone through quite an ordeal. NSAIDS can cause harm to your kidneys, which are already working overtime, given you are undoubtedly mildly dehydrated, at best, and increase your blood pressure to risky levels, as well as putting you at greater risk for hyponatremia. Eat something You can research, endlessly, the latest research into the right balance of protein vs carbs and the crucial post-race recovery window in which to eat them. And in an ideal world, you’ll have that three-parts carbs/one-part protein snack waiting for you. However ... I’ve run 10 marathons and I know full well that sometimes you can’t even look at food after the race. You’ve just run 26.2 miles and your stomach is queasy, full of gels and in rebellion. Don’t worry, just try and eat whatever you can cope with, whether that’s an ice cream, a bag of crisps, a banana or a protein bar. Have a proper good meal later: heaven knows you’ve earned it. Or celebrate the next day when you feel up to it. Do, however, make sure you rehydrate – take the water you’ll be offered at the finish and keep sipping away for the rest of the day. Hot vs cold Back in the comfort of your home or hotel room, it’s time to soak those aching limbs. So what’s better, hot or cold? “The research is ever changing in this area,” says Neil Smith, a physiotherapist at Pure Sports Medicine. “But I would say that ice baths are likely to be better for recovery than a hot bath. It may not be the first thing you want to inflict on yourself after 26.2 gruelling miles – but it does have some positive effects – including reducing Doms (delayed onset muscle soreness). However, if you really feel like a dip in a hot bath the evening of the marathon then no one is going to stop you!” Also note that you do not need access to a fancy cryogenic chamber: “How cold it should be is definitely a personal choice – but something in the region of 15C would work” says Smith. “Some athletes like to go as low as 8C – and that is still achievable with cold water and plenty of bags of ice.” However, Smith and his colleague Lisa Posnett are sceptical that Epsom salts, which are often recommended as a post-marathon remedy, make any difference. “Epsom salt is a common name for magnesium sulphate,” they say. “Despite it being used for decades, there is actually little evidence out there to support its use and muscle soreness alleviation. The idea behind it is it helps reduce magnesium deficiency. However, if it seems to work for you – even if it just provides a placebo effect – then go for it!” Massage Many races will offer you a quick post-race massage. That can definitely help, but can also involve standing around in a queue, which itself can be a form of post-race torture. But if you can afford it, a proper sports massage is a really good idea. As Ellen Cook, sports massage therapist at Ten Health and Fitness says: “The sooner you can do this, the better, as it will flush out any lactic acid that has built up during the race and in turn reduce the build-up of muscle tension. Pushing ourselves that far can cause damage to the muscles. Sports massages help by warming up the muscle fibres through friction and improves blood flow and circulation. Once the muscles are warm they become more malleable, making it easier to release tension, re-align them and ultimately speeding up the healing process.” And if you’ve had a Torquemada-like experience, then don’t be put off. “There are many myths out there regarding sports massage,” says Cook. “The most common is that effective massage should hurt. This is not correct at all, there are many techniques for massage that are used to relieve muscle tension and sometimes going gung-ho on a muscle is not what it needs.” So don’t be afraid to ask your masseur to back off a bit: there are no prizes for enduring agony. Sleep well – but don’t worry if you don’t Sleep is essential for recovery. However, this also comes under the “great idea in theory, hard in practice” rule. I have never slept well after a marathon. You are riding an adrenaline high (or, though I hope not, a crashing low) and every muscle in your legs is twitching and your system just can’t seem to shut down. Don’t worry – this is perfectly normal. Just rest. Don’t reach for the phone, just try to relax, listen to an audiobook, have another bath ... whatever helps you to drift off again. You’ll no doubt catch up and sleep like a log on subsequent nights. Look after your feet If you have a blister or two, leave them alone. As Neil Smith at Pure Sports Medicine says: “If the blister hasn’t popped on its own then don’t pop it yourself. Cover it with a soft plaster – there are some great blister plasters available these days. If it has burst already – let it drain, clean it, then cover it to help prevent infection. Also avoid wearing tight-fitting shoes [after the race] that may further irritate.” In fact, comfy shoes for a few days after the race are a good idea for everyone, regardless of blisters. Doms vs Injury If your legs don’t feel like they fought a war the next day – and the day after that – then did you really run that marathon? But at what point do you know if it’s just a sore muscle, or something worse. “Doms can start a few hours after your exercise and will often peak at about 48-72 hrs, but can last up to even a week,” says Smith. “A lot of people find some gentle massaging and stretching can be helpful. If the pain lasts longer than a week or gets worse then I would suggest seeking some medical advice from a physio or doctor.” Consider taking a week – or even two – off To some of you, that will be a no-brainer. Those legs are barely coping with stairs, let alone the idea of running again any time soon. Others, riding an adrenaline high, will be twitching to get back out there again after a few days. Don’t. You have nothing to gain, and a lot of torn muscle fibres that need to heal. If you crave being active, go for a swim, or do a gentle yoga class, but do not feel guilty about not doing any exercise if you don’t feel like it. Remember that elite athletes take a minimum of two very, very easy weeks to recover from a marathon, some longer. If you just want to get outside, gentle walking is a great way to stretch out sore legs. Post-marathon bugs and blues Your immune system, as well as your legs, has just taken a battering. Many people come down with a minor bug in the week after a marathon. So look after yourself, and try to eat healthily. Sure, you deserve celebratory treats, but your body needs to rebuild so be nice to it, and give it the micronutrients it deserves. As well as the cake. But don’t be surprised if elation soon turns to a touch of the blues. You’ve spent months planning and training for this event, and suddenly there’s a hole. Start thinking to the future: while you need to rest and recover, there’s no harm in starting to think of your next challenge. Push on Follow all this advice (and if you have, you’re doing better than me. As my mum would say: “Do as I say, not as I do”) and you’ll soon – but not too soon – be back and raring to go. Use that marathon fitness and see what it can do to your 5k or 10k times."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"politics/2018/apr/18/wales-opposition-parties-debate-carl-sargeant-report-government","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-18T09:21:17Z","webTitle":"Welsh parties try to force publication of Carl Sargeant report","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/apr/18/wales-opposition-parties-debate-carl-sargeant-report-government","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/apr/18/wales-opposition-parties-debate-carl-sargeant-report-government","fields":{"headline":"Welsh parties try to force publication of Carl Sargeant report","bodyText":"Opposition parties in Wales have criticised the Labour-led government for blocking the publication of a report examining claims that the sacking of Carl Sargeant from his ministerial post was leaked in the days before he killed himself. The Welsh Tories claimed during a assembly debate that it was morally wrong for the report not to be published. It was one of three reports commissioned after Sargeant was found dead, having been dismissed as communities secretary following allegations about his conduct towards women. The report found “no evidence of prior unauthorised sharing of information” about his sacking, according to a short statement issued after its conclusion. Opposition parties have said it should be published in a redacted form, but Welsh ministers claim this could still identify witnesses. The first minister, Carwyn Jones, tried to halt the debate by claiming it was unlawful and saying he could take legal action. During the debate on Wednesday the leader of the Welsh Conservatives, Andrew RT Davies, said safeguards could be put in place to protect witnesses. He told Labour backbenchers that if they did not support him, “morally you will be found wanting”. The Plaid Cymru AM Adam Price said denial of information was “always suspect” while the Ukip leader at the assembly, Neil Hamilton, branded the threat of legal action to halt the debate an “extraordinary reprise of the kind of action we saw in the 1640s” – a reference to King Charles I’s aggressive approach to political opponents in England. The counsel general Jeremy Miles, whose job includes providing legal advice to the Welsh government, said witnesses might be reluctant to cooperate in future inquiries if the report was published. Before the debate in a letter to the presiding officer, Elin Jones, the first minister wrote that if the Tories’ motion were not withdrawn, he reserved the right to bring proceedings for judicial review. The presiding officer replied: “I have taken advice and carefully considered your arguments. Having done so, I am not persuaded of the case which you have advanced. As a result, the motion remains scheduled for debate.” Meanwhile, another inquiry, into whether Jones misled the assembly over what he knew about claims of bullying in the Welsh government dating back to 2014, has concluded that he did not breach the ministerial code. Headed by James Hamilton, a lawyer, the inquiry said answers given by the first minister in the assembly were accurate and truthful. The third, and main inquiry, headed by Paul Bowen QC, is yet to begin and is expected to take several months. The attempt to force the publication of the report failed. Twenty-six assembly members backed the Tory motion calling for it to be released, one abstained and 29 voted against."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"crosswords/quick/14964","type":"crossword","sectionId":"crosswords","sectionName":"Crosswords","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-23T23:00:03Z","webTitle":"Quick crossword No 14,964","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/quick/14964","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/crosswords/quick/14964","fields":{"headline":"Quick crossword No 14,964","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/apr/19/michael-mccormack-talks-health-and-education-as-nationals-turn-page-on-joyce","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-18T21:03:52Z","webTitle":"Michael McCormack talks health and education as Nationals turn page on Joyce","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/apr/19/michael-mccormack-talks-health-and-education-as-nationals-turn-page-on-joyce","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/apr/19/michael-mccormack-talks-health-and-education-as-nationals-turn-page-on-joyce","fields":{"headline":"Michael McCormack talks health and education as Nationals turn page on Joyce","bodyText":"Australia’s acting prime minister, Michael McCormack, will promise to build on Barnaby Joyce’s work by renewing the party’s focus on regional health and education in his first major speech as Nationals leader. With Malcolm Turnbull overseas attending the Commonwealth heads of government meeting, McCormack will front the National Press Club on Thursday to set goals for better service provision in regional areas. McCormack became Nationals leader in late February when Joyce resigned after weeks of fallout over his affair with a former staffer and now partner, Vikki Campion. • Sign up to receive the top stories every morning Still relatively unknown to the electorate despite stints as minister for small business, veteran’s affairs, and defence personnel, McCormack will seek to raise his and the party’s profile by highlighting the Nationals’ achievements in the infrastructure portfolio, which he now holds. In excerpts of the speech, seen by Guardian Australia, McCormack sets goals of enticing doctors and teachers to regional areas but relies on existing Coalition policies in both health and education to explain how it can be achieved. “It is simply not good enough that regional Australians should be made to suffer through doctor and nurse shortages or that they be forced to travel thousands of kilometres to see a healthcare provider,” McCormack warns. “We see this in far more places than we should in 2018 … And I think there simply must be a better way,” he says. McCormack says there is no “magic wand” to bring doctors to the bush and argues the party must persist with its policy of training medical students in the bush, conceding it is a “still a work in progress”. On education, McCormack says the Liberals and Nationals are delivering needs-based funding for schools which will be “fairer for regional students” and points to a plan in the 2017 budget to increase the number of apprenticeships and traineeships by 300,000 over four years. “So our message on education is clear – whether it’s a degree or a trade, further education is good for everyone,” he says. “And a trade is every bit as good as a degree.” McCormack cites the high cost of students relocating for study as another area that “needs more work”, adding that he looks forward to working on it with his colleagues including deputy leader Bridget McKenzie. Despite leading an outwardly more united team than that of the senior Coalition partner, the Liberals, McCormack faces a number of challenges as Nationals leader. After inheriting the leadership from Joyce, McCormack set about attempting to reunite the Nationals with a March reshuffle that returned key allies Darren Chester and Keith Pitt to frontbench roles after they were dumped from cabinet by his predecessor in December’s reshuffle. Joyce has never ruled out returning to the leadership. Joyce loyalists Matt Canavan and David Littleproud, who was canvassing a run at the top job before belatedly dropping out for McCormack, still retain senior positions in cabinet. After taking the leadership, McCormack was forced to again renounce a homophobic editorial he wrote in 1993 while editor of Wagga Wagga’s Daily Advertiser and distanced himself from a string of others in which he advocated for the death penalty, opposed anti-gay hate laws and compared women’s soccer to an “egg and spoon” race. On Tuesday McCormack landed in hot water with Coalition colleagues, after comments to the Daily Telegraph suggesting treasurer Scott Morrison would play the part of Santa Claus in the May budget and give “goodies” that would bring cheer to voters. After Morrison said he was “no Santa Claus and there won’t be a Christmas in May”, the acting prime minister refused to retract the comment but told 2GB Radio it showed his enthusiasm for the government’s infrastructure spending."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/apr/19/my-town-is-so-green-theres-no-plastic-so-why-is-my-tree-covered-in-it","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-19T03:50:01Z","webTitle":"My town is so green there's no plastic, so why is my tree covered in it? | Brigid Delaney's diary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/19/my-town-is-so-green-theres-no-plastic-so-why-is-my-tree-covered-in-it","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/19/my-town-is-so-green-theres-no-plastic-so-why-is-my-tree-covered-in-it","fields":{"headline":"My town is so green there's no plastic, so why is my tree covered in it?","bodyText":"Last week my mum was driving me from the coast up to my house, to stay for a couple of days, when I decided to ask her something that had been perplexing me. “Mum, why did you wrap the tree in my backyard in plastic?” A few months ago I’d come home from an overseas trip to find the large tree in the backyard had the entirety of its lower limbs wrapped in a thick black plastic. It was not the American Beauty plastic bag in the tree that so transfixed Wes Bentley’s character (“Sometimes there’s so much beauty in the world, I feel like I can’t take it, and my heart is just going to cave in”). Instead, it was a menacing presence, like a Dark Mofo installation or a visual arts representation of a black hole. The plastic was thick and tough – the sort aid organisations use to shield dead bodies after a natural disaster. Sign up to receive the latest Australian opinion pieces every weekday I presumed my parents had wrapped the tree last time they stayed because the fairy lights on its branches were shining into their bedroom and they couldn’t get to sleep (why not just take the lights out then, Mum, why did you have to wrap the tree in plastic?). “I don’t know what you’re talking about,” my mother said. “We did not wrap your tree in plastic.” We pulled into the house. Half the plastic was still on the tree – I had removed some of it, then got tired and hadn’t finished the job. The portion I had removed had taken up most of the room in my large yellow recycling bin. The plastic that was left was pockmarked by the weather and covered in bird shit. It was ratty and flapped in the wind like an evil flag. In a weird irony I got a text message from my editor not long after we arrived, asking me to write about going a week without plastics. I looked at my diary. Easy, I was spending much of my week at home, where the only plastic I would be likely to see was the plastic hanging off my tree. “I shall try valiantly to live without plastics!” I wrote back, knowing that the difficulty I faced was not living without plastic but the opposite. It was a challenge to live with plastics! Very few places in my town carry plastic bags and you have to make a special case to get one. I live in a village that was established around the mid-19th century. The buildings are beautifully preserved. There’s an old-fashioned courthouse and a town hall, with a clocktower, like the one in Back to the Future. In recent years the town has been gentrifying at a great clip and although it may be unconscious I have observed that many people in the town don’t just want to preserve the 1860s – they want to be in the 1860s. They want to be pre-plastic people. There is no Uber Eats (there’s no Uber). Children play with wooden toys. Sometimes I see people on unicycles down the wide main streets. I see men wearing capes unironically. The men have Ned Kelly beards (no disposable plastic razors necessary) and wear lumberjack shirts or formal black waistcoats. The women dress like Quaker school teachers in chunky cardigans and long smock dresses made of rough natural fibres. I am yet to see anyone with signs of visible plastic surgery. When I arrived, some 18 months ago, my phone and internet stopped working. We were in a Vodafone blackspot – just like the 1860s! Then there’s getting around. As I don’t drive, I have to take prehistoric modes of transport: walking and cycling. My house was built in the 1860s and, when one of my brothers first saw it, he got very excited because it reminded him of the fake 1860s houses at the model maritime village in Warrnambool, Flagstaff Hill. “It’s like the candlemaker’s cottage!” In this ye olde environment, plastic is hard to come by. I feel shame when asking shops for a plastic bag and do the verbal equivalent of a carbon offset to justify it: “I am asking for this plastic bag because I have to walk two miles home in the rain and I don’t want these loose salmon steaks and laundry detergent to get wet.” So when my mother and I set off into town on our buggies (just joking, my mum drove) to buy some provisions, we did so with our largest handbags. The first stop was to get some ham. The man in the small goods shop neatly wrapped the ham (smoked on the premises) in wax paper. In the organic vegetable shop next door, we were not offered plastic bags. When we stopped into a cafe for a drink, our iced tea came with metal straws. We went to the cellar door of a winemaker, who told us that there were no sulphates in the wine and that we might find sediment in the bottom. We bought a bottle of wine and were not offered bags. Likewise at the next shop, where we bought two glass bottles of mineral water. We were running out of arms! At the weekend I went to the farmers’ market where I carried the food home in my pockets (no plastic bags) and bought a bunch of flowers secured with twine. (Twine! So 1860s!) At the flea market, I bought recycled clothes, including a chunky Quaker cardigan. Once again, no plastic bags were offered to shoppers. My friend bought a heavy jacket and wore it home. (Bodies: the best way to transport clothes!) At the end of her stay, Mum and I drank our wine in the backyard of the candlemaker’s cottage, waiting for the tide of sediment to hit our back palates. The fairy lights tried to sparkle under the thick black plastic. “You know what?” said Mum. “I think someone has poisoned your tree and put plastic on the branches so that the birds don’t die.” The tree did look a bit sick. Maybe it had been poisoned. In a way, it was like American Beauty, or maybe a David Lynch film where under the wholesome plastic-free exterior there lurked menace: the worm in the heart of a rose. • Brigid Delaney is a Guardian Australia columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"}]}}
