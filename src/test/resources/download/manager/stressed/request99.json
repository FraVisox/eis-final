There are the rolling hills of the South Downs, the dome of St Paul’s and opulent columns of Buckingham Palace – with a difference: they are all emblazoned with swastikas. The series is the newest ambitious, big-budget drama from the BBC. Based on the bestselling novel by Len Deighton, SS-GB envisions a world in 1941 in which the Nazis won the Battle of Britain and took full control of the UK. It is, according to the creators, “the ultimate post-truth drama – what could be more fitting for this moment in time?” The show, which begins on 19 February, is also the BBC’s latest attempt to maintain its hold over crucial Sunday night ratings. It follows on from a successful run of dramas, beginning the year with Sherlock, which at its peak drew in 8.1 million viewers on New Year’s Day, and then the critically lauded thriller Apple Tree Yard, starring Emily Watson, which drew in 7 million for its first episode on 22 January. For the show’s producers Sally Woodward Gentle and Lee Morris, adapting Deighton’s book has been decades in the making. Woodward Gentle met Deighton, considered alongside John le Carré and Ian Fleming to be among the great British spy thriller authors, 20 years ago and the pair remained friends. “Len actually suggested it as a good one to adapt, but he wanted it to be done by the right people – other people had tried before and failed,” she said. “It’s too nuanced and complicated to do as a film so it made sense for it to be done as television, but it’s only recently that television has been ambitious enough to take on something like that.” Like the BBC’s previous global drama success, The Night Manager, it has attracted high-calibre talent. The central character of Det Supt Douglas Archer, who grapples with having the Nazis as his bosses while also being embroiled in the resistance, is played by Sam Riley, who starred in films such as Control and On the Road, while Kate Bosworth plays the American reporter who becomes his love interest. The script has been written by Neal Purvis and Robert Wade, who co-wrote six James Bond films including Skyfall. Deighton, now 87, read the final script before production began but made no changes. While it is a drama firmly set in the past, Morris and Woodward Gentle said they could never have anticipated how many of the themes it touches on, and the climate of fear it evokes, would become so relevant to the world today. “In this post-truth, selfish, populist, moment SS-GB raises important questions,” said Woodward Gentle. “We see people scared and vulnerable, they feel under attack, they are torn because people they loved and they thought they knew, aren’t doing what they consider to be the right thing. People who they thought they could trust have affiliations elsewhere. People are driven by self-interest. So in that sense the show feels topical.” Morris agreed. “It now feels like we have entered into some kind of dystopian parallel universe,” he said, adding with a laugh: “So who would have developed this show apart from people with great foresight?” The appetite for drama around the world means the BBC can afford to give creators such as Woodward Gentle and Morris a larger budget, as profits from selling the show through BBC Worldwide have soared. The pair also said that while SS-GB was “very different”, they would happily build on the success of The Night Manager, which recently won three Golden Globes. For Morris, the draw of SS-GB comes from the watertight plotting of Deighton’s book but also the moral questions the setting of Nazi-occupied Britain inevitably raises in the minds of those watching. “We all like to think we would resist but history tells us that not everybody does,” he said. “When you look at the central character Archer, and the compromised position that he’s in, you inevitably ask yourself what would you do, what would we all do? Would we all be in the resistance or would we have to be pragmatic? That’s all part of the brilliance.” While the story is concluded over five episodes, the writers have left it possible for it to continue if there is an appetite for more. “The series is left quite open-ended enough that we can do a second series if we need to,” said Woodward Gentle. “We’d love to take it on again.” • This article was amended on 13 February 2017. Apple Tree Yard starred Emily Watson, not Samantha Morton as an earlier version said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"business/2017/feb/13/diamond-rings-sparkle-for-the-internet-dating-generation","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-13T13:39:04Z","webTitle":"Diamond rings sparkle for the internet dating generation","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/feb/13/diamond-rings-sparkle-for-the-internet-dating-generation","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2017/feb/13/diamond-rings-sparkle-for-the-internet-dating-generation","fields":{"headline":"Diamond rings sparkle for the internet dating generation","bodyText":"Where once a trip to the jewellers was a rite of passage for those wishing to tie the knot, thousands of people, mostly men, are now prepared to buy an engagement ring online. 77 Diamonds is a business set up to cater for the changing consumer habits of a generation which chooses a date by a swipe of their phone and probably booked a Valentines night out online. The company, based in a workshop up a scruffy narrow staircase behind a restaurant in central London , has caused a bit of a stir in the UK’s diamond industry by undercutting bigger players and removing the need for personal consultations in a jewellery store. Tobias Kormind, who founded 77 Diamonds in 2005 after stints at investment bank Morgan Stanley and helping to restructure online trading platform Interactive Investor, says one client spent £120,000 on a ring without ever seeing it in person. Another ordered a £500,000 piece online and paid a deposit, only flying in to the company’s Mayfair showroom for a viewing once it was close to completion. Clients include Premier League footballers and captains of industry. Most of the company’s clients are not splashing quite that much cash, but more than half spend as much as £3,000 online. Opening a leather box which looks like it might contain luxury chocolates, Kormind reveals two diamonds the size of throat lozenges. One has a rather glitzy cut that looks like it might be happy nestling at the throat of an Oscar nominee while the other is cut with an art deco-style similar to rings worn by Elizabeth Taylor and Beyoncé. They’re both worth north of £1m and are likely to be made into bespoke pieces. “We want to be a modern version of Tiffany and be an aspirational brand,” says Kormind, a 44-year-old Dane who went to school in Oxfordshire. “It’s not just about selling diamonds cheaply it’s about craftsmanship. If you want people to refer you, you need to have that quality product, service and design.” Kormind first set up the diamond sales site in 2005 while working for Marketing 77, a firm that helped luxury brands including Estee Lauder and Anya Hindmarch set up transactional websites. Three years later, he wanted to focus on the diamonds and teamed up with his wife, Ira, and business partner Vadim Weinig to buy out the business. Kormind funded his side of the buy-out with a few hundred thousand earned during his time working in banking as well as from remortgaging his flat. After a year of improving the website and building better relationships with diamond suppliers, turnover grew from about £400,000 to £2.4m. Today sales are about £18m and expected to rise to nearly £25m this year, according to Kormind. He says the business is profitable and looking at taking on outside investment to help build its international presence. As the price of diamonds in the UK has risen between 15% and 20% since the Brexit vote, because the pound has fallen against dollar in which they are priced, Kormind says clients are choosing to spend about the same amount but tweaking the size, or other factors to meet their budget. He says 77 Diamonds is able to offer jewellery as much as 70% cheaper than well-known businesses such as Graff or Tiffany partly because it bypasses the traditional wholesale markets and goes straight to the diamond cutters and polishers in India, the US and Antwerp. The group has access to about 400,000 stones, but only a fraction of this is held as stock helping to keep costs down. The jewellery is made to order with most of the gold and platinum rings cast at a firm based in Birmingham and then fitted with diamonds in the London workshop. In a tiny hot room, 77 Diamonds’ craftsmen sit at wooden benches curved like hairdresser’s sinks. The worktops are covered in exotic-looking tools – thin rasps that could have come out of a dentist’s kit, pointed tools with grips like small door handles and more emery boards than a manicurist could ever need. Leathery cradles looped under the benches in case any precious items are dropped also hold piles of pliers and other tools. Diamond setters Jason and Dean, who’ve previously done work for the likes of DeBeers and Cartier, reckon they have sat next to each other for nearly 30 years. With the steady hand and confidence of a master craftsman Jason takes tiny grains of diamond from a small wooden tray with a lick of spit and a fine tool shaped like a blunt toothpick. He then fits them into tiny recesses drilled in the ring. While this scene could be from the era of Dickens, it is offset by a futuristic laser welding machine used for cutting rings down to size. “About 90% of the jewellery sold in the UK isn’t made here and we are clawing a little bit of that back,” Kormind says. “We work with all the largest manufacturing groups and they all comply with the Kimberley Process. We don’t work with someone who doesn’t know where the diamonds are from.” Set up in 2000 in collaboration with a group of governments, the Kimberley Process is designed to stop diamonds being used to fund wars. The action against so-called conflict diamonds has been widely praised, but Global Witness, one of the NGOs that helped draft the Kimberley Process, resigned in 2011 over concerns it did not act to stop trade of diamonds where there are wider human rights abuses. Kormind says he believes in the system but technology can add even more traceability to the market. He’d like to see every single diamond traced right back to the mine it came from. He adds that one of 77 Diamonds’ casters uses 80% recycled gold and he wants to introduce Fairtrade gold within the next 12 months."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"news/2017/feb/12/profitable-for-developers-to-keep-britain-short-of-houses","type":"article","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-12T00:05:29Z","webTitle":"It is profitable for developers to keep Britain short of homes | The big issue","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2017/feb/12/profitable-for-developers-to-keep-britain-short-of-houses","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/2017/feb/12/profitable-for-developers-to-keep-britain-short-of-houses","fields":{"headline":"It is profitable for developers to keep Britain short of homes","bodyText":"Before we start carving up the green belt to build more housing, it might be a good idea to require the sites that already have planning permission to be brought forward for development. The last estimate I saw showed that there were 700,000 houses with extant permissions but on which construction has not yet started (“Plans to open up the green belt have to be just the start”, Comment). Developers are not charitable institutions; their prime responsibility is to their profits and shareholders, hence they drip-feed developments to suit them. This means that councils that demonstrated they had the requisite five-year supply of housing land when they adopted their development plans, say two or three years ago, can no longer prove that because of the way it is calculated. This carries significant weight, particularly if they refuse permission and an appeal follows, which is likely to be allowed. So we have the ridiculous situation where the supply of planning permissions is increasing but the supply of new houses is not. The other problem, and one that relates particularly to affordable housing, is that developers are only too keen to agree to build, say, 30% affordable housing in order to get planning permission. You would assume that they would build this into how much they pay for the land, but they will often return later, plead “non-viability” and seek to reduce the figure, knowing the cards are stacked against a council that resists. Despite the latest rhetoric from the government, it doesn’t matter if affordable housing is to buy or rent if the houses aren’t being built in the first place and if the proportion of affordable units is so vulnerable. As the government is clearly reluctant to put pressure on developers to speed up, an option would be to enable councils or housing associations to acquire land – possibly compulsorily – and build houses. Unfortunately, this would require legislation, which is even more unlikely under this government. Norman Jowett Nottingham Rowan Moore made clear a point that all too rarely features in any discussion of the housing shortage: it will never be resolved by private developers. As he puts it: “It is not in their interests to do so.” They are in business for the quite legitimate purpose of making a profit, not to solve social problems. They do their utmost to provide as little affordable housing as possible and the last thing they want (along with nearly all existing homeowners) is to create a situation that leads to a drop in prices. Public investment is the only way to ensure that people on low incomes can have a decent roof over their heads and enough left over to put food on the table. Les Masters Weston-super-Mare As ever, the Tories do not try to address the real problem, so their plans to help renters will do nothing to deal with the housing crisis in Britain (“Tories break with Thatcher homes policy to back renters”, News). There are plenty of good landlords, but even the bad ones didn’t create the problem: successive governments did that over decades, allowing cheap money from around the world to be used to buy the homes British people need, many of which remain as empty cashboxes in the sky. Only a serious attack on the ludicrous house price situation and stricter rules on empty flats and foreign ownership will deal with the issue. Start by repealing right to buy and all variants, including laws forcing housing associations to sell their best properties to their richest tenants and help-to-buy schemes that only prop up prices; withdraw all tax deductibles allowed for multiple-property owners; double council tax on all homes empty for more than 12 months and continue doubling for every subsequent year; if a flat remains empty for more than five years, allow councils to compulsorily purchase them. Oh, and stop all sales to non-residents.

Today, however, the word from South America is that Fifa are about to crank things up a notch. While Diego Maradona’s appointment to an ambassadorial role with world football’s governing body does not automatically mean guests at their lavish soirees can expect to be offered mountains of a stimulant that is considerably less fattening than chocolate, the Argentinian’s one-time fondness for jazz salt suggests many will attend in a state of cautious optimism. They will be disappointed, naturally. We need look no further than Diego’s ban from football during the 1994 World Cup to see how intolerant of drug use Fifa’s blazers can be, while his new role with the organisation provides a heartwarming example of their fabled capacity for forgiveness and bridge-building. Unless you’ve spent so much time gorging from the Fifa trough that your name is actually Blazer. But enough about Chuck the grass, a sad relic of Fifa’s sordid and soon-to-be forgotten past. “Now it’s official,” cheered Maradona on his Facebook page. “Finally I can fulfil one of the lifelong dreams; to work for a clean and transparent Fifa alongside people who really love football.” By clean and transparent Fifa, Maradona ostensibly means a Fifa reboot that hasn’t been caught doing anything too untoward since it got rid of his old mucker Sepp Blatter and appointed one-time Big Cup bingo caller Gianni Infantino in his place. Famous for his refusal to disclose his salary and with a fondness for private jets, chauffeured cars and lavish expenses, Blatter is currently serving a six-year period in exile from his former Fifa fiefdom and has been replaced by the former head of Uefa. As clean and transparent as the organisation he now heads, Infantino is – or at least was – also famous for his refusal to disclose his salary and a fondness for private jets, chauffeured cars and lavish expenses. Maradona could never have clambered aboard the gravy train while Blatter was in charge of Fifa, not least because of his fairly accurate assessment that the organisation had become “a disgrace and a painful embarrassment” under a man he likened “to an old Mafia boss who has somehow managed to stay out of jail”. Indeed, it is probably this kind of diplomatic language and capacity to avoid causing offence that caught the eye of Fifa’s new boss, who played on the same team as the 1986 World Cup winner during a five-a-side at Fifa HQ last month. “In recognition of his outstanding and unique contribution to football, Fifa is looking for the best way to collaborate with Diego Armando Maradona, ensuring he has a major role in Fifa’s activities to promote the game across the globe, through his involvement in relevant development projects and the Fifa Legends’ programme,” whooped a statement which suggests nobody at Fifa is quite sure how best to deal with their combustible and charismatic new employee. England’s footballers found themselves in a similar situation in Mexico back in 1986 and while Maradona came up smelling of roses, for Bobby Robson’s boys, it didn’t end at all well.

Can’t you just feel those winds of change? The first rule of Arsène Wenger’s Arsenal fight club is that you do not talk about Arsène Wenger’s Arsenal fight club. “When you are a competitor you fight,” honked Wenger, playing free and easy with his own rules. “You fight as far as you can and we are in a double fight. We are in a fight to be in the top four, but we also have to fight because we want to catch Chelsea. We have to refuse to give up.” The World Anti‑Doping Agency has described the lack of drug testing in Spanish football during the past 11 months as “alarming” and “deeply disappointing”. And Ronald Koeman wants Romelu Lukaku to autograph a bumper new Everton contract as soon as possible and would quite like the club to get a wriggle on. “I don’t believe [Mr 15%s],” mused Koeman. “I don’t know what is happening.

The report also found that more than 40% of adolescents in Tanzania were left out of quality lower-secondary education, despite a decision to make this schooling free. The country has one of the world’s largest youth populations, with 43% of people under the age of 15. The east African state, which has put young people at the heart of its aspiration to become a middle-income country by 2025, has been lauded for its December 2015 move to abolish all fees and charges for secondary schools. Enrolment has significantly increased as a result, according to the government. But in its report, “I Had a Dream to Finish School”: Barriers to Secondary Education in Tanzania, the human rights group said that the country’s government needed to do more to address crowded classrooms, discrimination and abuse, which undermined many adolescents’ education. It found that school officials conducted compulsory pregnancy tests and that, in most cases, girls were not allowed to re-enrol after their children were born. The use of “brutal and humiliating forms” of corporal punishment was also found to be common in schools, affecting attendance. Although still lawful in the country, HRW said this violates Tanzania’s international obligations, and that the frequency with which it happened was “alarmingly high”. The report said female students were exposed to widespread sexual harassment, and that in some schools male teachers attempted to persuade or coerce them into sexual relationships. Although Tanzania was once regarded as one of Africa’s development success stories and one of the continent’s largest recipients of aid, international donors suspended nearly $500m (£400m) in budget support to the country in 2014 in response to claims that senior government officials siphoned off funds. Nevertheless, major education programmes aiming to raise the quality of learning in its primary and secondary schools have received significant levels of external investment. Key donors include the World Bank (pdf) and the UK, which is investing more than £150m in education over an eight-year period (2013- 20). Elin Martínez, children’s rights researcher at Human Rights Watch, said the UK government was to be commended for its funding, but added: “Effective investment is about more than just pumping money into the system and getting children to physically attend school. It’s about making sure children are treated right once they get there too. “Donors, including the UK, should push the Tanzanian government to make sure children are safe in schools, and it should urgently grapple with two of the biggest problems we’ve uncovered: corporal punishment and widespread sexual abuse.” A spokeswoman for Britain’s Department for International Development (DfID) said the UK had helped more than a half a million students to receive a higher quality of education in Tanzania. “We are working with the government of Tanzania to implement lasting improvements to the education system, and have recently supported significant advances in literacy rates, pupil-to-teacher ratios and the number of pupils passing exams,” she added. DfID support comes through two main initiatives – the Education Quality Improvement Programme and the Education Programme for Results, which was previously known as Big Results Now. The former only provides support when key education results in primary and secondary education have been achieved, according to DfID, while the latter has worked with Tanzanian education authorities to develop a campaign to reduce corporal punishment and guide teachers on abiding by codes of conduct. HRW interviewed more than 220 secondary school students, out-of-school adolescents, parents, education experts, local activists, development partners, and national and local government officials in eight districts in four regions of Tanzania."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2017/feb/14/tuesdays-best-tv-the-moorside-andrew-marr-my-brain-and-me","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-14T06:09:34Z","webTitle":"Tuesday’s best TV: The Moorside, Andrew Marr – My Brain and Me","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/feb/14/tuesdays-best-tv-the-moorside-andrew-marr-my-brain-and-me","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2017/feb/14/tuesdays-best-tv-the-moorside-andrew-marr-my-brain-and-me","fields":{"headline":"Tuesday’s best TV: The Moorside, Andrew Marr – My Brain and Me","bodyText":"Nature’s Greatest Dancers 8pm, Eden Yes, it appears that the makers of much-memed nature docs have officially decided to cut out the middleman, matching footage of animals to a pop soundtrack and calling it dance.

In this personal story, he charts his recovery from a major stroke, returns to the hospital that saved his life and explores some of the mysteries of the old grey matter. Ali Catterall Secret Life of Dogs 9pm, ITV Narrated by Martin Clunes, this gentle dog-umentary series isn’t without interesting titbits. Tonight’s episode focuses on working hounds, revealing that chihuahuas are now favoured as sniffer dogs due to their size and startling sense of smell. There’s also the remarkable story of Holly, whose pooch has learned to monitor her blood sugar levels as she sleeps.

Phil Harrison Life of a Mountain: A Year on Blencathra 9pm, BBC4 Filmmaker Terry Abraham returns to the Lake District, following last year’s study of Scafell Pike. This is another beautifully photographed meditation on the mountain and the people who live on and around it, through all four seasons. The shots of clouds drifting across a sumptuous landscape are interwoven with the wry reflections of locals. However, the insertion of celebrity climbers Ed Byrne and Stuart Maconie feels jarring and unnecessary.

Wilshere is on a season-long deal at the Vitality Stadium after injury issues blighted his progress over recent seasons. He has proved his fitness by making 17 Premier League starts, establishing himself in Howe’s team and impressing the management with his attitude, contribution and influence. The 25-year-old will have 12 months on his contract at Arsenal when he returns in the summer and, with no guarantees of a new deal or regular first-team football at his parent club, will need to assess his options. Bournemouth, whose record outlay is the initial £13m paid to Liverpool for Jordon Ibe last summer, are keen to buy Wilshere. “We would love that to happen,” Howe said. “I can’t rate Jack any higher as a person or a footballer, and how he’s come into the team and what he has delivered for us. But there has been no discussion with Arsenal. “As I see it, Jack’s on loan until the summer when we’ll look at it and Jack will look at it. He views this as his home at the moment, until the end of the season. His heart has been here from the day he walked in the door. There have been no problems there. But it’s his right to review his options at the end of the season and see where his career goes next. “His future is something we can worry about at the end of the season. Not now. We’ve got other things to think about. But it’s very much in Jack’s hands, and where he sees his career going next. We’re enjoying the relationship at the moment, but let’s concentrate on the football.” Wilshere’s has been a busy presence in the side since he joined on transfer deadline day in the autumn, when Milan, Roma and Crystal Palace were left disappointed by the player’s desire to move to Bournemouth. Howe remains unperturbed by the player’s record of no goals and only two assists – the last of which set up Josh King in the 6-3 defeat at Everton last Saturday – in his 21 appearances. “From my perspective, I look deeper in terms of what he is doing and what he’s doing for the team,” Howe said. “This season we’ve improved a lot of the aspects of our play because of him. It’s not down to one individual in how you play, but he’s fitted into that team very well. He is producing more match-defining moments for me: the pass to Josh King against Everton was sublime. I think there are more moments like that to come from him as he continues to improve.” Bournemouth go into the home match with Manchester City on Monday six points above the relegation zone, having won only once in eight top‑flight matches. Simon Francis, Adam Smith and Charlie Daniels, all key members of Bournemouth’s first-choice back-line, have failed to train this week because of injury."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"politics/2017/feb/12/brexit-what-use-sovereignty-when-mps-deny-conscience","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-12T06:59:00Z","webTitle":"What use is sovereignty when MPs deny their conscience over Brexit?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/feb/12/brexit-what-use-sovereignty-when-mps-deny-conscience","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/feb/12/brexit-what-use-sovereignty-when-mps-deny-conscience","fields":{"headline":"What use is sovereignty when MPs deny their conscience over Brexit?","bodyText":"‘The first duty of an MP is to do what he [or she] thinks … is right and necessary for the honour and safety of Great Britain. His second duty is to his constituents, of whom he is the representative but not the delegate.” These are the wise words of Sir Winston Churchill, ignored by the majority of our elected representatives in last week’s vote on the Brexit bill. In his magnificent contribution to the debate – a speech of which Churchill himself would have been proud – the veteran Conservative statesman Kenneth Clarke stated that, in opposing Brexit, his conscience was clear, but “when we see what unfolds after we leave the EU, I hope the consciences of other members of parliament remain equally content”. He did not go as far as to quote Hamlet – “thus conscience does make cowards of us all” – but I could not help thinking that, if not cowardice, the word “pusillanimity” might not have been far from his mind with regard to the position of his colleagues. Consider: it is widely acknowledged in Westminster that the vast majority of members of both houses of parliament regard Brexit as little short of national madness. Yet only one Tory – namely Clarke himself – 52 Labour MPs and a small band of Liberals had the guts to vote against triggering article 50 of the Lisbon treaty. As Clarke says: “I have never seen anything as mad or chaotic as this.” In another memorable observation, the Financial Times commentator Martin Wolf writes: “What sane country would sever its ties to its most important trading partners and its strategic position in its continental councils over a feeling that its own government agrees is erroneous?” The feeling being the mistaken belief that parliament has not been sovereign throughout our membership of the EU, which it has and still is, as last week’s potentially catastrophic vote reminds us. Alas, the mistaken belief that parliament had sacrificed sovereignty to Brussels when we joined the EU was undoubtedly one of the key factors that influenced the outcome of the referendum – midsummer madness on midsummer’s eve. It is bad enough that MPs representing constituencies that voted Leave opted to be delegates, and not representatives exercising their own judgment. Bad enough but understandable up to a point. What seems inexcusable is the way that so many MPs representing strong Remain constituencies also voted to trigger article 50. The lame excuse propounded by Remain MPs signing up for Brexit is, essentially, that “the people have spoken, and it would be undemocratic to ignore the will of the people”. But the truth is that they are ignoring the will of half of the people on the official count and a majority of the people when you consider that only 37% of the electorate actually voted for Brexit. The philosopher AC Grayling has pointed out in the New European that there was an “artificially restricted franchise “on 23 June for what was, in any case, supposed to be an “advisory” referendum: unlike the case with the Scottish referendum, “we know that 16-17-year-olds were denied a vote, that a large class of expatriates was denied a vote, and that EU citizens living, working and paying their taxes in the UK were denied a vote”. Theresa May has made a Faustian pact with the devil of Ukip, under which she is evidently prepared to aggravate the already serious problems of our economy – low productivity, austerity, and pressures on the NHS, to name but three – by leaving the customs union and the single market in order to pay lip service to control of immigration. I say lip service because there was not much sign that she was very successful in this regard when she had sovereignty over immigration during her long years as home secretary. Nor is there any convincing evidence that reducing immigration from the rest of the EU will calm the “protest voters” who were the swing element behind the narrow victory for the Leave campaign. On the contrary: making the country poorer is a funny way of going about assuaging such anger. Moreover, not only are our overstretched hospitals vitally dependent on migrant staff in order to function at all: so are our manufacturers and services. Thus, as Jeremy Goring, one of our leading hoteliers, recently said: “We never turn away British people for jobs. It doesn’t happen. It’s a cheap headline that is simply not true. Restricting foreigners will not mean more jobs for locals.” Again, Nick Houghton, managing director of a Nottingham food manufacturing company, said: “There isn’t a pool of unemployed workers sitting there waiting for the EU workers to go back, ready and able to take up these jobs.” That the economy has performed somewhat better than expected since the referendum is irrelevant: Brexit hasn’t happened yet. And it is all very well saying there should be another vote when the terms of departure are known, but much of the damage, in the shape of cancelled investment and diversion of economic activity to continental Europe, will already have been done. I am told that when those two old Bullingdon Club playmates met on neutral ground after the referendum, the foreign secretary said to David Cameron: “I ****** up, didn’t I?” Given his popularity at the time, Boris Johnson might well have swung the result the other way. As it is, after spending years trying to join the EU in order to arrest our nation’s relative economic decline, unless our rulers experience a Damascene conversion, we are all set to throw away membership of one of the world’s major markets in order to resume our relative economic decline."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"artanddesign/2017/feb/24/secrets-oscars-engraver","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-24T15:59:36Z","webTitle":"‘You do gush sometimes’: secrets of an Oscar engraver","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/feb/24/secrets-oscars-engraver","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2017/feb/24/secrets-oscars-engraver","fields":{"headline":"‘You do gush sometimes’: secrets of an Oscar engraver","bodyText":"The Oscar bar, as I call it, has been going since 2010. As soon as the ceremony is over, the winners head upstairs from the theatre to the Governors Ball to have their statues engraved. There are a million press photographers taking pictures, and the A-listers’ people are trying to hurry things along, so there’s a lot of pressure. But the winners could not be more happy and relaxed. This is one of the best nights of their lives, the ultimate goal. We wouldn’t have time to engrave each Oscar on the spot, so we pre-engrave the name of every nominee on to plaques beforehand. Each statue is given a serial number and, during the awards, one of the team records the number of each winner as it comes in. We make a bit of a show of it. The statues are pre-drilled, ready for the plaques to be fitted, so all we have to do is show the winner the plaque, check the details are right, attach it, give it a polish and hand it back. The whole thing takes about five minutes, though we’re hoping this year will be a bit quicker (we used a different type of screw last year). We’re there for hours, until at least midnight. I grew up in Los Angeles in the industry (my father is a director) so I enjoy talking to actors. The first thing I do is congratulate them. But you do gush sometimes: a few years ago, I was a bit star-struck meeting Malik Bendjelloul, the director of Searching For Sugar Man, a documentary about the rumoured death of a musician from Detroit called Rodriguez. I was blown away by it. Alicia Vikander won best supporting actress last year for The Danish Girl. She was very sweet, and revelling in her moment. We were talking about Sweden; I have some Swedish friends here in LA. One of my most memorable encounters was with Colin Firth, who had won best actor for The King’s Speech. He took my arm in his and asked if he could take a picture of me with his phone while I attached his plaque. He was so gracious and polite. Anne Hathaway cracked me up. She put her hand on mine as I was attaching her plaque, then asked my name. She said, “I will never forget it.” I’m sure she has. My official job title is manager, exhibit design and production. I was in charge of installing the exhibitions we did at our headquarters in Wilshire Boulevard in Los Angeles. At the moment, I’m part of the team overseeing the development of the Academy’s new film museum, which is set to open in 2018. It will be housed in a former 1930s department store called May Company; the architect, Renzo Piano, has incredible plans. But, once a year, I get to have some fun. The press go a little crazy at the Governors Ball. Last year, a video of Leonardo DiCaprio getting his Oscar engraved went viral. I’m in thousands of photographs; I’ve been on the cover of the LA Times three times, in full colour. But I’m never named, just captioned as “engraver”. I’ve seen all this year’s best picture nominees and it’s impossible to predict who’s going to win. You’ll have to tune in. • Are you in a notable photograph?

Really sorry we can’t be at the party. I gave you my present last summer, you’ll remember. An X on a ballot paper. So did lots of my peers (25- to 49-year-old men are estimated to have voted 55:45 in favour of remain). Sadly, it wasn’t enough. Still, there’s a good reason that lots of people in my generation think the EU is all right. We’re about as old as British membership. Our upbringing was tinged with an opening up to all things European. Not just Abba and Jeux Sans Frontières and Johan Cruyff. But exchange programmes and pen pals, InterRail and espadrilles, pizza and Chianti. Europeans, it turned out, were normal, cool, interesting and interested. This was a huge comfort to those of us who paid attention in history. The first things British children of the 1970s and 80s learned about Europe was how beastly everyone had been to each other over the past 1,000 years. Waterloo, Trafalgar, the Somme and Agincourt. Crécy, Austerlitz, D-day. War without end, and how all those tiny little nations were forged by self-obsessed emperors and tsars and kings and despots who slaughtered anyone and everyone who didn’t think like them. Against that backdrop, it was a relief to learn, in double German one day, that finally we’d found another way to deal with each other. It was called the Europäische Ekonomische Gemeinschaft. And if that was a mouthful, then at least it was a mouthful from a country that made excellent cakes. The EEC, as it was then, was an instrument for win-win cooperation, for solidarity, for cross-border fertilisation of many kinds, for the fellowship of nations. OK, it wasn’t sexy, but then neither is dying in a ditch. The chances of people like me being called up to fight the Germans for the third generation in a row seemed remote as long as the EEC was there. It got better. Europe was open! You could just, like, go there. If the 80s marked the real beginning of Brits vacationing in Europe, the 90s was the decade that we moved there en masse. We explored the continent in ways that our parents never could. Campsites and cafes, Camels and new ways of doing coffee. Hitchhiking and railway stations and sleeper trains that started in one country and ended up in a totally different one the next morning. “Is it Austria?” my bleary-eyed, hungover fellow traveller asked one morning in 1989. “Germany,” I replied. “Germany till half past 11.” Freedom of movement in the 1990s had very different connotations to the dark undertones it has today. If you felt like it – and could afford it – you could just jump on a train and go live in Berlin, or Bordeaux or Barcelona. Eurostar, budget flights and cheap car rental. No visas, no hassle. Pick up a job on a building site, in a bank, in a bar. Oh the irony: to us Europe meant an absence of petty rules and regulations, not an accretion of them. We got to know Spanish and Dutch, Finns and Italians. The telling thing was we had so much more in common with these young foreigners than with so many of our compatriots. Who knew – Germans are just like us really. We people are all the same really, give or take. It really felt like nationality didn’t matter, it was just a lousy trick of the past, an instrument for bad rulers to deflect criticism and give people something to cheer, however empty. And while Britons relished Europe, Britain itself became more European: the food we ate, the footballers we watched, the clothes we wore, the cars we drove, the CEOs we employed, the friends we made, the people we married. Supermarkets brought in French cheeses, Italian hams, sparkling wines and Belgian beers. Licensing laws were relaxed. There were suddenly cafes, with bold outdoor seating. Culturally, we remained pretty Anglo-Saxon (notwithstanding the music of Kraftwerk, the novels of Houellebecq and the films of Kieślowski and Almodóvar). But socially we were more and more European. Where did it all go wrong? Looking back, it’s clear that this Europeanisation was perhaps only relevant to an outwardly focused, relatively privileged minority, to people interested in a world beyond the end of their street and able to afford to investigate it. The tide turned in the 2000s, though it’s still quite hard to pinpoint precisely why. Immigration? Economics? Euro-crises? Elitism? Complacency? Boredom? Or perhaps simply that those who talked down the EU were just better at doing so than those who talked it up. People say you can love Europe without loving the EU. That’s the wrong end of the telescope for my generation. It was the camaraderie and fraternity the EU fostered that helped us discover and fall in love with Europe. And that makes the divorce so much more bitter."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/2017/feb/09/ecuador-julian-assange-embassy-notice-eviction","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-09T06:30:15Z","webTitle":"Ecuador presidential hopeful promises to evict Julian Assange from embassy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/feb/09/ecuador-julian-assange-embassy-notice-eviction","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/feb/09/ecuador-julian-assange-embassy-notice-eviction","fields":{"headline":"Ecuador presidential hopeful promises to evict Julian Assange from embassy","bodyText":"Julian Assange will be given a month’s notice to leave the Ecuadorian embassy if the country’s main opposition candidate wins the presidency in next week’s election. In an interview with the Guardian, Guillermo Lasso, of the rightwing Creo-Suma alliance, said it was time for the WikiLeaks founder to move on because his asylum was expensive and no longer justified. “The Ecuadorian people have been paying a cost that we should not have to bear,” he said during an interview in Quito. “We will cordially ask Señor Assange to leave within 30 days of assuming a mandate.” That possibility is still some way off. In the most recent poll, Lasso is seven points behind the ruling party candidate Lenín Moreno, but the former banker has been gaining ground ahead of the first round of voting on 19 February and is widely tipped to force a runoff. Even if there is no change in power in Quito, however, it seems increasingly likely that Assange will soon be moving from the cramped embassy in Knightsbridge that has been his refuge for more than four and a half years. Although the current government has maintained its position of solidarity, all involved have grown increasingly frustrated with a situation that Ecuador’s top diplomat described as “something out of a John le Carré novel”. “Our staff have been through a lot. There is a human cost,” said the foreign minister, Guillaume Long. “This is probably the most watched embassy on the planet.” British police and intelligence have kept the embassy under close surveillance since Ecuador granted asylum in June 2012 to prevent Assange’s extradition to Sweden for questioning about a sexual assault accusation. The South American country accepts the WikiLeaks leader’s argument that the Swedish extradition request was a ruse aimed at eventually getting him into US jurisdiction, where he said he would face political persecution and mistreatment similar to that suffered by whistleblower Chelsea Manning. Since then, he has not left the building, which has given him less scope for movement than that of many convicted prisoners. “It’s a very precarious position,” Long said. “In terms of his physical comfort we have done all we can … But there is no access to an outside space. There is no patio or garden so he has mostly spent four and a half years on the first floor of a building in London, where there is not much light, especially in winter.” Assange occupies one of four office rooms in the embassy. Although he has described a family-like relationship with the staff and gets frequent visits from celebrity supporters, tensions occasionally emerge. During the US presidential election, the foreign ministry temporarily cut its guest’s internet access after WikiLeaks acted as a conduit for leaked emails from the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton’s campaign adviser. This suspension followed verbal warnings. “We wanted to be clear that our sovereign space was not being used for interference in the election of another country,” Long explained. The foreign minister expressed sympathy for Assange, but also frustration at the slow pace of judicial negotiations with Sweden and the punitive stance of the UK government, which has cut many bilateral ties and is suspected of a hand in the unusually frequent breakdowns of the embassy’s telephone and broadband systems. But after a long standstill, things have picked up pace. Last November, Assange was interviewed in the Ecuadorian embassy in the presence of a Swedish prosecutor. In January – after Barack Obama’s decision to release Manning – Assange restated his willingness to face justice in the US if his rights were respected. For the Ecuadorian foreign minister, the goodbye cannot come too soon. “We would like the next step to be tomorrow,” he said and called for the Swedish courts to accelerate matters. “We hope they are as swift as possible because this has been going on for far too long.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sustainable-business/2017/feb/09/trump-business-brand-super-bowl-nordstrom","type":"article","sectionId":"sustainable-business","sectionName":"Guardian Sustainable Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-09T14:51:28Z","webTitle":"Get off the sidelines: businesses can't play it safe politically in the age of Trump","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2017/feb/09/trump-business-brand-super-bowl-nordstrom","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sustainable-business/2017/feb/09/trump-business-brand-super-bowl-nordstrom","fields":{"headline":"Get off the sidelines: businesses can't play it safe politically in the age of Trump","bodyText":"On 12 January, a week before the inauguration, LL Bean found itself smack bang in the middle of one of now-President Trump’s notorious tweets: The brand quickly distanced itself from the tweet – and from board member and Trump donor Linda Bean, who donated money to help elect Trump. “LL Bean does not endorse political candidates, take positions on political matters, or make political contributions. Simply put, we stay out of politics,” said Shawn Gorman, LL Bean’s executive chairman, in a Facebook post. What a quaint notion that seems like today. Since our new POTUS took office nearly three weeks ago, hundreds of companies from tech to retail giants have been forced to deal with a torrent of emotional responses from their customers and employees, unleashed by Trump’s executive orders and tweets. Staying out of politics doesn’t seem to be possible anymore – and business leaders need to get smart about addressing it. We’ve seen 200,000 people #deleteUber in the hours following Trump’s executive order on travel from seven majority-Muslim countries. People rushed to take sides to #boycottStarbucks or #supportStarbucks in response to its pledge to employ 10,000 refugees in 75 countries. Tesla fans canceled their electric car orders because Elon Musk sits on Trump’s business advisory council. Harley Davidson canceled a presidential visit to its Milwaukee plant to avoid protests. And that was all before last Sunday’s Super Bowl, when viewers looked at the splashy ads through a political lens and reacted in ways that we hadn’t seen before. To those of us who’ve been working in corporate sustainability, the lineup of brands spending Super Bowl-sized dollars to show support for American values of diversity, inclusion and acceptance – Anheuser-Busch, Airbnb, Coca-Cola and Audi among them – felt like a watershed moment. But for all the support these ads drew, the backlash was equally fierce. While the Airbnb Super Bowl spot was a conscious political statement, Anheuser-Busch claimed its celebration of the company’s immigrant roots in the ad called “Born the Hard Way” wasn’t politically inclined. Other brands have been entangled with Trump’s politics in a more personal way. Nordstrom and Neiman Marcus dropped the fashion line bearing Ivanka Trump’s name. Nordstrom, which face boycotts from both sides, said its decision to stop carrying the merchandise was “not a political decision” but rather “based on performance”. President Trump took aim at the decision in a tweet yesterday complaining that his daughter has been “treated so unfairly by Nordstrom”. It used to be business gospel that you kept politics out of business. But in this hyper-polarized political climate, is it time to change that mantra? Should a brand stay out of politics? And whatever your intention, can you stay out? With so many consumers and employees demanding to know what their companies stand for, brands need to figure out how to respond. Fast. Get off the sidelines When anxiety is in the air, employees and consumers urgently want to know whether their companies are willing to take a stand for what they believe in. Don’t assume staying silent will insulate a business against controversy. In a leadership vacuum, people draw their own conclusions – as they did in the lag between Uber suspending the surge pricing during airport protests of the Muslim travel ban and the company’s response the following day explaining its decision. The new reality: saying nothing is riskier than saying something. Start from that assumption and go from there. Values ≠ politics A company’s values should be timeless and be able to steady the ship in precisely these kinds of choppy waters. Revisit, reassert and recommit to them now. Crucially, that may not mean a business must take sides. The best Super Bowl ads celebrated values that historically have been universal and uncontroversial. For example, Coca Cola’s ad included a multilingual version of “America The Beautiful” to show its inclusive, multicultural vision of the USA looked very similar to the “Welcome to America” reel I’ve watched countless times waiting in line at customs and immigration at JFK. Leading the action For years, companies have seen a disconnect between the values their customers said they held and their purchasing decisions. People who said they wanted businesses to sell more environmentally friendly products were often unwilling to pay more to get them. Suddenly we are seeing many examples of that alignment. Consumers are flocking to or fleeing from Starbucks, ditching Levis-Strauss (which made its stores gun-free) and donating at unprecedented levels to the American Civil Liberties Union (it received donations totaling six times its yearly average in the weekend after the travel ban). People are hungry for ways to get involved and will thank the brands they support for giving their intentions an outlet. Be ready While immigration and women’s rights received the spotlight in the early days of the administration, expect many more social and environmental issues such as climate change and LGBTQ rights to join the national debate. How will a company reassure its employees and customers that it will remain committed to their values and to their wellbeing? The time to plan for this is now. Publicly speaking out in this explosive political climate won’t come easy. It will feel counter-intuitive. Businesses may lose some consumers while galvanizing others to become lifelong supporters. But they must step up when their long term credibility is at stake."},"isHosted":false},{"id":"sport/2017/feb/09/nic-maddinson-takes-a-break-from-cricket-for-personal-reasons","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-08T21:49:32Z","webTitle":"Nic Maddinson takes a break from cricket for 'personal reasons'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/feb/09/nic-maddinson-takes-a-break-from-cricket-for-personal-reasons","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/feb/09/nic-maddinson-takes-a-break-from-cricket-for-personal-reasons","fields":{"headline":"Nic Maddinson takes a break from cricket for 'personal reasons'","bodyText":"Australian cricketer Nic Maddinson will miss a Sheffield Shield game as he takes a break from cricket for personal reasons. The three-Test batsman will not play in New South Wales’s clash with Queensland on Friday after also being a late withdrawal from the win over Victoria this month. “Cricket Australia and Cricket NSW advises that Australian and NSW batsman Nic Maddinson will not be available for selection due to personal reasons, until further notice,” the two bodies said in a joint statement. They have requested Maddinson’s privacy be respected. Maddinson, 25, was part of a young batting trio to make their Test debuts in the day-night third match against South Africa in Adelaide last November, batting at six. He was dismissed for a duck on debut, before registering scores of 1, 4 and 22 in innings against Pakistan. Unlike Peter Handscomb and Matt Renshaw, who have maintained their places in the Test squad, Maddinson was dropped after three Tests for all-rounder Hilton Cartwright. The left-hander was unable to recapture form in the BBL, failing to register a big score for the Sydney Sixers in seven matches. He made his Test debut after averaging 38 from 58 first-class games for NSW, with two tons and an 86 in the 2016-17 Sheffield Shield season. “Hopefully Maddo can get back to where he needs to be and that’s playing really good cricket and the Sydney Sixers, because I think he’s an unbelievable talent and he’s a nice kid as well,” Victorian paceman John Hastings told RSN radio on Thursday. Maddinson’s NSW teammate Ed Cowan said Maddinson was in “good spirits” but did not know how long he would be out of the game, and Cowan took the opportunity to suggest that Cricket Australia should place greater emphasis on player welfare. Cowan, who himself lost his Test spot due to form, said more could be done to support omitted players. “In terms of picking young guys, you need to make sure they’re ready,” Cowan told reporters on Thursday. “If they’re going to churn through players, Cricket Australia needs to be aware there’s going to be some burn.” “They’re going to have to work extra hard on the welfare side to look after the guys they’re going to spit out the other side. I don’t think the Australian Test team manages any kind of exit very well. I know from my own personal experience it feels as though you’re left at a train station and you look up and the train’s five stops (ahead) flying down the track.” Cowan said the NSW team was rallying around Maddinson. Former Test captain Kim Hughes said Maddinson wasn’t ready for Test cricket and had been “thrown to the wolves” by selectors. “Just to cast them (dropped players) out is absolutely diabolical.

He also questioned Maddinson’s Test selection. “Generally, even if you’ve been dropped, you’re still invigorated and you’re trying to get back in there,” Fleming told RSN radio. “If he’s in this frame of mind, he’s going into the game with no thoughts of enjoyment.

Claudio Ranieri and Steve McClaren made 18 changes between them, prioritising Premier League survival and a Championship play-off push respectively, meaning that those who had the misfortune of watching were rewarded with a second-rate contest. A penny for the thoughts of Greg Clarke, the FA chairman and a Leicester supporter, who looked on from the stands on a bitterly cold evening as two East Midlands rivals went through the motions in what was to all intents a reserve game. It was also tempting to wonder what was going through the mind of Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha, the Leicester owner, who had travelled the best part of 10,000 kilometres to watch the fourth-round replay. Ranieri, who was preoccupied with Sunday’s crunch game at Swansea City, eventually saw Leicester prevail in extra-time courtesy of a superb 25-yard shot from Wilfred Ndidi – the 20-year-old Nigerian had been on the pitch for only four minutes – and a fine individual goal from Demarai Gray, to set up a fifth-round tie at Millwall on Saturday week. In that sense there were some positives for Ranieri at the end of a long evening during which the fans chanted his name on several occasions, prompting the Italian to applaud them for their support. Srivaddhanaprabha had made the journey to show his public backing for the Italian on the back of the statement that the club issued the day before, saying that Ranieri had their “unwavering support”. Quite what this victory will do for Leicester’s hopes of avoiding relegation is unclear given that the team was unrecognisable from the one that lined up against Manchester United on Sunday – Ahmed Musa was the sole survivor – but any win has to be welcome in the context of the club’s recent struggles. “It was important for Leicester, not for me,” Ranieri said. “It’s a very important victory to go through in the Cup and also to get confidence.” The Leicester manager admitted he would happily swap victory over Derby for three points at the Liberty Stadium. That game coloured Ranieri’s approach to this replay and meant that Kasper Schmeichel, Danny Simpson, Wes Morgan, Robert Huth and Jamie Vardy did not even make the Leicester bench. Ranieri, however, felt the need to call on three of his big names to help to turn this tie into Leicester’s favour after Abdoul Camara’s deflected shot cancelled out Andy King’s header to haul Derby level. Riyad Mahrez, Islam Slimani and Ndidi were all brought on and McClaren acknowledged the balance of the match shifted as a result. Gray, though, was arguably Leicester’s standout performer and it was a lovely goal that put the game beyond Derby. With dexterous footwork he slalomed through the Derby defence, twisting and turning past Richard Keogh, before curling a right-footed shot into the far top corner. It was a fine goal to settle a strange match that took a long time to spring into life and featured some highly dubious officiating. Mike Jones, the referee, turned down three Leicester penalty appeals, including two in the first half, and Jonathan Mitchell, the Derby goalkeeper, can count himself fortunate that his clear handball outside the area near the end of normal time was not seen. Instead Musa, who had been attempting to take the ball past the Derby keeper, was booked for protesting. King had put Leicester ahead less than a minute into the second half, when he nodded home from inside the six-yard box after Marc Albrighton headed Gray’s deep centre back across goal. Derby, though, got back into the game 15 minutes later via Camara’s shot, which took a huge deflection off Ben Chilwell, and for a brief period the Championship side were on top. Leicester rallied, however, before the end of normal time. King, with a glancing header that drifted just wide, came close to a late winner and Max Lowe, the Derby left-back, chested the ball against his own upright. Extra-time was probably the last thing either manager wanted but Leicester quickly made their mark. Ndidi, who arrived from Genk for £15m last month, ran on to Mahrez’s pass and thumped a glorious left-footed shot in off a post. Slimani missed a golden chance to add a third but Gray was not so generous as he danced into the area before finishing emphatically. The question now is whether the first team can do something similar against Swansea. “For us it is one of the main matches of the season because we have to get a result,” Ranieri said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/feb/11/internet-scams-dating-romance-money","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-11T11:00:14Z","webTitle":"The internet scammer who loved me (not)","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/feb/11/internet-scams-dating-romance-money","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/feb/11/internet-scams-dating-romance-money","fields":{"headline":"The internet scammer who loved me (not)","bodyText":"On 2 February, at the cusp of Valentine’s Day, the Los Angeles sheriff’s department warned of the “growing criminal epidemic” of romance scams during a community meeting called Love Hurts. Romance scams are a type of online fraud, in which criminals pose as desirable partners on dating sites or email, win the hearts of their victims and end up fleecing them of their money. Lt Antonio Leon said the forum’s name was tongue-in-cheek, “but the truth of the matter is that love really does hurt, for some people”. According to the Internet Crime Complaint Center, last year romance scam victims lost $173m in California alone. Ouch. And that’s just the reported scams; victims are often too embarrassed to report they’ve been duped. So how is it possible people still fall for them? That’s the attitude I used to have – until I got involved with a scammer myself, and things got messy. I met “Cindy” via my spam folder, not long after I moved to New York City from Melbourne. “If you would be interested for a serious friendship hit me back with more details about yourself. I am 26 years old, I live alone in Senegal.” Yes, Cindy was obviously a scammer. And knowing this, I got back to her. Let me back up. I’d become fascinated with scams back when I lived in Australia. Back then I was researching them for a TV show. Scams were a hot-button topic, and I went to a victims’ support group to learn more. That’s where I met a widower named Bill. “I just wanted someone to hold me,” Bill said, explaining why he joined a dating site in the first place. He met someone, fell in love, and was eventually left bankrupt. Bill and I became friends. He was a smart, worldly man, and I was baffled as to how he could have fallen for a scam. Just before I left Australia, Bill and I celebrated his 80th birthday. We talked about his scam, and Bill said something that stuck with me. He said that in the back of his mind he knew he was being scammed, but he kept sending money because couldn’t bear for his relationship to end. This fascinated me – it seemed his loneliness overrode his common sense. Even as Bill and I spoke about the detrimental effects of scams, I was pretty sure he was still sending money overseas. I suspected that when I left his place, he’d jump online and give himself over to his scam once more. Not long after, I moved to New York with my boyfriend, Michael. Michael went to work in an office and made new friends, while I stayed home and researched scams. I was haunted by Bill’s story, and I wanted to write about lovelorn victims like him, but I also wanted to find out more about perpetrators – those who leech victims of their money. And that’s when Cindy’s email arrived. I got a notification that Cindy wanted to talk via Gchat, and voilà, I thought: I had my guinea pig scammer. In customized curly rainbow font, Cindy asked what the weather was like in Mumbai, which made me realize she had her wires crossed between me and someone else she was scamming. I decided there was no need to correct her, for now, so I Googled the weather in Mumbai. Cindy sent a photo: a pretty, ponytailed woman about my age, with a full build, leaning against a car. Scammers often steal photographs online, and though I knew that the “Cindy” I was chatting to was probably not the woman in the photo, it was easier to attach a face to the name. So whenever I communicated with Cindy, I pictured the woman leaning on the car. The soccer World Cup was starting, and in Australia I’d always watched with friends. Cindy said she wasn’t into soccer, but that she’d make an effort to watch because I liked it, and that’s the sort of thing people in relationships did for each other. According to her, we were dating. So while my boyfriend was at work, my Senegalese girlfriend and I watched soccer and chatted online. When my boyfriend wasn’t at work, I tactfully closed my laptop, because I preferred for him not to think I was chatting to a scammer all day. Cindy was either the most attentive person I have ever semi-dated (ready with a “hi babe!” the second I came online) or she was a team of people. I knew scammers often worked for syndicates, taking shifts, communicating with dozens of victims at once, referring to dossiers (“she is into World Cup soccer”, mine might say). Whether Cindy was a lone wolf or a group, I took comfort knowing I was chatting with someone real – which was better than talking to my dogs – so I’d rattle off my opinions on Brazil’s team into a chat box and wait for Cindy’s immediate ping of response. And then, one day, Cindy asked for my photo. This was a problem, as she still thought I was a middle-aged Indian man. I decided to come clean. “I am a woman. I hope you won’t be angry with me,” I said, assuming she would dump me and move on to a more trustworthy victim. But Cindy surprised me by saying she’d been brought up believing women should be with men, but that she had fallen in love with me, and was willing to take a chance on a same-sex relationship if I was. I found this simultaneously funny, confusing and endearing. She asked for a photo, and, slightly baffled by this turn of events, against all reason, I sent one. That night she sent an email: “The feelings I have for you is true and will last for Eternity as long as you accept me in your heart just as I have accepted you. “I love you. I Love Every little thing about you. “I love your Cute smile, your magical eyes, and the sound of your words.” And though I was fully aware that Cindy had cut and pasted this from somewhere, and I knew that a scammer’s job was to stroke victims’ egos, I couldn’t help but glance at the photo I sent Cindy to see if my eyes did indeed look magical. Cindy asked me to call. Suddenly my scammer had a voice, which didn’t sound like that of a criminal, but of a tired woman keeping her voice down. A baby started crying and Cindy was quick to say it was someone else’s kid. I wondered if she was lying. Does she have a partner, I thought, or is she a single parent? Then Cindy told me she was being evicted, and she needed $140. And there it was: I’d been expecting her to ask for money all along, except suddenly I wasn’t ready for it. Cindy was no longer a random email in my spam folder. She was a person on the other end of the line, asking for help. It was suddenly hard to just say “no”. Instead, I beat around the bush like a coward. I pretended I had a friend whom I’d told about Cindy, and the friend suggested Cindy might be a scammer. Cindy acted outraged at the suggestion, and our conversation petered out, with me saying I couldn’t spare the money. I Googled Senegal and discovered that almost 50% of its population lived in poverty. Who’s to say Cindy wasn’t being evicted? I thought. Right on cue, an email came from Cindy. “My life is not easy,” she said. “I am trying to survive as a responsible girl. I do not go out to sell my body like some other girls do here.” I knew scammers rarely got arrested; it was a relatively safe crime. If one of the other options was sex work, I could see that chatting to amorous westerners on the internet would be more appealing. Could I blame her for what she was doing? I felt like a jerk for stringing her along. I decided to write an email, from the real me, to the real Cindy. I intended to tell her a bit about me, but I found myself telling her a lot. I told her my family came to Australia when the war in Yugoslavia began, and that my dad died when I was a child. I wrote that when we moved to Australia, my parents never thought we’d be split up again, yet I’d voluntarily moved to New York City, and I felt guilty. I said I felt lonely and friendless. I wasn’t sure why I told Cindy all this, but in hindsight I think it was because I wanted her to like me. And as I wrote, I found myself tearing up. I told her I didn’t blame her for being a scammer, and that I wanted her to be honest with me. I said that if she told me about her real life, about scamming, I would find some money to send her. She wrote back ignoring most of what I said, emphasizing that she was not a scammer – and including her Western Union details. I felt a pang of annoyance and embarrassment for opening up to her. Did she think I was an idiot? Cindy and I went back and forth playing this game: me offering money for the truth, and Cindy feigning ignorance. We were at an impasse. Finally, Cindy snapped. She called me a wicked, selfish woman. She said she never wanted to hear from me again. And for the first time in a long time, my computer went silent. After Cindy dumped me, I felt like I understood Bill better. He knew in the back of his mind he was being scammed, but he chose to keep going so he wouldn’t end up where I was. Bill had made excuses for his scammer, just like I’d made excuses for Cindy. It reminded me one of those bad relationships where you’re willing to overlook so much because you don’t want to be alone. Romance scams, I decided, weren’t about being tricked by someone, they were about tricking yourself – telling yourself lies, to keep loneliness at bay."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"world/2017/feb/09/young-indian-cricketers-mohit-ahlawat-astonishing-innings-makes-him-global-sensation","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-09T08:31:28Z","webTitle":"Young Indian cricketer's astonishing innings makes him global sensation","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/feb/09/young-indian-cricketers-mohit-ahlawat-astonishing-innings-makes-him-global-sensation","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/feb/09/young-indian-cricketers-mohit-ahlawat-astonishing-innings-makes-him-global-sensation","fields":{"headline":"Young Indian cricketer's astonishing innings makes him global sensation","bodyText":"His world-first 300 run knock in a Twenty20 match at a suburban Delhi cricket ground has become a global sensation, but Mohit Ahlawat is still a little bemused by the attention. It isn’t the first record-breaking score the 21-year-old has posted in the game’s shortest form. “In the last tournament I played in the Delhi district league I scored 224 not out,” he says. In another recent tournament, in Ghaziabad, he posted a casual 139. The first of those easily eclipses the current professional record of 175 not out, scored by the West Indies’ Chris Gayle in an Indian Premier League match in Bangalore in 2013. Hitting mammoth scores – on Tuesday, 300 runs off just 72 balls, including an astonishing 39 sixes – has become routine for the student from Panipat, a rural district of Haryana state about 85km (53 miles) north of Delhi. “I didn’t think I’d get so much media coverage,” he says. “It feels great, all the news channels have come to the ground to interview me.” The softly spoken batsman and wicketkeeper says his secret is quickly finding his flow. “I wasn’t nervous,” he says, entering the final over on 266 runs, seeing a triple century in sight. “I was just cool,” he says with a laugh. “I thought I could do it. I told myself:just try to hit it on time. I try to enjoy my batting, try not to think too much.” The scorecard tells the tale of that final over: 4, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6. The ground in East Delhi is particularly small, but this time his total was enough to put Ahlawat on the radar of the Delhi Daredevils, the Indian Premier League side that called him up for a trial on Wednesday after news of the knock spread. Should he be selected in forthcoming player auctions, Ahlawat will be playing on pitches and in front of crowds a universe away from the patches of grass in Panipat where, growing up, he and his friends would play cricket each Sunday. “It wasn’t a cricket ground,” he says. “But every Sunday the kids used to call me to play, and my father bought me a cricket kit, so I started playing with that.” People in the town noticed his talent. “Everyone used to say I was quite a good player, that I played a bit differently,” he says, but his big-swinging style also needed tempering before he could face better quality bowlers. “When I was a kid, I didn’t really know how to hit the ball in the right way. I’d get out a lot,” he says. Like so many young Indians in the rapidly urbanising country, at 17, Ahlawat moved to the city chasing bigger opportunities. “My father told me it was better I go and join a club in Delhi, that I won’t be able get anywhere in cricket from Panipat,” he says. Alongside his studies at Delhi University, he joined one of the city’s most esteemed cricket clubs, the LB Shastri Cricket Academy. There he was coached by Sanjay Bhardwaj, who also oversaw the international career of former Indian opener Gautam Gambhir. Bhardwaj told Indian media he was delighted by Ahlawat’s achievement. “He hasn’t had anything easy in life. He is a farmer’s son and has had to struggle to follow his dream of playing cricket,” he said. “I am very happy that the Daredevils took note of his knock and called him for trial.” Ahlawat is facing his sudden surge of fame the same way he does bowlers: coolly, focusing on one ball at a time. “I haven’t really thought about the future,” he says. “Last year I was dropped from the Delhi team for the Ranjit Trophy after only three matches. I was lacking confidence. Maybe now they’ll take me back?”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2017/feb/10/coalition-urged-to-charge-10-royalty-on-offshore-oil-and-gas-projects","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-10T04:48:09Z","webTitle":"Coalition urged to charge 10% royalty on offshore oil and gas projects","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/feb/10/coalition-urged-to-charge-10-royalty-on-offshore-oil-and-gas-projects","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2017/feb/10/coalition-urged-to-charge-10-royalty-on-offshore-oil-and-gas-projects","fields":{"headline":"Coalition urged to charge 10% royalty on offshore oil and gas projects","bodyText":"The Turnbull government must introduce a 10% royalty on all offshore oil and gas projects in Australia to ensure taxpayers start getting a fair return on their natural resources, the Tax Justice Network says. The group has called for the petroleum resource rent tax (PRRT) to be overhauled, saying there were too many opportunities under its regime for offshore oil and gas companies to exploit transfer pricing, with direct impacts on PRRT credits and profits. In a submission to the PRRT review, the Tax Justice Network said a 10% royalty ought to be applied to offshore oil and gas projects in commonwealth waters that were only subject to the PRRT. It said a 10% royalty needed to be charged because the PRRT – which was designed in the 1980s for crude oil projects, but which had failed to keep up with developments in the industry – was failing to collect adequate revenue. The treasurer, Scott Morrison, admitted last year that revenues from the PRRT had halved since 2012-13, and crude oil excise collections had fallen by more than half. He announced a formal review of the PRRT regime in November after a rapid decline in revenues from the tax. Jason Ward, from the network, said a 10% royalty would raise between $4bn and $6bn over the next four years. He said the royalty system should be similar to existing state and Commonwealth royalties that already apply to all other oil and gas projects in Australia. It should be deductible from PRRT, and the PRRT should remain as a backstop to collect additional revenue if and when prices increased substantially and when existing PRRT credits were exhausted. “With Australia poised to be the world’s largest exporter of LNG but projected to generate little direct government revenue for decades, there is a major problem that needs to be addressed,” he said. “At the moment projects in commonwealth waters are getting millions of tonnes of LNG effectively for free. “No other industry, including coal, iron ore and onshore gas, get given the total cost of their investment (plus uplift) in free resources before they begin paying for that resource. “This policy will level the playing field across the oil and gas industry. At the moment projects in commonwealth waters are getting a competitive advantage over onshore projects and the north-west shelf who pay much higher royalties. “All of the major companies, Shell, Chevron, BHP, Woodside and BP, already pay under our proposed model through their ownership of the north-west shelf project. They have been happy to pay under this model for years without complaint. The north-west shelf shows they still make huge profits under this type of royalty regime.” Ward said mature oil projects, such as BHP in the Bass Strait who already pay PRRT, would not be affected given the royalty would be fully deductible from the PRRT. “This proposal we believe ensures a fair return to the Australian people while still encouraging investment by maintaining our royalty regime as one of the most generous in the world,” he said. “We call on the industry to support this proposal to the commonwealth government.” The problems raised by the Tax Justice Network are similar to those raised by tax expert Dr Diane Kraal, from Monash University. Her submission warned flaws in the PRRT regime meant Chevron’s giant Gorgon gas project off WA would not pay the tax until “at least 2030”, despite decades of operation. Kraal said her modelling showed $5bn in revenue would be raised from Gorgon alone by 2030 if royalties were reintroduced. She said her research indicated other natural gas projects in commonwealth waters should also be subject to commonwealth royalties, including Chevron’s Wheatstone, Woodside’s Pluto LNG project, and Inpex’s Ichthys project. Woodside Petroleum used its submission to argue against any changes to the PRRT. It said the PRRT had been operating as intended, despite declining revenues from the tax recently. It said the regime had delivered $200bn worth of projects over the past decade, and Woodside had paid $2bn in PRRT since 2001. “As a profits-based tax, it is not unusual to have declining PRRT at a time of declining oil and gas prices and prior to these projects recouping their costs,” its submission said. “Woodside pays billions of dollars of taxes in Australia. The PRRT is just one part of our tax contribution but increasing it could put other tax revenues at risk by making future projects unviable. “Woodside has an ownership stake in three of Australia’s major undeveloped gas resources. As the leading Australian gas producer, we want to develop these resources and deliver significant benefits to the Australian people. “We urge the PRRT review team to consider carefully the substantial impact of any changes to the current fiscal settings that could jeopardise existing and future investments.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2017/feb/09/real-fight-starts-now-jeremy-corbyn-brexit-tweet","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-09T04:24:49Z","webTitle":"'Real fight starts now': Jeremy Corbyn's Brexit tweet prompts bruising response","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/feb/09/real-fight-starts-now-jeremy-corbyn-brexit-tweet","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/feb/09/real-fight-starts-now-jeremy-corbyn-brexit-tweet","fields":{"headline":"'Real fight starts now': Jeremy Corbyn's Brexit tweet prompts bruising response","bodyText":"The government bill to trigger article 50 sailed through the Commons on Wednesday night with a majority of 372.

The sweeping, unchallengeable powers have been condemned by migration experts, who unanimously told a Senate committee the powers were unjustified, too broad and could be used to target specific nationalities or groups lawfully living in Australia. Passed through the House of Representatives on Thursday, the Migration Amendment (visa revalidation and other measures) bill is expected to face significant opposition in the Senate, where the vote is likely to be close. The bill was introduced last year to create a revalidation measure for the pilot program of 10-year visas for Chinese visitors to Australia. But the bill’s drafting has given the immigration minister far broader powers to impose a “revalidation” check on any visa at all. The bill would give the minister, currently Peter Dutton, power to impose a revalidation check on visas for any “specified class of persons”, to be determined solely by the minister “in the public interest”. The minister could refuse to revalidate a visa if the minister held “adverse information” relating to the person, or a connected group of people. What constitutes “adverse information” is not defined in the bill. The minister can consider public health and safety, national security, Australia’s economic wellbeing or the circumstances in a person’s home country when making a revalidation decision. The bill gives examples of a person being required to revalidate their visa because they: Hold a particular passport Live in a particular country Live in a particular state or province within a country May have travelled through a particular area at a particular time However, there are no parameters guiding the minister’s determination of a specific class of person, and concerns have been raised that it could be broadly imposed on people of certain ethnicities, or religious or political affiliations. When the bill went before a Senate committee last year, every submission – except for the department’s own – said the powers were unjustified and liable to exploitation. The Migration Institute of Australia said the bill had the potential to give the minister “unfettered power” over who held a visa in Australia. “At worst, the minister’s powers could be used to significantly skew this interpretation of the ‘public interest’... this could be extrapolated to discriminate against large numbers of long-term visa holders lawfully living in Australia.” The Law Council of Australia said the bill was “neither necessary nor proportionate to its intended objective” and that it gave the minister a broad range of powers “with limited or no explanation as to their intended purpose” and without parliamentary oversight. The Andrew and Renata Kaldor Centre for International Refugee Law at the University of New South Wales said refugees could be adversely affected by the proposed bill, and that it gave “excessive powers” to the minister without any definition of what the “public interest” should be. The Department of Immigration and Border Protection defended the proposed powers, saying the revalidation powers were drafted broadly in order to allow the minister to act in the national interest. Parliament would have oversight of the revalidation orders, the department said. The Senate committee ultimately recommended the bill be passed. Dutton told ABC’s AM radio program that Labor had no objection to the bill, including at the Senate committee, until the last 24 hours and labelled the opposition’s tactics a “mendacious” distraction. “What we’ve said is during that period [of holding a visa] if somebody, for example, commits a criminal offence or they are put on a terrorist watchlist then we reserve the right to go back and have look at their details and stop them from coming to our country.” Dutton said it was “rubbish” that there was no parliamentary oversight because the Senate could disallow the regulation. Greens senator Nick McKim, who issued the only dissenting statement from the Senate committee report last year, told the Guardian the proposed ministerial powers were “an attack on multicultural Australia”. “We would urge the parliament not to give Peter Dutton the ‘extreme vetting’ powers that he wants, that would give him the ability to target nationalities, ethnic or cultural groups.” Labor has similarly vowed to oppose the bill. The party’s immigration spokesman, Shayne Neumann, told parliament: “Labor cannot give Trump-like powers to a man that has such a high desire to see a divided Australia. “Labor won’t support a bill that could see whole groups of people targeting based on their place of birth, passport or religion. This minister cannot be trusted with wide-ranging, unfettered powers over the visas of whole groups of people.” The bill passed the House of Representatives Thursday, but will face more opposition in the Senate, where the vote is expected to be extremely close. If Labor and the Greens vote against the bill, the Coalition will require nine of 10 crossbenchers to vote in favour."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2017/feb/10/john-wick-chapter-2-gun-violence-keanu-reeves","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-10T12:45:01Z","webTitle":"John Wick: Chapter 2 is a shameful example of Hollywood gun pornography","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/feb/10/john-wick-chapter-2-gun-violence-keanu-reeves","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2017/feb/10/john-wick-chapter-2-gun-violence-keanu-reeves","fields":{"headline":"John Wick: Chapter 2 is a shameful example of Hollywood gun pornography","bodyText":"“What’cha think?” a colleague asked as we spilled onto the sidewalk outside a Manhattan screening room. “I think I need two aspirin,” I said, clutching my throbbing head. The critical reaction to John Wick: Chapter 2 has been quite positive. And I can understand why. Audiences get to pick and choose, but we critics, the brave soldiers of cinema’s trenches hurling ourselves atop grenades to save you from a bad movie, suffer through more junk than you can possibly imagine, especially in the early months of the year. Director Chad Stahelski, cinematographer Dan Lausten, production designer Kevin Kavanaugh, stunt coordinator JJ Perry and their teams, it must be made abundantly clear, are wizards working at the top of their craft, and the leap in quality from typical action dreck to this is undeniable. But eventually we’ll need to ask: where does this end? Just because we can rattle our brains with bone-snapping, aorta-snipping, cranium-splashing violence, does that mean we have to? At what point does this hyperactive, blood-soaked, corpse-strewn video game aesthetic, however laudatory its choreography, cease being harmless entertainment and become psychologically invasive? And that’s why I’ve called you all to the PTA tonight. OK, so I know like I sound like someone terrified of witchcraft lurking in heavy metal lyrics, but common sense (and my own viewing habits) have me convinced that desensitization to violence is a real thing. Years ago, watching a beat-down or shoot-out would send me into a white-knuckle sweat. Now I don’t stop munching my popcorn. To put it bluntly, it took film-making this good to realize just how sick we’ve all become. John Wick: Chapter 2, a string of elaborate bullet ballets with only trace elements of a plot, is hardcore gun pornography, pure and simple. And when the imagery faded (along with the hoots ‘n’ hollers of the audience) I felt sunk in a crater of guilt, choking on a miasma of shame. This specific film may seem like an unfair place to shout “enough!” but its clear indication of intelligence is, in a weird way, doubly irksome. This is a movie that wants to have its shotgun blast to the head and eat it, too. In addition to a Seijun Suzuki hat-tip, John Wick: Chapter 2 is loaded with vague hints of some kind of meaning in its lean script. In the first John Wick (which, yes, I awarded four stars back in 2014, back before I became so easily shellshocked, I guess) the big surprise was learning, as the picture progressed, that a larger, surreal underground of killers lived among us. The sequel leans into this to the point of absurdity; by the end it implies that nearly everyone in New York City is somehow tied into the criminal netherworld and its labyrinthine codes of conduct. The world of John Wick includes a chain of fancy hotels serving as “neutral ground” for killers who are currently “working”, eg figuring out how to murder someone and, probably, their dozens of bodyguards and henchmen. Peter Serafinowicz plays the Roman “sommelier” who actual deals in carbines, not cabernets. A lustily shot sequence teases out one weapon after another and, to one who has never held a firearm and has no intention of doing so, each make and model just sounds like chrome noise. Until our hero was handed an enormous rifle in the AR family. Ah, that’s one I’ve heard of. I recognize it as the gun of choice in Newtown and Aurora and San Bernardino. (The Pulse dance club in Orlando fell to an MCX, the Pepsi to the AR-15’s Coke.) So, it’s supposed to be funny when Keanu Reeves’ John Wick and his nemesis (played by Common) have to temporarily call a truce when their brutal brawl crashes into the lobby of the Continental, but I dunno, that little dose of intentional comedy wasn’t enough to wash the bloody taste out of my mouth. The “we’re just joshing around” angle, in addition to making very little sense, just feels like a paint job, as does the lame final act twist of having a showdown at an art museum. Oh, it absolutely looks breathtaking (and shatters The Lady From Shanghai’s broken glass count), but the mere presence of a recorded voice saying things about “deeper reflections into the nature of self” doesn’t actually impart any intellectual heft. In fact, some might say it makes you realize the waste of effort in this whole enterprise. Stylized violence in movies isn’t going away any time soon. Nor is it always uncalled for. The last movie I remember with so many gunshots to the head was Oliver Hirschbiegel’s Downfall. But violent movies come into my life so regularly; I must have seen so many others brimming with vicious head kills since then. Yet Downfall is the one that keeps coming up because it was a rich story with urgent themes, historical resonance and dramatic tension. These high body-count brutality fests, even the cleverly made ones (like Hardcore Henry or The Raid 2) are ephemeral, and their mindlessness doesn’t stick, no matter how many minds are shown sticking to the wall. I don’t think it’s overly prudish to wonder just where the line of decency is as audience bloodlust continues to get chummed. Eventually, the moviegoer staggering out of a violent screening looking for headache tablets will be you."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"music/2017/feb/10/grammy-predictions-rock-pop-adele-beyonce-drake","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-10T15:49:05Z","webTitle":"Grammy predictions: who will win in the rock and pop categories?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/feb/10/grammy-predictions-rock-pop-adele-beyonce-drake","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2017/feb/10/grammy-predictions-rock-pop-adele-beyonce-drake","fields":{"headline":"Grammy predictions: who will win in the rock and pop categories?","bodyText":"Album of the year The four top-selling albums of 2016 – Adele’s 25, Drake’s Views, Justin Bieber’s Purpose and Beyoncé’s Lemonade – all got nods in this “big four” category, the sort of confluence between popularity and Grammy popularity that happens far less often than one might think. The fifth nominee, maverick country singer Sturgill Simpson, did not make the year-end albums chart, although the epistolary A Sailor’s Guide to Earth received copious praise from critics. Figure that Bieber and Drake, both of whom are skipping Sunday’s ceremony, are out of the running for various reasons, including their albums not being up to the artistic par set by Adele’s third album, let alone the offerings from Beyoncé and Simpson. The question then becomes one of what memories the Grammy hive mind is in the mood to reward. If it’s cash-register popularity that brings to mind the Diamond Award-garnering days of the early 21st century, Adele is your pick; she’s still selling boatloads of albums, with 25 even cracking the 10m mark. If callbacks to the singer-songwriter era of the 70s, Simpson is your man; A Sailor’s Guide has its eye on classic country ideals, but it isn’t so rooted in the past that it doesn’t include a (very good!) cover of Nirvana’s sardonic In Bloom. And if unfettered artistic ambition is the name of the game, the answer is Beyoncé, whose Lemonade – in both audio and visual form – was not only expertly executed, exhibiting an unbelievable breadth of artistic knowledge that culminated in self-discovery, it also had more than a few cracking tunes. Will win: 25 Should win: Lemonade Record of the year Adele’s Hello was a monster of a single, able to heal politically induced Thanksgiving-dinner wounds and induce tears almost on demand. That it was the reigning song of the end of 2015 – a vastly different time for the world – is one of the reasons that the Grammys always seem kind of trapped in amber, just behind trends enough to merit a pat on the head or two. Similarly, Beyoncé’s Formation, which turned the world on its ear when it was released, feels very pre-summer of 2016; if anything, the fiery Freedom feels more appropriate to the current moment, especially when you think about the way Beyoncé and Kendrick Lamar staged it at the BET Awards last summer. 7 Years and Stressed Out were two songs that helped make 2016’s pop radio landscape absolutely dreary. Lukas Graham, the Danish band behind 7 Years, has put forth a lament by a not-yet-30-year-old who is anxious about his accomplishments. Similarly, Twenty One Pilots’ Stressed Out is a plea to time-travel back to childhood, “when our momma sang us to sleep but now we’re …” That these two songs struck a chord this year speaks to an underlying anxiety that should unnerve any sociologically minded observers. Finally, there’s Rihanna’s Work, the lead single from her shoulda-been-nominated-instead-of-Drake Anti. Record of the Year is a production-focused award, and if nothing else, Work sounded different than anything else on the radio, its sparse production allowing Rihanna’s ultimatums to fully shine and its sparks of sexual frustration to coalesce around the cameo verse by Drake. Will win: Hello Should win: Work Song of the year Three of the five record of the year nominees – Hello, Formation and 7 Years – are up for this songwriting-focused award. The other two entrants: Justin Bieber’s sneering Love Yourself, a kiss-off built around a playground-taunt chorus (“My mama don’t liiiike you, and she likes everyone”) and Bieber’s Purpose-era maturity; and I Took A Pill In Ibiza, Michigan singer-songwriter Mike Posner’s tale of post-pop-fame woe that became an unexpected hit after being remixed into a radio-ready bounce by the Norwegian duo Seeb. The affable Posner is, at least, aware of his comeback’s irony, which gives him points over Lukas Graham, whose faux-deep tale of being on the verge of 30 sags under its own seriousness. Will win: 7 Years Should win: I Took A Pill In Ibiza Best rock performance Offering perhaps the most odd assortment of nominees this year, the best rock performance category contains two entrants that essentially snuck in via technicality – an Austin City Limits recording of the Grammy-beloved Alabama Shakes’ Joe, which was a bonus track on 2016 Album of the Year nominee Sound and Color; and Disturbed’s Conan performance of Simon &amp; Garfunkel’s The Sound of Silence, which appeared on the band’s 2015 album Immortalized. The other contenders include two nominees for best rock song, which goes to the songwriters: the towering title track of the often-Grammy-snubbed Bowie’s posthumous Blackstar; and Twenty One Pilots’ sullen Linkin Park update Heathens. The dual nominations might indicate more widespread support for those tracks’ artistic merits, but don’t count out Beyoncé – the stinging Don’t Hurt Yourself both showcases her ability to front a pyrotechnic rock act and features an assist from the perennial Grammy favorite Jack White. Will win: Don’t Hurt Yourself Should win: Blackstar Best rock album A true toss-up category: dick-joke pop-punk (Blink-182’s California), chugging yet curious alt-rock (Cage the Elephant’s Tell Me I’m Pretty), razor-sharp French metal (Gojira’s Magma), overly ambitious pop-rock that succeeds even when it misses the mark (Panic! At The Disco’s Death of a Bachelor) and self-referential powerpop (Weezer’s Weezer, AKA The White Album) go head to head. The sheer audacity of Death of a Bachelor, which features a super-obvious Rock Lobster sample and ends with frontman Brendon Urie showcasing his piano-bar crooner bona fides, makes it easy to root for. But really, this category is anyone’s to win, if only because most of the truly notable rock records of the last year didn’t make the cut. Will win: Tell Me I’m Pretty Should win: Death of a Bachelor"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"football/blog/2017/feb/09/nicolas-anelka-roda-france-di-canio-anis-ben-hatira-zozulya","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-09T11:21:00Z","webTitle":"Nicolas Anelka, Roman Zozulya and clashes of football and politics in Europe | Louise Taylor","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2017/feb/09/nicolas-anelka-roda-france-di-canio-anis-ben-hatira-zozulya","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/blog/2017/feb/09/nicolas-anelka-roda-france-di-canio-anis-ben-hatira-zozulya","fields":{"headline":"Nicolas Anelka, Roman Zozulya and clashes of football and politics in Europe","bodyText":"The ears of the club official sharpened when, unusually, the talk near the back of the plane turned to politics. A Premier League team were flying to the south coast and a senior midfielder had begun discussing Britain’s vexed relationship with Europe when a young player behind him inquired: “What’s the EU?” Cue considerable hilarity, along with a vague sense of relief on the official’s part that football remained a largely current affairs-free zone, somehow sealed off from the wider geo-political issues of the day. Comforting as that impression may be, it is increasingly false. Already the English game has wrestled with the rights and wrongs of Paolo Di Canio’s appointment as Sunderland’s manager, Nicolas Anelka’s dismissal by West Bromwich Albion and Papiss Cissé’s initial refusal to wear Wonga-branded Newcastle United kit on the grounds he considered the pay-day loan company’s activities as anti-Islamic. Further controversies are gaining traction across Europe with Anelka’s arrival as a consultant at Roda of the Eredivisie meeting with a furious reaction from Jewish leaders in the southern Netherlands. The former France striker parted company with West Bromwich Albion after making a quenelle gesture during a Premier League game in 2013. Widely regarded as an anti-semitic act bearing more than a passing relationship to a Nazi salute, it brought Anelka a five-game ban and £80,000 fine imposed by the Football Association, although the governing body ruled he had not been promoting anti-semitism. Anelka promptly took to social media to announce he was terminating his contract in order to preserve his “integrity” and the club sacked him for “gross misconduct”. Opinion is now divided in Kerkrade, the small mining town which is home to Roda, with Ron van der Wieken, a local Jewish leader arguing the former Mumbai coach’s appointment was “disgraceful” and “shocking”. Meanwhile Anelka, now 37, retorted that it was all “a misunderstanding” and he has “nothing against the Jews”. Across the border in Germany Islamic fundamentalism entered the football arena after Darmstadt of the Bundesliga parted company with their Tunisia midfielder Anis Ben-Hatira by “mutual consent” over his work with Ansaar International. A contentious Islamic aid organisation of particular interest to the security services, it reportedly has links to Germany’s ultra-orthodox Muslim Salafist community, claims which Ansaar International denies. The Berlin-born 28-year-old claims he is the victim of a “slander campaign” and Ben-Hatira remains adamant he had merely been involved in facilitating “humanitarian” work in Syria, Somalia, the Palestinian territories and Afghanistan. “Darmstadt SV 98 views the private humanitarian aid Ben-Hatira offers, through the organisation he works with, as wrong,” said Darmstadt’s president, Ruediger Fritsch. “After analysing the whole situation, it no longer makes sense for both parties to keep working together. Darmstadt 98 wishes Anis Ben-Hatira, who has always behaved impeccably and exemplarily at our club, all the best for his sporting future.” Some German commentators feel the club bowed to pressure from fans who before a recent home draw with Borussia Mönchengladbach distributed flyers and unfurled a banner demanding the player sever his links with Ansaar. Ben-Hatira railed against his treatment. “Anyone who looks at my CV will quickly see that I am the sort who is socially involved and who fights for equal treatment between people of different skin colour, ethnicity or faith,” he wrote on Facebook. “I’m known as someone who will not be bullied or manipulated. I’m going to try to continue to help people … the real scandal is that there is now an attempt to sabotage my sports career in Germany.” In Spain Roman Zozulya shares similar sentiments after being sent back to Real Betis only hours into a loan stint with Rayo Vallecano after some of their supporters dubbed the Ukraine striker a “neo-Nazi”. A Madrid second-tier team, Rayo Vallecano have a radical left-wing fan base and indignant supporters turned up at Zozulya’s first, and only, training session, hurling abuse his way before chanting their city was “no place for Nazis”. Despite Zozulya publishing an open letter denying he harboured far-right views, the club took fright and returned him to Betis. It means a forward who arrived in Seville and joined Betis from Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk late last summer, cannot play again this season as league rules prohibit players from being registered for more than two sides in a single campaign. “Unfortunately my arrival in Spain was accompanied by a misunderstanding by a journalist who knows very little about the reality of my country,” says Zozulya, who has posed on Twitter holding a rifle and donated money, some of it the proceeds of auctioning his 2014 Europa League winners’ medal, to help support the Ukraine army in its struggle against Russia. “I arrived at Seville airport wearing a T-shirt with the badge of Ukraine. This journalist reported that I was wearing a shirt from a paramilitary group. The newspaper recognised their error and apologised. I’m not linked to any paramilitary or neo-Nazi group.” Apparently unnerved, Miguel Torrecilla, Vallecano’s sporting director, said: “We’ve decided it’s in the best interests of the player to return to Seville. The player’s very upset, he’s scared and in no condition to do a job here.” Back at Betis Zozulya’s team-mates have offered their unstinting support, Ukraine’s ambassador is demanding the Spanish government intervenes and lawyers suggest La Liga may yet punish Rayo Vallecano. If that case prompts all sorts of concerns about possible “fake news”, the perils of players’ social-media portals opening unwanted windows on their worlds and the sometimes blurred margins between extremism and freedom of opinion, there was no doubt Di Canio not only had a Dux – which translates as “leader” – tattoo but had previously said he was “fascist but not racist”. Perhaps tellingly, no one had appeared concerned by this when the former West Ham forward managed Swindon. Indeed it was not until David Miliband resigned from Sunderland’s board in protest at his appointment in 2013, and the Bishop of Durham expressed outrage, that the club’s directors realised the gravity of a situation complicated by the enduring belief of many Italians that 1920s fascism – “before Mussolini had his head turned by Hitler” – was very different from Nazism. Eventually Di Canio denounced fascism – sort of. “I’m not political, I don’t affiliate myself to any organisation,” he said. “I’m not a racist and don’t support the ideology of fascism.” With Sunderland’s former manager carefully camouflaging his tattoo by wearing long-sleeved tops in public, the furore swiftly blew over. Zozulya, Anelka and Ben-Hatira are discovering there is no disguising perceived political or religious sympathies highlighted by indelible digital footprints."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"australia-news/live/2017/feb/09/bill-shorten-malcolm-turnbull-union-liberal-labor-politics-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-09T06:49:37Z","webTitle":"Barnaby Joyce juggles coal as Labor and Coalition clash over blackouts  – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2017/feb/09/bill-shorten-malcolm-turnbull-union-liberal-labor-politics-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/live/2017/feb/09/bill-shorten-malcolm-turnbull-union-liberal-labor-politics-live","fields":{"headline":"Barnaby Joyce juggles coal as Labor and Coalition clash over blackouts  – as it happened","bodyText":"The lower house has now adjourned people, so it is time to say goodnight and good luck. Today, as poor old South Australia sweltered and faced more blackouts, the major parties tried to apportion blame, which didn’t really help any of the people sweating it out in that state and/or trying to run a business. LNP senator Ian Macdonald defended the Gold Pass free travel card for ex-politicians, saying pollies did not get paid much ($200,000 base for a senator) and they could be earning a lot more outside. He said it was the retrospectivity that was the problem – in that it applied to people who had already retired and they had expected it to go on for life. It was just not fair. He said old pollies should get a chance to have a say, even though a few of them did take an earlier change to the high court and the high court chucked it out. June Oscar, a Bunuba woman from Western Australia who has fought successfully for alcohol restrictions in remote communities, and for the preservation of ancient languages, is the new Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander social justice commissioner. The petroleum resource rent tax has failed to collect billions of dollars in revenue and the Turnbull government should reintroduce royalties for natural gas projects off north-west Australia, a resource tax expert has said. Malcolm Turnbull continued his attack on Bill Shorten, saying the opposition leader did not have a fair dinkum bone in his body. Shorten said Turnbull - poor thing - was under pressure and he felt a bit sorry for him. Labor MPs made merry of his speech on Wednesday, with one suggesting red cordial had been tipped into his Grange. Thanks to my brains trust, Paul Karp, Gareth Hutchens, Katharine Murphy and Mike Bowers, picture magician. Don’t forget parliament is sitting next week so you will find me back here on Monday, same time same bat station. In the meantime, here is a photo of a treasurer in 2017. Good night. As the country suffers a heat wave, the prime minister is really pushing the energy outrage. Late today the cameras were invited down for him to address the energy committee of cabinet – something that happens rarely, if at all – for him to make some more remarks about what happens when governments follow an ideological approach to energy. He says Labor has been “complacently assuming that things would sort themselves out, without putting in place the measures to secure their electricity network”. Then he warned in WA the Labor opposition was also proposing a 50% renewables target. There is an interesting development in the Senate. Remember the Four Corners episode on the salmon industry in Tasmania? The Senate environment committee had questioned whether representatives of Tassal had improperly influenced a witness to the Senate inquiry into the fin-fish aquaculture industry in Tasmania. The Greens senator Peter Whish-Wilson asked the Senate president to consider whether the chamber could vote to send the matter to the privileges committee. The president agreed it could and today the Senate voted in favour of sending it to the powerful committee for a ruling. If the committee rules there was improper influence, it has the power to fine or impose a jail sentence. The Parliamentary Privileges Act states: “A person shall not, by fraud, intimidation, force or threat, by the offer or promise of any inducement or benefit, or by other improper means, influence another person in respect of any evidence given or to be given before a House or a committee, or induce another person to refrain from giving any such evidence.” You know how I said there was something in the water... DPM tries to keep it together. There must be something in the water. I shall take captions. There is much weirdness in the chamber. Tanya Plibersek is speaking to a matter of public importance on “the government’s $30bn of cuts to schools hurting Australian children”. She says the government has no education policy and outlines schools that have benefited from Labor’s Gonski funding. Plibersek contrasts it with the Coalition’s policy to cut corporate tax rates. She says business tax cut plan equivalent to asking every person in Australia to hand over $2000 to a big business, “probably a bank”. She asks, would most Australians want to hand the money to a company or a school? The assistant minister, Karen Andrews, answers Plibersek in her speech. She says the Coalition provides better educational policies because the Coalition has a holistic approach to education and does not believe more money will fix everything. F-F-F-F-F-Far out. Release the beast. Shorten to Turnbull: Is it still your government’s policy to make Australians work until they’re 70 to get the aged pension and can the prime minister confirm that he is giving Australia the oldest aged pension in the developed world? Turnbull flicks the question to Christian Porter, who promptly reads out former press releases from Wayne Swan and Jenny Macklin, not to mention an op-ed by the Labor economist and frontbencher Andrew Leigh. Porter quotes Macklin: She said increasing the aged pension age is a responsible reform to meet the challenge of an ageing population and the economic impact it will have for all Australians. Australia must move towards a higher pension age over the next decade. Porter quotes Leigh: He says a better approach would be to index upper age limits in all laws. Porter does not answer the question on whether the aged pension will be increased to 70. Labor’s Kate Ellis to Turnbull: In September last year, the government announced more than $3bn for its childcare policy. But legislation introduced by the government yesterday showed that this policy has now shrunk to a $1.6bn policy – half of the original amount that was promised by the prime minister. Why is the prime minister still making pensioners, new mums and over 1.5 million Australian families pay for his shrinking childcare package at the same time as giving a $50bn corporate tax cut to big business? Turnbull says “we are delivering is exactly what we promised” but does not go to the overall cost envelope – the $3bn. I will try to get further clarification as to the change in the figures. A government question on boats to the immigration minister, Peter Dutton, allows him to attack Bill Shorten. The Australian public knows – they instinctively know, when they look at this leader of the opposition – there is something that is not right. They have a hesitation about this leader of the opposition because they know that he says one thing to one part of the country and he says something very different to another part of the country. This is the earlier question from the Greens MP Adam Bandt, which shows the very different tone Malcolm Turnbull is taking in parliament the last two days. Labor MPs are calling it the return of “Bad Malcolm” – a reference to the Annabel Crabb Quarterly Essay on the prime minister in which she said Turnbull had two sides, Good Malcolm and Bad Malcolm. Labor’s Jenny Macklin to the social services minister, Christian Porter: I refer to his previous answer when he said, “We invest all of the money we’re saving in the family tax benefit system”. But, under the government’s policy, it’s cutting $2.7bn in family payments and only spending $1.6bn on its childcare policy. Is the minister aware he was misleading theAustralian people, or is he just plain incompetent? Porter admits he made a mistake. I should have said ‘almost all’. That is true, that is true. The Kings of Coal. Labor to Frydenberg re South Australian blackouts: I refer to the statement recently released today by the operator of the Pelican Point power station which reads, “The second unit at Pelican Point is not able to provide a market response under the current rules of the NEM unless directed by the market operator”. Why did the federal regulator that reports to this minister force blackouts on South Australian households and businesses instead of directing Pelican Point to switch on the second unit? Frydenberg says the energy market operator disputes Labor’s version of events. Pelican Point could have come on with the high demand and the high prices. Now, the issue in South Australia was not Pelican Point. The issue in South Australia was the low supply from wind power. Labor tries to table the statement from Pelican Point power station. The government refuses to allow it. Another government question on the South Australian blackouts and energy policy to Josh Frydenberg. The treasurer, Scott Morrison, also took a government question and brandished a block of coal at the opposition. This is coal – don’t be afraid, don’t be scared. Shorten to Turnbull: Is the prime minister aware that almost three million children are in families that receive family tax benefit part A. Prime minister, how many of these three million children are in families that will have their payments cut? Turnbull flicks the question to social services minister Christian Porter. Porter says there are about 1.5 million families that described as family tax benefit families in the system. 725,000 of those families have children of childcare age between 0-5. Of those 1.5 million families, 480,000 of those families have children of after-school care age, aged 6-12. There are 1 million children of long day care aged between 0-5, 1 million children of 0-5 years inside the Family Tax Benefit system. There are 1.2 million children of after-school care age between 6-12 years and the families of those children all stand to benefit from reform to childcare. All of those families with children of those ages stand to benefit from generation-changing childcare reforms. (So again, the minister went to childcare increases rather than family tax benefits cuts.) In response to a Dorothy Dixer in Senate question time, communications minister Mitch Fifield, has revealed he’s written an angry letter to the board of Australia Post about executive pay after it was reported its chief executive, Ahmed Fahour, earns $5.6m. Fified said that the prime minister, he and the community believe that pay packet is “out of step with community expectations”. He’s written to the Australia Post board requesting “more rigorous consideration of remuneration packages” including being conscious of community expectations and the need to reduce operating costs. Fifield said while it’s up to the board to set pay, they have to be able to justify the levels. In short: hint, hint, give the executives a pay cut. Greens MP Adam Bandt to Turnbull: The new United States president Donald Trump appears to be dangerously unhinged, has a sycophantic relationship with Russian dictator Vladimir Putin, and is surrounded by far-right ideologues who seem hell-bent on war particularly in our region. So far, Australia has followed the US into war every time they’ve asked. Do you understand why Australians are worrying that you will lead Australia into another American-led war? Will you commit to a full parliamentary debate and decision before Australia follows the US into their next war? Turnbull turns on Bandt. He says no party’s policy endangers Australia more than the Greens. He uses the endorsements of US politicians since the dreaded phone call as a restatement of the commitment to the Australian-US alliance and cuffs the Greens along the way. As Theresa May said in the House of Commons, the honourable member is part of a protest movement, I’m the leader of a nation. I’m standing up for Australia’s security. You, the Greens party, would undermine it at every turn. The American alliance is the foundation of our national security. It has been built by millions of Australians and Americans, on sacrifice, on standing shoulder-to-shoulder on every major conflict since the first world war. In the last week, we have seen more recognition and support for the Australian alliance in the United States than we’ve seen for many years ... But I say to the honourable member, the policies of his party would put this nation at grave risk and we will not have a bar of them. We’re standing for Australia... Shorten to Turnbull: Kelly is a mum for Ballarat with three children in school aged 7, 8 and 11. Kelly says that she relies on family payments to keep her car on the road, which she says is her only means of getting her children to and from school. The prime minister’s cuts to family payments mean that Kelly will lose around $1,000 a year. Why is the prime minister taking money from families like Kelly, but still persisting with a $50 billion tax giveaway to large businesses, big banks and multinationals? Turnbull says: I assume the business tax cuts that the honourable member referred to are the ones that, in 2012, he said delivered productivity, investment, jobs and economic growth. I mean, this leader of the opposition says one thing in one place and another in another place, depending on what the audience is, and whether it suits him. Note that Labor’s question relates just to family tax benefits. The pea and thimble trick going on between the two parties is that the government provides modelling that takes into account the childcare subsidy (slightly increased) AND the cuts to the family tax benefits. Labor is asking specifically about the cuts to family tax benefits, which show those who receive those benefits lose under just those cuts. Every government question has been about energy and affordable power so far. Labor’s Mark Butler to Josh Frydenberg, energy minister: Why did the Australian Energy Market Operator – the federal regulator that reports to this minister – force blackouts on South Australians last night, when there was sufficient spare gas generation capacity at Pelican Point which the federal regulator refused to turn on? The government benches roars in feigned outrage. Frydenberg says the problem was lack of supply. Wind power fell to 2.5% of supply yesterday in South Australia. At times, it can provide up to 80%. So the whole problem was the failure to provide sufficient wind. I mean, the only wind blowing in South Australia is the hot air of the Labor Party, Mr Speaker. Frydenberg quotes the energy regulator AEMO from last year. But Tony Burke makes the point comments made from last year cannot be relevant to “the refusal to turn on additional power yesterday”. The reality is the market operator and the market commission actually pointed to the failure in South Australia because there is this increase in the generation of intermittent power...the market operator has made it very clear he disputes the Labor Party - Jay Weatherill and the Federal Labor Party - trying to blame the umpire for the bad game that they’ve played when it comes to South Australia’s energy mix. There has been general argument on Turnbull’s answer. Tanya Plibersek objected to his shouting, to which Turnbull replied it was the content she was objecting to. Labor’s leader of opposition business Tony Burke described it as insane. Speaker Smith gave Burke a lecture, warning him not to reflect on his judgements. The attorney general, George Brandis, has appointed June Oscar as Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander social justice commissioner in the Australian Human Rights Commission. Oscar is a Bunuba woman and community leader from the central Kimberley region of Western Australia. She is currently the CEO of the Marninwarntikura Women’s Resource Centre in Fitzroy Crossing. Shorten to Turnbull: After repeatedly refusing to say exactly how many Australian families will be worse off because of the prime minister’s cuts to family payments, the government today was forced to admit the 1.5 million Australian families who receive family payments will be worse off. Why is the prime minister cutting the living standards of 1.5 million Australian families? Malcolm Turnbull is on his feet shouting. Why is he threatening the jobs of every Australian? Do you want to know how many Australian families will be worse off under a government led by this man? Every single one. Every single one. How many South Australians are worse off because of the Labor left ideological approach to power? I tell you, every single one. Every single one that wants to turn the lights on, wants to put the air conditioner on, wants to have a job, wants to have some investment. The Labor party threats every job, every business. Labor MP Pat Conroy has delivered his Turnbull gags. Over the PM’s leadership, we have seen Abraham Turnbull, who grew up in a log cabin. We have seen Malcolm Trump, with the “know your place” speech. This government is deeply out of touch. Labor MPs are using their 90-second statements before question time to take the mickey out of Malcolm on the speech. Tim Watts said as a public school boy, he knows what toffs and snobs mean when they say call someone a social climber. It means don’t rise above your station. Joanne Ryan said the speech should be known as the “know your place” speech. Question time coming up at 2pm. Malcolm Turnbull doubled down on his attack on Bill Shorten, suggesting his colleagues knew he was a fake. At the same time, Labor’s Rob Mitchell interpreted the Turnbull speech as “if you are not a billionaire, you are not worth shit”. Shorten said poor Turnbull, under so much leadership pressure. The parliamentary entitlements authority legislation was introduced to parliament by Turnbull, including a new interim body to get the expense business in hand before the authority formally begins. LNP MP Warren Entsch has already said it was unfair for former pollies to have the scheme changed retrospectively and today LNP senator Ian Macdonald has said the same thing. The Greens tried (for the third time) to get a federal corruption body on the agenda – after Labor succeeded with its Senate committee inquiry into same. The Greens said we don’t need another inquiry, just establish the thing. Or something like that. Barnaby Joyce has (again) raised his personal view – following the prime minister’s push to lift state bans on CSG exploration – that farmers should be paid for CSG mining on their land. Talk to the wallet, he said. After rolling blackouts in South Australia, the prime minister and energy minister have attacked the Labor SA government for its renewable policy. Labor has seized on the fact the Coalition’s plan to lift the pension age to 70 is absent from its omnibus welfare bill, calling on the government to ditch the measure entirely. The government maintains it is still Coalition policy but the deputy prime minister, Barnaby Joyce, has said it is subject to Senate negotiations. Excuse me, while I perambulate the building to guard against deep vein thrombosis. Greens Rachel Siewert lost a motion to change the date of Australia Day after Labor and the Coalition voted it down. All sides of parliament, particularly Labor, purport to advocate for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. In this instance, they have turned their back on them. As a reminder, when Ian Macdonald suggests that former politicians should get a say, there was that case in the high court last year. Four former federal politicians lost their high court challenge over reduced post-parliamentary perks, AAP reported. The four – a Howard government defence minister, John Moore, the Hawke government minister Barry Cohen and Labor MPs Barry Cunningham and Anthony Lamb – had used the same legal principle made noteworthy by the Australian comedy movie The Castle. They argued their entitlements under the Superannuation Act and to a life gold travel pass were their property which had been acquired by the commonwealth other than on the just terms required by a section in the constitution. High court judges unanimously held that amendments to legislation and rulings by the remuneration tribunal did not constitute acquisition of property. A majority held that changes to the life gold pass legislation, reducing return air trips for retired MPs from an unlimited number to 25 and now 10, also did not constitute acquisition of property other than on just terms. In The Castle, the Aussie battler Kerrigan family resort to the high court when developers seek to acquire their home to expand an airport. The case hinged on Section 51 (xxxi) of the constitution which says that property can’t be acquired other than on just terms. FYI Independent senator Cory Bernardi is directing business in the Senate from the chair. (It works on a roster system.) LNP Senator Ian Macdonald would like to reinstate the Life Gold Pass, the free travel pass for politicians that was dumped by his government . Earlier this morning, Macdonald revealed a few of his thoughts on the Gold card move. As I said in our party room the other day: I do not want to indicate what was said in the party room but these are my own thoughts, not the party room’s thoughts especially. It is about time our leaders – all of our leaders, and Senator Di Natale would be a good start – started emphasising how much work politicians do, how much commitment most of the people who sit in this parliament – most, I might add – have. They are here because they believe in Australia and they believe that they can make a contribution to Australia. By the standards in the community they do not get particularly well-paid, and there are hundreds of examples of that. Someone has to stand up, rather than just Senator Ludlam joining the populist theme and denigrating by innuendo everybody in this chamber and the other chamber, and start arguing for politicians, arguing for parliamentarians, saying why they are there. Most parliamentarians – or those on this side – would have done infinitely better financially staying in their legal practice, staying in their business, staying in their veterinary practice, staying in the jobs they had before. That is not why they have come into this chamber. I will be talking on this again in another bill coming up, where I will be opposing my government and again moving amendments. It is a bit wordy but given I speak Macdonald, here is the shorter version: most politicians are hard-working populism is making our lives harder LNP politicians are better at making money than Labor and are therefore taking a pay cut to take these poorly paid jobs (base senator salary = $200,000). He has just risen again to speak. Macdonald says the Life Gold Pass will not benefit him because he will leave the Senate “in a box”. He is thinking of elderly MPs now and the evils of retrospective legislation. Labor is now moving in the Senate to refer the omnibus savings-childcare bill to a committee for a short inquiry. Speaking on the same bill, Greens leader Richard Di Natale says the tactic of combining “nasties” with some reasonable reforms is a tactic imported from the US. He also notes by calling the bill and “omnibus” it covers the fact that the bill has some fairly severe welfare cuts from the 2014 Abbott budget. (A reminder if you were not with us yesterday. The omnibus bill contains the childcare policy to streamline numerous subsidies into one payment but has savings attached which cut family tax benefits, has a four-week wait for the dole for young people, cuts youth payments and cuts pensions for those overseas for longer than six weeks. Among other things.) Di Natale said the government has designed the bill to avoid the “scrutiny of the media that moves from issue to issue with the attention span of a goldfish” and the Australian people. The Greens are supporting the reference of the bill to committee. Energy policy has been a theme in this first sitting week and I am just running this up the flag because I think we could – granny pants required* – see changes in this area at some stage. So to step back. This morning Barnaby Joyce was asked about recent comments by the PM and energy minister who want the bans on coal seam gas mining addressed in particular states to address what the government claims is a shortage of gas. The Nats have had a lot of blowback on CSG, particularly in the NSW election where they lost a seat to the Greens on the north coast. The Baird NSW government bought back CSG licences to stop the electoral backlash. In Victoria, farmers want it banned. Sabra Lane asked, do you want to see those bans lifted? Joyce says he has always said, stay away from prime ag land but if it is not prime land and not in danger of destroying water aquifers, there should be a return to the landholder. (At present, the landholder does not own the resources underneath the ground. In some other countries, such as the the US, farmers get paid for resources.) Joyce continues: Now, people say, “Oh, well, they don’t own the resources.” Well, that historically is incorrect, because hydrocarbonous (sic) material – coal, oil, gas – in many instances was vested with the landholder. It was divested from the landholder without payment by a range of acts over the last 100 years. So if you cut a good deal with the farmers, then I think – as long as you’re not destroying aquifers and you’re not destroying prime ag land – then I think you can find a happy medium in this debate. Because everybody wants to make a buck. Talk to them where they listen most and that’s through their wallet. Watch this space. Joyce has been saying this for a while. With the Coalition shifting on to household energy costs, things could change. *granny pants = backside covering It is Thursday and the last sitting day so I thought I would bring you peak irony. The Daily Telegraph reports that Andrew Forrest has warned thousands of Australians will lose their jobs if Labor continues to block the government’s company tax cuts. The report says: Mining boss Andrew “Twiggy” Forrest said “self-interested” Labor and crossbench MPs should be kicked out of parliament if they refused to agree to business tax relief. Bill Shorten was asked about it this morning. Andrew Forrest would say that, wouldn’t he? It is in his interests to see company taxes reduced. He is entitled to his opinion. What I think is a bigger problem, that a million Australian families will have family payments reduced. We have lost 130,000 apprenticeships in the last four years. That is a bigger problem. People have to pay upfront fees to get ballooned cancer tests. What is a problem is when we don’t have needs-based funding in schools. We have over 700,000 people unemployed, over a million of our fellow Australians who regularly record they would like more work, people who have given up looking for work. Pensioners are worried about changes to the pension assets test. Mr Forrest and Mr Turnbull can worry about large corporates, I will worry about the people of Australia. It’s hard to look serious next to a dinosaur. It is disappointing that Labor would oppose the omnibus bill. Just let me cut away to a debate in the Senate on the national integrity commission bill. Labor received support yesterday to establish another Senate inquiry into establishing a national Icac. The Greens have today introduced their old bill, dated 2013, which would immediately establish a national corruption body. It would: Establish a national integrity commission as an independent statutory agency which will consist of the national integrity commissioner, the law enforcement integrity commissioner and the independent parliamentary advisor and provide for: the investigation and prevention of misconduct and corruption in all commonwealth departments, agencies, and federal parliamentarians and their staff; the investigation and prevention of corruption in the Australian Federal Police and the Australian Crime Commission; and independent advice to ministers and parliamentarians on conduct, ethics and matters of proprietary. Also provides for the establishment of a parliamentary joint committee on the national integrity commission; and makes consequential amendments to the Law Enforcement Integrity Commissioner Act 2006, Ombudsman Act 1976, Privacy Act 1988 and Public Interest Disclosure Act 2013. A bit of history. The former Greens leader Christine Milne first introduced the bill in 2013. It has been debated four times and lapsed twice because it was not supported by either major parties. Now the Greens are introducing it again, to make the point that the bill is sitting there – ready and waiting. They suggest, just get on with it. Labor’s Jacinta Collins says Labor feels the committee needs to inquire first. The Liberal senator Ian Macdonald says a federal Icac is not necessary. In the last parliament, a similar federal Icac investigation was conducted in a senate committee set up by PUP senator Dio Wang and independent John Madigan. It was stopped midway because of the double dissolution election. The Greens senator Janet Rice highlights the recent political donations and ponders what donors get in return. On heckling from Coalition senators, Rice acknowledges that the Greens were given $1.6m by Wotif founder Graeme Wood. She said he was keen to promote policies to address climate change. We need to shine a light we need to clean up that river [of donations] because at the moment the waters are murky. The debate is adjourned. Shorten is asked about George Christensen’s threat to cross the floor and vote for Bob Katter’s proposed commission of inquiry into the banks. I will believe it when I see it. George is big in Canberra, he is big in his local constituencies, but I hope he stands up for a royal commission vote in Canberra. The banks do need a royal commission. Labor will, if elected, implement a royal commission into the banks because something has to give. We see scandal after scandal in banking and there is always the apologies and ‘we have learned our lesson’ until the next time. I hope George Christensen votes for a royal commission. Bill Shorten: What turns people off politics is the absolute – just yelling at each other. I am not perfect. I won’t say that. What I do understand is that we have to try and lift out of politics and go to a better place to restore confidence and politics. That is why we are seeing the rise of minor parties. People feel the mainstream politicians are always on at each other like a Punch and Judy show. Bill Shorten on Turnbull’s speech: For me, what was important yesterday isn’t his name calling, what is important yesterday is that the government put forward proposals to cut the family payments to a million Australian families. That is what Labor does. We stand up for middle and working class Australians. Mr Turnbull, on the other hand, he is clearly showing signs of pressure in the job. I am relaxed in my own skin. Bill Shorten is speaking now at his press conference. He repeats his line that he feels sorry for Turnbull because he is under leadership pressure. He says it is not Turnbull’s wealth that is at issue, it is his policies in which he wants company tax cuts while pursuing Centrelink clients. Shorten bats away suggestions that he raised Turnbull’s wealth by calling him Mr Harbourside Mansion. He says it was first used by Turnbull’s former chief of staff Peta Credlin. (She went on to work for Abbott.) I have been representing workers for years. My dad was a fitter and turner. I am relaxed in my own skin. Overnight, South Australia has been sweltering through more blackouts. The ABC reported: South Australia’s energy minister is furious with the Australian Energy Market Operator after tens of thousands of South Australian homes were blacked out last night in scorching conditions. As the temperature hovered about 40C at 6.30pm, power was cut to more than 40,000 homes for more than half an hour. Demand for electricity forced SA Power Networks to implement blackouts, prompting an angry response from the SA government. The temperature hit 46C in outback areas of the state on Wednesday, including Port Augusta and Ceduna, while Adelaide saw a top of 42C. As many people arrived home from work and cranked up their air conditioners in the evening, SA Power Networks announced it would start load shedding to cope with demand, plunging some areas into blackouts. The Coalition has jumped on it this morning, again criticising the South Australian government’s commitment to renewable energy. Of course it is more complex than that, but never let a political opportunity slide. Turnbull: They want to blame it on everybody else. I suppose they could blame it on the wind because it wasn’t blowing yesterday. You know something, the history is in SA, which does have a history of heatwaves, when they have the biggest heatwave, there is no wind. When there is no wind, all their windmills don’t generate electricity. They haven’t planned for that. This is not an issue about the virtues of fossil fuel, one type or another, or wind energy or renewable energy, this is an issue about competence. One more from Paul Karp. The expenses authority is not all sweetness and light. Paul Karp found these. Malcolm Turnbull is now speaking to the independent parliamentary expenses authority bill, the body that will manage politicians expenses. (This came about after the downfall of health minister Sussan Ley over the Christmas break.) He said there would be monthly disclosures and the authority would start work on 1 July. A new interim advisory body will work in the meantime, with an independent board. Once the authority is in full flight, the interim body will be disbanded. Essentially it will mean that the oversights, such as monthly disclosures will happen sooner. As parliamentarians we have a duty to make sure our expenses meet standards that Australians expect, Turnbull said. He continues: Politics is about many issues. It is about policies, it is about character. It is about strength of character. I back myself. I am my own man. I can’t be bought by anyone. I don’t suck up to billionaires. I look them in the eye and when I need to I take them on. Bill Shorten sold his members out again and again and they know that. It is one of the oldest unions in Australia, perhaps the oldest, the Australian workers union. He sold their members out. That is a fact. That is not rhetoric. That is not a political line. That is fact. It is in the royal commission. He sold them out then, he is selling them out now and he will sell them out again because that is his character. Turnbull uses the example of cuts to company tax, which Shorten has backed in the past. Bill Shorten has made the case for reducing company tax as eloquently as anyone. He will say anything to suit his purpose. Let’s be quite frank. Bill Shorten doesn’t have the character to be prime minister of Australia. He does not have the integrity to be leader of the opposition, to be leader of the Labor party. Malcolm Turnbull is going Shorten again. He wants to play the politics of envy but he’s been a sycophant. Everybody knows. That everybody knows that. No union leader has tucked his knees under more billionaires’ tables than Bill Shorten. Everyone knows that. Those criticisms rang true and the people who know him best are his own colleagues. They know he is a fake. He has no integrity, no consistency. He doesn’t have a fair dinkum bone in him. Labor backbencher, Rob Mitchell, rarely sighted on the early doorstops, said this of the prime minister: Yesterday, we’ve seen extraordinary events where the prime minister proved that he’s out of touch, arrogant and petulant. We’ve seen the big dummy-spit as the silverspoon got spat across the dispatch box when he was questioned about his attack on families. We’ve seen a prime minister who said to Australians yesterday if you’re not a billionaire, you’re not worth shit and that is something I think Australians this morning have woken up and realised. This prime minister has now turned full circle. He’s gone back to caring about only those in his station. Deputy prime minister Barnaby Joyce further defined the Turnbull message to Sabra Lane on AM. We had to put up with Mr Shorten coming out and he knows what he’s doing, he’s creating this class warfare, calling Mr Turnbull Mr Harbourside Mansion. And as I’ve said before, if I’m going to have a choice between someone running the country with the arse out of their pants who’s never made a buck or someone who has made a dollar, got ahead – remember Mr Turnbull owns a nice stack on the harbour because he’s worked very hard and been successful. That’s what we want in this nation. We should celebrate success. The thing about Mr Shorten is such a hypocrite because we know he spends his whole life swanning it with Solly Lew and Richard Pratt and flying around in their jets. And good luck and God bless him but don’t go to the dispatch box and start this confected outrage of you and the working man as if you’re Clark from a coalmine in Wales. You’re not. Have a good look at yourself. You might be leader of the Labor party but you look like you’ve never done a day’s labour in your life. When Sabra Lane suggested much of the voter criticism had been of personal abuse, Joyce said: We’re not going to have Mr Shorten bucketing on us and take it on the chin every day. If that’s where Mr Shorten wants to go, we’re ready, willing and able to reply. He’s completely and utterly incompetent. He couldn’t run a pie shop and the thought of him running the country fills me with dread. There has been some reaction to the Turnbull speech from his colleagues. Energy and environment minister Josh Frydenberg said Turnbull was talking to the people of Australia when he gave the speech because Bill Shorten was not fit to be prime minister. He was speaking to the people of Australia, not just the colleagues in the party room. Bill Shorten is not fit to be prime minister. Let’s take a moment to sketch out the day. The prime minister has a press conference this morning on childcare at 9am and Bill Shorten is at 9.30am on skills. In the house, we have: Independent Parliamentary Expenses Authority (the independent watchdog) Farm household support amendment Treasury laws amendment (combating multinational tax avoidance) Diverted profits tax Parliamentary entitlements legislation amendment Enhancing online safety for children amendment Health insurance amendment (national rural health commissioner) Appropriation (No. 3) 2016-2017 Appropriation (No. 4) 2016-2017 Treasury laws amendment (Bourke Street Fund) Good morning blogans, I trust you have all had a fitful sleep after yesterday and are ready to get amongst it on this, the last day of the sitting week. The news – in the sense of things that are new – this morning are thus: Gareth Hutchens reports George Christensen, Queensland LNPer and government whip, has threatened to cross the floor to support Bob Katter’s proposed bank commission of inquiry. This is the parliamentary inquiry which is more like a royal commission and has only been used once before for former high court justice and Labor minister Lionel Murphy. Last night, there was debate over a migration bill that would change the law to allow the immigration minister to have another look at “certain visa holders” after they have already been approved “if the minister determines that it is in the public interest”. Labor said it could give Peter Dutton Trump-like powers. This morning Dutton said the Labor shadow Shayne Neumann told him on Sunday in a phone call that Labor had no trouble with the bill except for a minor change. LNP MP and member of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters Scott Buchholz told the Fin that anyone who has a beef with Cory Bernardi standing as a Liberal and then quitting should make a submission to the current inquiry investigating the election. But the news cycle continues to be dominated by the Turnbull speech in which the prime minister - taunted for months over his wealth - accused the opposition leader of sucking up to rich people and effectively selling out his union members. On 7.30 last night, Bill Shorten adopted a “more in sorrow than in anger” face when he said: Mr Turnbull was clearly fired up but that’s about saving his job. I mean this may sound a little incongruous, a little unusual, but I feel a little bit for Malcolm at the moment. He’s under great pressure. We take our orders in Labor from the middle and working class of Australia. Now, it is true that I was good friend with the late Richard Pratt. He died eight years ago. I think that Malcolm Turnbull wants to criticise our position on families and we have that argument. We should do that. But I think he was showing pressure when he referred to a bloke who died eight years ago. We’ve got to lift the tone of debate. The shadow treasurer, Chris Bowen, gave his thoughts to Fran Kelly this morning. Firstly I thought it was shrill, desperate, un-prime ministerial. It was personal. The context here of course was that Bill Shorten had moved a motion about the government’s cuts to family tax benefits … what was Malcolm Turnbull’s speech about? Was it about Australians? Was it about the people who would be worse off? No. It was about him and Bill Shorten. The guy’s obsessed with Bill Shorten. Bowen said the speech was bizarre, accusing Bill Shorten of not being a radical enough union leader. Bill Shorten was a pragmatic union secretary, who got things done for his members but took a sensible approach working with employers on big major infrastructure projects. Sometimes union leaders are accused of not doing enough of that. So there is your political brekkie for the day.

Vice reverses the gender role by portraying the woman as the one stumbling through one-night stands in order to get over a harsh break-up. The electronic pulse that rumbles underneath casts a dark shadow and the song’s sexual independence puts it in the tradition of Loretta Lynn’s breakthrough hit The Pill. The only threat here is the Tim McGraw hit Humble and Kind, an earnest anthem for unity that has already racked up song awards at last year’s American Music Awards and Country Music Association awards. Will win: Humble and Kind – Lori McKenna for Tim McGraw Should win: Vice – Miranda Lambert, Shane McAnally and Josh Osborne for Miranda Lambert Country album Sturgill Simpson’s latest album, A Sailor’s Guide to Earth, is not really a country album, but so what? The singer-songwriter casts himself as the rightful heir to outlaw country players like Merle Haggard. His underground-to-mainstream journey resulted from touring and television appearances, not the charts, which have made him a disrupter in Nashville. Certainly his current momentum means a win is likely, and would send the message that individual vision, creative experimentation and respect for tradition still matter. Will win: A Sailor’s Guide to Earth – Sturgill Simpson Should win: A Sailor’s Guide to Earth – Sturgill Simpson Country solo performance For all the reasons listed above, this needs to go to Miranda Lambert. The only threat here is Carrie Underwood, whose rock ballad Church Bells is an epic revenge song that ended up becoming one of the biggest hits of her career. She also blazed through the song during three country music awards shows last year, which helped build momentum for a potential Grammy win. Will win: Carrie Underwood Should win: Miranda Lambert Country/duo solo performance The true tussle in this category is between Dierks Bentley with Ellie King and Kenny Chesney with Pink. Both are crossover collaborations – King is more of a blues singer and Pink a pop star – and both different directions for Bentley and Chesney. Chesney’s superstar status favors a win for his power ballad, and including Pink only increases the odds. But Different for Girls deserves the win because it takes chances. The song is a well-intentioned look at relationship conflict through a woman’s lens. While it is a sign of maturity for a singer who once had a hit with a song titled Drunk on a Plane, it also brought something new to stale country radio playlists. Will win: Setting the World on Fire – Kenny Chesney and Pink Should win: Different For Girls – Dierks Bentley and Ellie King American roots song Jack White’s name in any awards category tends to tilt the odds in his favor. Yet this is for a minor work – a White Stripes song from a collection of past rarities. His competition is less than high-profile: the Nashville supergroup the Time Jumpers, the singer-songwriter Lori McKenna, and the Lafayette Zydeco band Roddie Romero and the Hub City All-Stars. The favorite, though, is Robbie Fulks – Alabama at Night is the centerpiece of an album from last year that raised the bar for modern singer-songwriters. Influenced by the 1936 literary masterwork Let Us Now Praise Famous Men by James Agee, the song, sung from the author’s perspective, has literary weight not heard in song since the golden age of songwriting decades past. Will win: City Lights – Jack White Should win: Alabama at Night – Robbie Fulks Americana album Because Americana is a category that has a long musical reach, there’s no surprise this slate of nominees is just as varied. The Avett Brothers certainly rule the category in current relevance; the North Carolina folk-rock band’s latest album happens to be their most adventuresome and successful. This is their second nomination in this category, so this is probably their year. The former Stax soul man William Bell is nominated as well as the Nashville supergroup the Time Jumpers and the singer-songwriter Lori McKenna. But this could be the moment for voters to recognize the outlaw legend Kris Kristofferson. He is 80 and recently suffered a bout of Lyme disease. Now that he has resumed touring – a current victory lap of solo acoustic shows – the award would validate his lasting influence on everything Americana. Will win: True Sadness – The Avett Brothers Should win: The Cedar Creek Sessions – Kris Kristofferson American roots performance For sheer popularity, this is yet again an award for the Avett Brothers to win. But Rhiannon Giddens, late of the old-timey roots trio Carolina Chocolate Drops, has carved out a solo career that stands on its own merits. No song in this category is quite like Factory Girl, a haunting elegy that might double as a long-lost Irish murder ballad. Will win: The Avett Brothers Should win: Rhiannon Giddens Traditional blues album This category celebrates the traditionalists, but in 2017 the idea of “traditional blues” is not that straightforward. The bluesman who carries the longest legacy among the nominees is the Chicagoan Lurrie Bell who started in the club scene alongside his father, the famed harmonica player Carey Bell. The son, 58, remains one of the strongest ambassadors of Chicago electric blues working today. However, the marketing budget is heavier for the blues rocker Joe Bonamassa, whose nomination has already caused controversy since his playing – he’s a disciple of Eric Clapton and Stevie Ray Vaughan – is the furthest from the tradition you can get. Will win: Live at the Greek Theater – Joe Bonamassa Should win: Can’t Shake This Feeling – Lurrie Bell Contemporary blues album Here’s the category where Bonamassa would rule. Instead it should go to the Louisiana blues guitarist Kenny Neal, whose playing brings in a myriad of influences, including swamp pop and funk. He is a soulful vocalist also known over the last two decades for his slashing guitar work. If he doesn’t walk home with the Grammy, look for it probably going to the unfortunately named the Record Company. This is a roots-rock trio of multi-instrumentalists who channel early rock’n’roll with a heavy emphasis on classic blues – not compelling stuff but the kind of comfort-zone fare that makes it easy for voters. Will win: Give it Back to You – The Record Company Should win: Bloodline – Kenny Neal Folk album No one wants to compete for a folk Grammy against Judy Collins. The folk revival legend is out with a new album on which she is paired with the New York singer-songwriter Ari Hest. They, plus the Carolina Chocolate Drops singer Rhiannon Giddens, the teenage prodigy Sierra Hull, and the alt-folkie Sarah Jarosz make heady competition for Robbie Fulks. Yet momentum has been building this past year for the Chicago alt-country songwriter and for good reason. Upland Stories is a major accomplishment of literate storytelling and unvarnished musicianship, earning him the best reviews of his 20-plus-year career. Will win: Upland Stories – Robbie Fulks Should win: Upland Stories – Robbie Fulks Bluegrass album No surprise that this category is occupied by a number of traditionalists – the Tennessee group Blue Highway, the legends Doyle Lawson &amp; Quicksilver, the fiddler Laurie Lewis, as well as the O’Connor Band, a six-member family group.

The creation of the clinic has prompted fears that other GPs will follow suit and that NHS patients will become “second-class citizens” as general practice increasingly becomes a two-tier health service. The three doctors running the Dorset Private GP service are offering “the unhurried, thorough, personal care we believe is best for patients” – at a price. Patients pay £40 for a 10-minute phone consultation, £80 for a 20-minute face-to-face appointment and £145 for 40 minutes with a GP. “With the NHS sometimes struggling to offer a quality service now is the time to choose a private doctor,” according to the website for the trio’s venture. They offer times that suit patients and the chance to see the same GP at each visit, benefits that few NHS patients are offered any more because of the heavy and growing pressures on family doctor surgeries. Those who pay receive their appointment at the same Poole Road Medical Centre in Bournemouth where the GPs see the NHS patients on their practice list. However, private patients in effect jump the queue to be seen as they can get appointments on the day, whereas ordinary patients can wait up to four weeks for an appointment lasting just seven minutes. GPs are barred under the terms of their contract from offering private medical services to patients on their practice list. However, the Dorset Private GP service is not breaking any rules because it is only offering the service to other people. “This looks like the thin end of the wedge. There are really worrying signs that a two-tier NHS is emerging under Theresa May’s leadership,” said Jonathan Ashworth, Labour’s shadow health secretary. “The relentless underfunding of healthcare has meant that practitioners in many parts of the country are struggling to keep the service going, but the news that private patients are being offered the chance to skip the queue comes as a real shock.” Norman Lamb, the Liberal Democrat health spokesman, warned that the service risked opening up a divide between those who can and cannot afford to pay upfront charges for healthcare. “We are also witnessing increasing numbers of people, who have the resources to do so, opting out of the NHS to fast-track treatment. The inevitable result will be a two-tier system. Those without money will just be left waiting longer for care. “There will be a great temptation for some GPs involved to prioritise private work over NHS work. This would lead to NHS patients being treated as second-class citizens,” he added. Dr Tim Alder, the main GP behind the scheme, defended the setting-up of the service and warned that NHS general practice was on “the brink of collapse” and heading for privatisation because it was underfunded, facing a serious staff shortage and unable to cope with demand. “Five years ago there would be far more people saying ‘how dare you do this to the NHS’ and ‘you’re causing it to fall apart by doing this’, rather than the other way around. But now most people understand why and are quite interested. They see it as an option for the future themselves,” Alder told the Southern Daily Echo. “I’d love to be able to say ‘you can have 20 minutes with me on the NHS’, but that is not going to happen until we have twice as many GPs. We certainly won’t be using NHS resources, we’ll use ours, which means if we do this in NHS time, we’ll find cover for that,” he added. Alder predicted that NHS underfunding of general practice and the takeover of surgeries by private firms such as Virgin Care could lead to GP surgeries – which are private businesses and not controlled by the NHS – charging all patients. “Sadly the NHS is no longer prioritising [quality general practice] and we can see a time when traditional GPs are private and the majority of patients are instead seen in clinics based in hospitals like minor A&amp;E departments. The personal touch and the ‘whole patient’ knowledge will be lost,” Alder added."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/feb/08/the-guardian-view-on-parliament-and-brexit-mps-fail-their-first-test","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-08T20:31:09Z","webTitle":"The Guardian view on parliament and Brexit: MPs fail their first test | Editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/feb/08/the-guardian-view-on-parliament-and-brexit-mps-fail-their-first-test","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/feb/08/the-guardian-view-on-parliament-and-brexit-mps-fail-their-first-test","fields":{"headline":"The Guardian view on parliament and Brexit: MPs fail their first test","bodyText":"Last month, Gina Miller stood outside the supreme court and celebrated the judges’ confirmation that parliament must sit behind the wheel in the Brexit process, not the prime minister invoking the medieval royal prerogative. A little more than two weeks later, the House of Commons has decided that Theresa May is the driver after all. Ms Miller fought long and hard, and at great personal cost, to ensure that the Commons could assert its lawful sovereignty over the Brexit process. On that morning in January she invited them to use “their invaluable experience and expertise” to set Britain’s course. But as the European Union (notification of withdrawal) bill comfortably passed its third reading in the Commons she was entitled to ask herself whether her efforts have really been worth it after all. It is tempting to say that MPs have been weighed in the balance and found wanting. That is because in many respects they have. Faced with a bill that sets in motion the UK’s withdrawal from the EU, which is as profoundly mistaken a decision as any that the UK parliament has taken in the postwar era, MPs have essentially said that last year’s referendum is sovereign and that they are powerless to put their foot on the brake or choose a different route. Too many on both sides of the Commons nonsensically deployed their experience and expertise to vote for a bill they admitted to not supporting. Too many MPs genuflected to a referendum decision that sets Britain against its neighbours and its own place in the world and puts the UK economy at hazard. It fell hardest for Labour, a pro-European party with many leave constituencies, where the EU dilemma is entangled with other issues about Labour’s future. It is a wrong decision because MPs have given far too little careful attention over the years to deciding the proper place, if any at all, of referendums in a representative democracy. The consequences of that have been painfully clear in the past two weeks. Referendums are too often cuckoos in the nest of parliamentary sovereignty. But the passing of this bill is also wrong because this particular referendum made such a lamentable choice about the future of Britain. Britain should be part of Europe. That has not changed. However, the Brexit vote took parliament’s authority away, politically if not constitutionally, and not even Ms Miller’s heroic efforts have been able fully to restore that authority. Two thirds or more of MPs think that Brexit is the wrong course. But, as Wednesday night’s vote confirmed, too many of them felt compelled to go through the lobbies in support of a bill that they believe, correctly in our view, will damage Britain. It is not they as individuals who have been found wanting. It is parliament. Yet not all is lost. Three days of the committee stage of the bill this week, as well as the brief third reading debate, have exposed big Brexit-related issues on which the majority of MPs seek outcomes that Mrs May would have been reluctant to concede or contemplate in the absence of parliamentary pressure. In particular, Mrs May has been forced to make procedural concessions about parliament’s later role in the process. Whether these concessions are real or a con will depend on how MPs act when the time comes. MPs have also made it clear that they expect the existing rights of EU citizens to live in the UK to be an inalienable part of any final deal. Other markers have also been laid down. These do not entirely compensate for the original wrong decision on Brexit or the second reading of the bill last week. But they mean the forces of openness and internationalism live to fight another day. And fight they must. The most disturbing aspect of an admittedly difficult set of decisions for MPs and parties over the past two weeks has been the caution with which parliament’s “soft Brexit” majority has behaved. That must change. Most opposition MPs and a large minority of Conservative MPs favour a soft as opposed to a hard Brexit. They must surely also want a good deal rather than either a bad deal or no deal at all. Yet cross-party cooperation has been too hesitant. Perhaps the vituperation of the rightwing press against “remoaners” has frightened too many in both main parties. Perhaps Tory liberals don’t want to fall out with Mrs May too soon. Whatever the truth, pro-European MPs in all parties need to relearn the practicalities of using their power as effectively as the Eurosceptics learned to use theirs long ago. There will be plenty more opportunities. They must be taken."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"sport/2017/feb/08/jockey-club-sandown-racing-news-tips","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-08T18:37:31Z","webTitle":"Racing news and tips: Council leader ‘not told’ of Sandown Park plans","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/feb/08/jockey-club-sandown-racing-news-tips","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/feb/08/jockey-club-sandown-racing-news-tips","fields":{"headline":"Racing news and tips: Council leader ‘not told’ of Sandown Park plans","bodyText":"The leader of Elmbridge borough council, which has planning responsibility for Sandown Park in Esher, said on Wednesday he has had “no contact at all” from the Jockey Club either before or after it announced plans to turn the course into a “super-track” using cash from the proposed sale of Kempton for housing. Stuart Selleck, who took over as leader in May last year, also stressed that plans to redevelop Sandown will be subject to strict local planning laws, as the course is situated on green belt land. The Jockey Club hopes to stage the King George VI Chase, the highlight of Kempton’s season, at nearby Sandown Park if its controversial scheme to sell Kempton for property development proceeds as planned. The course will require significant investment in the track and facilities to do so, however, as Sandown’s current maximum crowd is around 16,000 while Kempton regularly attracts more than 20,000 to the King George on Boxing Day. The development required to bring Sandown up to the standard the Jockey Club has promised, as well as accommodating the bigger crowds that a “super-track” would need to attract, would place significant extra strain on the surrounding roads and infrastructure. Any new building work, meanwhile, even if it follows the “footprint” of previous structures, would be subject to strict regulation and could well be opposed by local residents. “I’ve no idea what their plan is for Sandown Park, whether they are likely to build more or refurbish what they’ve got,” Selleck, who is a regular racegoer at Kempton’s “twilight” Flat meetings, said on Wednesday. “Whether they have been in contact with our planning department I wouldn’t know but they haven’t made any approach to the council via me on any sort of ideas they may wish to bring forward. I’m working on rumours as much as anybody else. “We have a major problem with traffic in the whole of Surrey, not just in Esher. There are big issues with what you can and cannot do on green belt land and, even if a plan is accepted by the local council, it would still need to be referred to the secretary of state. “Nothing is going to get waved through because it is on green belt and it will need to adhere to all the policies relating to green belt development. It will not be waved through in any shape or form.” The “super-track” plan for Sandown is one of two main projects that the Jockey Club insists will depend on raising at least £100m from the sale of Kempton for housing. The Jockey Club also wants to build a new all-weather track in Newmarket and says it will add to prize money at its tracks over and above what would have been on offer without the loss of Kempton. Kempton itself is believed to be the third-most profitable track in the Jockey Club’s portfolio, however, after the principal jumping venues of Cheltenham and Aintree. It is also a much-loved venue, rich in history, having seen such all-time greats as Arkle, Kauto Star and Desert Orchid entering its winner’s enclosure. The Club’s plans have been poorly received by many racing fans while both Spelthorne borough council, where Kempton is located, and an overwhelming majority of residents are also believed to be bitterly opposed to the track’s redevelopment. The plans to bulldoze Kempton were announced in early January, two days before the close of a statutory “call for sites” in Spelthorne for possible redevelopment, and took both the council and racing fans by surprise. The lack of contact with Sandown’s local planning authority, despite the track’s significance in the Jockey Club’s overall scheme, adds to the impression of a “now-or-never” decision to cash in on the immense value of the Kempton site. The latest estimates of land value produced by the Department for Communities and Local Government are now more than a year out of date, but suggest that the 200 acres of land that the Club says will be sold for housing would be worth at least £400m. Might Bite, who fell at the last fence at Kempton with a Grade One race at his mercy in December, will attempt to put that experience behind him when he returns to action in a novice chase at Doncaster on Thursday. Might Bite was a long way clear of his field in the Kauto Star Novice Chase when he took a crashing fall at the final obstacle, allowing Royal Vacation to record an unlikely 33-1 success. The potential in Might Bite’s performance was clear, however, and he is the second-favourite at 6-1 in ante-post betting for the RSA Chase at Cheltenham next month. “The thought process behind choosing Doncaster over Kempton [on Friday] was that it looked like being the easier option,” Nicky Henderson, Might Bite’s trainer, said on Wednesday. “I liked the idea of taking him back to Kempton over two-and-a-half miles, but he needs a confidence booster. He’s been very good at home since [Boxing Day], but I just felt that after what happened, the easiest race I could find him would do the job and by going to Kempton I’d have been overlooking the obvious. Doncaster is a lovely track, the fences are spaced out lovely, he won’t be rushed over three miles and he’s already won there over fences.” “Admittedly when it happened I thought he’d take a long time to recover because in his first couple of races he was a bit spooky at his fences. However, he recovered remarkably quickly and hopefully he puts in a clear round.” Thursday’s tips by Greg Wood Doncaster 1.55 Pithivier 2.30 Snow Leopardess 3.00 Might Bite 3.30 Abbreviate 4.05 Chelsea Flyer 4.40 Gambol Huntingdon 1.15 Bandon Roc 1.45 Petite Power 2.20 Keeper Hill (nap) 2.50 Protek Des Flos 3.20 Bertenbar 3.55 Petticoat Tails 4.30 Majestic Moll Lingfield Park 1.35 Lunch 2.05 Sutter County (nb) 2.40 Welsh Inlet 3.10 Graceful Lady 3.40 Brooke’s Point 4.15 Oberyn 4.50 Starboard Chelmsford City 5.50 Celtic Artisan 6.25 Babouska 7.00 Lostock 7.30 Shamshon 8.00 Mr Potter 8.30 Zorba The Greek"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2017/feb/08/yemen-us-raid-al-qaida-counter-terrorism-strategy-trump","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-08T20:14:19Z","webTitle":"Yemen wants US to reassess counter-terrorism strategy after botched raid","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/feb/08/yemen-us-raid-al-qaida-counter-terrorism-strategy-trump","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/feb/08/yemen-us-raid-al-qaida-counter-terrorism-strategy-trump","fields":{"headline":"Yemen wants US to reassess counter-terrorism strategy after botched raid","bodyText":"The Yemeni government said on Wednesday it wants a rethink of US counter-terrorist operations on its territory after a botched commando raid on 29 January that left 25 civilians dead. The Navy Seal operation, aimed at gathering intelligence on al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula (Aqap), has shone light on chaotic decision-making in the Trump White House, where presidential aides, many with little foreign policy or national security experience, are competing for influence. The Yemeni foreign minister, Abdul-Malik al-Mekhlafi, denied overnight reports that his government had ordered a halt to all ground operations by US troops in Yemen. But he added that his government, which is also fighting a civil war against Houthi rebels, “is involved in talks with the US administration on the latest raid” which it wanted “reassessed”. An official statement on Wednesday said: “ The government of Yemen reiterates its firm position that any counter-terrorism operations carried out in Yemen should continue to be in consultation with Yemeni Authorities and have precautionary measures to prevent civilian casualties. Yemen believes that terrorism is a global menace that has no borders, religion or nationality; one that only a collective and well-coordinated response can address.” Despite the US partnership with the government of President Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi, Yemen was one of seven predominantly Muslim countries whose nationals were barred entry to the US in a Trump executive order. US central command, which oversees operations in the Middle East, said there had been no change to its operations. “Currently, we have not been ordered to stop conducting any operations nor have been directed to halt any operational planning,” Centcom spokesman Maj Josh Jacques said. “We will continue to conduct operations consistent with international law and in coordination with the government of Yemen. We will not relent in our mission to degrade, disrupt and destroy al-Qaida.” In the White House press briefing on Wednesday, the press secretary, Sean Spicer, insisted that the raid in Yemen was a success and said anyone questioning its success owed an apology to the family of Chief Petty Officer Ryans Owens, the Navy Seal killed in the operation. When asked if that criticism applied to Senator John McCain, who deemed the raid a failure after receiving a classified briefing on the operation, Spicer repeated: “Anyone who undermines the success of that raid owes an apology and a disservice to the life of Chief Ryan Owens.” The night raid on a village in the central Yakla region appears to have gone wrong from the start, with the crash landing of an Osprey aircraft. According to the accounts of local villagers, about 50 US troops began by shooting villagers and tribal elders, and Aqap militants camped nearby only joined the fight after many civilians were already dead. Villagers told the Bureau of Investigative Journalism (BIJ) that 25 civilians died alongside a group of militants, including nine children under the age of 13. Of the nine young children who died, the smallest was only three months old. Seven women were killed, including one who was heavily pregnant. Seven more women and children were injured. The dead also included the eight-year-old daughter of al-Qaida propagandist and American citizen Anwar al-Awlaki, who was killed in a September 2011 US drone strike in Yemen, her family said. “It is true they were targeting [al-Qaida] but why did they have to kill children and women and elderly people?” Zabnallah Saif al-Ameri told the BIJ. He said he lost nine members of his extended family, five of whom were children. “If such slaughter happened in their country, there would be a lot of shouting about human rights. When our children are killed, they are quiet.” Villagers also told the BIJ that people trying to flee the gun battle between US commandos and Aqap militants were cut down by helicopter gunfire. “They killed men, children and women and destroyed houses,” said Mohsina Mabkhout al Ameri, who lost her brother, nephew and three of her nephew’s children. “We are normal people and have nothing to do with [al-Qaida] or [Yemeni rebel movement] the Houthis or anyone. The men came from America, got off the planes and the planes bombed us.” Although the US has carried out frequent drone attacks aimed at Aqap in recent years, this was the first raid involving US ground troops since 2014. According to a senior Obama administration official, a US military proposal to escalate ground raids like the Yakla operation had been reviewed in the last weeks of the administration, but a decision on whether to give it a green light was deferred to the incoming Trump team. The circumstances of Trump’s authorisation of the raid, at a dinner on 25 January, have drawn scrutiny of how the new White House makes such life and death decisions. The plan was presented to Trump at the dinner by the defence secretary, James Mattis, and the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, Gen Joseph Dunford. The president was flanked by his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and his chief strategist and former Breitbart news executive, Steve Bannon. Apart from Bannon’s seven years as a navy officer more than three decades ago, neither has foreign policy experience. The casual format differed markedly from previous practice, where such decisions would have been taken in the White House situation room and involved top officials from the state department and intelligence agencies, convened by the national security council (NSC). “In the Obama administration, there would have been a lot of debate, possibly too much,” said Loren DeJonge Shulman, who was a senior adviser in Obama’s NSC. “The people at the White House would have known the risks and the details of the raid backwards and forwards, but in this case it seems to have been fairly cursory, and left to political advisers and the military.” “The question is – is this going to be the normal process, when a couple of folks get together and cook up operations? Are we just shooting from the hip?” Shulman, now at the Centre for a New American Security, asked. Trump’s national security adviser, Michael Flynn, was also at the dinner, but the decision did not going through the normal NSC channels, through which heads or deputy heads of all agencies with a stake in the operation would be convened. A deputy principals session was held on 26 January, but according to sources familiar with the meeting it was simply asked to rubber-stamp the president’s decision. The incident has heightened fears that the NSC could be sidelined when it comes to important decisions. According to reports emanating from the White House, senior directors of specialist departments are not being asked to give briefings directly, but rather formulate short bullet-point summaries. They are rarely, if ever, called into the Oval Office when the president calls foreign leaders. Bannon and Kushner have set up a separate body inside the White House called the strategic initiatives group, viewed by some in the NSC as a potential rival centre of decision-making power. Flynn told the Washington Post that 60 of 230 staff posts in the council are still unfilled, a possible sign that senior officials in other agencies are not prepared to work in a Trump White House. Recent political appointments to the NSC have also reflected the influence of a prominent Trump backer and venture capitalist, Peter Thiel. Kevin Harrington, the former manager of a Thiel investment fund with minimal foreign policy experience, was named last week as deputy assistant to the president for strategic planning. This story was updated on 9 February to correct the number of civilians killed in the raid."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"money/blog/2017/feb/13/great-western-railway-delay-repay","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-13T07:00:07Z","webTitle":"GWR’s compensation scheme is all delay and no repay","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/blog/2017/feb/13/great-western-railway-delay-repay","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/blog/2017/feb/13/great-western-railway-delay-repay","fields":{"headline":"GWR’s compensation scheme is all delay and no repay","bodyText":"I travelled from Paddington to Plymouth in October by train which suffered a two-hour delay due, in part, to circumstances beyond GWR’s control (a fatality on the line) but still worthy of compensation according to the terms and conditions on its website. Arriving in Plymouth all passengers were invited to take a leaflet to claim compensation. I did so by post. A month later, I called customer service to follow up my claim and was told that, due to an office relocation, the address I had sent my claim to was six months out of date, but if I had copies of the tickets I could reapply online. I did so and got an email saying that they were receiving many calls and I would have to wait up to three weeks. Four weeks later, I received an email saying that my claim had been rejected as the initial delay was caused by police investigating a death en route. I appealed, on the grounds that there were further delays subsequent to that, and pointed out that handing forms out to customers to facilitate applying for compensation gives the impression that compensation would be forthcoming. Checking my phone records, I noticed that calls to its customer service centre (holding time averaged 20 minutes on the two occasions I used it)are charged, unannounced, at a premium rate. I pursued an email appeal of 19 December (they gave themselves three weeks again...) and got a reply saying the expected time for a reply is now eight weeks. I’ve had enough. The service is either critically understaffed or deliberately designed to frustrate, or both. Whether this is policy or planning it is demonstrably unacceptable, and they should be accountable, especially in the light of complaints that you have already addressed and others I have seen online. JL, London SW2 The nub of your complaint is the – we agree, wholly unacceptable – amount of time GWR has taken to respond, and our postbag is filling up with more along the same lines. The operator has recently moved its contact centre, but all mail is redirected from a Freepost address, routed via Royal Mail – which should have no bearing on the time taken for a complaint to be received. The company also says its customer service number is not a premium rate line. Calls to an 0345 number are charged the same as a normal landline but, unlike 0845 numbers, they are also included in any mobile phone call bundle a customer may have. So if a customer’s monthly/weekly allowance of free minutes has been used up (as in your case) those calls become chargeable and the charge levied depends on the provider. For example, 3 charges 3p a minute, Vodafone 30p a minute and Orange 35p, so there is quite a range. GWR says it has worked hard to make sure customers are able to make contact and know how tobut adds that it has little control over mobile phone providers’ fees. Maybe time for a different charging system, then? That aside, it says that when trains are significantly delayed it does its best to inform customers during the journey and to address their needs when they reach their destination. With only one eligible passenger in five claiming for compensation across the system, the UK’s rail regulators have demanded that operators do more to raise awareness of compensation rules – announcing that it may be available and giving out claim forms when a train exceeds the delay threshold to qualify. GWR says that it was “sorry for the time it has taken our customer service team to work through this complaint and resolve it to JL’s satisfaction. We’ve recently moved our contact centre to a new site, bringing all our customer service work back to the UK. The move means some detailed responses are taking longer than we would like, and we are working with our new team to improve our response rates. Like any other business we strive to deliver the best possible service for our customers. When things do go wrong it is entirely in our best interests for customers to know how to contact us and what the arrangements for refunds or compensation are. While the customer’s initial delay was beyond our control we have offered a gesture of goodwill, which we hope will be with him shortly”. We gather rail travel vouchers are on their way to you.

Quite apart from the fact that, as with all Christian principles, the believer is called to apply self-denial to his or her own behaviour, not to impose it on others, lagom has an appeal way beyond religious ethics. We live in a world where we are encouraged to see continuous increase in the consumption of stuff as the only sure measure of political and personal success, ignoring that the Earth’s resources are finite. In this country we pay only lip service to the condemnation of a western culture of conspicuous waste, and we walk away from institutions formed to enhance individuals’ quality of life by cooperating in the development of social welfare. A move as simple as the recent Swedish government decision to cut VAT on the repair of possessions shows an understanding that real improvement in the quality of life requires more than simple acquisitiveness. Lagom gives practical expression to secular action on the protection of the planet, and a start to reducing inequality in global living standards. The fact that it reinforces religious warnings on the unwisdom of basing personal fulfilment on amassing goods, and on self-indulgence, is incidental.

But as the 45th US president enjoys a second vacation in as many weekends at Mar-a-Lago, his private coastal retreat, the wealthy town that hosts him continues to grapple with the unprecedented financial and logistical burdens imposed upon it as a sometimes home to the new commander-in-chief. Community leaders are concerned by the spiralling security costs of protecting Trump and his family during his frequent escapes from Washington DC, and fears are growing that some local traders could be put out of business amid the air and land lockdowns mandated by the presence of a president who has promised to protect the interests of small-business owners. “People will just say I’m not going to stay in the Palm Beaches, I don’t need the aggravation. It’s going to grind our economy to a halt,” said Jeff Greene, a hotel owner who says that he has already lost bookings from prospective guests at his upmarket Tideline Ocean Resort and Spa further south along Ocean Boulevard from Trump’s waterfront estate. “For people in Palm Beach, it’s exciting having a president here … But you can’t close down our roads, it’s just not right. You can’t close down our town for four years, or eight years.” The Secret Service requires airspace and road routes around Mar-a-Lago to be closed when Trump comes to town, and Greene worries that restaurants and hotels on narrow Palm Beach island will be the first to lose out. “This is a seasonal resort community, a place where there are a number of small business people who have to make their whole livelihood in a short period of time,” he said. “And basically the opportunities in a town like this are exactly the times he’s planning on being here, Christmas, New Year, Presidents’ weekend, Easter and all these other weekends, like last weekend and this coming weekend. In our hotel we depend on February and March to make 50% of our annual profit.” While hoteliers such as Greene are unable to yet put a dollar figure on their expected losses, Palm Beach County’s airports, flight schools and other aviation-related businesses are already counting the cost. Trump’s four-day visit last weekend caused more than $250,000 in lost revenue from fuel sales and landing fees, according to a dossier released this week by county aviation officials, mostly at Palm Beach international airport, where Air Force One lands and departs. At Lantana general aviation airport, inside the 30-mile flight restriction zone around Mar-a-Lago imposed by the Federal Aviation Administration, all operations cease during presidential visits. Jonathan Miller, chief executive of airport operator Stellar Aviation, said the repeated groundings, including training and sightseeing flights, are forcing several Lantana tenants to consider their futures. Palm Beach Aircraft Services estimates losses could reach $2m a year and several private plane owners have already switched to other airports, Miller said. “When [the president’s] here for three days we lose at least $30,000. Our small businesses can’t survive, they’ll either shut down or leave,” said Miller, who added that more than 400 people work at the airport. “There’s a little bit of hysteria and emotion but these short-term losses have significant impacts to us and the long-term damages will literally kill this airport. It’s not a one-off type of event. He’s going to be here a lot.” Miller has joined with the Palm Beach airports director, Bruce Pelly, and concerned county commissioners to appeal to the Secret Service for a relaxation of some of the tightest restrictions to “get Lantana functioning”. While the airports’ losses grow, Palm Beach is also seeking relief for security costs to protect Trump, including policing of demonstrations. About 3,000 people took part in a peaceful protest at Mar-a-Lago last weekend and another is planned for Sunday. The Palm Beach sheriff’s office did not respond to the Guardian’s request for cost details of last weekend’s visit, or Trump’s extended Christmas and New Year break at Mar-a-Lago, but its overtime bill alone topped $250,000 for the then president-elect’s short Thanksgiving sojourn. At a commission meeting this week, county leaders reaffirmed their desire to enlist congressional help to seek federal reimbursement. “We’re exhausting all options, including Twitter,” said commissioner Dave Kerner. Low-level security issues were a regular occurrence for staff at Mar-a-Lago even before Trump’s presidency, since he purchased the estate in 1985. A records request to the Palm Beach County police department revealed more than 300 police callouts to the address on 100 S Ocean Blvd and the area outside, between 1985 and 2016. Many of these occurrences were mundane: more than 70 traffic stops, 25 suspicious person and trespass reports and 10 property damage incidents. But the recent manoeuvrings underscore how Palm Beach, for more than a century a renowned winter playground for millionaires, is in uncharted territory when it comes to accommodating a sitting president. “Back in the 1960s John F Kennedy was here but it was a different town then, much smaller and quieter,” said Laurel Baker, a longtime Palm Beach resident and executive director of the town’s chamber of commerce. Baker said tourists had always come to gawk at the Rolls-Royces, Bentleys and Maseratis parked outside the upscale jewellery and fashion stores along Worth Avenue, but the challenge now is turning Trump’s notoriety into financial gain for the island’s business owners. “People want to see the winter White House but they’re drive-bys, which is a terrible word to use, but that’s what it is,” she said. “It’s all well and good, but it doesn’t help unless they also stop for a bite to eat.” There are, of course, no such worries inside Mar-a-Lago, where the opulent dining room is full every dinnertime when Trump is in residence, and the non-refundable membership fee doubled to $200,000 within weeks of his election victory.

It seemed like a coup for Trump, who has pledged to bring manufacturing back to the US. In a media-attended Oval Office meeting, Intel’s Brian Krzanich stood next to Trump and declared that the investment was a response to Trump’s business-friendly policies. “It’s in support of the tax and regulatory policies that we see the administration pushing forward that really make it advantageous to do manufacturing in the US,” he said. Trump was happy to take credit, thanking Krzanich and calling the Fab 42 plant – which will make state-of-the-art computer chips – a great investment in jobs and innovation. However, the semiconductor company had already announced the same factory back in 2011 when Barack Obama was in power. In 2012, Obama made a speech in front of the building, describing it – to a cheering crowd – as an “example of an America that attracts the next generation of good manufacturing jobs”. The construction of Fab 42 was halted in 2014, following a slump in PC sales, but analysts don’t believe Trump is the reason it’s been restarted. Instead, the decision to complete work on the factory is likely to be based on industry pressure to move to more advanced types of chips as demand for smart devices surges. “Now this announcement tonight is probably because of the semiconductor demand we have alluded to in great detail in recent weeks, more than it is about Trumponomics,” Neil Campling, the London-based head of global technology, media and telecom research at Northern Trust Securities, told Bloomberg News. “I call it ‘refried’ news. Intel seems to be selling the same horse twice – first to Obama and now Trump,” said Will Marshall, the president of the Progressive Policy Institute. “It gives them a chance to bask in presidential favor and show patriotic commitment to investing in America and jobs.” Intel’s pledge comes less than a year after the company revealed restructuring plans that included laying off 12,000 jobs by 2017. Intel is the latest company to use a meeting with Trump, who has threatened to punish companies that shift operations overseas, to promote domestic investments and job-creation plans that were already in place. On the eve of a summit between tech leaders and Trump in December, IBM CEO Ginni Rometty unveiled plans to invest $1bn in the US and hire about 25,000 people in the US over the next four years. The news came in the same year the company announced thousands of layoffs. When Lockheed Martin met with Trump in January, after the president-elect publicly criticized the F-35 fighter jet program for being too expensive, the defence contractor announced the creation of 1,800 jobs. The contractor had previously said it would hire more than 1,000 more workers as production of the F-35 ramped up. Similarly, Trump claimed a victory at a Carrier plant in Indiana after offering the company $7m in tax breaks in order to save 1,100 jobs at a time when the company was moving even more jobs to Mexico. “There is a pattern now where he takes credit for corporations allegedly changing decisions to move production offshore or investing here,” Marshall said. “These are symbolic events – kabuki theater – to show a person delivering on his promise to fight for American workers. It makes Trump voters think he’s delivering on his promises.” Stanford economics professor Nicholas Bloom said that there is no evidence that manufacturing is returning to the US. “Manufacturing employment was decimated by the great recession with 6 million jobs shredded between 2000 and 2010. Since then about 1 million have come back in a so-so recovery that is now flatlining,” he said. The “PR announcements” are part of the normal ebb and flow of jobs, Bloom explained. Every year, according to census data, around one million manufacturing jobs are created as another million are destroyed. “A bigger long-run issue is the rise of the robots – manufacturing jobs around the world including China are being replaced by robots,” Bloom said. “So Trump trying to stop the inevitable march of technology is his turn at being King Canute – the English king that thought he could command the sea to stop.” This article was updated to note that construction of the Arizona factory announced in 2011 was halted in 2014 due to a slump in PC sales."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2017/feb/19/night-trains-andrew-martin-review-rise-and-fall-of-the-sleeper","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-19T08:00:03Z","webTitle":"Night Trains: The Rise and Fall of the Sleeper review – we can still dream","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/feb/19/night-trains-andrew-martin-review-rise-and-fall-of-the-sleeper","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2017/feb/19/night-trains-andrew-martin-review-rise-and-fall-of-the-sleeper","fields":{"headline":"Night Trains: The Rise and Fall of the Sleeper review – we can still dream","bodyText":"As anguished Southern commuters will testify, the golden age of rail travel has long gone.

On Wednesday, amid Brexit votes and rumours of a Labour leadership challenge, the British government quietly announced it was dropping its commitment to child refugees under the Dubs amendment. Shortly afterwards, a despairing senior figure texted friends a popular clip from the Mitchell and Webb TV series. Two SS officers, festooned with the grim regalia of death’s heads across their caps, scarves and drinking goblets, look at each other and slowly query: are we the baddies? The joke, of course, is about the power of denial. The death of the Dubs amendment is by no means the only touch of Trumpism among the Tories that has the more liberal in their ranks worried. But it mirrors a global tendency to let fear and intolerance shape policy: policy that has a sharp effect on the lives of the most vulnerable. With regard to Trump himself, the British prime minister’s position on the diplomatic stage is unenviable. Downing Street is right to point out that there is little an ally can do – and what a weak ally this Britain has become – to rein in Trump, without putting British citizens further at risk. But there is a difference between confronting a US president with his fingers on the nukes, and confronting his fellow travellers here at home. There are plenty in the British Conservative movement who can smell a bad odour creeping into the house – call it fascism, call it populism – but, like good dinner party guests, aren’t quite sure how to point it out. The government’s confused, contradictory noises about the US president’s toxic travel restrictions led to a series of frantic telephone calls around junior ministers demanding a response while Theresa May was in Turkey. (“None of us slept that weekend,” says one.) But few are speaking out. Some are holding their fire to focus on Brexit battles, others fear career consequences should they add to the pressure on the prime minister. Tory civil liberties movements, so restrained by distrust of the mob and the bandwagon, have only a shallow history to draw on. As May flew back from Washington and Turkey, a group of liberal parliamentary candidates attempted to organise a gentle public letter requesting she do more to denounce Trump’s new anti-Muslim travel ban. The letter never surfaced, due in part to fragmented organising structures, and in part to the explicit promise of Downing Street’s displeasure. Yet more Conservative condemnation of Trump could be the best thing to happen to May. The prime minister, a naturally cautious politician, is well aware that the public mood is still susceptible to the teeny-Trump act offered by Nigel Farage. We all know she once warned the Conservatives against becoming “the nasty party”; what she knows now is that large segments of the British population are rapidly making us the nasty nation. Shaping this landscape is a network of Conservative British newspapers and thinkers whose fixation on the Great British Brexit has inspired a Faustian determination to defend even Trump’s worst excesses. Threaten a judge? All part of providence’s great plan for a new Anglo-American free trade alliance. Forget that awkward “America First” business. No wonder the prime minister has so little room to manoeuvre. The silence of liberal Tory ministers, writers and editors has left her with little political cover to confront the headwinds of Breitbart UK. This is shameful. It is also a strategic disaster for Conservatism as a long-term movement in Great Britain. Not just because this fortnight’s spinelessness has undermined years of effort by the Conservative party to attract BAME and Muslim talent among its candidates. How May behaves in the current global crisis will define the Conservative party’s reputation for generations. The electorate may be ambivalent today about closing the door to refugees, but populations have a remarkable capacity for forgetting their own complicity in moral crimes – and for holding politicians to account with perfect moral hindsight. It was into this political gap that John Bercow, a man who never misses an opportunity, leapt on Monday. Those in his party who despise the man should be asking themselves why they’d failed to claim such politically fertile ground first. It’s not a good look when the only senior Tory in the Commons to denounce Trump’s Muslim ban is the one whose job should prohibit him from doing so. Meanwhile, in recent weeks marches condemning Trumpism have been organised, respectively, by women’s movements, the Guardian’s Owen Jones, and the SWP. Measured on the bizarre womb-fixated axis of US politics, the organisers of the Women’s March on Washington limited itself to the left by refusing to work with anti-abortion groups. The London march was more welcoming, but female Conservative MPs stayed away, leaving Yvette Cooper and Sadiq Khan to take the megaphones. The Conservative movement will live to regret letting Jones, Cooper and Lucas become the faces of Britain’s moral conscience. True, Tories have always had an aversion to the politics of protest. Crowds are smelly, noisy, messy – it’s all a bit French revolution. But the flamboyant visual signalling of neo-fascist politicians such as Trump requires an equally visual response. Those who oppose Trump go far beyond the “anarchists, thugs and paid protesters” the president described on Twitter. Trump’s obsession with “ratings” is not an idiosyncratic bug of his populism, it’s a feature. Moderates might not like to measure political power by the energy of rallies and crowds, but those are the rules that Russia’s Vladimir Putin, Turkey’s Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and Hungary’s Viktor Orbán play by also. If Conservatives are serious about joining the international opposition, they will need to strap on backpacks and hold their noses. Conservatives, particularly liberal Conservatives, have spent years telling lefties that they’re nice people. “Of course we care about the poor – we just think welfare dependency is what really hurts.” “No, we’re not racist – but we need to confront the conservatism of British Muslim communities.” “We strongly oppose military abuses – but they deserve more credit for keeping us safe.” These arguments still hold, and these political debates still matter. But if British Conservatives fail to denounce the toxicity of Trumpism – if they shrivel under the scrutiny of this moment in moral history – then they will deserve every name the left has ever flung at them."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"sport/2017/feb/09/bernhard-langer-donald-trump-golf-voter-fraud","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-09T20:26:40Z","webTitle":"Bernhard Langer: Trump apologized to me over voter fraud story","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/feb/09/bernhard-langer-donald-trump-golf-voter-fraud","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/feb/09/bernhard-langer-donald-trump-golf-voter-fraud","fields":{"headline":"Bernhard Langer: Trump apologized to me over voter fraud story","bodyText":"Bernhard Langer, the two-time Masters champion, has said that Donald Trump called him to apologize for any misunderstanding after the golfer was caught up in one of the president’s confusing tales about alleged voter fraud. The 59-year-old Langer, who was born in West Germany and now lives in Florida, said the president called him personally and “he apologized if there was anything that hurt me”. Langer said he and the president were on “good terms”. Last month, the New York Times reported on what they called a “troubled tale” featuring Trump, Langer and an unverified anecdote about voter fraud. According to the Times, Trump, during a reception at the White House, had told a curious story to illustrate what he believed to be unchecked voter fraud in November’s election. Langer, unwittingly, was caught up in it. Trump has long complained that millions of people voted illegally in November, and said that “the very famous golfer Bernhard Langer” was in line to vote in Florida on election day, but was turned away – while others “who did not look as if they should be allowed to vote” were able to cast their ballots. As the Times put it, “the anecdote was greeted with silence, and Mr Trump was prodded to change the subject.” The trouble with the story was that Langer was never able to vote in the first place. Langer is a German citizen with permanent US residence who is, by law, not eligible to vote. “He is a citizen of Germany,” Langer’s daughter Christina said. “He is not a friend of President Trump’s, and I don’t know why he would talk about him.” Three witnesses insisted Langer was the protagonist in Trump’s story, but a White House official later claimed Trump had been telling an off-the-cuff anecdote relayed to Langer by one of Langer’s friends. It was all rather complex, and on Thursday, during a press conference for a PGA champions tour event, Langer attempted to clear up any confusion. He said by the time the story reached the White House, details had gotten fuzzy. Langer said: “We talked on the phone. [Trump] was very clear. If there was any whatever, anything that hurt me, he apologized. And I apologized, too, for some of the quotes that were incorrect, and we’re on good terms. “It was fun talking to him briefly, and I thought that’s a great gesture from him, because he’s got a lot of other things to be concerned about, not just, you know, this golfer Bernhard Langer. He’s got far more important things to do. But for him to take the time, talk to me for a brief while and clear things up is pretty amazing.” Langer tried to explain how Trump’s version of events had come to be. He said: “I didn’t say anything to the president. We never talked. I told a story to a friend and the friend told a story to another friend and another friend and another friend. Somewhere down the line six people later somebody knew somebody at the White House and that’s how it went, OK? “It’s kind of weird, because you’re being talked about without being talked to. Then you read the story and it’s not like it’s a fact, it’s like, oh, I heard this from so-and-so, and I have a source that told me this, and I have a friend that told me that.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"news/2017/feb/09/corrections-and-clarifications","type":"article","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-09T20:59:33Z","webTitle":"Corrections and clarifications","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2017/feb/09/corrections-and-clarifications","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/2017/feb/09/corrections-and-clarifications","fields":{"headline":"Corrections and clarifications","bodyText":"• A report on page 3 in Thursday’s paper about the opening day of a case at the high court involving Nick and Christian Candy said incorrectly that they attended the hearing accompanied by bodyguards. • In a subheading on an article about Tara Palmer-Tomkinson, who died on Wednesday (‘I would love to say I have no regrets … but I do’, 9 February, page 5), we referred incorrectly to a “cancer diagnosis”.

Figures obtained by a freedom of information (FoI) request show police are disproportionately targeting people of black or mixed white and black ethnicity with the electric stun guns, raising fresh concerns of racism in the force. Between January 2014 and September 2016, 1,530 of a total of 3,815 cases – 40.1% – where police drew, aimed or fired Tasers involved people of black or mixed white and black ethnicities. According to the 2011 census, people from those groups comprise 15.6% of London’s population. The figures, which come before the expected rollout of a new, more powerful model of Taser gun, also reveal that overall Taser use by the Metropolitan police increased in 2015 and was due for another increase in 2016, based on figures for the first nine months of the year. Lee Jasper, a race relations activist who was director of policing and equalities for the former London mayor Ken Livingstone, said the latest figures showed that the police systematically targeted black people. “Black people are disproportionately charged for offences; we are disproportionately refused bail; we are disproportionately found guilty and disproportionately sentenced,” he said. “We have got massive disproportionality right throughout the system, of which Tasering is just one aspect. “The working culture of the Met police service is one that deems black people to be mad, bad or criminal. The mayor of London needs to take urgent action to redress the resurgence of institutional racism within the MPS that is driving this disproportionately.” The Met’s figures include all the times that officers drew, aimed or fired Tasers while on duty, although the weapons were only discharged in 13% of cases. They correspond with a FoI request by the BBC from 2015, showing that across England black people were three times more likely to be Tasered than white people. Data collected by the mayor of London’s office shows that people of black or mixed race ethnicity have the least confidence in the police out of all Londoners. Diane Abbott, Labour’s shadow home secretary, said the use of Tasers aggravated tensions between police and the public. “There is something inherently wrong with how Tasers are being used, and there are no assurances that their use does not disproportionately impact BME communities,” she said. “Tasers are not some sort of panacea and there have been too many incidents where Tasers have led to unnecessary deaths. “Amber Rudd’s decision to provide this potentially lethal instrument to any police officer who wants one will only add to historic tensions between communities and the police.” Enfield had a higher than average proportion of black people involved in Taser incidents. Tasers were used against black people 55 out of 131 times in the period covered by the FoI. The area’s MP, Kate Osamor, called the findings “deeply alarming”. “When contrasted with the ethnic makeup of the borough, these figures clearly show non-whites being disproportionately affected,” she said. “This data reflects a wider perception of discrimination that is felt by the black community. Relations between police and the black community have been further strained owing to the high number of stop and searches, harassment cases and deaths in custody. These incidents only seek to further weaken the relationship between law enforcement and those they purport to protect.” The Met defended its policies for Taser use, insisting that “the ethnicity of the person is completely irrelevant” when officers consider whether to use force. “Tasers are carried by specially trained Metropolitan police officers and are used when the safety of the public or the officer is at risk,” a Met spokesman said. “The Metropolitan police service engages with communities regarding use of force by its officers and specifically regarding the carriage and use of Taser. The current level of deployment is deemed to be appropriate to the threat and risk faced by officers, doing their duty to protect Londoners. “Officers know that any use of force – which includes the use of Taser – must be entirely justified and that they may be asked to account for their actions.” There is growing evidence that black people are treated differently in various stages of the criminal justice system. Early findings from an ongoing investigation by David Lammy, the Labour MP for Tottenham, show that for every 100 white women handed custodial sentences at crown courts for drug offences, 227 black women are imprisoned. For every 100 white men jailed, 141 black men receive prison time. “These emerging findings raise difficult questions about whether ethnic minority communities are getting a fair deal in our justice system,” Lammy said at the time. Police use of Tasers drew attention last August after the death of Dalian Atkinson, a former Aston Villa footballer, outside his family’s home. Two West Mercia police officers were put under criminal investigation after Atkinson was Tasered three times and suffered a cardiac arrest. More recently, police in Bristol were investigated by the Independent Police Complaints Commission after Tasering their own race relations adviser. In scenes captured on video, Judah Adunbi, 63, was Tasered outside his home when officers apparently mistook him for a wanted man. Adunbi later said that he had feared for his life, but the chairman of the local police federation branch said officers were “doing what the public expect of them”. The Home Office said: “Taser gives the police an important tactical option when facing potentially physically violent situations, but its use warrants proper accountability and transparency. “That is why the former home secretary commissioned an in-depth review of the publication of use of force data – including Taser – to ensure these powers are being used appropriately.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2017/feb/10/unforgotten-review-a-satisfying-ending-that-lingers-after-the-credits-roll","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-10T07:20:45Z","webTitle":"Unforgotten review: a satisfying ending that lingers after the credits roll","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/feb/10/unforgotten-review-a-satisfying-ending-that-lingers-after-the-credits-roll","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2017/feb/10/unforgotten-review-a-satisfying-ending-that-lingers-after-the-credits-roll","fields":{"headline":"Unforgotten review: a satisfying ending that lingers after the credits roll","bodyText":"So, in the end, Unforgotten (ITV) equals Strangers on a Train, the Patricia Highsmith novel/Hitchcock film – I’ll do your murder if you do mine, so as not to get caught, hopefully. Except there are three of them here, and they are not on a train. Strangers in an Ealing psychiatric unit, then; that’s where Sara, Colin and Marion met and hatched their plan, because these strangers were victims of sexual abuse as children. It ain’t no Ealing comedy, that’s for sure. I hadn’t guessed it, and I had thought about it a lot, since the end of the last episode when DCI Cassie Stuart told DS Sunny Khan she thought she had cracked it. (Just after he had had a crack at her, as it happens). Unforgotten does that – lingers, worrying you, after the end credits roll. I have also enjoyed watching it the old-fashioned way, when it goes out (remember that?) because of the build-up in anticipation as Thursday night approaches, and because of the need to discuss it afterwards, even if the watercooler has been moved from the office to the Twittersphere. Perhaps scheduled TV and event TV can still find a home for more than sport and baking. Some of the details are best not scrutinised too deeply: such as how Colin managed to string up Marion’s abusive dad in Highgate woods and make it look like suicide; or how Sara got Colin’s abusive Scout leader out on his boat, into the Clyde, then over the side. If that’s what she did. But Unforgotten doesn’t go into those details and there is no real need for you to either. As a solution to the murder mystery, it is a convincing and clever one, as it was with the first series, but not too clever-clever, like Sherlock. All those strands come together in a satisfying knot. Also clever is Cassie’s cracking of it – because their alibis were too good, and because they tried too hard to look as if they didn’t know each other. Remember that next time you kill someone: don’t make it too perfect, or your alibi too watertight. And don’t think that, just because you have got away with it for a quarter of a century, Cassie and Sunny won’t come knocking on the door one day. Unforgotten is so much more than a satisfying murder mystery, though. It is such a human show. This one has been a thoughtful and timely examination of how sexual abuse affects children. Of the physical and irreparable mental damage it does, how it changes that person for ever. Of how hard it is to tell someone. Of the shame and guilt they feel, and the issues they may have in their own relationships. Of how they can sometimes recognise each other and are drawn together. Colin’s impassioned speech to Cassie leaves you – and her – reeling and numb. He is a barrister, of course, and it is like a brilliant summing up, a final appeal – except that he is in a pub rather than a courtroom, he is appealing not to the jury but to the copper; and it is his own future that depends on it, not a client’s. Then there is Marion’s to get through, too: more gruesome memories, revelations and details, about her own father, a past that never went away – and never will. Poor Sara, too, off to tell her husband, Hassan. I hope he is all right about her being a murderer. It is not all grimness, though. Well, there is Nicola Walker’s DCI Stuart for one – such a convincing, real creation and performance. And a refreshing change from the current television standard; yes, she has issues, everyone has, but she is not a gloomy misanthrope with a cupboard full of skeletons and secrets and booze. Her relationship with Sanjeev Bhaskar’s DS Sunny Khan is lovely, sturdy enough to survive disagreements or an embarrassing drunken lunge. She is a great boss/daughter/mother, warm and calmly strong, but she will admit it if she is wrong about something. Except, then, she is also magnanimous and wise. And now, case solved, it becomes about why people are sent to prison. As a deterrent, rehabilitation, or punishment? None of which Colin, Sarah and Marion need, so let’s leave it at that shall we; mum’s the word … Again, that is quite a big ask of the viewer. But I’ll take it, because it seems like the right thing to do. And because it’s lovely."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"politics/2017/feb/09/the-roles-of-parliament-and-the-people-in-the-brexit-debate","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-09T19:02:18Z","webTitle":"The roles of parliament and the people in the Brexit debate | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/feb/09/the-roles-of-parliament-and-the-people-in-the-brexit-debate","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/feb/09/the-roles-of-parliament-and-the-people-in-the-brexit-debate","fields":{"headline":"The roles of parliament and the people in the Brexit debate","bodyText":"Gina Miller was of course wrong to get the supreme court involved in Brexit politics (Editorial, 9 February). She should have known that, after the referendum, the people not parliament are sovereign, because parliament’s record of berating voters for making democratic choices that it finds “abhorrent” to implement goes back a long way. In the 1964 general election, Peter Griffiths, a Conservative, defeated his Labour opponent in Smethwick in the West Midlands by placing the issue of immigration at the centre of his campaign. Though Griffiths represented the collective will of his constituents on immigration, race and culture, the British parliament of the day would have none of it. He was constantly rebuked for his election victory. Harold Wilson, the then prime minister, even called him a “parliamentary leper”. The British elite then, as it does now, preferred to believe that only parliament, not the people, had the right to make decisions on sensitive issues such as immigration. By passing the notification of withdrawal bill, MPs have at last admitted that it is the people, not parliament, who are sovereign. Randhir Singh Bains Gants Hill, Essex • I applaud your editorial on MPs failing in their duties. However, I cannot agree with your verdict on the voting conduct of MPs that “it is not they as individuals who have been found wanting. It is parliament”. All MPs are individuals. They were elected to act in the best interests of their constituents and of the country. Most chose to vote against their better judgment and to support a move that they are convinced will do their constituents and the country harm. For this they all deserve either to be deselected or to lose their seats at the next election. Nick Chadwick Oxford • Wes Streeting suggests that parliament voting against leaving the EU would have caused a constitutional crisis (We can’t stop Brexit now, 9 February). I would have thought that if a majority of MPs have blatantly voted for something they believe to be wrong, we already have one. Geoff Reid Bradford • The job of the opposition is to oppose policies they consider to be harmful to the UK’s future proposed by the elected government. There is no clearer example than triggering article 50 without amendments. If there’s a constitutional crisis at present, it’s due to the opposition party not fulfilling its proper function. A worthy opposition doesn’t stop opposing after a general election, in which the majority voted for different policies to the losing party. Tim Pollard Purley, Surrey • Lord Hain said on Wednesday that, if necessary, he would vote against the government’s plans to trigger article 50. He added that 48% of the people should not be ignored. Yet back in 1997, he was happy to not care tuppence about the 49.7% like me who had voted against Welsh devolution. No “magnanimity in victory”, whatsoever. I can still see Hain, on the balcony of Cardiff city hall, grinning like the Cheshire Cat, the day after that incredibly close final vote count. The 48% would have been incandescent with rage if they had lost by a tiny “point six of one per cent”. They should grow up and learn to accept defeat with a bit of class. Dai Woosnam Grimsby, Lincolnshire • Thank you for the list of Labour rebels, and one Tory (9 February). For the most part these MPs would claim they rebelled to reflect the views of their constituents who had voted to remain, so it would be helpful to have the matching list of Tory MPs who backed the Brexit bill, despite their constituents having voted to remain. Les Bright Exeter, Devon • Conservative MP John Baron enthused in the House of Commons on Wednesday over the significant fall in the value of the pound since the Brexit vote “leading to a field day for exporters”. Has he no concern for his constituents and the country as a whole, who will be paying more for petrol and diesel fuel, gas and electricity, food and clothing, to say nothing of greatly increased costs for foreign holidays? All this will cause rising inflation, with a consequent fall in the value of take-home pay as a result of pay freezes and other austerity measures. Is this what he means by taking back control? It sounds more like a recipe for social unrest at the very least. Dr James Walsh Rustington, West Sussex • There is absolutely no need for remainers to cave in to the Brexit vote, especially if it leads to the anticipated hard Brexit (Remainers accept the inevitable, 8 February). This vote is not “the will of the people” for many reasons. The will of so many who voted Brexit was for the government to pay attention to the neglected north of England and to Wales and the other areas of the “left behinds”. The will of so many is for doctors and nurses to be trained, houses to be built, the NHS to be funded properly and for employers not to exploit cheap labour. It was not for many more years of austerity, made worse by the expense of Brexit and the damage that will inevitably be done to the prosperity of this country. Stand up to it, remainers. Keep communicating with your MPs. Keep airing your concerns.

The world’s largest cosmetics company said it had not made any decision on the future of the Sussex-based retailer, which has more than 3,000 stores in 66 countries, but had “decided to explore all strategic options” in order “to give it the best opportunities and full ability to continue its development”. The announcement confirms reports earlier this week that L’Oréal had appointed bankers to examine a sale of The Body Shop with some private equity suitors already interested. The French beauty products company bought out the founder, Anita Roddick, in 2006 for £652m in a move that shocked supporters of the ethical firm. Roddick set up the business in Brighton in 1976 to help support her two daughters. Roddick said she had ensured The Body Shop’s own principles were protected under the terms of the takeover, and insisted she could be a “Trojan horse” who could influence the new parent into adopting some of her ethical ideas. However, she died in 2007 and industry watchers believe there is little crossover between her business and L’Oréal’s other brands. Some fans of The Body Shop are put off by its links to a vast corporate cosmetics firm. Last year, The Body Shop tried to reaffirm its ethical principles with 14 targets for 2020, including ensuring all its natural ingredients were traceable and sustainably sourced, compared with just under half today, and that 70% of its packaging did not come from fossil fuels, compared with 30% today. But the group now faces more competition than when it started out, from more upmarket ethical brands such as Dr Hauschka and Chantecaille, as well as the British rivals Lush and Neal’s Yard. L’Oréal, which owns a plethora of international brands including Garnier and Maybelline, reported on Thursday that The Body Shop’s operating profit had dived 38% to €33.8m in the year to 31 December 2016. Sales sank nearly 5% to €920.8m. The pace of decline stepped up in the final and most important quarter of the year – sliding by 6.3% in total. Reporting its annual results on Thursday afternoon, L’Oréal said The Body Shop sales at established shops had risen 0.6% over the year as it enjoyed good momentum in Europe, especially the UK. Online sales also rose. However, sluggish sales in Saudia Arabia and Hong Kong have affected the business’s overall performance."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"money/2017/feb/13/workers-feelings-of-powerlessness-fuelling-anger-says-jobs-tsar","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-13T17:14:03Z","webTitle":"Workers' feelings of powerlessness fuelling anger, says jobs tsar","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2017/feb/13/workers-feelings-of-powerlessness-fuelling-anger-says-jobs-tsar","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2017/feb/13/workers-feelings-of-powerlessness-fuelling-anger-says-jobs-tsar","fields":{"headline":"Workers' feelings of powerlessness fuelling anger, says jobs tsar","bodyText":"A feeling among workers that they lack control or a voice in the workplace is fuelling “misery and anger in British society”, the chair of a Downing Street review of modern employment has said. Matthew Taylor has called for the improvement of the quality of work in the UK to become a new “national goal” so that people “feel like citizens at work and not servants or slaves”. Taylor, a former adviser to Tony Blair, was appointed by Theresa May amid concern that growth in the so-called gig economy and temporary contracts were making work more precarious for millions. Anger at the declining quality of jobs has also been identified as a driving force behind the rise of the populist vote across Europe and the US. “The evidence is that a society where people feel they have no control at work and don’t know what is going on [is] more likely to feel miserable and angry,” Taylor told the Guardian in an interview before a tour of 12 UK towns and cities to gather evidence from workers and employers about the realities of modern work. “The fact that too many workers feel that they have no control and no voice contributes to the quantum of misery and anger in British society.” May appointed Taylor after a series of revelations about the reality of low-paid work and after she promised on her first day as prime minister to govern for the “just managing”, a pledge she repeated standing alongside Donald Trump in the White House last month. Last week the TUC reported that the number of people without guaranteed hours or baseline employment rights had risen by more than 660,000 (27%) over the past five years. Taylor’s review is expected to propose significant reforms to the regulation of fast-changing working practices in the UK, including changes to the balance of power between hiring companies and workforces, particularly those who are self-employed or work for agencies. Margot James, the employment minister, said Taylor’s review was “hugely important in helping us understand whether employment rights need to change to keep up with the various new ways people can work”. In October the taxi-app company Uber lost a landmark employment tribunal case brought by drivers who demanded to be treated as workers with rights to the minimum wage and sick pay rather than as self-employed contractors. Hermes, the courier company, is involved in an investigation by HM Revenue and Customs into whether its 10,000 delivery drivers are genuinely self-employed, after several claimed they were earning less than the minimum wage while working six or seven days a week. Last year Sports Direct year admitted underpaying temporary agency staff working in conditions likened by MPs to “a Victorian workhouse” at its Shirebrook warehouse. Among the changes Taylor said he was considering proposing were: • Allowing workers to check directly with the government whether attempts by companies to class them as self-employed are legitimate. He is considering suggesting it should become the hiring company’s responsibility to prove a worker is genuinely self-employed. • Making it mandatory for temporary workers to receive written terms and conditions within a week of starting jobs to ensure they do not miss out on rights including paid holiday, something many migrant workers lose out on. • Giving agency workers on variable hours the right to request a permanent contract after a certain period. • Making it mandatory for companies to publicly report how many temps they use. “Flexibility is a positive choice for most workers,” Taylor said. “But there is clearly growth in forms of work, particularly agency work and zero hours, where the power relationship is not balanced, people’s position can feel precarious and it can be harder for them to exercise their rights.” For example, he said: “Some agencies are deliberately not telling workers, particularly migrant workers, that they have holiday pay entitlements.” He added: “For the last 20 to 30 years we as a country have asserted very successfully that what matters is the quantity of work. It is great that we are very good at generating jobs. But although ministers make speeches and reports come out, I don’t think we have ever, as a country, said it is not just the quantity of work but the quality that matters.” Taylor defined “quality” work as employment that was fair, decent and provided scope for fulfilment and development. “There is still in society a view that … if you have a job it doesn’t matter if you are miserable and have no opportunities,” he said. “I understand the emphasis on jobs, but I think the dignity of human beings and the strength of our society lead us to care about how people live their lives 35 to 40 hours a week and they do feel like citizens at work and not servants or slaves.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/feb/12/good-journalists-face-down-fake-newsmongers-donald-trump-sean-spicer","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-12T06:59:00Z","webTitle":"How good journalists can face down fake newsmongers | John Naughton","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/feb/12/good-journalists-face-down-fake-newsmongers-donald-trump-sean-spicer","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/feb/12/good-journalists-face-down-fake-newsmongers-donald-trump-sean-spicer","fields":{"headline":"How good journalists can face down fake newsmongers","bodyText":"Let us pause for a moment to mourn the passing of Hans Rosling , one of the most gifted and humane educators of our age. He was professor of global health at Sweden’s prestigious Karolinska Institute and became famous when he gave a spectacular TED talk in 2006 using global data to show how the world had changed during the 20th century. Rosling specialised in devising striking ways of visualising statistical data and in using computers to provide animations showing, for example, how child mortality, family income and so on changed over time. But what probably clinched his fame was the way he talked his audience through the evolving worldview with a manic energy reminiscent of Newsnight’s Peter Snow and his general election night “swingometer”. Rosling’s untimely death (from cancer) seems particularly poignant at this moment in our history, because he was such a fervent believer in the idea that we could find illumination, if not salvation, in facts. In that respect, he reminded me of the late David MacKay, another gentle polymath, who was for a time the chief scientific adviser to the Department of Energy and Climate Change. At a lecture following the publication of his book, Sustainable Energy – Without the Hot Air, he was assailed by an angry environmentalist who asked him why he was “so hostile” to wind power. MacKay smiled sweetly and replied: “I’m not hostile to anything. I’m just in favour of arithmetic.” I thought about Rosling and MacKay a lot last week as the “fake news” crisis deepened. It turns out that the public sphere may be even more poisoned than we had supposed. We now have to reckon with artfully faked opinion as well. Among the many sites on the web that relay high-level commentary on foreign affairs is the Center for Global Strategic Monitoring. The website describes it as “a nonprofit and nonpartisan research and analysis institution dedicated to providing… a viable informed resource to the public, the media and politicians. It aims to play a positive role and offer proper tools for understanding and decision-making that define the relationship between the United States and the world.” In order to carry out this laudable mission, the site lists an impressive stable of “experts”. Among them is one Brian Mefford, described as “a nonresident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council’s Eurasia Center”. But guess what? Mr Mefford says that he had never agreed to serve as one of the Center’s “experts” and his emails asking for his name to be removed have gone unanswered. The site’s modus operandi, he claims, involves republishing analysis from respectable research institutions, mixing them with “news” from Russian-controlled sources without attribution and possibly even posting some fake articles under the names of distinguished scholars. Why are the massed forces of responsible journalism apparently so impotent in the face of this chicanery? If journalism has indeed become the “enemy” for the White House, then how should it fight back? The first thing, wrote Adam Tinworth, an insightful blogger, last week, is to recognise the real nature of the war in which journalists are now involved. Tinworth borrows a concept from military strategy – asymmetric warfare – to explain why mainstream media are failing to hold Trump &amp; co to account. What it comes down to, he says, is “narratives versus facts”. The alt-right crowd are good at narratives and very skilled at packaging them in images and video rather than text. Journalists, in contrast, are addicted to text and not very good at narrative. But narratives are what the punters crave – and what they “share” on social media. In such a climate, therefore, relying on fact-checking is a bit like whistling against a hurricane. If it is to combat this postmodern strategy of poisoning the public sphere to the point where nobody knows what to believe, responsible journalism has to change. It has to become more combative and confrontational. It has to be ruthless in accurately documenting what’s going on, so that Trumpian allegations of “misreporting” never stand up. It has to learn how to package the truth in narratives that people can understand and share, which means relying more on imagery, video and animation. And – most difficult of all – it means that the savagely competitive instincts that usually divide journalists have to be temporarily shelved. So, as Politico’s Jack Shafer has suggested, when Sean Spicer evades a question from one member of the White House press corps, the next questioner should, instead of asking his/her prepared question, demand that the previous question be answered by re-asking it. E pluribus unum and all that."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"media/2017/feb/09/ed-miliband-asks-ofcom-for-inquiry-into-rupert-murdoch-sky-bid","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-10T15:04:18Z","webTitle":"Ed Miliband asks Ofcom for inquiry into Rupert Murdoch Sky bid","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/feb/09/ed-miliband-asks-ofcom-for-inquiry-into-rupert-murdoch-sky-bid","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2017/feb/09/ed-miliband-asks-ofcom-for-inquiry-into-rupert-murdoch-sky-bid","fields":{"headline":"Ed Miliband asks Ofcom for inquiry into Rupert Murdoch Sky bid","bodyText":"The former Labour leader Ed Miliband is leading a campaign for the media regulator Ofcom to launch a full inquiry into Rupert Murdoch’s bid for ownership of the satellite broadcaster Sky. In a letter to Sharon White, the chief executive of Ofcom, Miliband is one of several senior cross-party politicians to demand that the regulator carry out a “fit and proper person” test following 21st Century Fox’s bid for the 61% of Sky it does not already own. Ofcom carried out a fit and proper person test of whether Sky should be allowed to hold a broadcast licence in 2012. Although it cleared the broadcaster, Murdoch’s son James was heavily criticised over his role as chairman of News International when the news of the phone-hacking scandal at the News of the World broke. The letter’s other signatories include Vince Cable, who was the business secretary when the Murdochs launched their first bid for the whole of Sky in 2011, the Conservative peer Lady Warsi, Lady O’Neill, a crossbencher, and Lord Falconer, a Labour peer and barrister. In an interview, Miliband said that a full inquiry was needed given the Murdochs’ bid to increase their Sky shareholding and the fact that James Murdoch was now chief executive of Fox. “We are calling for a new inquiry to deal with the issue of fitness and propriety given the ownership structure,” he said. The letter to Ofcom quotes from the 2012 inquiry’s findings that during his time as chief executive and chairman of the Sun and Times owner News International, James Murdoch’s behaviour was “difficult to comprehend and ill-judged” and “fell short of the responsibility expected of him”. However, the report said that the concerns did not amount to a breach of the fit and proper person test, in part due to the Murdochs only holding a minority stake in Sky. The letter argues that there has been a “material change in circumstances” due to James Murdoch’s increased involvement in Sky – where he is now chairman – and his role as boss of Fox. It also says that criminal convictions for journalists over phone hacking and ongoing civil cases against the parent company of the Sun and the News of the World newspapers are also on their own enough to justify a repeat of the Ofcom investigation. The letter concludes by describing whether or not there is another inquiry as “a defining test of Ofcom and its capacity and strength as a regulator”. Ofcom can chose when to carry out a fit and proper person test. It would be separate to an assessment of the proposed deal’s impact on media plurality, which could be triggered by the culture secretary, Karen Bradley. An Ofcom spokesman confirmed the letter had been received and said it would be “considered carefully”. Fox has been an investor in Sky for nearly 25 years and the proposed takeover would not affect the requirements to adhere to Ofcom’s rules. When it announced the deal, Fox said it would keep broadcasting Sky News and was committed to “maintaining its excellent record of compliance with the Ofcom Broadcasting Code”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2017/feb/09/a-lesson-in-blurring-fact-and-fiction","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-09T19:01:17Z","webTitle":"A lesson in blurring fact and fiction | Brief letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/feb/09/a-lesson-in-blurring-fact-and-fiction","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2017/feb/09/a-lesson-in-blurring-fact-and-fiction","fields":{"headline":"A lesson in blurring fact and fiction","bodyText":"Denise Brewster’s supreme court victory (Report, 9 February) is one further step towards a more equal society.

In its unanimous ruling, the three judges on the ninth circuit court of appeals upheld the temporary restraining order, which was issued by Judge James Robart, a federal district court judge in Washington state, and has blocked the enforcement of many key parts of the executive order. The court found that “the government has not shown a stay is necessary to avoid irreparable injury.” In particular, its ruling noted “the government has pointed to no evidence that any alien from any of the countries named in the order has perpetrated a terrorist attack in the United States. Rather than present evidence to explain the need for the executive order, the government has taken the position that we must not review its decision at all.” Almost immediately, Trump tweeted his response: “SEE YOU IN COURT, THE SECURITY OF OUR NATION IS AT STAKE!” Speaking to reporters in the West Wing shortly after that the ruling, he characterized it as “a political decision” and said that “the safety of the nation is at stake”. Trump added that he “looks forward to seeing them in court”. Thursday’s ruling does not end all litigation over the executive order, which sparked international outcry when it was first issued. Instead, it simply means that its provisions – which include a 90-day travel ban from seven Muslim-majority countries, a 120-day freeze on admission of any refugees into the United States, as well as indefinite halt to admitting any refugees from Syria – cannot be enforced again as the legal battle moves forward. There are roughly 20 lawsuits against the travel ban currently making their way through courts in various states. On Robart’s injunction, the federal government can now ask the supreme court to review the ninth circuit’s ruling. But the unanimous ruling suggests that the Trump administration will face an uphill battle. The supreme court could also sidestep controversy and defer an appeal, leaving the ruling in place as the case works its way through other courts. The appeals court decision follows a hearing on Tuesday night, at which lawyers for the state of Washington, which was challenging the ban, argued with attorneys for the justice department. August Flentje, the lawyer for the federal government, argued that the ban was “plainly constitutional”, noting that Congress has granted the president the authority to suspend certain classes of immigrants. However, he additionally argued that the decision should not be subject to judicial review, noting that “judicial second-guessing of the president’s national security determination in itself imposes substantial harm on the federal government and the nation at large”. The court rejected much of this argument in its ruling. The panel wrote “although courts owe considerable deference to the president’s policy determinations with respect to immigration and national security, it is beyond question that the federal judiciary retains the authority to adjudicate constitutional challenges to executive action”. In contrast, Noah Purcell, the solicitor general of Washington state who was arguing to keep the injunction, cited Trump’s campaign trail promise to impose “a total and complete shutdown on Muslims entering the United States” and raised the specter of religious discrimination. The court, though, did not base its decision on this argument, although it noted “we reserve consideration of these claims until the merits of this appeal have been fully briefed”. Instead, it found that the government had not shown it was sufficiently likely to succeed in a court hearing on the question of whether the executive order restricted without due process an affected individual’s ability to travel. The judges’ ruling was also scathing in parts, essentially calling into question the government’s credibility. On the confusion over the rights of lawful permanent residents caught up in the travel ban, the ruling notes: “At this point, however, we cannot rely upon the government’s contention that the executive order no longer applies to lawful permanent residents.” Then later continues: “Moreover, in light of the government’s shifting interpretations of the executive order, we cannot say that the current interpretation by White House counsel, even if authoritative and binding, will persist past the immediate stage of these proceedings.” Also in the opinion, the judges wrote that “it is well established that evidence of purpose” from a case’s context can be used in court – meaning that the states can cite Trump’s claims and tweets, for instance about his preference for Christians and call for a “complete and total shutdown of Muslims”, as admissible evidence. Trump’s long history of controversial statements, the court suggested, can therefore be used as legal weapons against him. The decision immediately set off a political firestorm on both sides of the aisle. Donna Brazile, the chair of the Democratic National Committee, celebrated the decision in a statement. “This is a massive blow to the White House. The court upheld that we do not discriminate based on religion. That is what terrorists do, and what terrorists want us to do.” The Washington state attorney general, Bob Ferguson, agreed: “The bottom line this is a complete victory for the state of Washington.” “We are a nation of laws as I have said … from day one, those laws apply to everyone in our country and that includes the president of the United States.” In contrast, Senator Tom Cotton, a Republican from Arkansas, railed against the ruling. “No foreigner has a constitutional right to enter the United States and courts ought not second-guess sensitive national-security decisions of the president. This misguided ruling is from the ninth circuit, the most notoriously left-wing court in America and the most reversed court at the supreme court,” said Cotton in a statement. Senior White House aide Kellyanne Conway, speaking on Fox News, expressed confidence that the ruling simply represented a bump in the road. “It is an interim ruling and we are fully confident that when we get our day in court and argue it on the merits we will prevail.” Purcell said on Thursday: “The judges did their jobs carefully and well and we appreciate their work.” He added: “We are not usually in the limelight light like this, and we’re not used to it.” Oliver Laughland, Claire Phipps, Julia Carrie Wong and Alan Yuhas contributed reporting."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2017/feb/16/wagging-tongues-of-ferns-and-salty-yarns","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-16T05:30:32Z","webTitle":"Wagging tongues of ferns and salty yarns","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/feb/16/wagging-tongues-of-ferns-and-salty-yarns","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/feb/16/wagging-tongues-of-ferns-and-salty-yarns","fields":{"headline":"Wagging tongues of ferns and salty yarns","bodyText":"This section of moist, shady, wooded bank above the footpath, extending for perhaps 150 metres, is covered with the largest concentration of hart’s tongue ferns I have ever seen. This fern, Phyllitis scolopendrium, dominates because it thrives in calcareous woodland soils over limestone and the conditions here are perfect. This morning, as I approached, hundreds of long, undulating, emerald-green tongues wagged in the breeze: if these plants needed a collective name “a gossip” of hart’s tongues would do nicely. I turned over a frond and saw the long, slit-like rows of spores, then searched under a rocky overhang for signs of germination. There were scores of juvenile ferns, their tiny tongues poking from the crevices where wind eddy currents had wafted spores into contact with the wet rock. But there was also something very unusual going on here. The surrounding mosses, clinging to the rock, were becoming fossilised. Tufa, that strange, porous, sedimentary rock produced when trickling lime-laden water evaporates and deposits its salts, was being formed. I pulled off a small grey piece and rubbed it between my fingers; it was gritty and as it crumbled I could see, under a hand lens, fragments of moss stems and foliage. Water was being trapped by capillary action between the minute overlapping moss leaves long enough for it to deposit its load of calcium salts, enclosing the plants in a stone straitjacket. New moss shoots were barely managing to grow from the concretion. This process will be familiar to anyone who has visited the petrifying well at Mother Shipton’s well near Knaresborough, in Yorkshire, and seen everyday objects turned to stone by dripping, lime-laden, water. It might have been going on at a microscopic scale under this rock for decades, a race every spring between seeping water’s stony embrace and the new growth of moss shoots. The new hart’s tongues are immune to the threat because they are shiny and water runs off them quickly before it can precipitate salts. But the intricate, absorptive, structure of these mosses condemns them to a perpetual struggle to escape the stony fate that continually overwhelms their lower stems.

Fixated by events in Washington, they rarely think about those just across the Channel. Every Whitehall spad will know the name of the mayor of New York; perhaps only one in a hundred could identify the mayor of Paris. It would be naive to think this longstanding complacency was about to change, least of all in the solipsistic politics of a Brexit Britain in which fewer people than ever learn modern languages. Nevertheless, strange but true, as Britain turns its back on the EU, there seems to be a glimmer of awareness that politics in the republic in 2017 are not only at an interesting stage but might even have some direct bearing on the tortuous process to which MPs regrettably gave their assent when they voted for the triggering of article 50 this week. In three months’ time, France will have a new president in place of François Hollande. The prospect that this president might be Marine Le Pen of Front National explains most of the uptick of awareness about France. Yet if three opinion polls published this week are correct, it will not be Le Pen. Instead, it will be ex-banker and former finance minister Emmanuel Macron, an economic and social liberal who speaks impeccable English, knows this country well and is running as an independent centrist. The polls show him defeating Le Pen in a head to head by 63% to 37%. Much can change before the first round of voting on 23 April, and opinion polls are often wrong. Britain’s 2015 general election, the Brexit referendum, the second Spanish general election of 2016, the US presidential election and the Italian constitutional referendum all produced results to the right of what polls had signalled. The same thing may happen in France. Nevertheless, the election of a liberal centrist, committed to a less austerity-driven eurozone and refusing to reimpose internal borders with EU partners, would be an event of continent-wide significance. Macron’s desire to reform the EU to make it work better may seem “Anglo-Saxon” in some ways. For a Britain embarked on Brexit, however, it could be a very uncomfortable development, increasing the chances of a hard future relationship with Europe. France’s two-stage presidential election process favours Macron’s En Marche! (note the initials) movement. In the first round, voters choose from a full spectrum of candidates; the second round is a runoff between the candidates who finished first and second. As the historian Robert Tombs puts it, in the first round you vote “for the person you want” but in the second you vote “against the person you fear”. This favours whoever gets into the runoff against Le Pen. True, many things have changed since Jacques Chirac gained 82% of the vote in a runoff against Le Pen’s father, Jean-Marie, in 2002: economic stagnation, increased migration and Islamist terrorist attacks among them. Marine Le Pen has also dropped some of her father’s far-right stances: her programme no longer calls for the reintroduction of the death penalty, for instance. Her polling levels reflect these changes. Jean-Marie Le Pen only squeaked into the second round in 2002 with 17% of the vote, profiting from divisions among his rivals. By contrast Marine Le Pen is currently set to top the first round with around 25%. Macron owes his current strong showing to his own audacity and to the stumbles of others. The fact that he is only 39, has never been elected to any political office and has no party machine behind him all speak to his daring. But he would not be on the threshold of the presidency without the assistance of his rivals. François Fillon’s candidacy on the right hangs by a thread because of his wife’s earnings from a political job she seems never to have done. Meanwhile the socialist party has chosen leftwinger Benoît Hamon. Both have been slipping in the polls. Together, these choices have opened up the centre for Macron. French presidential elections often ebb and flow. Macron is now the candidate the others have to break if they are to grab second place behind Le Pen. His rivals will paint him as a creature of the elite. In the face of rumours, this week he denied a gay, extramarital affair. Julian Assange and his Russian providers claim to have something up their sleeves. A Macron victory would be a rebuff to those who believe Brexit and Trump will have a domino effect. It would confound those who want the EU to unravel (though that may happen anyway). It would be a rejection of the Front National and of the established parties of France’s fifth republic. For the Gaullist right, it would be a rejection of the republican grandeur bequeathed by De Gaulle. For the left, it would be a rejection of state dirigisme in the labour market. Whether there would be a durable national embrace of what Macron stands for is far from certain. In large part that is because Macron has not said what he stands for. It is one thing to campaign by brilliant marketing, and quite another to govern by it. And a man who becomes president with the first-round support of barely a quarter of the electorate will always have relatively little room for manoeuvre. The ability of France’s public sector unions to prevent reform remains formidable. For British Europhiles, a Macron election would be bittersweet. Here is a reform-minded French politician with a view of the EU and of European security that Britain could support and work with if only Brexit were not happening. Instead here are we, backs turned to Europe, minds turned inward, our politics and country fragmenting, naive supplicants at the court of the worst US president in modern times."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"stage/2017/feb/12/vault-festival-review-london-great-gatsby-mars-actually-crew-for-calais","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-12T07:50:01Z","webTitle":"Vault festival review – light in the tunnels","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/feb/12/vault-festival-review-london-great-gatsby-mars-actually-crew-for-calais","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2017/feb/12/vault-festival-review-london-great-gatsby-mars-actually-crew-for-calais","fields":{"headline":"Vault festival review – light in the tunnels","bodyText":"Since 2011, the traditionally torpid theatrical weeks at the start of the year have been shaken up by the Vault festival.

Plays, circus, comedy. Hungary Hot Potato at the pop-up Balkano Kitchen. Spangled spaces and the smell of damp. Vault takes you back to the roots of festival, to the idea of visiting not for one show but for the nonstop parade of possibilities. You may go to be immersed in The Great Gatsby, staged as a jazz-age party by the Guild of Misrule, but bump into Superbolt Theatre’s Mars Actually. Or a stimulating swath of work staged by Crew for Calais, the charity set up by people in the theatre industry to help refugees. Borderland and Calais (last performance today) draw on the Twitter streams that documented the demolition of the camps as it happened. The small-scale musical show Still Waiting urged action but also offered a riposte to those who look sceptically on such initiatives. A self-parodic song, Humblebrag, riffs on boasts about visiting and failing to visit the Calais camp. These underground nooks and alleys lend themselves to tales of escape. Matt Jones’s multilingual A Colder Water Than Here imagines the experience of people on the move. Five characters, their hands stained from fruit-picking, remember the assaults of people-smugglers and look back on escaping over water, the punch of the cold driving the air from their lungs.

I wanted to cheer but didn’t. Does this sort of advertising work? Has it been tested? I have always thought the government and police have a blind spot when it comes to rightwing ideologues and their followers. However, having spent years as an environmental activist and Green party politician – part of a movement that is still on the receiving end of repressive police tactics – I’ve learned the value of being clear about definitions. As a democrat and advocate of civil rights for all, I don’t want people being locked up for having vile opinions, or any kind of thought crime. The architects behind Donald Trump’s Muslim ban, Steve Bannon and the rightwing voices mobilised by Breitbart News, share common ground with many on Europe’s new right. They are nationalists and have risen to power by stoking fears and targeting scapegoats. For all the similarities with the 1930s, that doesn’t automatically make them fascists. Working out the distinction, if any, between the new breed of rightwing populists and neo-fascists has become important to me. So here are three rules to guide the work of the security services: first, there is nothing wrong with being anti-establishment. Like Trump and Nigel Farage, I regard myself as anti-establishment (but without the gold doors, obviously). I also mistrust big government, but I tend to mistrust big capitalist companies even more. People having a go at McDonald’s, fracking companies or golf courses are not a danger to society – people using division and fuelling hate crime are. Second, thought crime is not a crime, no matter what the prime minister says about “British values”. Extreme views are legally acceptable in a democracy as long as they don’t lead to people getting hurt. Extreme behaviour is less acceptable, but dealt with by existing laws just like any other crime. Many greens advocate the dismantling of the “police state” and corporate capitalism, but they want people to vote for these changes. Sometimes greens block a road in protest at something and get thrown in ditches. Fascists hit people who don’t agree with them. Third, the big difference between environmentalists and the new right is about power and violence. Greens tend to be wary of all powerful leaders and are strong advocates of nonviolence. For fascists, violence is both a means and an end. They use violence or threat to silence opponents and intimidate their way to power. Once in power, they use the levers of the state to suppress dissenting views. While an elected Green, I was put on the Metropolitan police’s domestic extremism database, along with Green MP Caroline Lucas, Green councillors and several journalists. When left to themselves, the police instinctively keep their definitions loose, cast their net wide and overstep their powers. Even though I was on the Metropolitan Police Authority, and working closely with sections of the police to get extra resources for roads policing and wildlife crime, I was on their watchlist, along with 8,000 others. When I discovered what they were up to, my main reaction was to lament the stupidity of the police for wasting their time and taxpayers’ money. It took me two years of pressure before they redrafted their definition of domestic extremism to restrict it to people involved in serious criminality or terrorism. The exposure of undercover police working for the Special Demonstration Squad (SDS) taught us a lot about police abuses of power. The SDS was set up in response to the anti-Vietnam war protests of 1968 and has rolled on through the decades, spying on CND and anti-roads protesters. Meanwhile the far right has mostly been ignored. The threat was considered low, even after the Admiral Duncan pub bombing killed three people in 1999. It’s tragic that it took the killing of Jo Cox MP to force the authorities to accept how deadly the hatred has become. Now we have a sanitised far right that’s managing to win a few elections in Europe and the biggest election of all in the US. So I want to see the government take these threats to democracy and public safety seriously. But I find it hard to cheer at this work being led by secretive “anti-subversion” units in Whitehall. This work needs clear definition, transparency and accountability. After all, these are some of the British values we seek to defend."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/2017/feb/09/greece-hopes-deal-eu-debt-german-warning-single-currency","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-09T19:53:55Z","webTitle":"Greece hopeful of imminent EU debt  deal     despite German warning","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/feb/09/greece-hopes-deal-eu-debt-german-warning-single-currency","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/feb/09/greece-hopes-deal-eu-debt-german-warning-single-currency","fields":{"headline":"Greece hopeful of imminent EU debt  deal     despite German warning","bodyText":"The Greek government has expressed hope of an imminent deal with its EU creditors, despite a warning from the German finance minister, Wolfgang Schäuble, that the country could cut its debts only by leaving the single currency. Athens is in a familiar stand-off with the German finance ministry as it seeks easier repayment terms on its €330bn (£280bn) debt pile, which the International Monetary Fund has described as unsustainable and explosive. The IMF has so far declined to get involved in the latest Greek rescue effort, a three-year EU bailout worth €86bn set to run until August 2018. The fund says it will only join if Greece gets significant debt relief, although its board is split. Germany and the Netherlands, which both face elections this year, think the IMF’s involvement is crucial for the bailout plan to continue. Tensions – and Greek borrowing costs – have risen in recent weeks, ahead of a meeting of eurozone finance ministers on 20 February, which is widely seen as the last moment to reach agreement before the eurozone election cycle. The Dutch go to the polls in March; French presidential elections follow in April-May and German elections in the autumn. George Katrougalos, Greece’s Europe minister, voiced confidence that a deal was within reach: “I am optimistic that we can have such an agreement before the Eurogroup of 20 February.” He told journalists in Brussels that Europe was not the problem. “If we had just to deal with the Europeans we would have already completed this review in December. All the delay is due to the ambivalence of the IMF to participate or not to participate.” Katrougalos brushed aside comments from Schäuble, who has previously called for Greece to quit the eurozone. “Mr Schäuble is now an isolated voice in Europe, one of the last defenders of austerity,” he said, arguing that the German minister was not supported even in his own country. Schäuble told ARD television on Wednesday that the EU’s Lisbon treaty ruled out a debt reduction for Greece. “For that, Greece would have to leave the monetary union,” he said. His stance has been supported by Germany’s Liberal party, currently in opposition, but the Social Democrats, the junior coalition partner, have voiced concern. Katrougalos, a former MEP who joined the Syriza government following its election in January 2015, said Greece was not asking for a cut in the face value of the debt, but measures to make repayment easier. “We are not asking about haircuts, we are speaking about measures of debt relief,” he said. “If we do not have a bold measure of debt relief, the Greek debt will not be sustainable. But we think we can have an agreement with our European partners on that exactly because it should not be a disputable issue. It is obvious.” The EU has already promised some help to ease the burden of repayments, measures which eurozone officials say put Greece on a manageable path to cut its debts. On Thursday, the head of the eurozone bailout fund insisted that there was no cause for alarm, as he stepped up criticism of the IMF’s gloomy prognosis. “The European Financial Stability Facility and the European stability mechanism, the eurozone’s rescue funds, have disbursed €174bn to Greece,” Klaus Regling, head of the ESM, wrote in the Financial Times. “We would not have lent this amount if we did not think we would get our money back.” He said Greece had some of the lowest debt-servicing costs in Europe, conditions that would remain in place for a long time, and a factor the IMF had overlooked. A spokesman for the fund said it was sticking to its forecast that Greece’s debts could hit 275% of GDP by 2060. “We stand by that [debt sustainability] analysis. Most executive directors are on the record as supporting that too,” he said, hinting at the boardroom split. The Greek government agrees with the IMF’s forecast that it cannot reach a budget surplus of 3.5%, a key demand of EU creditors. “It never happened in the past and it cannot happen with an economy that is very much exhausted by six, seven years of austerity,” Katrougalos said. But Athens disagrees with the fund’s call for further pension reforms. It is also lobbying its EU creditors to allow it to reintroduce collective bargaining. The minimum wage is currently set by the state as part of an earlier bailout agreement. Katrougalos was meeting officials in Brussels, including the European commissioner for economic affairs, Pierre Moscovici, who has been one of Athens’s closest allies in the bailout saga. Asked to explain his grounds for optimism for a February deal – given the history of missed deadlines and midnight brinkmanship – the Greek minister said no country had any interest in prolonging negotiations because of crucial elections. “Nobody has any interest in putting Greece in the midst of the problems of Europe. Europe has enough problems.” But he criticised talk of snap elections in Greece, saying that would force the end of the bailout programme and rule out any new one. “Everybody calling for new elections in Greece is basically calling for a disorderly default.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"stage/2017/feb/12/sex-with-strangers-review-hampstead-laura-eason-emilia-fox-theo-james","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-12T07:55:01Z","webTitle":"Sex With Strangers review – a night to forget","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/feb/12/sex-with-strangers-review-hampstead-laura-eason-emilia-fox-theo-james","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2017/feb/12/sex-with-strangers-review-hampstead-laura-eason-emilia-fox-theo-james","fields":{"headline":"Sex With Strangers review – a night to forget","bodyText":"Laura Eason’s Sex With Strangers was first staged by Steppenwolf in the States eight years ago.

Aid to the Gambia dried up under Jammeh, whose record of human rights violations, along with his habit of pulling out of international institutions and throwing out diplomats, alienated donors. Now, after promises from the new government to defend human rights, protect media freedom and rejoin the international criminal court and the Commonwealth, the EU has become the first to commit major funding to what has become known as “the new Gambia”. After a rollercoaster transition period during which Jammeh accepted electoral defeat before performing a U-turn – he refused to leave State House, and finally conceded only under pressure from a phalanx of African presidents – there will be no respite for the country’s new president. Having beaten the eccentric autocrat despite the odds, largely on a promise of a better life for Gambians, Adama Barrow now faces the challenge of living up to his people’s hopes. The EU has pledged €75m (£64m) in immediate funding and €150m in the longer term to help “make sure that the new Gambian state can deliver as it should … that it can stand up to the high expectations of the population”, said Neven Mimica, the commissioner for international cooperation and development, who met Barrow on Thursday. “There is no time to lose.” The former estate agent-turned-coalition leader told Mimica that his country was “in need of immediate rescue”, particularly emergency budget support. “We have just assumed the task of governing the country after decades of dictatorship and self-imposed isolation,” Barrow said. Jammeh expelled the EU’s charge d’affaires in 2015, giving her 72 hours to leave Banjul, with no explanation. “We had a dictatorship that thrived on bad governance, human rights abuses, bad policy choices, and violation of the rule of law. A dictatorship that cost us our friends. A dictatorship whose conduct deprived us of our development and aid. A dictatorship that was brutal toward its citizens,” said Barrow. “As a new government, what we have inherited is an economy that is virtually bankrupt and in need of immediate rescue. This sad reality was brought about through a mismanagement of our finances.” Donor money is sorely needed in a country whose economy has grown little in recent decades, prompting many Gambians to take the perilous “back way” to Europe – crossing the Mediterranean from Libya to Italy – in search of a livelihood. The Gambia has public debt of more than 100% of annual GDP and youth unemployment of just under 40%. The US is planning to send an assessment team to the country shortly after Barrow’s official inauguration on 18 February. Barrow was sworn in as president in neighbouring Senegal last month, as Jammeh clung to power. After all-night negotiations by regional presidents, who finally succeeded in persuading Jammeh to go, Barrow returned to his country and was greeted by thousands of celebrating supporters. In a final blow, however, Jammeh withdrew more than $11.4m (£9.2m) from the country’s banks in the fortnight before getting on the plane to Equatorial Guinea, according to the interior minister, who said the coffers were “virtually empty”. Despite the cash flow problems, Barrow and his team have ambitious plans. The country’s new foreign minister, Ousainou Darboe, said he wanted to make the Gambia the “human rights capital of Africa”. This would be a dramatic turnaround from life under Jammeh, when journalists, political opposition members and people arrested at peaceful protests, whether they were protesting or not, were thrown in jail, often without trial or on trumped-up charges. Darboe was a political prisoner until his release in December, which drew thousands of people to his modest house in Banjul, flooding in to offer their congratulations. “We already have the institutions that give the Gambia the qualification to be the human rights capital of Africa,” said Darboe. “We have the African Commission on Human and Peoples’ Rights here in Banjul. The only institution we don’t have is the African court of human rights. We are going to champion the establishment of that institution and its location in the Gambia. “Also, our own practice of human rights and protection of human rights will be a model.” Barrow has said his administration will prioritise rebuilding the economy, and a national development plan is in the works. He is also creating a thinktank of advisers on agriculture, health, the environment and other areas, to identify the needs in each sector. The country’s justice system, which Jammeh used to further his own agenda, will be overhauled, and the constitution amended, in particular to remove age limits for positions in government. Barrow’s first move as president, making Fatoumatah Jallow-Tambajang his vice-president, was unconstitutional, as an age limit of 65 had been set under the youthful Jammeh, who was 29 when he took power and 51 when he left. Most of the EU’s €75m is for projects tackling malnutrition, food security and unemployment. Drought and climate change have made farming difficult for Gambia in recent years, and a tenth of the population suffers from acute malnutrition. Mimica also said he was aware of the need to support “stability and reconstruction of the Gambian state” and would dispatch a team to Banjul to help decide what the other €150m should be spent on.

Nobody is in possession of insights or facts that everyone else isn’t also in possession of. We all absorb the same breaking news, the same analyses, the same comments and jokes and memes. Our outrage, horror and anxiety duplicates the outrage, horror and anxiety of the next guy. To say that we’re all on the same page, politically and psychologically, would be an understatement. We’re photocopies of one another. Our blind spots are identical. Something similar seems to have happened in Brexiting Britain. A format of preoccupations and emotions, shaped back in 2015, still exerts control. This might explain why a fact that’s obvious, from an American perch, apparently has escaped the notice of a lot of Britons and their parliamentarians. As they argue with Lilliputian ferocity about hypothetical trading scenarios and legislative technicalities and putative “deals”, the UK faces its gravest national security threat since the second world war. The threat comes from here, the United States. To be succinct: President Trump, animated by private motives as yet undisclosed, wants to bring about a Russian-American axis that would enfeeble Nato, destroy the European Union and dominate a continent reduced to politically dysfunctional national fragments. This isn’t speculation. European leaders in Malta last week discussed precisely this new state of affairs. There is a global threat as well as a European one. Operating under the “America first” rubric, Donald Trump has instantly turned the US into a rogue state. Internationally agreed rules on trade, territories, refugees, climate and disarmament are, it seems, to be treated as no longer binding on America. The president’s sudden, vicious restriction on Muslim immigration; his harassment and insulting of the Australian and Mexican leaders; his erasure of all reference to the Jewish genocide in his remarks for International Holocaust Remembrance Day; his appointment of his senior political adviser, the apocalyptic ethno-nationalist Steve Bannon to the National Security Council: it all adds up to an agenda of unhinged Christianic belligerence and international lawlessness. And that’s without even getting into the most dangerous issues of all: Iran, China and Trump’s questionable mental instability. To make matters worse, Trump rejects any kind of institutional control. He has shrunk the executive branch of government into a private dictatorial clique. He has excluded from his decision-making process the cabinet secretaries, civil servants and members of Congress who would ordinarily be consulted. The intelligence agencies have been marginalised, and the White House record-keeping rules ignored. Trump has ridiculed journalists, judges, protesters, senators, ethicists, spies, diplomats, chief executives, Oscar winners and Arnold Schwarzenegger. He daily undermines the very idea of objective truth. If the Richter magnitude scale were applicable to the terajoules of dictatorial seismicity, Trump would register as a six. Simply to recapitulate these facts is to experience staleness, exhaustion, banality, fear, denial – as if they were unwelcome test results just reported by one’s doctor. But there can be no question of living with this pathogen. Trumpism is a lethal, highly infectious political disease that attacks liberal democracy wherever it finds it. Either you fight it or you succumb to it. Which brings us back to Brexit. The referendum, and the debates animating it, took place in a world that simply no longer exists. In early 2016 few seriously reckoned with the possibility that Donald J Trump, perhaps the most ludicrous of the Republican primary contestants, would end up occupying the White House. If they did reckon with it, nobody foresaw the presidency that we now have. Everybody assumed that, if Brexit came to pass, the United Kingdom would negotiate its new trade and security arrangements in a geopolitically stable world. Everybody assumed the presence of a sane and friendly American president loyal to the Atlantic alliance and its shared liberal democratic values. All these assumptions, so basic they were never even discussed, have turned out to be false. And yet the Brexit white paper, published last week, makes no reference to the changed circumstances. The only reference to Trump is indirect: “The new United States administration, the world’s biggest economy, has said that they are interested in an early trade agreement with the UK.” The grammatical chaos of this sentence reflects a broader confusion. The white paper recognises that Brexit has huge security implications. But, incredibly, it states: “The Government’s national security strategy established clear national security objectives. The 2015 Strategic Defence and Security Review (SDSR) set out a funded plan to achieve them and we are now focused on delivering that plan.” That’s right: the UK’s current national security plans are the security plans made back in 2015. WTF, if I may put it that way. The SDSR was based on the National Security Risk Assessment of 2015. That assessment states, quite rightly: “Our democratic and inclusive values are the foundation of our security and prosperity. We will continue to uphold these values against those who are intent on undermining them.” No doubt written with Islamic extremism in mind, these words are, two years on, applicable above all to Trump. It all puts the British government in a terrible position. In order to get the post-Brexit trade deal that the UK needs from the US, Theresa May will be forced to align Britain geopolitically with Trump, because Trump doesn’t do compromise. It’s either his deal or no deal. You’re either totally with him or totally against him. May will have no choice but to enable Trump’s ongoing attack on the very “democratic and inclusive values” that are, by the government’s own assertion, the foundation of UK security. I’m not suggesting that the Brexit decision or parliament’s vote be revisited. I’m suggesting that if article 50 notification is given next month, as currently envisaged, the UK will be forced to choose between two options, both catastrophic to its national security. Either the UK makes common cause with Europe in its existential opposition to the Trump-Putin axis, in which case the UK will end up with no trade deal from the US, its biggest single trading partner; or Britain will make that trade deal, but will become Trumpist America’s client state, because to oppose the president or his great friend Vladimir Putin would put at risk the trade deal. Fortunately, there is an alternative to this lose-lose scenario: adhere to the Brexit decision, but suspend article 50 notification until it is clear that the national security crisis has passed. The UK and its European friends would stand together against Trump in their joint hour of need. Moreover, a Europe united in opposition to Trump would be a very grave blow to the despot. Americans have their own vision of their national security, shared by almost everyone across the ideological spectrum. It does not involve befriending Putin’s Russia at the expense of old European allies, the UK in particular. If Britain makes the right decision, it will be Trump who is placed in an impossible position. To suspend article 50 notification – or to suspend negotiations with the EU after notification – would require courage. Trump would be foiled and therefore angered, and no doubt there would be a lot of complaining in the UK. But surely national security is a non-partisan, non-negotiable, irreducible issue. With clear political leadership, people would get it very quickly: this is 2017, not 2015; Trump is a much bigger, much more immediate threat than the EU: deckchairs, Titanic. Once the Trump threat has passed, EU withdrawal will still be there, waiting to be triggered or negotiated. The trick is to ensure that a recognisable UK will be there too."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"stage/2017/feb/12/the-glass-menagerie-duke-of-york-theatre-review-john-tiffany-kate-o-flynn","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-12T08:00:01Z","webTitle":"The Glass Menagerie – fluid and radiant","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/feb/12/the-glass-menagerie-duke-of-york-theatre-review-john-tiffany-kate-o-flynn","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2017/feb/12/the-glass-menagerie-duke-of-york-theatre-review-john-tiffany-kate-o-flynn","fields":{"headline":"The Glass Menagerie – fluid and radiant","bodyText":"Is there a better scene in American theatre? The jangle of domestic life ruled by a pushy mother has subsided. The outside world, embodied by the restless young hero, is absent. A young girl, shy and lame, is wooed out of awkwardness by a young man she knew long ago. He is sweet to her; she expands and blossoms; they dance. For a brief interval amid the melancholy of The Glass Menagerie, hope soars. In a drama that looks back in sadness, for a moment time stands still. The audience are brilliantly cheated from facing what they know to be true: that there will be no happy ever after. John Tiffany’s staging of this intense episode is alone worth the price of a ticket. As the damaged Laura, inspired by Tennessee Williams’s own sister, Kate O’Flynn imposes herself even while she seems to retreat. She managed a similar conjuring trick – though not at all the same performance – four years ago as a gawky, compelling adolescent in Simon Stephens’s Port. Here she pulls a tremulous vitality – a gleam on the face, a quickened voice – from what seemed to be complete blankness. It is part of Williams’s genius that the man who shatters her briefly awakened hopes is a decent chap. He leaves her as impaired as her favourite glass ornament – with no cad to blame. Brian J Smith gives this gentleman caller just the right clumsy good intention: easy and understated. That is not Cherry Jones’s way. When Tiffany staged this production, first seen in Cambridge, Massachusetts, at the Edinburgh festival last summer, Jones – star of many Broadway shows including Doubt and The Heiress – was hailed for her commanding performance as Laura’s mother, Amanda. Something seems to have happened. She is forceful all right, but stiffer than anyone else on stage, with jerky, repetitive hand gestures and a boom to her delivery. It is a relief not to have a caricature of a faded belle clanging around the stage, but too often Jones makes her power look like heartiness, as if she is about to encourage everyone to saddle up. The play swims beautifully between realism and dream. To see it is to recognise the source of many playwrights’ daring – Arthur Miller, among them. Tiffany’s production captures its fluidity, with Steven Hoggett’s choreography requiring actors to mime occasionally and a score from Nico Muhly that sends music lightly hovering over the action. Natasha Katz’s lighting is key, with each scene enclosed in its own illumination. Laura and the gentleman caller act in a bubble fringed with darkness. There are Chinese lanterns and a scatter of fairy lights on water. In one wonderful moment, Laura’s face is made radiant by light from the glass unicorn she cherishes. Tiffany’s production also points to a wholly unexpected – to me – topical aspect; a sense of the abyss between America and Europe. “In Spain there was Guernica! But here there was only hot swing music and liquor… and sex that hung in the gloom.” Alternative facts, I suppose. The Glass Menagerie is a play of long reach and reverberations. Few dramas have been less concerned with being up to date. Which makes its intersections with modernity startling, like those passages in Shakespeare where you have to look up the text to check something has not been written in for “relevance”. The Glass Menagerie is at the Duke of York’s, London until 29 April"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"film/2017/feb/10/mel-brooks-donald-trump-doesnt-scare-me-hes-a-song-and-dance-man","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-10T15:39:01Z","webTitle":"Mel Brooks: ‘Donald Trump doesn't scare me.

He's a song-and-dance man'","bodyText":"On Sunday night, the legendary director, producer, screenwriter, gag writer, standup comic, composer, impressionist and drummer Mel Brooks will be honoured for a lifetime of comedic excellence by Bafta. Noting that an awful lot of great British comics – Morecambe and Wise, the two Ronnies, even Rowan Atkinson – never made it big in the US, Brooks says, “I was happy that they got my work in Britain. And I was surprised.” Now 90, Brooks (born Melvin Kaminsky) has had a remarkable career that stretches back to the 1950s, when he wrote sketches for the seminal variety programme Your Show of Shows. From there it was on to the classic 007 sendup Get Smart, ebulliently loopy films like The Producers, Blazing Saddles and Young Frankenstein, and the long-running Broadway musical based on The Producers. For 60 years, Brooks has been one of the most original and admired voices in American comedy. There is no one else quite like him, nor are we likely to see his like again. Bafta seem to understand this. What does the award mean to him? “You’re talking Charlie Chaplin, you’re talking Alfred Hitchcock,” he says, holding forth in a typically boisterous Greenwich Village cafe. “Is it special to me? It’s very special.” Brooks is part of a generation that did not go directly from nursery school to an internship at the New Yorker to a senior vice-presidency at DreamWorks. He graduated summa cum laude from the School of Hard Knocks. Like a lot of poor Jewish kids, he started out working part-time in the garment district. After a year in college, he trained at the Virginia Military Institute down in Dixie. VMI is the venerable institution where roughly 90% of the civil war general Stonewall Jackson’s body is buried. His gangrenous left arm, surgically detached, is buried about 120 miles north in a field outside Fredericksburg, where he was fatally wounded, possibly by his own men. It was a weird war, and VMI is a truly weird destination for a New York Jew, and the whole freaky, Grand Guignol Stonewall Jackson thing sounds like a scene from Young Frankenstein. From VMI, Brooks went to work for the US army, defusing unexploded bombs. “The bombs were powerful enough to blow up a tank,” he recalls. “Imagine what they could do to you.” After the war, Brooks made his way into television, still in its embryonic stage, and eventually developed a hugely successful routine with the equally legendary Carl Reiner. The 2000 Year Old Man was a mock interview in which an earnest journalist (Reiner) grilled a primitive humanoid (Brooks) about his experiences. Pressed to identify the greatest invention, the oldest man in the world extolled the virtues of Saran wrap. As they used to say in Brooklyn, oy. From there it was on to small, arty films, then big, not-so-arty films. Surprisingly, Brooks never expected to go into the movies. His original career path veered towards the rag trade, a common destination for poor kids from Williamsburg, Brooklyn, where he grew up. Williamsburg today is the kind of place where every cafe has two German DJs creating evanescent sonic art while the four patrons – two graphic designers, a choreographer and a guy who restores vintage ouds – sip their piquant cappuccinos. The Williamsburg of Brooks’ youth predates hipsterism, irony and Teutonic sonic art. He recalls, with pride, growing up in a tenement where “everyone slept in a single bedroom and everyone had a job in the garment district. There were a million kids and we all played in the street where you never had to worry about getting hit by a car because there were no cars.” Brooks had a life-altering epiphany when his Uncle Joe, a cabbie who used to snag tickets to Broadway shows, took him to his first musical. “It was Anything Goes. It was one of Cole Porter’s greatest shows. Songs like All Through the Night and You’re the Top.” Ethel Merman right up there on the stage. Even then I thought she was a bit loud. I was a nine-year-old kid. I was spellbound. When the show was over, I told my uncle: ‘I’m not going into the garment business. The theatre is where I live or die.’” In the end, movies were more of a detour than a dream come true. “Movies were great to go to when I was a kid,” he says. “But they were never as exciting and palpable and thrilling as a Broadway musical. For me, back then, movies rated a 20 and Broadway rated an 80.” And Broadway today? The Broadway of Wicked and Mamma Mia and Cats “Fifty-fifty,” he replies. Brooks is by turns funny, ironic, sentimental and nostalgic. He loves to talk shop. He adores Billy Wilder, Martin Scorsese and James Whale, who made the classic 1930s horror movies that Brooks both parodies and honours in Young Frankenstein. He is envious of Hitchcock, in part because Hitchcock only used stunning-looking leading men in his films (Cary Grant, Gregory Peck), pairing them with stunning-looking women (Grace Kelly, Eva Marie Saint). Brooks did not have this luxury. In his opinion, Hitchcock is “the greatest director ever. The stories, the way he set up shots, everything.” Yet Hitchcock never got the respect he deserved. “In France they worshipped Hitchcock,” Brooks says. “But as he once told me, ‘In England and America they view me as an entertainer.’” Brooks’ heyday as a filmmaker was in the 1960s and 1970s, when the machiavellian Richard Nixon was running the show. Laughs were hard to come by in the Nixon years; basically it was just Brooks and Woody Allen holding the fort. Brooks’ films were never overtly political, yet today both Blazing Saddles and The Producers seem astonishingly timely. In the former, a charismatic black man wanders into a miserable community, unites the races in their fight against their common enemy – ruthless capitalists and crooked politicians – and then rides off into the sunset. Which sounds just a wee bit like the arc of Barack Obama’s career. The Producers, a film about two men who concoct a plot to make the worst musical ever – Springtime for Hitler – and then end up doing hard time when the play is an unexpected success, seems shockingly resonant in the era of The Donald and The Ivanka and The Melania and The Jared. “The whole thing is crazy,” he says. “Trump was never a politician. He was never a senator. I don’t think he was ever president of his high-school class. And then he got himself elected president of the United States. He didn’t expect to win. He didn’t take it seriously. Three hundred million Americans didn’t take it seriously. Now they do.” Brooks, who views Trump’s anti-Muslim travel ban as poorly planned and poorly executed – his parents came to the US as kids – does not revile the new president in the kneejerk way most movie people do. “Trump doesn’t scare me,” he says. “He’s a song-and-dance man. Pence [the vice-president] and Bannon [Trump’s scheming henchman, a kind of Dick Cheney without the radiant, cherubic charm], those guys make me nervous.” He adds: “We are not talking about Athenian democracy here.” When asked if he was ever tempted to make a “serious” film the way Allen did with Interiors and a few other exquisitely lugubrious affairs, Brooks mentions Gene Hackman’s unexpectedly hilarious turn as a daft, blind monk who befriends the hapless monster in Young Frankenstein. He pours hot soup into the monster’s lap, smashes his wine glass and sets his thumb on fire. When the hideous creature races off, bellowing in pain, Hackman cries out: “Where are you going? I was going to make espresso.” This may be the funniest line in all of Brooks’ oeuvre. So why didn’t Hackman make more comedies? “I talked to Gene about that. He had a sensationally sly gift. But it’s all baggage. Once they (Hollywood) see what you can do, that’s all that they’ll let you do. I could produce The Elephant Man as part of Brooksfilms. But Mel Brooks couldn’t direct The Elephant Man. I had baggage.” Brooks made staggering amounts of money from films with tiny budgets. But money was not always easy to raise, because his films were quirky, goofy. He recalls his duplicity when trying to bankroll Young Frankenstein, which earned $86.3m on a budget of $2.8m. “At the end of the meeting, when I had them sold, I walked over to the door, turned around said, ‘By the way, the film’s in black-and-white.’ Then I quickly slammed the door and ran down the hall, followed by a hundred Jewish guys screaming: ‘No money! No deal. No black-and-white!’” If Amazon or Netflix gave him $50m today, no strings attached, what film would he make? “Spaceballs 2,” he says. There is no evidence that he is joking. Brooks had the good fortune to work with a cadre of peerless comic talents: Gene Wilder, Madeline Kahn, Zero Mostel, Harvey Korman. Mostly born after him, they are all gone. Outliving your friends is no picnic. “I think about them plenty of the time. But I don’t think about them all of the time. That would be too much.” Asked about his wife, the actor Anne Bancroft, who died in 2005, he says: “Was she funny? Yes, she was very funny. But the best thing she ever said was when she told an interviewer, ‘My life starts when I hear his key in the door.’” There was a time when Brooks’ films were viewed by snooty critics as vulgar, sexist and sophomoric. Most of these critics are now dead, though presumably still snooty. Viewed today, the films seem daring and clever and even sophisticated, while still being vulgar and sophomoric and insufficiently respectful toward women and minorities – though all in an endearing, high-class way. The films contain inspired, theatre-of-the-absurd moments such as the climactic scene in Blazing Saddles in which a raucous, Wild West fistfight erupts on to a sound stage where a campy musical is being filmed. At this point, the villain (Korman) hails a cab and tells the driver: “Drive me off this picture.” He is then driven to Mann’s Chinese Theater, where Blazing Saddles, not yet completed, is being screened. And there he is gunned down. It is a finale that seamlessly fuses Luigi Pirandello and Jean-Luc Godard with Eugene Ionesco and Groucho Marx. It is the kind of ingenious, postmodern material you rarely get in Adam Sandler films. “I do 85% for the audience, and 15% for myself,” Brooks says. “‘Drive me off this picture’ was for me.” Asked to single out the best joke he ever wrote, Brooks says: “My favourite line is more emotional. It’s the scene at the end of Blazing Saddles when Gene Wilder asks Cleavon Little where he’s headed next. And Cleavon says, ‘Nowhere special.’ And Gene says: ‘Nowhere special. That’s somewhere I’ve always wanted to go.’” The conversation eventually returns to New York, “the most exciting city in the world,” and particularly Broadway, from top to bottom the most amazing thoroughfare known to man. Brooks loved the city growing up, and he loves it now. It’s a city that is hard not to love, even though “you have to go all the way over to Katz’s on Houston Street to get a legitimate corned-beef sandwich now that the Carnegie Deli has closed.” That said, Brooks has made his home in Santa Monica for a long, long time. When he first went to California decades ago, it was viewed by many Americans as paradise. In Donald Trump’s Amerika, it still is. “Let’s say you were a pigeon and you landed on a rooftop in New York,” he says. “You’d find other pigeons and you’d find yourself some peanuts down in the park and you’d have yourself a wonderful time. But if you were a pigeon and you flew to California, you’d never fly again. Where would you go?” • The Baftas will be broadcast live on BBC1 from 9pm on Sunday 12 February • This article was amended on 14 February 2017 because the 2000 Year Old Man thought mankind’s greatest invention was Saran wrap, not aluminum foil as an earlier version said.

The projection of a “vanishingly small reduction” is one of the first attempts to estimate how likely labour market demand, and the government’s planned new controls, could reduce the number of migrants coming to the UK. Reduction in immigrant numbers has been repeatedly cited in polls as the chief reason voters backed leaving the European Union. The report by a new thinktank, Global Future, shows total net immigration, which at the latest official estimate was 335,000 in the year to June 2016, could be expected to fall by no more than 15%, to 285,000 a year. Future free trade deals with non-EU countries suggests even this reduction could be wiped out. Liam Fox, the international trade minister, accepted last week he did not know of any new free trade deal that did not also include liberalisation of migration rules between the two countries signing such agreements. Australia and India have already indicated they will seek preferential access for their workers as part of a free trade deal. The government has so far refused to produce its own estimate of the cut in migration from Brexit, or precisely how new controls will operate. But the report’s estimates, which were formulated by breaking down the different elements of net migration from the EU and examining government commitments to retain skilled labour, students and some seasonal work, represents one of most thorough projections to date. The report argues: “While ending freedom of movement is psychologically appealing to those who want a sense of control of our borders, the reality is such a move would create more the illusion of control. People looking for substantial reductions are likely to be disappointed with the eventual figure of 50,000 or less.” The thinktank has won the backing of the Sainsbury’s chief executive Mike Coupe, as well as Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron. Its director, Gurnek Bains, said: “The extent to which this impact is worth the myriad of economic and political problems that pulling out of free movement would create needs to be reflected upon. In addition, promising more than can be delivered on migration risks creating a firestorm in the future.” Farron said: “In return for this self-inflicted wound it is unlikely that the Conservative Brexit government will be able to deliver its promise of dramatically reduced immigration.” The report starts with the premise that the current true net immigration figure from Europe is 182,700 annually, representing the maximum amount of reduction possible from leaving the EU out of a total immigration figure of 335,000. The estimates suggest net migration of EU students will be unchanged post-Brexit, even though the mix of EU and non-EU students may shift. It also suggests the currently small number of EU citizens coming mainly for family or marriage reasons will remain constant at 25,000. This route will become one of the most attractive way of entering the UK, the report points out. In the biggest category, the number of workers coming in from the EU, the report projects a fall from 204,000 to 125,000, citing government indications that it would have to exempt key professional staff and ensure employers continued to have a ready supply of labour. Even this modest decrease, however, is likely to be offset by EU citizens already in the UK being less likely to leave Britain and the prospect of restrictions on UK citizens moving to other countries in the EU. The report points out 22% of EU migrants are in professional jobs, 22% in skilled occupations and 56% doing unskilled jobs. The UK has already said it will need to keep the professional route open, so the report assumes 50% of existing flow professional workers will still be required. Ministers have also said they will respond to employer pressure to meet their demand for 80,000 seasonal workers, 90% of whom come from the EU. The report then looks at the large proportion of workers in the key industries such as hospitality, transport and building. “Complete closure of the skilled and unskilled categories is simply not feasible without catastrophic consequences for a range of UK sectors,” it warns. The thinktank points out that in its recent Brexit white paper, the government itself also conceded that the supply of skilled and unskilled workers cannot be switched off without serious disruption to key industries. It has promised to work closely with business leaders to ensure adequate supply of labour for key industries. The report also looks at the number of the EU citizens in the UK returning to the EU, saying the number will fall from 95,000 to 58,000, partly due to fears they will be unable to return to the UK. It also expects the current small net outflow of UK citizens to Europe will fall to zero, partly due to changes to residency requirements, access to healthcare and taxation for the estimated 1.2 million UK citizens who live in Europe. Critics will say the thinktank set up to break down cultural barriers has had to make too many assumptions and does not take into account the public’s support for the principle of controlling borders."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2017/feb/13/watch-act-one-of-die-walkure-from-opera-north-ring-cycle-wagner","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-13T10:00:10Z","webTitle":"Watch act one of Die Walküre from Opera North's stripped-back Ring Cycle","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/feb/13/watch-act-one-of-die-walkure-from-opera-north-ring-cycle-wagner","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2017/feb/13/watch-act-one-of-die-walkure-from-opera-north-ring-cycle-wagner","fields":{"headline":"Watch act one of Die Walküre from Opera North's stripped-back Ring Cycle","bodyText":"Opera North’s production of Wagner’s complete Ring Cycle toured sold-out concert halls across England last year to huge acclaim. The semi-staged concert performances, with the orchestra and singers on the stage in front of giant screens that integrated impressionistic video with surtitles and other narrative, were hailed as enthralling experiences and praised for both their intimacy and a matchless cast of singers and musicians that brought Wagner’s music thrillingly to life. “It is rare to encounter such a concentrated and riveting realisation of the work as this, with the story explained simply and the words translated on a triptych of atmospherically illustrated video screens .... This is back-to-basics Wagner, and in many respects it feels like a liberation,” wrote Martin Kettle in his Guardian review. The live performances were filmed over a week at Leeds Town Hall in May 2016, and the entire cycle is now available to view, free, on the BBC – and in part here on the Guardian.

The legal battle began in earnest this week after a year of pre-trial clashes. Lawyers hired by Holyoake have delved into the Candys’ financial affairs, leading to accusations in court of tax evasion. The billionaire brothers, whose luxury developments have attracted oligarchs and Gulf royalty, deny the claims. In return, their advisers have raked over the collapse of Holyoake’s fish import business, British Seafood. Setting out the case for the defence on Thursday, Tim Lord QC said Holyoake had given the Candys a misleading account of how much he was worth in order to borrow £12m from them to develop luxury flats. Holyoake alleges he was then intimated, blackmailed and pressured into paying back £37m and forgoing profits on his building project, a period mansion block in London’s Grosvenor Gardens, by selling the property before it had been refurbished. Setting out what he called “the true version of events”, Lord said they entailed “serial dishonesty and fraud on the part of Mr Holyoake and his associates”. Emails were read out in court which allegedly showed Holyoake’s financial advisers complaining of “constant lying” to investors, and raising concerns about “the fraud we have committed”. Lord said: “Mr Holyoake is a man capable of saying different things to different people dependent on whether he is trying to borrow money from them or pay it back.” Watching proceedings from the public gallery were two investors still owed money following the collapse of British Seafood, which collapsed in 2010 with debts of £250m. The Serious Fraud Office closed an investigation three years ago without pressing charges. The defence have uncovered documents which they claim show Holyoake told the investment firm 3i, one of the British Seafood creditors, that he had net assets of £15m in December 2010. Less than a year later, a declaration of assets given to Christian Candy’s Guernsey-based CPC group, as part of the loan contract, put Holyoake’s worth at the much larger figure of £120m. This later declaration did not, the defence claimed, take account of money promised to 3i. “That was a dishonest thing to do and it amounted to serious fraud on CPC,” said Lord. Holyoake denies the claims. The court was shown a series of emails between Holyoake and his advisers William Pym and William Lovering, partners in a firm which helped to raise money for the Grosvenor project. One message, referring to communications with architects about the date of a transfer of funds, says lying “seemed to be the norm now”. In another, Lovering confesses that his “moral compass is stretched beyond anywhere I can comprehend”. In October 2013, allegedly responding to instructions from Holyoake to hoodwink a potential funder, the men complain that they “just struggle with the constant lying”, and that they are “worried about the fraud we have committed”. The trial continues."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"public-leaders-network/2017/feb/10/home-office-syrian-refugee-families-islington-council","type":"article","sectionId":"public-leaders-network","sectionName":"Public Leaders Network","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-10T06:10:44Z","webTitle":"A small shift by the Home Office would mean so much to Syrian families | Kaya Comer-Schwartz","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/public-leaders-network/2017/feb/10/home-office-syrian-refugee-families-islington-council","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/public-leaders-network/2017/feb/10/home-office-syrian-refugee-families-islington-council","fields":{"headline":"A small shift by the Home Office would mean so much to Syrian families","bodyText":"Just over a year ago, members of our local community stepped forward to support Syrian refugees in dire need. Our borough is now home to nine families and we hope to welcome more people throughout the year. Yana, 20, fled Syria in 2013 when her brother was imprisoned and her house destroyed. The youngest of six siblings who have been scattered around the globe by the conflict, Yana has settled in well in Islington. She recently passed her first accountancy exams and her English has blossomed as she has made friends, including in a Red Cross-run choir she recently joined. Stories such as these are a testament to the contribution they’ve made to our community and evidence of a smooth transition into our borough. Yet issues remain that have made the process of resettlement harder than it needs to be, particularly the Home Office’s insistence that those who have arrived under the government’s Vulnerable Persons Resettlement Scheme (VPRS) be granted five-year humanitarian protection visas instead of typical refugee status, which affords people the ability to travel and access to student finance as well as to some social security support. This seemingly insignificant administrative matter is the cause of great distress to the families we have welcomed. As grantees of humanitarian protection, those who have arrived under the Syrian VPRS scheme are not entitled to a UN travel document. Instead, they must either use their own passport or apply for a certificate of travel. At £218 per person, this is unaffordable for many of those who only recently escaped a horrific civil war that is still ongoing. The matter is compounded by the fact that many countries – including Jordan, Lebanon, Turkey, and Egypt – do not accept such a document or are very unlikely to. The Home Office has told us of a case in which at least one family obtained these documents only to be subsequently turned away as they attempted to travel. As for their own passports, of the nine Islington families, only three have valid Syrian documentation; one family’s passports expire shortly. Many have close family – children, parents and siblings – in Europe and around Syria. To make matters worse, help with family reunion is now outside the scope of legal aid, like so many other issues. The inability to travel to see relatives is proving to be seriously distressing to these families. In some cases, it is preventing us from effectively supporting them to integrate. Late last year we urged the Home Office to reconsider this disparity between the two definitions. We are not alone in doing so: recently the Commons Public Accounts Committee made similar calls in its report on the VPRS scheme, pointing out that granting humanitarian protection rather than refugee status risked people missing out on access to some public services It would greatly assist us in providing the best support to families, without incurring additional costs, if refugee status were granted through a fast-track process set up in consultation with experts on asylum law and policy. The kindness and generosity of spirit shown by the members of our community who opened their doors to desperate Syrian families fits a proud and longstanding Islington tradition of helping immigrants in desperate circumstances. We are extremely grateful to them. A small but significant shift by the Home Office would do much to help that tradition continue – here and across the country.

Outside, it’s freezing; inside, it’s a basement with obstructing pillars and a stage so cosy that she and her three musicians are almost literally cheek by jowl. Yet dreams are subjective, and for this teenager from Croydon, headlining XOYO is measurable progress after three years of co-writing songs for others and being the featured voice on other people’s hits. Coming third in the Sound of 2017 poll has given Raye a leg up, but tonight’s show proves that she would have probably got here under her own steam: she’s that confident, and that promising. Current hit You Don’t Know Me heads a short set of emotional R&amp;B, to which she brings musicianly deftness, a singer-songwriter’s intimacy – new song Sober, played on a keyboard, graphically describes a boyfriend’s drug addiction – and an extrovert’s unquenchable charm. Her tracksuit posits her as the anti-diva, and she sings what she knows: My Girl bouncily celebrates her best friend, and new track The Line jauntily makes light of queueing outside a club at one in the morning. Give her the chance to be Lana “Del Raye”, though, and she rises to the occasion, making a dark tour de force of the queasy weed ballad Hotbox. As a getting-to-know-you occasion, tonight’s well-plotted mix of bangers and sweetness succeeds in making you want to know a lot more about Raye."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"stage/2017/feb/10/tanztheater-wuppertal-masurca-fogo-review-pina-bausch","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-10T16:00:12Z","webTitle":"Tanztheater Wuppertal: Masurca Fogo review – a hot collage of anguish and joy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/feb/10/tanztheater-wuppertal-masurca-fogo-review-pina-bausch","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2017/feb/10/tanztheater-wuppertal-masurca-fogo-review-pina-bausch","fields":{"headline":"Tanztheater Wuppertal: Masurca Fogo review – a hot collage of anguish and joy","bodyText":"It’s nearly eight years since Pina Bausch died and while her company are striving to preserve her spirit, changes have been inevitable. New dancers have joined the company, a new artistic director is commissioning new works and already the question arises over which of Bausch’s own productions are most likely to survive on the stage. Café Müller and The Rite of Spring are most likely to gain classic status, especially since they are already being performed by other companies. Yet as Masurca Fogo returns to London, I wonder if this too might gain a wider platform. Created in 1998, it is an impressionist travelogue of Portugal and Brazil, and compared with the nightmares that haunted Bausch’s earlier work it feels like a summer holiday. Projected film footage transforms the stage into a rainforest or a beach, and the music lilts through a hot romantic collage of jazz, fado and kd lang. Of course, familiar Bausch elements are everywhere. As the dancers confess their most intimate memories they tap into deep seams of yearning insecurity and pain. Courtship rituals become ugly games of power; men posture and women beadily observe each other as they put their bodies on parade. Yet the darkness is always dissolved by the work’s tenderness, and by Bausch’s deliriously strange comic instincts – the lone walrus that heaves itself across the stage, the startling, colourful streamers that fall around a man’s face as he doffs his hat to a woman. Far outweighing the private pain too are the joyous moments where the cast scooch along an improvised water slide, party in a ramshackle beach hut and are liberated into sequences of larky, full-bodied expressive dance. There’s so much dancing in Masurca and this is one reason why the work could translate well to another cast. Some of Bausch’s performers feel irreplaceable: the fearless, elegant Julie Shanahan, the mordantly droll Nazareth Panadero. But it’s not inconceivable that a large repertory company like Rambert could rise to the challenge of Masurca and bring it a new personality, a new life. At Sadler’s Wells, London, until 12 February.

The hottest days yet this summer are forecast for parts of New South Wales and Queensland, which have taken the brunt of a series of heatwaves in recent months. Soaring use of air-conditioning has put the country’s power networks to the test. Electricity shortages caused a blackout for 40,000 people in South Australia on Thursday, and businesses and households in New South Wales have been urged to curb their power consumption to avoid similar problems. Meanwhile politicians have clashed over the reliability of power networks and the merits of phasing out coal-fired power for renewable energy as Australia pursues its commitments under the Paris climate deal. Stephen Wood, a senior forecaster at the Bureau of Meteorology, said roughly 20% of Australia – an area equivalent to 1.5m sq km (roughly 580,000 sq miles) – would experience peak temperatures of over 40C on Saturday. “To have such a large area of temperatures above 40C and for so long is definitely unusual,” he said. “These next three days, large areas are going to suffer through the pain of it, unfortunately.” Sydney airport recorded its hottest February day ever at 42.9C, breaking a 37-year record. Wood said the month was on track to be the hottest on record in both Sydney and Brisbane, following on from their hottest January on record. Peak temperatures of 48C were forecast in areas around Ivanhoe, in central New South Wales. Three places in north-west NSW were forecast next week to break the state record of 50 consecutive days above 35C, Wood said. A total fire ban for the state was declared and residents of the Hunter Valley were warned of “catastrophic” fire conditions in coming days. Horse racing and school sports events scheduled for the weekend were cancelled. The heatwaves have been caused by the buildup of hot air in the desert interior of Australia. This summer had been unusual in the dearth of any cold fronts from the southern Indian Ocean to “flush out” that reservoir of hot air, Wood said. Tim Flannery, a prominent environmentalist and former chief commissioner of the government’s former Climate Commission, said this summer’s heatwaves were “documented to be part of a growing trend” in Australia’s south-east cities. “The heatwaves are coming earlier in the season, they can be experienced later in the season, they’re longer and they’re more intense,” said Flannery, now with the non-profit organisation Climate Council. “That trend is just continuing across the country and across the world.” Flannery said this Australian summer had probably given many people in southern cities their first jolting awareness of the effects of climate change. “Unless you’re a farmer, or you’re out in the regions or you visit places like the Great Barrier Reef, it’s possible that you would’ve got by without having much direct experience of climate change beyond an intensified weather event,” he said. “But these heatwaves are by far the most dangerous of the extreme weather phenomena we see in this country. They kill more people and they certainly are felt into the cities. They’re a good gauge, if you want, of people’s experience of climate change.” The government seized on the South Australia blackouts as evidence of the folly of the state’s promotion of wind power in its energy mix. The treasurer, Scott Morrison, brought a lump of coal into parliament on Thursday to make a case for the importance of the fossil fuel in reliable power supply. “Don’t be afraid. Don’t be scared,” Morrison told the Labor opposition, whose state counterparts are pursuing renewable energy targets of as high as 50% by 2030. New South Wales, which relies largely on coal for power, and the Australian Capital Territory were predicted to face power cuts on Friday, but in the end this did not happen. Nevertheless, the warning prompted the Queensland government to export a spare 1,000 megawatts of power to help NSW avoid having to cut electricity. Mark Bailey, the Queensland energy minister, said the power crisis in New South Wales was taking place in “a state with one of the lowest levels of large-scale renewables in the country. “That’s something [the federal government] can’t explain because it doesn’t fit in with their ideological position.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/live/2017/feb/10/who-should-host-the-new-blind-date-join-our-live-look-at-the-week","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-10T16:23:14Z","webTitle":"Fact-checking Trump and a ketchup debate – catch up on our live look at the week","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/live/2017/feb/10/who-should-host-the-new-blind-date-join-our-live-look-at-the-week","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/live/2017/feb/10/who-should-host-the-new-blind-date-join-our-live-look-at-the-week","fields":{"headline":"Fact-checking Trump and a ketchup debate – catch up on our live look at the week","bodyText":"Thanks for getting involved today.

I’m interested to hear readers’ experiences of sleep? What has helped you with insomnia? Did anything change the way you see slumber? Share stories and experiences in the comments. A couple of points on some of the things we’ve been talking about that might traditionally be aimed at our audience in the US, next – but, this first reader is right ... we are a global news organisation now. I’m still not going to use a “z” there though ... Sunday’s Super Bowl was a thriller, as the Atlanta Falcons pulled off one of the biggest chokes in sport history and the Belichick-Brady machine ruthlessly exploited every weakness to pick up the Patriots’ fifth title since 2001. Atlanta had plenty of chances to wrap the game up and it’s hard to make an argument that they deserved to win, but it was still disappointing that the most important call of the game was the correct “heads” call by Matthew Slater before the start of overtime. The Patriots opted to receive the ball, marched down the field and won the game without the regular-season MVP, Falcons quarterback Matt Ryan, even getting to touch the ball. There must be a better way to do this. The most obvious comparison and the most talked-about alternative is the college football system, in which extra periods are played with each team getting one possession from their own 25-yard line, with as many extra periods as are necessary until the tie is broken. It’s definitely fairer, but the coin toss still gives an advantage to the team going second as they then know whether they need a touchdown or whether a field goal will suffice. Other methods have been proposed, including: Another full 15-minute period, repeated as necessary Carry on as though the game never ended, with the ball wherever it was on the field. First score wins. The college system, but the ball starts at some point closer to the end zone and the second team only gets as many downs as the first team needed to score The auction system, where one team chooses where on the field the ball will be received and the other team then chooses which team will receive it. First score wins A silent auction, in which both coaches make an offer of where they would be willing to receive the ball, and the furthest-away offer receives it first. First score wins A rugby-style penalty shootout A bidding system where the referee offers both coaches possession at their own 1-yard line, then 2, then 3 and so on until one coach accepts. That team then starts at that point on the field. First score wins. Of these, my preference would be for the last one – it would be incredibly dramatic and hard to argue about fairness. But what do you think? Which of these would work, or do you have a better alternative? Or do you think the current system works just fine? Things are getting more serious in our below the line conversation, but you can still vote in our poll from earlier – so far decidedly divisive. Where do you keep your ketchup? Go on, click it ... you know you want to ... But do bear this observation in mind: This reader sets out a three point plan for reporting on the president. What do you think? A couple of views from readers on reporting Trump after Martin Belam talked about covering the US president. I wrote a piece earlier this week looking at the dilemma that Donald Trump’s White House poses for journalists. When he issued his much derided list of under-reported terror attacks, journalists around the world, including my colleague Claire Phipps, scrambled to factcheck it. But does that mean we are just being pushed into playing his game, on his terms? The hours spent by many news organisations looking into his ludicrous list – which included such major world news events as the terror attacks on Paris and Nice – were not spent looking into other aspects of his administration, like the attempt to repeal regulations on banks introduced after the financial crash. The list took away the attention of both journalists and the audience. I worry that for his committed supporters, it isn’t the facts of something like the terror list that matter. And that for the people who don’t support him, they never believed the list was true in the first place. Are we in the media collectively wasting our time debunking his pronouncements? How do you think news organisations should approach reporting the Trump administration, when the White House itself seems content to push “fake news”? The BBC did, it appears, beautifully troll him over it, which at least gave me a wry smile in the midst of all the worry. A couple of you have been talking about what you’d like us to talk about up here – as well as down in the comments. Here’s a couple of starters – anything else you would be interested in discussing?

My excuse is that the app-provided list of things I’m supposed to find irritating, but I don’t really care about them. There’s no Nicole Scherzinger Muller Lite ads or alt-right middle class teenagers. Unforgivably, there doesn’t even seem to be a Trump option. I’d love to meet someone as relentlessly testy and nit-picky as me but my abiding impression is that Hater needs to draw its gallery of irks from its active users or face becoming just another dating app that dies on the vine. As it stands I, ironically, just find it a bit annoying. We’ll put our top reporters on this one Whether its for top class political debate making sense of the news or topical issues that are at the hearts of our lives, thousands of you come to the comments every day ... And on Wednesday this week, it was certainly a conversation with gravitas that caught our eye. After a supermarket did a poll and found around half its customers put ketchup in the fridge, around half of you were pretty confused. Why would you do that? The numbers were actually 53% in the chiller and 47% out, but, that’s their customers ... A good point, Pidgeonfancy – we hear you: can we find out whether our readers are in tune with customers of that particular supermarket? Do you feel passionate or are you sort of in the middle? Maybe this causes fights in your family? Is any of this statistically significant? Who knows. So, where do you keep your ketchup? Just one more comment to get you going, with the original numbers ... Just a last handful of your suggestions for the new Blind Date host before we move the conversation above the line here on a little ... Or someone more serious? Fresh from The Moorside ... A couple of calls for this comedian: But finally, an observation ... Picture editor Joanna Ruck takes us through some of the most memorable images her and colleagues have seen this week. The standout photo this week has to be the one of Barack Obama on holiday in the Caribbean. Looking healthy and somehow still smiling despite all that’s going on. The family gathering to end all family gatherings happened in China this week. They managed to gather all 500 members of the Ren family together in Shengzhou City – and needed a drone to take the photo. Ukip campaigning in Stoke have taken to carrying umbrellas, not for the rain, but the flying eggs. What images stick in your mind? A couple more of your suggestions after Harriet Gibsone asked who you would like to see host the returning Blind Date. There have been a few votes for comedians in character... But not many women, we note – perhaps nobody can match Cilla herself? Who would you like to see on Blind Date? Here are some of your suggestions so far ... Hmm ... nice. What about Ricky Gervais? Or, even better ... This next reader has a point Finally, for now ... If that last one makes no sense to you, check out this quite disturbing video by comedian Adam Buxton ... 31 May, 2003: the day terrestrial television bid a fond ta-ra to Blind Date – the one stop shop for love and a lorra lorra laughs. At the height of its popularity in the 1980s, 18.2 million tuned in on a Saturday night to watch as a selection of lonesome singletons with enormous perms wrestled with food-based innuendo. This week it was announced that the show is making a comeback. It returns in a very different cultural climate, however. Perhaps the end of Blind Date marked the end of innocence itself. It existed before one could hook up with the nearest ankle fetishist within a 10cm radius within the click of a button. Before you could flick on the TV and see a row of brazen penises on display (Naked Attraction, not The Grand Tour). Of course, key to the success of the original series was queen matchmaker Cilla Black, with her catchphrases, chintzy charm and cheekiness. So is there a beloved figurehead worthy of replacing her in 2017? So far Geordie Shore’s Vicky Pattison has been rumoured, as well as trilby’s Olly Murs. But I think we can do better than that. Let us know who you’d like to host the return of the revamped dating show (and for a bonus point, a new Graham too). Welcome to our weekly social, where we discuss the week’s news and comment with our readers. We’ve got lots of great things lined up today (including some comments on the return of Blind Date. Very exciting). Share the topics you want to discuss now below the line.

OK, he wasn’t actually suggesting that Gooners should buy Kyle Walker replica shirts and season tickets for White Hart Lane, but his comments are unlikely to go down too well among supporters who may or may not be interested to read tabloid reports that somewhere in the Emirates is a sheet of paper bearing the names of four potential replacements for the Frenchman should he decide to walk away from the club this summer. With previous talk of Eddie Howe being the new Wenger-in-waiting having apparently been consigned to the dustbin of history now that the novelty of Plucky Little Bournemouth being in the Premier League has worn off, the name of Borussia Dortmund gaffer Thomas Tuchel can be found at the top of this list, where it is printed in slightly bigger and bolder font than that of Juventus manager Max Allegri, who has apparently agreed to leave Turin come season’s end. Their Bayer Leverkusen counterpart Roger Schmidt and Monaco’s Leonardo Jardim are also being touted as potential Future Arsenal Managers, at least until Hull City’s Marco Silva proves he’s no flash in the pan by getting a few more big scalps under his belt ... possibly starting tomorrow. Chelsea midfielder Willian has responded to reports that José Mourinho has been pinning “wanted” posters bearing the image of the Brazilian’s face up around the Manchester United boardroom by making the astute observation that “there are always some things on the internet”, before adding that he’s “glad to hear that there are clubs that admire my work”. If the day ends in ‘y’ then chances are David De Gea is being linked with a move away from Manchester United. This being Friday, the Spanish goalkeeper is wanted by Juventus. The Old Lady has also been suggestively hitching her skirts at Milan teenager Gianluigi Donnarumma as she looks for a worthy heir to fill the intimidatingly big boots of Gigi Buffon, in the unlikely event that the ageless Italian legend decides to retire before either of the men being tipped as his successor. In other reports from Manchester, somebody somewhere has said that Antoine Griezmann will refuse to sign for Manchester United if they don’t qualify for the Champions League, even though it’s a fair bet that, like most footballers, he wouldn’t rule out inking a contract with Stockport County or Macclesfield Town if the price was right. Romelu Lukaku is another player we’re led to believe harbours a burning desire to play Champions League football, even if reports that he’s prepared to sign a new contract with Everton don’t necessarily tally with that particular state of affairs. Just because you’re paranoid doesn’t mean Jürgen Klopp isn’t out to get you and if Leicester City winger Demarai Gray feels like he’s being watched it may be down to the fact that Liverpool are reported to be “monitoring” him. Currently playing for a team that’s only won two matches in seven attempts this year, Gray may well fancy the step up to one that’s only won one in 10. Liverpool are also interested in signing Sporting midfielder William Carvalho, one of those players who has featured so often in this column without actually going anywhere that he’ll soon have his own star on the Rumour Mill Walk Of Fame. Manchester City also covet the 24-year-old, who is contracted to the Portuguese side until 2020 and valued at around £26m. Elsewhere in Portugal, Benfica right-back Nelson Semedo is wanted by Bayern Munich, who’ll be needing somebody to slot into that particular position when Philipp Lahm retires at the end of the season. The Rumour Mill remains hopeful the German champions will give their No21 shirt to a certain right-back named Alan who plays for Aston Villa, if only because it would allow us to resurrect that hoary old gag with the punchline “... Hutton dressed as Lahm”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2017/feb/10/on-the-slippery-slopes-of-the-jump-with-bradley-wiggins","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-10T12:55:56Z","webTitle":"‘I’m not a risk-taker’ – on the slippery slopes of The Jump with Bradley Wiggins","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/feb/10/on-the-slippery-slopes-of-the-jump-with-bradley-wiggins","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2017/feb/10/on-the-slippery-slopes-of-the-jump-with-bradley-wiggins","fields":{"headline":"‘I’m not a risk-taker’ – on the slippery slopes of The Jump with Bradley Wiggins","bodyText":"Bradley Wiggins, Tour De France winner, record-breaking Olympian and knight of the realm, is sat in an Austrian hotel bar trying to explain his latest career move. “I’m not a risk-taker,” he says. “I’m not a thrill-seeker either.” It’s a strange thing for a man who has spent the majority of his adult life pedalling at breakneck speed to suggest. Stranger still when you consider that, for his first post-retirement act, the champion cyclist will be flinging himself down a precipitous ski slalom route as part of a TV reality contest that has done for so many celebrities and athletes before him. Wiggins is entering The Jump, which is nothing if not risky. Yes, The Jump is back … somehow. The celebrity winter sports show returned this week for a fourth series of gaudy lycra and flailing limbs, which seems utterly implausible when you consider its past performances. This is a series frequently described as cursed. A series the Sun reported as having been cancelled last year after ratings “fell off a cliff”. And a series that has maimed so many famous folk – one contestant, model Vogue Williams, has already exited this year’s competition due to injury – that you’d assume not even Z-listers would touch it with a ski pole. You’d assume wrong. Wiggins’s involvement underlines The Jump’s peculiar paradox: the more injuries, the more impressive the list of people willing to risk life and limb becomes. Last year saw six contestants withdraw prematurely due to various breaks and sprains, with Olympic gymnast Beth Tweddle suffering a neck injury so severe that she underwent surgery to fuse together two vertebrae. Yet this year’s contest has assembled a murderer’s row of athletes to face off against Wiggins: Olympic gymnast and Strictly victor Louis Smith, English Rugby World Cup winner Jason Robinson, former Liverpool striker Robbie Fowler (AKA ‘God’), Olympic Taekwondo gold medallist Jade Jones, multi-discipline paralympian Kadeena Cox and Wales rugby legend Gareth Thomas. Yet there’s no doubting this year’s star draw. The show doesn’t even attempt to pretend otherwise, positioning Wiggins a few inches ahead of everyone else in promotional pics and making sure to announce him “last and definitely not least” in the show introductions. The adulation even extends to his fellow celebs. “I was in awe of him for the first week”, admits comedian Mark Dolan, a 33/1 outsider in this year’s competition. “I kept trying to sit next to him at lunch, but he’s like Tom Cruise: you’re not allowed to make eye contact without prior approval from his agent.” Not everyone is quite so starstruck: Josie Gibson, famous for winning one of the later Big Brothers, admits she had never heard of the Tour De France winner, while TOWIE’s Lydia Bright initially thought it was Christopher Biggins who would be donning the lycra. Did Wiggins take much encouraging? “It took a while, because I had just retired and I didn’t know what I wanted to do,” he admits. “I think it helped seeing that Robbie, Jason, Gareth and Louis were doing it. Because straight away I was like, ‘yeah, OK, it’s not like going into Big Brother’.” (More cynical types might suggest that Wiggins is using The Jump to distract from the controversy swirling around him and his Team Sky at the moment.) Learning a series of winter sports on the fly is certainly more challenging than the usual reality TV fare. But that might just be the appeal: one final opportunity for former elite athletes to prove themselves. Sure, it wouldn’t rank among their finest achievements – “I’d put the Cowbell trophy in the loft”, says Robinson, while Fowler jokes that he’s “looking forward to touring Liverpool on an open top bus” – but the sense of rivalry between the athletes seems genuine. This competitiveness is particularly acute for those who have competed in the Olympics, says Louis Smith. “Everyone expects Olympians to be this special breed and be good at everything. “I am shit-hot at skiing, though,” he adds. Wiggins is especially enamoured with the toboggan. “It was very similar to racing on the track,” he says. “The g force, the racing on the banking, all that feeling of speed, the minimal control of the thing – I just loved it. I hated it at first because they just sent us down it with no information, but by the end I loved it. It’s just brilliant, that feeling at the end, that speed you’re going, it’s exhilarating.” In the ante post betting odds, Wiggins is second favourite behind Smith, with Made in Chelsea’s Spencer Matthews a close third. But Wiggins doesn’t seem to be annoyed at not being favourite. “To be honest, it’s just a bit of fun. I don’t envisage myself winning. I’m quite realistic; I know there are better jumpers than me. My worst fear was going home week one or week two and just looking like a complete prat but I think I’ll be alright. I’m racing Mark Dolan the first week so …” Wiggins is right to be confident. In his ski slalom race in the opening episode, he beats Dolan by a couple of inches and avoids the dreaded jump-off. While it would be a stretch to suggest he looks a natural on the slopes, given that he’s only been skiing since the turn of the year, he does possess that infuriating mix of poise and intensity natural athletes tend to have. He looks a solid bet for The Jump’s coveted cowbell. But then, as so many times before on this most savage of reality contests, disaster strikes. Just as he eases down after victory, Wiggins begins to limp heavily. It emerges that during the race he has torn a muscle in his leg. After just one round, his future in The Jump is in severe doubt (a Channel 4 statement says Wiggins “remains in the competition”). Whether he will soldier on or exit early like so many before him remains unclear. What is clear is that The Jump is a risky business."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"politics/2017/feb/10/jeremy-hunt-nhs-problems-completely-unacceptable","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-10T08:46:39Z","webTitle":"Jeremy Hunt: NHS problems completely unacceptable","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/feb/10/jeremy-hunt-nhs-problems-completely-unacceptable","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/feb/10/jeremy-hunt-nhs-problems-completely-unacceptable","fields":{"headline":"Jeremy Hunt: NHS problems completely unacceptable","bodyText":"Jeremy Hunt has said that performance in some parts of the NHS is “completely unacceptable”. The health secretary said there was “no excuse” for some of the problems being seen in the health service and that some of the care being offered was not what anyone would want for their family. His remarks, in an interview with the BBC, came after official figures for December and leaked January statistics for waiting times in England showed consecutive months of the worst delays in A&amp;E since a four-hour target was introduced 13 years ago. Earlier, one of his key advisers, Patrick Carter, had said that hospitals were under such extreme pressure that they were in a state of war. On Thursday figures emerged showing that the number of A&amp;E patients seen within the target of four hours fell to a record low of 86% in England in December, while those waiting longer than 12 hours to be admitted to a hospital bed doubled to more than 2,500 in 2016. The leaked January figures suggested a worse performance on A&amp;E waiting times, with NHS England meeting its four hour target in 82% of cases. The number of people waiting more than two months to start cancer treatment after an urgent referral was at a record high of 25,157 in 2016, and the proportion of patients receiving hospital treatment within 18 weeks fell below 90% for the first time since 2011. Hunt said there was already a “big transformation programme” under way in the NHS with the aim of treating more people at home or in the community to ease burdens on hospitals. But he said the changes would take time and said progress had been “disappointingly slow” in some areas. “It is incredibly frustrating for me,” said the health secretary. “I am doing this job because I want NHS care to be the safest and best in the world. That kind of care is completely unacceptable. No one would want it for members of their own family.” He said there were no excuses for cases such as that of 89-year-old Iris Sibley, who was stuck on a hospital ward at Bristol Royal Infirmary for more than six months because a nursing home place could not be found for her. “It is terrible for Mrs Sibley but it is also very bad for the NHS,” Hunt said. He insisted the government was addressing problems in the social care system which are preventing many elderly and frail patients from being discharged from hospital – so-called “bed-blocking”. Hunt added: “The prime minister has been very clear: we recognise the pressure’s there. We recognise there is a problem about the sustainability of the social care system. That has to be addressed and we are going to do that.” Barrister Sir Robert Francis, whose 2013 report uncovered poor care in Mid Staffordshire, said the NHS was facing an “existential crisis” which made a further similar scandal inevitable. Francis, a non-executive director at the Care Quality Commission, told the Health Service Journal there was an “increasing disconnect” between what is said nationally about the NHS and “what people on the ground feel or see is going on”. “Let’s make no bones about it, the NHS is facing an existential crisis,” he said. “The service is running faster and faster to try and keep up and is failing, manifestly failing. “The danger is that we reach a tipping point; we haven’t reached it yet, but there will come a point where public confidence in the service dissipates.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/commentisfree/2017/feb/12/government-shows-contempt-for-millennials-no-wonder-theyre-not-optimistic-greg-jericho","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-11T22:12:19Z","webTitle":"Government shows contempt for millennials, no wonder they're not optimistic","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/commentisfree/2017/feb/12/government-shows-contempt-for-millennials-no-wonder-theyre-not-optimistic-greg-jericho","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/commentisfree/2017/feb/12/government-shows-contempt-for-millennials-no-wonder-theyre-not-optimistic-greg-jericho","fields":{"headline":"Government shows contempt for millennials, no wonder they're not optimistic","bodyText":"This week came the news that Australia’s millennial generation are the least optimistic in the world. Fortunately the study was done prior to this week’s events in the federal parliament, because any young person observing what the government did would quickly find themselves even more despondent. The big legislative move this week was the government seeking to pay for its child care policy by introducing numerous cuts to the family tax benefit and to areas which will affect young people more than others. Among the most pernicious was to increase the age at which someone is considered a “youth”. The government is seeking to raise the eligibility for Newstart from 22 to 25 years of age; all those under 25 would instead have to claim the Youth Allowance. For a single person living away that would mean going from receiving $528.70 a fortnight to $437.50. The reasoning for the policy goes some way to demonstrating the contempt this government has for young people. The social services minister, Christian Porter, told ABC’s RN drive on Thursday the reason for the change was that currently the system “structurally disincentives” people aged 22-24 from studying. This is because students are on the lower paying Youth Allowance rather than Newstart. Porter argued the system needed to be changed “because the option consistently exists for [the students] to go onto Newstart and receive slightly more money and not pursue studies”. Such a belief exhibits both a breathtaking lack of logic and a huge amount of disdain for the intelligence of 22-24 year olds. Porter is suggesting a 22-year-old would give up study and the prospects for a better paying job over the rest of his of her lifetime in order to get an extra $45 a week now. Even worse is that Porter’s own defence of the policy destroys the reasoning for it. He told ABC’s Patricia Karvelas the changes would not see people worse off because students are able to earn up to $437 a fortnight and still claim the full amount of the youth allowance. But the problem for Porter is that system already exists. If, by Porter’s own words, going from Newstart to Youth Allowance does not make someone “materially worse off ... if they are able to engage in employment”, then where is the disincentive to study? The reality is the change is all about saving money by targeting a segment of the voting public the government believes cannot hurt it at the ballot box. It has nothing at all to do with encouraging people to study. And cuts to Newstart are particularly harmful for young people, because youth are more likely to be unemployed than those over 25. People aged 20-24 account for 10% of the labour force but 19% of the unemployed. The unemployment rate for people aged 20-24 is now 10.5% – the highest it has been since 2001. Since the end of 2015, the unemployment rate for people over 25 has fallen from 4.6% to 4.2%; while for those aged 20-24 it has risen from 9% to the current rate. In periods of weak employment growth life is always toughest for the youth – especially when underemployment is also at record highs. You’re not only competing for work against those who are older and more experienced, you are also competing against those who are older and more experienced and who already have work but are looking for more hours. It’s worth noting that when Christian Porter was a 22-year-old in 1992, only around 15% of those aged 20 to 24 were studying full-time compared to around 31% now – and students are much more likely to be also working than were Porter’s generation back in the 1990s. But then as government backbencher Luke Howarth unintentionally revealed this week, life was a bit different for youth back then. Howarth argued that the big issue of housing affordability was young people not knowing how to save. He told the Federation Chamber that “I bought my first home when I was about 23. It cost me $93,000, I think, at the time, and I was earning about $27,000 a year working full time in retail.” As Buzzfeed’s Mark DiStefano noted a retail worker can now earn around twice what Howarth did, but the price of a first home at around $440,000 is nearly five times more than Howarth’s first home. I guess that’s just millennials’ fault for being born too late. There was also no joy for the younger generation on the issue that will affect them the most – climate change. Once there was a time when Malcolm Turnbull would make a speech to mark the launch of a plan for “zero carbon Australia”. He would argue that “we must move, if we are to effectively combat climate change to a situation where all or almost all of our energy comes from zero or very near zero emissions sources”. And back in 2010 Turnbull cared deeply about the lives of young people, arguing that “we are asking our own generation to make decisions; to make sacrifices, to make expenditures today so as to safeguard our children, their children and the generations that come after them”. Now he sits next to a treasurer who brought along a chunk of coal to question time. Now he is a man who uses the climate change denier code of “energy security”, praises coal as vital and decries moves towards greater use of renewable energy as “ideological”. Let us not say Turnbull is now a climate change denier, let us just say he is impersonating one so well that he has fully inhabited the role. He told parliament, despite all evidence to the contrary, that the load shedding of electricity in South Australia this week was due to a lack of wind and was a sign the state ALP government’s policy toward renewable energy was “a triumph of ideology over common sense” and had the state akin to “the third world”. But when asked about load shedding in the rather more coal-dependent, NSW suddenly all was well as he replied, “as long as it is controlled and planned, that can be done without impacting on households”. It’s a position that does not bode well for those of the generation who, unlike the prime minister’s, will actually have to deal with the consequences of inaction on climate change. And along with the changes to Newstart it does not suggest a government that particularly cares about the wellbeing, either now or in the future, of that younger generation."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/feb/10/donald-trump-agrees-support-one-china-policy-phone-call-xi-jinping","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-10T08:15:29Z","webTitle":"Trump agrees to support 'One China' policy in Xi Jinping call","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/feb/10/donald-trump-agrees-support-one-china-policy-phone-call-xi-jinping","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/feb/10/donald-trump-agrees-support-one-china-policy-phone-call-xi-jinping","fields":{"headline":"Trump agrees to support 'One China' policy in Xi Jinping call","bodyText":"Donald Trump has held his first telephone conversation with the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, since entering the White House, telling the Communist party leader he will not challenge Beijing by upending longstanding US policy towards Taiwan. In a brief statement the White House said the leaders of the world’s two largest economies had held a “lengthy” and “extremely cordial” telephone call on Thursday evening in which “numerous topics” were discussed. “President Trump agreed, at the request of President Xi, to honor our ‘One China’ policy,” the White House said, referring to a diplomatic understanding by which Washington does not challenge China’s claim over Taiwan, a democratically ruled island that Beijing considers a breakaway province. In a much lengthier account of the call Xinhua, China’s official news agency, said Xi had vowed to work with Trump’s administration to ensure relations could advance “in a sound and stable manner”. “The two countries are totally capable of becoming good cooperative partners,” Xi was quoted as telling Trump. “Trump said he was glad to talk over the phone with Xi,” Xinhua added, reporting that the two leaders had agreed to “keep close contact with each other” and to “strengthen mutually beneficial cooperation in trade and economy, investment as well as international affairs”. “Both of them expressed their eagerness to hold a meeting at an early date,” Xinhua said. Lu Kang, a spokesperson for China’s foreign ministry, told reporters the two presidents were looking forward to meeting in person “at their earliest convenience”, with officials from both countries now working towards such a get-together. “China and the US need to cooperate, and can cooperate in many areas,” Lu said. The cordial encounter follows an “unsafe” one on Wednesday in the South China Sea between a Chinese aircraft and a US Navy patrol plane. US Pacific Command spokesman Robert Shuford said on Friday the “interaction” between a Chinese KJ-200 early warning aircraft and a US Navy P-3C plane happened in international airspace but did not say what was regarded as unsafe. Shuford said the US plane was on a routine mission and operating according to international law. The Chinese defence ministry has not responded to a request by Associated Press for comment. Following his shock election in November last year, Trump had infuriated and unnerved Beijing by questioning his administration’s commitment to the “One China” policy and holding an unprecedented phone conversation with Taiwan’s president, Tsai Ing-wen. His team, which includes several notorious China policy hawks, had also threatened a much harder line against Beijing on issues such as trade and the South China Sea, where Trump has accused China of building a “massive fortress”. On Tuesday some of the world’s leading China specialists had warned that already “precarious” ties between Beijing and Washington could be plunged into a dangerous new era, partly as a result of Trump’s rise to power. Bonnie Glaser, the director of the China power project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) think tank in Washington, said the long-awaited conversation between the two leaders, which had taken almost three weeks to arrange, would calm fears that US-China relations were on the verge of a damaging breakdown. “I think the entire region will heave a sigh of relief here,” she said. “One hopes that what this understanding has achieved is to enable the US and China to head off a major crisis.” Glaser said she believed China had been holding off arranging a phone call with Trump until it was convinced he would not seek to challenge Beijing over Taiwan. “The Chinese were unwilling to have that conversation unless and until they were sure it would resolve this problem,” she said. “There has been ongoing discussion in the Trump administration over the last several weeks about what to do on this issue … It became clear that the relationship would be frozen in the absence of Trump taking a firm position.” The White House statement said the two presidents had “extended invitations to meet in their respective countries” and that officials from both countries would now engage in “discussions and negotiations on various issues of mutual interest”. “President Trump and President Xi look forward to further talks with very successful outcomes,” it added. Tensions between Washington and Beijing mounted after Trump’s election, with the incoming president angering Beijing by hinting he was considering changing foreign policy on Taiwan unless trade concessions were made. Beijing warned Taiwan was a “non-negotiable” issue after the billionaire said “everything is under negotiation”. Paul Haenle, a veteran US diplomat who is the director of the Carnegie–Tsinghua Centre in Beijing, said he believed secretary of state Rex Tillerson had convinced Trump to pull back from his threats to ditch “One China”. “Trump had been toying with the notion of trying to use it to get leverage with the Chinese but was convinced that it was in the US interests to abide by it … Trump was convinced, and rightly so, that the ‘One China’ policy is not something we do because it is good for Beijing. It is in America’s interests. “It’s good news and a positive development for the relationship,” Haenle said of the call. “It will allow the US and China to get on to the more difficult issues that really need work such as trade, North Korea and the South China Sea. “This will open the door now for the US and China to begin to develop the relationship that will allow them to tackle some of the more difficult and contentious issues.” Shen Dingli, a professor of international relations from Shanghai’s Fudan University who had previously called on Beijing to close its embassy in Washington because of Trump’s threats, welcomed the White House’s concession to Xi. “It is good for the two countries and the Asia-Pacific. Now we can have a predictable relationship.” Had Trump followed through on threats to alter US policy on Taiwan he would have caused “big trouble”, he added. “Beijing must feel much relief at the message.” Additional reporting by Wang Zhen"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/feb/10/australians-are-worried-about-trump-but-theres-a-lot-to-be-worried-about-at-home","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-10T03:40:32Z","webTitle":"Australians are worried about Trump.

But there's a lot to be worried about at home","bodyText":"Last week, for the second time, former Labor leader Mark Latham appeared on The Convict Report, aka The Dingoes, an Australian “alt-right” podcast. It’s part of the network of podcasts hosted by The Right Stuff, a major international far right hub. That’s the same website whose major players have been recently doxxed by the left, and whose unmasking as promoters of fascist ideology has, in some cases brought suitably ruinous consequences. In previous episodes, the pseudonymous hosts of the show have aligned themselves with Richard Spencer and other alt-right figures. The Dingoes attempt to produce the same edgy fare as The Right Stuff flagships like The Daily Shoah, but they sound a little too much like chinless Young Liberal nerds to bring any real menace. It’s significant, though, that Latham is prepared to go on their show more than once. Apparently, a show with previous episode titles like “I never want to see your race again”, which regularly spouts casual antisemitism and undergraduate race theory, and which has open fascist links, is not beyond the pale for a Sky News commentator. Despite the fact that disclaimers were offered about opinions not necessarily aligning, Latham was happy to be there. “I saw some dickhead lefty saying I’d lost all credibility by appearing on the Dingoes. I saw that as a very good sign”, he said. “I took it as a badge of honour”. He also expressed common cause with his alt-right hosts. “We’re howling right across the universe at the moment, the outsider rebellion.” It’s also significant that Latham’s main purpose seemed to be to praise Cory Bernardi’s decision to break away from the Liberals and form his own party. “He’s found that in the modern Liberal party there’s no place for a serious libertarian like him. The Liberal party has become fundamentally anti-freedom and timid.” Bernardi’s recognised that if you’re going to get rid of 18C, Safe Schools, safe spaces, trigger warnings, bogus cultural Marxism programs in our schools; if you’re going to clean out the ABC, clean out the Human Rights Commission, get rid of social engineering and political correctness in Australia well you need to be a bit more robust than civility conservatives. So I think he’s looked at the Liberal party and thought, effectively, that they’re useless. Latham praised Bernardi in terms of many of the senator’s own expressed dissatisfactions, and was happy to use a buzz phrase – “cultural Marxism” – that has crossed over from the far right to the vocabulary of more mainstream conservatives. Late last month, in the Daily Telegraph, Latham had issued a 10-point “Outsiders manifesto” for Australia, which also touched on many of Bernardi’s obsessions: the Human Rights Commission, “social engineering” and “man-bashing” in schools, the promotion of “western civilisation”, and “pushing back against the spread of radical Islam – the greatest human rights threat to our society”, Latham wrote. Speaking of Islam, Bernardi will be appearing on Friday night, along with George Christensen (who has wavered over his LNP membership), as a speaker for a $150 a plate dinner for The Q Society. That’s the secretive Australian group that describes Islam as a “totalitarian ideology”, once hosted a visit far right Dutch populist Geert Wilders, and opposed the construction of the Bendigo Mosque. Bernardi also has other, perhaps even stranger connections. In particular, he has a long relationship with a group called the Sydney Traditionalist Forum. They describe themselves as “the first explicitly paleoconservative-leaning association in Australia, and “the only local group that embraces the political currents of contemporary dissident reaction”. Their purpose is to provide “a forum where ideas once understood to be common sense can be exchanged, debated and discussed, unfettered and ungagged by modern liberal thought-control”. That forum has been extensively used to promote the wisdom of Bernardi – he has frequently appeared as the “Quote of the Week” on the website, and his collected works have been extensively discussed there. Their convenor, Edwin Dyga, introduced Bernardi at a dinner for Australian conservative magazine, Quadrant. Perhaps he was returning a favour: Bernardi introduced a documentary screening at a “SydneyTrads” event in 2013. (The film, “Agenda” , is a lurid retelling of the “cultural Marxism” fable). Their website is otherwise full of would-be highbrow, reactionary essays against feminism, equality, and the alleged evils of the Frankfurt School. Their events include European reactionaries, and acknowledged sources for the alt-right, like French philosopher Alain De Benoist, who has also appeared at conferences organised by American alt-right doyen, Richard Spencer. Alexander Reid Ross is an anti-fascist researcher, lecturer at Portland State University, and author of the new book, Against The Fascist Creep. In his opinion, based on looking at their published materials, the Sydney Trads are “an alt-right style umbrella group” which mixes elements of the neoreactionary movement, paleoconservatism, traditionalist Christianity, and the European New Right in its publications and events. It may be small, but he points out that the alt-right used to be too. Bernardi’s sponsorship of their events can only be interpreted as an attempt to support their growth. Ross says that while the alt-right proper is distinguished by beliefs like the necessity of a white ethnostate, one which Bernardi has never expressed, the “positions and semiotics of this party put it unequivocally on the radical right”. He expressed the opinion that, “there’s Islamophobia, misogyny, and interestingly a rejection of the mainstream media, where he sees them as largely liberal or on the left.” Also important according to Ross is the vociferous rejection of mainstream conservatism, which has powered the momentum of populist leaders like Trump and Marine Le Pen, but is also crucial to fascist movements. From my current perch in the United States, I have seen many Australians express voluminous concern about the ascent of Donald Trump. To a large extent, this is appropriate. For better or worse , Australia’s fate is tied to the United States, and trends in Australia are not unrelated to what’s happening in the US. The far right has made their own efforts international in scope; we should respond in kind. But there is a lot to worry about at home. The links between the far right and figures like Latham and Bernardi – who have mainstream platforms – suggest that there are few barriers between fascist currents and the heart of Australia’s political process. Their positions are similar in nature to radical rightwing populists elsewhere. Bernardi may never win government, but governments may have to make deals with him or One Nation, or go after their radicalised supporters. As we have seen over the last 20 years, that’s a recipe for dragging the whole show to the right."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"us-news/2017/feb/10/tom-price-confirmed-health-secretary-trump","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-10T07:33:13Z","webTitle":"Vehement Obamacare critic Tom Price confirmed as US health secretary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/feb/10/tom-price-confirmed-health-secretary-trump","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/feb/10/tom-price-confirmed-health-secretary-trump","fields":{"headline":"Vehement Obamacare critic Tom Price confirmed as US health secretary","bodyText":"The US Senate has confirmed conservative Georgia representative Tom Price as Donald Trump’s health secretary, an appointment that suggests a radical shift in American healthcare over the next four years. In a late-night vote sharply divided along party lines, the 62-year-old former orthopedic surgeon was confirmed by 52 votes to 47. He will lead an agency with a $1.1tn budget, made up of some of America’s largest public health insurance programs, which he has spent much of his career attacking. As a congressman he supported privatizing Medicare, America’s public health insurance for the elderly. He proposed turning Medicaid, a program for the poor, into a block grant – a change certain to precipitate cuts. Price campaigned relentlessly to repeal the Affordable Care Act, Barack Obama’s signature health law, which brought consumer protections and government subsidies to an unwieldy private insurance market. The law helped insure 20 million Americans. If such changes were enacted they would amount to critical shifts in American healthcare, arguably the most expensive and complex system in the world. Price’s nomination process has also been plagued by allegations of insider trading. Price bought and sold health stocks repeatedly even though he was a leading voice on healthcare policy in the US House of Representatives. In one case, he was offered a discounted price for an Australian company called Innate Immunotherapeutics for between $50,000 and $100,000 worth of stock. At the same time, another Trump transition team member and fellow House colleague, Chris Collins, was one of the company’s main investors. In another instance, Price purchased up to $15,000 worth of stock in Zimmer Bionet, one of the world’s lead orthopedic device manufacturers, before filing a bill less than one week later that could have aided the medical device market. In yet another instance, Price introduced a bill that could have potentially benefitted durable medical goods manufacturers, before purchasing $15,000 worth of shares in Blackstone, which owns medical durable goods manufacturer Apria, according to USA Today. The same investigation found Price misstated the timing and value of his purchases in several instances. Price has always denied any wrongdoing. Throughout hearings, he maintained that his broker was in charge of buying and selling stocks, and that in most cases he had no knowledge of the trades. His broker arrangement is far from a blind trust though, and in the Innate Immunotherapeutics case Price testified that he personally instructed his broker to purchase the stock. Democratic opponents, keen to keep the Affordable Care Act in place, called on the Securities and Exchange Commission to investigate Price. When Democrats boycotted his hearing before the Senate finance committee, Republicans changed the rules to advance his candidacy without them. It was not only Price’s opposition to the ACA that has raised the hackles of Democrats. Price is vehemently anti-abortion, and anti-gay rights. He called an escrow account established for victims of the Gulf of Mexico BP oil spill a “Chicago-style political shakedown”. He voted against allowing the Food and Drug Administration to regulate tobacco. He voted against federal funding for syringe exchange programs, which are proven to reduce HIV infection rates, even as injection drug use in his district was on the rise. Price’s stances on medical issues are so controversial even doctors were divided by his nomination, despite his physician bona fides. While Price’s proposals represent the near polar-opposite of the current ACA, emphasizing that the free market and doctors could best determine how to treat patients, his testimony was almost conciliatory. “Many individuals have coverage, they have a card, but they don’t have any care,” Price said during a recent hearing. “It’s imperative we have a system that is accessible for every American, affordable for every American.” His broad assertions about affordability and access have left many attempting to read tea leaves to determine which, among several Republican proposals including Price’s, would make it into an actual plan. So far, Republicans have made seemingly contradictory proposals for “insurance for everybody” and to end the individual mandate, the element of Obamacare that requires people to have insurance. “I have had conversations with the president about healthcare, yes,” Price said at another point in his hearing, though he offered no details of what those conversations entailed. Recent protests against the repeal of the ACA ensure that, whatever Price’s role in replacement is, it is unlikely to go unnoticed."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/feb/10/hundreds-whales-die-mass-stranding-new-zealand-beach","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-10T03:52:07Z","webTitle":"Hundreds of whales die in mass stranding on New Zealand beach","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/feb/10/hundreds-whales-die-mass-stranding-new-zealand-beach","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/feb/10/hundreds-whales-die-mass-stranding-new-zealand-beach","fields":{"headline":"Hundreds of whales die in mass stranding on New Zealand beach","bodyText":"Rescuers are trying to save dozens of whales after a mass stranding on a New Zealand beach thought to be the largest in decades. The Department of Conservation (DOC) discovered 416 pilot whales had beached themselves overnight at Farewell Spit in Golden Bay at the top of the South Island, with more than 70% dying by the time dawn broke on Friday. DOC staff and dozens of volunteers were on hand on Friday morning trying to save the remaining 100 whales. Peter Wiles, who was one of the first volunteers to reach Farewell Spit, told Fairfax New Zealand that the white bellies of the whale corpses were lined up on the sand and floating in the shallows. “It is one of the saddest things I have seen, that many sentient creatures just wasted on the beach.” As the morning wore on, an urgent plea was issued for locals to drop work and school commitments and head to the remote beach to save the whales, bringing towels, buckets and sheets to keep them cool, calm and wet. Andrew Lamason, a team leader for the DOC Takaka area, said the stranding was the largest in living memory, and although he had “no clue” why the whales had beached themselves this time, Golden Bay was conducive to strandings because of its shallow bay, which made it difficult for whales to swim out once they’d entered. At high tide, at 10.30am, the 100 remaining whales were successfully refloated, but early in the afternoon at low tide 90 of them re-beached themselves. DOC staff and up to 500 volunteers are now focused on keeping the surviving whales as healthy as possible until the next high tide at lunchtime tomorrow. Lamason said it was common for whales involved in a mass stranding to re-beach themselves, because they were social animals and would stay in close proximity to their pod, the majority of which were now lying dead on the beach. “We are trying to swim the whales out to sea and guide them but they don’t really take directions, they go where they want to go. Unless they get a couple of strong leaders who decide to head out to sea, the remaining whales will try and keep with their pod on the beach.” Lamason said whale strandings, which were common in Golden Bay, were an emotionally exhausting event, and anyone who wasn’t fit and strong and equipped to cope with the trauma were advised to stay away from the beach and not participate in the rescue effort. “It is cold, it’s wet and some of us have been in and out of the water for nine hours now, we can only cope with robust volunteers, not ones that are going to break down, which happens quite often.” he said. “We are in the farthest corner of the universe here but now volunteers have started turning up en masse and there are hundreds of people here and they have brought food and supplies so they are prepared to be here all day and all night if needed.” The beach was still littered with the bodies of the nearly 300 dead pilot whales which died overnight, but plans for disposing of their bodies naturally at sea were on hold while rescuers “concentrated on the living”, Lamason said. The stranding at Farewell Spit makes it the third largest whale stranding in New Zealand’s recorded history. In 1918, 1,000 whales beached themselves on the Chatham Islands, and in 1985 450 stranded at Great Barrier Island off the coast of Auckland. According to Project Jonah, a whale rescue group, New Zealand has one of the highest rates of whale strandings in the world, and on average about 300 whales and dolphins beach themselves on Kiwi shores every year. The reasons for whales strandings are still unclear, but it is thought a combination of factors contribute, with old, sick and injured whales being particularly vulnerable. Navigational errors among pods are also common, especially when chasing food or coming close to shore to avoid predators such as orcas. Since 1840, more than 5,000 whales and dolphins have beached themselves on New Zealand shores according to DOC records. Strandings occur year round, but usually involve only one or two animals. DOC respond to about 85 events a year, usually involving just a single animal."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/blog/2017/feb/10/talking-horses-goingstick-friday-kempton","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-10T12:10:51Z","webTitle":"Talking Horses: GoingStick news plus best bets for Friday at Kempton | Chris Cook","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2017/feb/10/talking-horses-goingstick-friday-kempton","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/blog/2017/feb/10/talking-horses-goingstick-friday-kempton","fields":{"headline":"Talking Horses: GoingStick news plus best bets for Friday at Kempton","bodyText":"Today’s best bets, by Chris Cook I’m a fan of the GoingStick and perhaps you are too, since any technology that gives an objective insight into the state of the going must be of interest to any punter. Well, there may be developments afoot because I can exclusively reveal that racing’s powerful are going to make a study of The Stick to see if they can do a bit better for punters and indeed trainers who want to know what the ground is like. The British Horseracing Authority tells me: “A cross-industry working party has been established to review the use of the GoingStick and to determine whether there are any practical steps that can be taken to increase its accuracy, improve the manner in which it is used by racecourses and to make its data more relevant and user-friendly.” I was a tad worried by the news, at first, jumping to the (wrong) conclusion that this might be the beginning of a cost-saving exercise that would conclude The Stick wasn’t worth the candle. After all, each GoingStick costs almost £4,000 and, every time you want readings from your racecourse, a member of staff has to spend 90 minutes gathering the data. Happily, the signs are all the other way, that this is indeed about making better use of The Stick. Indeed, TurfTrax, who make the GoingSticks, tell me they asked for this working party last year and are looking forward “to taking part in discussions about how the racing industry can benefit from advances in technology”. Feedback from racecourse officials suggests there is plenty of faith in GoingStick measurements at free-draining tracks like Goodwood, Epsom and Kempton. Reservations are more likely to be held by those working at tracks with more complicated soil structures. Chris Stickels (Ascot) and Kirkland Tellwright (Haydock) are the clerks of the course appointed to this working party, due to meet for the first time on Monday. Stickels is broadly positive about the GoingStick, while Tellwright has more reservations. Both men see the benefit of having an objective measurement of ground conditions if it can be made to work and both hope to see an advance in the next generation of GoingStick. From a punters’ perspective, what I really want to see is consistent taking and reporting of readings from tracks around the country. I’m aware of six tracks which have failed to report a GoingStick reading for at least one raceday since Christmas, while two others have produced readings from one or two days before the raceday. We can’t hope to put the data to good use if we don’t have the data. Even more annoying, in my book, are the tracks that don’t produce a GoingStick reading on the day before a fixture, when tipsters and punters are working away at a card and connections are trying to decide whether they want to run. It’s at that time that insights into ground conditions are most valuable. Some tracks take their responsibilities very seriously, others seem to neglect them. British racing could use a standardised approach in this and other areas. And so to today’s racing. I’m grateful to a Racing Post feature today for pointing out that Nick Williams has a fine record with hurdlers running in handicaps for the first time because it just so happens that I fancy two of his Kempton runners today who fit that profile, albeit the Post stats relate to more valuable races than are taking place this afternoon. Grand Coureur (1.40) is a half-brother to a Listed winner in France and showed significant improvement in his latest novice hurdle to be second at Bangor after setting the pace. He has to step up again on that form in order to win this but I’m sure that he can, especially with a return to more conservative tactics. While he’s on offer at 7-1, Williams’s One Of Us (3.45) has been backed from 15-2 down to 9-2 for a later handicap hurdle. A useful sort in bumpers, he put up two fair efforts over hurdles in the autumn, about six weeks before Williams really hit some kind of form. There’s plenty more to come now that the horse steps up in distance from a fair opening mark. He’s out of a half-sister to the Grand National winner Rule The World and three miles is likely to be his trip in time. Bangor’s card has survived the elements and closes with a hot-looking hunter chase. I’ll take a chance on Poole Master (5.00) at 15-2, he having needed the run when well beaten by Grand Vision at Warwick, where he led to two out. Though he lost his way in his last season with David Pipe, he was a Grand Sefton winner off 142, so there is plenty of ability in there if Chris Honour has been able to rekindle same. Honour was his regular jockey six years ago when the horse was just starting out.

What a shame she didn’t give them her vote","bodyText":"What should happen to the EU citizens who came to the UK before Brexit? In theory, the answer should be simple: both sides in the referendum campaign, as well as large majorities of leave and remain voters, believe that their rights to stay in the UK should be protected. Which raises two questions: should their right to stay be guaranteed by the UK unilaterally, in advance of a deal with the EU on reciprocal rights for UK citizens in the EU? And how exactly would this right apply in practice? Last autumn, the NGO British Future set up an inquiry to make the case for a unilateral guarantee, and to look into the details of how it should work. It was chaired by Gisela Stuart, the Labour MP who strongly supported the leave side in the referendum, and the panel included people from both sides of the Brexit debate, including me. I agreed to participate because, as a specialist in EU free movement law, I thought I could help with some of the legal detail we were looking at. Also, as a remain supporter, I thought that it was a good idea for those on the two different sides to work together on an issue we could all agree upon, rather than continue to be divided. In particular, I thought that Stuart would do a good job making the case for a unilateral guarantee. The report of the inquiry, which came out in December, indeed argued for EU citizens’ rights in the UK to be guaranteed unilaterally, while seeking a reciprocal deal on UK citizens in the EU. It also recommended how to accomplish this in detail – for instance, by waiving the rules that make it hard for many EU citizens married to UK citizens to get permanent residence status. Gisela Stuart chaired the inquiry well, and initially did a good job advocating its findings in public. For instance, she told one newspaper that “Britain should make the first move to demonstrate goodwill”. So far, so good. But on Wednesday night, she bottled it. She voted against an amendment to the Brexit bill – tabled by her own party – that would have guaranteed those rights. (So did Suella Fernandes, a Conservative MP who also participated in the British Future inquiry). There’s little point to an inquiry chair who votes against the policy she agreed to advocate. Moreover, she had no good reason for doing so. The amendment would not have blocked Brexit; rather it would have guaranteed EU citizens’ rights separately from triggering article 50. Leavers didn’t like the idea of amendments to the bill, but they could have made a principled case for this one, as a single exception to their rule. Although the home secretary offered assurances on this issue that satisfied some potential rebels, they should not have sold their votes so quickly. Those assurances don’t extend to a unilateral guarantee for EU nationals; they’re just a vague promise to table a bill of some sort in the future. This means that EU citizens face many months more uncertainty. So do their employers, as Séamus Nevin of the Institute of Directors (who was also part of the inquiry) has pointed out. If there’s one thing people don’t like about politics, it’s two-faced politicians. MPs who support a policy should simply vote in favour of it, not against it – in particular if they have chaired an inquiry advocating that very policy. There’s still time for Stuart to do the right thing. Hopefully, the House of Lords will insist on an amendment on this issue, giving her the chance to execute a graceful U-turn. If not, there’s that future bill some day. For my part, if the inquiry were reconvened for whatever reason, I wouldn’t serve with her again and be a figleaf for her nakedly cynical tactics."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"law/2017/feb/10/sir-elihu-lauterpacht-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"law","sectionName":"Law","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-10T16:14:01Z","webTitle":"Sir Elihu Lauterpacht obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2017/feb/10/sir-elihu-lauterpacht-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/law/2017/feb/10/sir-elihu-lauterpacht-obituary","fields":{"headline":"Sir Elihu Lauterpacht obituary","bodyText":"In 1993, the scholar and international lawyer Sir Elihu Lauterpacht, who has died aged 88, played a leading role in the genocide case filed against Serbia at the international court of justice in The Hague. As an ad hoc judge appointed by Bosnia-Herzegovina, he ruled to ensure that the court protected the needs of individuals, the “ultimate beneficiaries of the legal system”, in a case he believed to have “a human dimension of a magnitude without precedent in [the ICJ’s] history”. Serving on the World Bank administrative tribunal (1980-98, for the last two years as president), he contributed to a series of landmark decisions to protect the rights of employees against the power of international organisations. As an advocate, he took on cases that consistently broke new ground, including New Zealand’s 1995 challenge to French nuclear testing in the South Pacific, which led to the ICJ’s recognition that the protection of the environment formed part of general international law. At Cambridge University, he founded in 1983 what is now the Lauterpacht Centre for International Law, focused on scholarship that is practical and progressive. In all these activities, his great passion was the practice of public international law in all its forms. Called to the bar at Gray’s Inn in 1950, he began a career that touched on a multitude of subjects and places, among them the negotiation of the UN convention on the law of the sea, the 1994 peace treaty between Israel and Jordan, the Eritrea-Ethiopia Boundary Commission and the peaceful resolution of a land dispute between Egypt and Israel. From his first case at the ICJ – the nationalisation of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company – in 1951 to the last in 2014, and at other courts in between, he engaged with the changes to the international legal order that followed the end of the second world war. The ICJ, the primary judicial body of the United Nations, had begun work in 1946, and Lauterpacht’s early role in it enabled him to help others to follow. In advising a panoply of individuals, NGOs, corporations and other organisations, he contributed to the enhanced role they now play in international affairs. Born in Cricklewood, north-west London, Elihu was the son of Jewish parents. Recently arrived from Vienna, his mother, Rachel (nee Steinberg), was a pianist; his father, Hersch, born near Lviv (the one-time Lwów) in what is now Ukraine, was a legal academic at the London School of Economics. The family moved to Cambridge in 1937 when Hersch was appointed to a chair, and in 1941 Elihu was evacuated to the US, and studied at Phillips academy, Andover, Massachusetts. In 1945 he returned to Britain to study at Harrow school and then Trinity College, Cambridge – first history, then law. An only child, he followed his father into international law scholarship but forged his own path: departing from his father’s inclination towards theory, yet sharing the commitment to the law as a means of delivering international justice, he focused more on what was practicable. This caused him to place the accent on legal practice and on the role of international courts and tribunals in making international law more effective. In 1953 he was appointed to a fell- owship at Trinity and an assistant lectureship in the law faculty; an honorary professorship came in 1994. I was among the fortunate beneficiaries of the generous support he gave to his “former pupils”. From 1960 onwards he edited the International Law Reports, a principal source of reference across the globe. He wrote on the administration of international justice, edited several volumes of his father’s collected papers, and in 2010 published a meticulous biography of his father. To each case – as advocate or adjudicator – Lauterpacht brought particular skills: a deep knowledge of historical context; an ability to master the facts and explain them (his argument to the ICJ on the practicalities of exploding an underground nuclear device remains a first point of reference for any international advocate who faces the challenge of arguing a point of science before a panel of 15 or more international judges); and a special sense as to what might be persuasive to an international judge. He was a fearlessly independent advocate in whose hands a turgid treaty or fact could be made interesting, always in a tone that was fair, easy on the ear and persuasive. He was appointed a QC in 1970 and knighted in 1998. Warm and humane, Lauterpacht was without pomposity of the kind that characterised the once fusty world of international law. In 1996, when we appeared together for Ireland in a planning inquiry on the disposal of nuclear waste at Sellafield, he delighted in a hearing in the small town of Cleator Moor in Cumbria that was held in a glorified Portakabin, and was even more delighted when his arguments prevailed – the burden of proof lay on Nirex, the nuclear industry body, “to show that no danger can or will arise” from accidental discharges. The application for a deep waste repository was rejected by the environment secretary, John Gummer, and has not been revived. Lauterpacht was never starry-eyed about international law: he recognised law’s role in international relations, but also its limits. The large, book-lined study at his open, inviting home was a place that no former pupil could forget, truly a room of learning and laughter. In 1955 he married Judith Hettinger, with whom he had three children, Deborah, Gabriel and Michael. After Judith’s death in 1970, he married Cathy Daly, and together they had a son, Conan. He is survived by Cathy and his children. • Elihu Lauterpacht, international lawyer, born 28 July 1928; died 8 February 2017"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2017/feb/13/nintendo-switch-it-may-be-weird-but-it-is-for-everyone","type":"article","sectionId":"games","sectionName":"Games","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-13T17:28:11Z","webTitle":"Nintendo Switch: new console may be weird, but it is for everyone","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/feb/13/nintendo-switch-it-may-be-weird-but-it-is-for-everyone","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2017/feb/13/nintendo-switch-it-may-be-weird-but-it-is-for-everyone","fields":{"headline":"Nintendo Switch: new console may be weird, but it is for everyone","bodyText":"The Nintendo Switch is the weirdest games console to hit the market since … well, the last games console Nintendo released. When docked to the TV, the slim black device could be mistaken for one of the company’s previous consoles. The “Joy-Con” controllers give away that something’s up, though: even in their most traditional configuration, clicked in to a mounting device to be used as a classic dual-analogue-stick handset, they’re still fairly oddly shaped. But it’s when you unclip the Joy-Cons—with a smooth, satisfying click, and undock the Switch from its hub next to your TV, that the full rationale for the thing becomes clear. The controllers clip into the side of the 6in touchscreen, the game seamlessly continues working, and the whole system becomes portable. To a certain extent, it’s an evolution of the design that lay at the heart of the Wii U, Nintendo’s disastrous attempt to follow up the breakout hit it had with the motion-controlled Wii. The Wii U was oriented around the GamePad, a bulky wireless controller with a touchscreen in the centre, that could be used as a second screen for some games, or as the main screen for games played while the TV itself was turned off. The idea may have been sound, but it failed to catch consumers’ imagination, with abysmal sales forcing the company to turn to the success of its 3DS mobile console for financial salvation. Despite that, there are obvious similarities between the Wii U and the Switch. The newer device, when undocked and used in its portable mode, looks like a sleek upgrade to the 2012 console’s controller – except the entire machine is contained in its slim form. So is the Switch an evolution of the Wii U or an attempt to go down a different path entirely? Shinya Takahashi, director and general manager at Nintendo’s entertainment planning and development division, claims it’s really neither. “I think it’s the product of us applying all the knowledge that we’ve built up over the years of designing hardware systems, and putting that into one device,” he said. “Certainly as a facet of that, we did look at some of the areas where people were, maybe, not fully satisfied with the Wii U hardware. For example, with Wii U, you could play on the Wii U gamepad, but you couldn’t play, really, away from the living room, and now that’s become possible with the Nintendo Switch.” Takahashi’s career at Nintendo began in 1989, and he has fulfilled numerous roles in that time. He has worked in game development, starting out on the acclaimed Nintendo 64 version of jet ski racer, Wave Race, but he has also managed teams, overseeing projects like Pokémon Stadium and Wii Sports Motion. When Nintendo merged its software and hardware research division in 2015, it was Takahashi who was put in charge. In short, he’s the developer’s developer, the head of the Nintendo’s in-house creatives. Takahashi’s deputy is Yoshiaki Koizumi, the general producer for the Switch, and the breakout star of Nintendo’s livestream event introducing the machine to the world. Where Takahashi is the picture of the Japanese otaku, bouncy and enthusiastic about the games he makes, Koizumi has managed to create a heartthrob persona. Cool and measured, he speaks and looks like he’s stepped out of an advert for Yamazaki whisky. When asked about what distinguishes the Switch from the Wii U, he points out that the new device began with the two controllers. “This is something that Nintendo has done with some previous consoles, although it was quite a while back and so some may have forgotten,” he says. “We wanted to start with the premise of two or more people playing together. “That idea was very important to us as a concept, and it’s an idea that we’re carrying forward as we’re thinking about how this hardware is different from previous generations.” Koizumi backs this up by turning to one of the system’s two first-party launch games: 1-2 Switch, a party game plucked straight from the historical highs of Nintendo weirdness. The game tasks players with competing in a raft of bizarre minigames, from milking cows to rocking babies to sleep, using the Joy-Con controllers. Notably, a significant chunk of the games are designed to be played without looking at the screen at all, instead relying on audio cues from the speakers and vibration from the controller. Nintendo intends players to look at each other while they play, with Koizumi pulling a playing card out of his pocket to demonstrate the similarities with card games of yore – and with Nintendo’s own history: the company started off making cards in Kyoto in 1889. It’s a shame, then, that 1-2 Switch also breaks with another trend of Nintendo’s recent past, coming as a separate purchase rather than a pack-in title in the vein of Wii Sports and NintendoLand. Takahashi argues that the software fits in the broader spectrum of year-one titles, “starting with Mario Kart followed then by ARMS followed by Splatoon 2, and then, of course, working towards Super Mario Odyssey at the end of the year. “So we felt that between this strong line-up, and the strength of the titles, as well as the strength of the 1-2 Switch software itself, that it didn’t feel to us that should be bundled with the hardware, but rather was something that we felt stands alone within that overall first-year line-up.” But the lack of a bundled game adds to the already high cost of the Switch. Launching at £279.99, it’s the most expensive Nintendo console for a long time – and, in fact, the most expensive console on the market. Adding the £34.99 cost of 1-2 Switch would take it above the cost of even the premium edition of the Wii U, which launched at £300. That cost is part of the reason that, although the Switch is being positioned as a hybrid console, the 3DS, Nintendo’s previous portable console, is sticking around. “The Switch isn’t necessarily a successor” to the 3DS, Takahashi says. “We’re releasing software into next year: the fact that it’s a system with a low price and a larger library makes it appealing to kids, who might want to buy it as their first console.” So who is the Switch for? “As broad an audience as possible,” says Takahashi, unsurprisingly. “The hardware is designed to be flexible, for every use case”. The pair of launch games, Zelda: Breath of the Wild and 1-2 Switch, meanwhile, are also aimed, he says, at the two ends of Nintendo’s demographic, providing a broad and expansive experience for the hardcore, and a more casual experience for those who came to Nintendo around the time of the Wii launch. But most importantly, the hoped-for audience is anyone who’ll find the flexibility of the Switch appealing. “As game developers,” says Koizumi, “we think about how these experiences can contribute to you life, and we think it does make a real difference. When people start using it, they’ll see that.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"books/2017/feb/17/the-best-recent-crime-novels-review-roundup","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-17T12:00:09Z","webTitle":"The best recent crime novels – review roundup","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/feb/17/the-best-recent-crime-novels-review-roundup","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2017/feb/17/the-best-recent-crime-novels-review-roundup","fields":{"headline":"The best recent crime novels – review roundup","bodyText":"The first novel written in English by Romanian author EO Chirovici is a sophisticated take, complete with framing devices and plenty of mind games, on a simple whodunit. The Book of Mirrors (Century, £12.99) begins when New York literary agent Peter Katz receives an unfinished manuscript dealing with the events leading up to the unsolved murder, almost 30 years earlier, of Princeton psychology professor Joseph Wieder. When Katz learns that the author has died and the remainder of the text is nowhere to be found, he hires journalist John Keller to try and discover the truth. Keller, tiring of teasing out hard information from a tangle of contradictory accounts and clashing agendas, passes the baton back to Roy Freeman, the original detective on the case. Freeman, now retired and in the initial stages of Alzheimer’s, nevertheless manages, with the aid of some surprising new information, to bring the story full circle. A study of manipulation and the protean character of memory, The Book of Mirrors is slow-burning but entirely compelling. Paula Daly’s fourth novel, The Trophy Child (Bantam, £12.99), deals with a psychological experiment of a different kind. Tiger mum Karen Bloom is determined that her daughter, 10-year-old Brontë, will excel in life. Tutoring the poor kid to the point of exhaustion, she ignores her stoner son, troubled teenage stepdaughter and husband, Noel, who has abdicated his parental responsibilities in favour of picking up women in bars. One of these is DS Joanne Aspinall, who is called in to investigate after Brontë goes missing. The child returns unhurt, but not before Karen has provoked public outrage with her ill-advised comments (“this is not some council estate case”) to the press. When Karen is found murdered, not only does Aspinall find herself with a long list of suspects, but she also has to face the possibility that her attraction to Noel may be clouding her professional judgment. Not a particularly complex read, but a terrific page turner. Rennie Airth’s fifth John Madden mystery, The Death of Kings (Mantle, £18.99), begins in 1938 with the killing of actor Portia Blake during a smart house party in Kent. Eleven years later, retired chief inspector Angus Sinclair receives an anonymous letter and a jade pendant apparently worn by Blake on the day of her death, and begins to wonder if the wrong man was hanged for the crime. Scotland Yard are reluctant to reopen the case, and, laid up with gout, Sinclair persuades Madden, who has left the police force, to conduct an unofficial investigation. What he uncovers takes him from the upper echelons of society to the criminal underworld of the Chinese triads and back again. The pace may be slow, but Airth captures the postwar ethos well; solid storytelling, a cast of well-drawn characters and clever sleuthing from Madden make for a satisfyingly meaty read. Stav Sherez is one of the most distinctive and intelligent British crime writers, and his latest novel, The Intrusions (Faber, £12.99), is well up to his usual high standard. The third in the Carrigan and Miller series sees the two detectives investigating the abduction and subsequent killing of Anna Becker, a young woman who came to London hoping for a place at Rada, but ended up living in a hostel at the seedier end of Bayswater and taking cleaning jobs to make ends meet. Carrigan and Miller discover that not only has someone been trolling Anna, but remote-access technology has been used to control her laptop, driving her to a nervous breakdown – and it appears that she isn’t the only one who has been targeted. A little more detail about the detectives’ personal lives (Carrigan is still dealing with the fallout from an earlier case) would perhaps be helpful for newcomers to the series. But the main plot, with its online gaslighting, misogyny and obsession, is utterly riveting and truly terrifying. Highly recommended, with the caveat that you may never look at your computer in quite the same way again. Inspired by a real unsolved crime, Nicolás Obregón’s debut novel, Blue Light Yokohama (Michael Joseph, £12.99), is set in Tokyo, where Inspector Kosuke Iwata has just joined the homicide squad. His new colleagues are overtly hostile. He is given a case in which a Korean family of four has been murdered in their home, a black sun daubed on the ceiling and the smell of incense the only real clues. It seems to be a poisoned chalice, the original investigator having thrown himself off a bridge four days earlier. Iwata’s troubled past has left him plagued by nightmares and his superiors are more hindrance than help as more “black sun” murders follow. With a labyrinthine plot and a likable protagonist, Blue Light Yokohama is a strong beginning to what promises to be an excellent series. • Laura Wilson’s The Wrong Girl is published by Quercus."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"business/2017/feb/10/pimlico-loses-appeal-against-plumbers-worker-status-in-gig-economy-case","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-10T15:40:01Z","webTitle":"Pimlico Plumbers loses appeal against self-employed status","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/feb/10/pimlico-loses-appeal-against-plumbers-worker-status-in-gig-economy-case","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2017/feb/10/pimlico-loses-appeal-against-plumbers-worker-status-in-gig-economy-case","fields":{"headline":"Pimlico Plumbers loses appeal against self-employed status","bodyText":"Pimlico Plumbers has lost a court battle over the status of its workers, in the latest legal ruling on employment status in the gig economy. It came as the government released a report warning that “unscrupulous” employers were in a position to exploit low-paid and low-skilled workers. Plumber Gary Smith, who worked for Pimlico Plumbers for six years until 2011, had already won an employment tribunal challenging the firm’s view that he was self-employed. The court of appeal rejected an appeal lodged by Pimlico Plumbers, founded by the Conservative party donor Charlie Mullins. The firm argued Smith was an “independent contractor” rather than a worker or employee. Smith’s solicitor, Jacqueline McGuigan, said the ruling held wider implications for gig economy firms such as Deliveroo or Uber, both of which are embroiled in rows over employment status. “We are absolutely delighted,” McGuigan said. “The decision brings welcome clarity to the issue of employment status relating to work in parts of the economy.” Speaking outside court, Mullins said: “I am happy. This gives some clarity. We will be looking at the full judgment and there is a good chance we will appeal to the supreme court.” The UK’s department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) said: “We are determined to make sure our employment rules keep up to date to reflect new ways of working, and that’s why the government asked Matthew Taylor to conduct an independent review into modern working practices.” But BEIS immediately came under fire from the Green party for failing to publish a report that warned in December 2015 that gig economy workers were at risk of exploitation. A string of labour disputes have since arisen as staff from firms such as Uber, Deliveroo and CitySprint have fought to have their status upgraded to that of workers or employees. The report, commissioned by the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition, warned that a lack of clarity over workers’ status was allowing “unscrupulous” employers to take advantage of workers. It explored possibilities including “flipping” the burden of proof in labour disputes, so that employment tribunals would consider complainants to be full employees unless a different relationship could be established. “Some of the more unscrupulous employers will also have to start to take notice if a significant proportion of their workforce stand up for what is rightfully theirs as a result,” it said. The Green party said the government’s failure to publish the report since it was completed in December 2015 had increased uncertainty for gig economy workers and forced them to take the risk of going to tribunal. “It is shameful that Tory ministers have sat on the findings of the coalition’s review into employment status,” said Green co-leader Jonathan Bartley, who wrote to the prime minister in October calling for the report to be published. “As they did so workers everywhere have been living in increasing insecurity and left to fend for themselves.” Asked why the report had been delayed, BEIS said it had been commissioned to “explore future options” and would help inform the Taylor review into employment status, which was launched a year after the report was published. Employment law experts said the Pimlico Plumbers ruling would have significant implications for the ongoing dispute over employment status. Natalie Razeen, employment law solicitor at Russell-Cooke, said the decision “suggests that courts are alive to the inequality of bargaining power faced by individuals in these circumstances. “This serves as yet another reminder to employers that they should consider the question of employment or worker status carefully.” Marian Bloodworth, employment partner at Kemp Little, said the judgment highlighted the need for legal clarity around the status of those working on a self-employed basis and in the gig economy. “Tribunals and courts are increasingly willing to look behind the labels businesses use for their staff and will take into account the reality of the working arrangements and relationships,” she said. The ruling is the latest decision to be handed down in a series of court challenges launched by gig economy workers who feel they should get the same benefits as full-time employees, such as holiday pay and pension. A cycle courier working for the delivery firm CitySprint won the right earlier this year to paid holidays and minimum pay. Food delivery firm Deliveroo was told last year it must pay its workers the minimum wage unless they are ruled self-employed by a court or HM Revenue &amp; Customs. The Independent Workers’ Union of Great Britain has written to Deliveroo on behalf of a group of couriers in Brighton, serving two weeks’ notice to offer better pay and more hours. The group has also had a message of support from the GMB union. Ride-hailing app Uber lost the right to designate its drivers as self-employed last year, in a ruling it has since appealed against. Maria Ludkin, the GMB’s legal director, said: “This case, like the Uber case last October, is yet another victory for the bogus self-employed who have been treated appallingly by their employer. “All they want is basic employment rights as are enjoyed by the majority, including the right to be paid a minimum wage and holiday pay.” • This article was amended on 14 February 2017 to clarify that the Independent Workers’ Union of Great Britain is organising Deliveroo riders in Brighton."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/blog/2017/feb/10/england-wales-six-nations-preview-fear-factor-rugby-union","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-10T13:12:21Z","webTitle":"Dragon-sized demons await as England look to conquer Welsh fear factor","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2017/feb/10/england-wales-six-nations-preview-fear-factor-rugby-union","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/blog/2017/feb/10/england-wales-six-nations-preview-fear-factor-rugby-union","fields":{"headline":"Dragon-sized demons await as England look to conquer Welsh fear factor","bodyText":"There is a tongue-in-cheek line in Evelyn Waugh’s 1928 novel Decline and Fall – “We can trace almost all the disasters of English history to the influence of Wales” – that resonates on weekends like this. England have played international rugby across the Severn since 1882 yet there is never a year, even now, when they approach the bridge toll booths whistling the carefree tune of the entirely relaxed. For outsiders such as Eddie Jones this is ridiculous. Can one short river crossing really make a major psychological difference? The cost of driving a car from England to Wales rose by 10p to £6.70 last month but there are no real surprises on the other side. Along with every other away venue in the Six Nations, there will just be a packed stadium containing thousands of people extremely keen to see England finish second. What sets Cardiff apart, perhaps, are the noises, the sheer city-centre visibility of the pre-match desire and the unbounded relish – with Brains and curry sauce on top – whenever it is sated. England have tasted bitter defeat in Edinburgh, Dublin and Paris down the years but it is the feverish scarlet nightmares that often endure longest. Who can forget the 30-3 slam-dunk in 2013? Or their inability to win on Welsh soil between 1963 and 1991? Even though England prevailed on their last visit two years ago, their dragon-sized demons have not been entirely slain. Mind games or not, Jones is entitled to pose the question: does this old-school stuff still matter in 2017? On his watch England have already conquered Murrayfield, sacked Rome, prospered in Paris and seen off the Wallabies in Brisbane, Melbourne and Sydney. The coach has more of an affinity with Mad Max than Max Boyce and the 1970s are an awful long time ago. JPR, JJ, and Gareth are in their late 60s now; all great men but their impact on big games is not quite what it was. Better, perhaps, to turn the equation on its head. When Wales head to Twickenham, with the last quarter of the 2015 World Cup pool game a conspicuous exception, red does not necessarily spell danger. England have already beaten their opponents twice under Jones in the past 12 months. A few more inflatable daffodils and 150 miles of motorway should not, in theory, make that much difference. Going back two years, Stuart Lancaster’s England also showed the way. The flame throwers, the heavenly bread, the regimental goat, Hymns and Arias ... none of it could prevent the visiting team from leaving with a well-earned 21-16 win. The pre-match tunnel standoff set the stubborn tone, Jonathan Joseph and George Ford provided the requisite flashes of class and the upshot was a stirring comeback from 16-8 down at half-time. “We know we’ve got to be driven by performance ... I don’t think it’s about putting a picture of Justin Tipuric’s head on a dartboard,” Tom Wood warned beforehand and he duly watched the team deliver. So why the faint anxiety this time? These days the teams are required to take the field together, so the tunnel issue is sorted. But then you look at England’s rookie back row and remember how fiercely motivated Wales will be under the patriotic Alun Wyn Jones, about to win his 107th cap. Slightly mischievously, I once asked the ultra-competitive Jones if he ever wished he had been born an Englishman? “I’d have moved to Wales,” came the instant reply, “because I’d rather be Welsh.” It is in this emotional context that Jones’s slightly offhand reference to “a country of 3m people” strayed into risky territory. You need only 23 players in a match day squad and having a small population has never held back New Zealand. Wales have won four Six Nations titles, including three grand slams since 2005. Tell a Welsh rugby player he’s useless and he may be privately inclined to believe you. Tell him his country loves him and the English are coming and you effectively ignite a stick of dynamite. England, consequently, need to reconnect with their inner St George and steel themselves for the molten passion pouring down from the stands. In 2013 that proved impossible. “We felt we were overcome by the power of the emotion in the stadium,” Wood admitted. “We went in confident and we’d prepared well but, ultimately, the passion of the Welsh fans and the cauldron that was the Millennium Stadium caught us off-guard. I’m slightly embarrassed to say that but it must have been the case.” It is called the Principality Stadium nowadays but, in public at least, England are scornful of any supposed mystical qualities regardless of name. “You could be anywhere in the world – it doesn’t matter,” insisted the lock Joe Launchbury. “Some of the grounds in the Premiership are just as tough.” True, Salford on a Friday night can be awkward but nowhere do the anthems cascade down with the heartfelt intensity of Cardiff when the English are in town. The secret for the visitors will be to sidestep the special-issue Western Mail front covers and remind themselves, amid the bedlam, that 15 straight Test wins is no accident. England have fielded more dazzling teams but this lot are durable, stubborn and united. One glance at the video from 2009, when Joe Worsley played a defensive blinder in a narrow losing cause, should remind everyone Wales do not score umpteen tries in this fixture. The hosts have never managed more than two against England in Cardiff in the Six Nations and, on Welsh soil, have won the try-count only twice in eight meetings since 2000. Last-quarter fitness also matters against England, even if Maro Itoje, Jack Clifford and Nathan Hughes splutter as a unit against Sam Warburton, Tipuric and Ross Moriarty. Wales do not have oodles of backline pace, particularly if George North is on one good leg, but they will kick their goals and keep on coming. Nor will it have escaped the hosts’ notice that the referee Jérôme Garcès took charge of the fateful 2015 World Cup pool game, in addition to the aforementioned Six Nations encounter that year. Interestingly, no Welsh region lost at home in this year’s pool rounds of either European competition, while Ospreys remain unbeaten at home in this season’s Pro12. If England claim consecutive Test win No16 with a reshuffled pack they will feel they can prevail anywhere. Scotland against France in Paris could be a more attractive spectacle but nowhere will the breakdown and gainline battle be as remorselessly physical. These are certainly well-matched teams on paper and the same will probably be true on grass, particularly if Wales’s “16th man” are on song. Inviting DJ “Wooden” Spoony to supply “bespoke” pre-match musical content two years ago was a ludicrous booking; no English visit to Cardiff needs bigging up when Wales scent potential victory. England are about to discover if their long-standing bridge phobia is imaginary or painfully real."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2017/feb/10/iranians-turn-out-in-force-for-annual-rally-after-call-for-trump-response","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-10T14:15:47Z","webTitle":"Iranians turn out in force for rallies after call for Trump response","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/feb/10/iranians-turn-out-in-force-for-annual-rally-after-call-for-trump-response","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/feb/10/iranians-turn-out-in-force-for-annual-rally-after-call-for-trump-response","fields":{"headline":"Iranians turn out in force for rallies after call for Trump response","bodyText":"Rallies in Iran marking the anniversary of the 1979 revolution have turned into a display of public anger towards Donald Trump. Thousands of people sympathetic to the ruling establishment took to the streets of Tehran and other cities on Friday to participate in state-sponsored celebrations of the Islamic revolution victory day. Some brought “Death to America” signs and Trump effigies and set fire to US and Israeli flags. The rallies and their anti-American sentiment are common in Iran around this time of year, but have taken on an extra bite after the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, thanked the US president for “making our life easy” and showing “the real face of America”, and urged people to come out on Friday in big numbers to “respond to his words”. Late last month Trump imposed travel restrictions on nationals from seven majority-Muslim countries including Iran and said he was putting Iran “on notice” because of a recent ballistic missile test. On Friday Iran’s president, Hassan Rouhani, a relatively moderate figure who secured a nuclear deal with the west in 2015, addressed the crowd in Tehran’s Azadi (Freedom) Square. The choice of speaker suggested Iran’s religious leaders wanted to project a less antagonistic approach than in previous years, when more hardline figures have taken the stage. Rouhani said the large turnout was a response to “false remarks of the new White House rulers”. “Some inexperienced figures in the region and America are threatening Iran,” he said, referring to Trump and his regional Arab allies. “They should know that the language of threats has never worked with Iran. “Our nation is vigilant and will make those threatening Iran regret it. They should learn to respect Iran and Iranians. We will strongly confront any warmongering policies.” Qassem Suleimani, the head of Iran’s Quds force, the external arm of the elite Revolutionary Guards, was seen among the crowd. Some demonstrators tried to differentiate between the US political leadership and the American people. “American people are welcome and invited to visit Iran,” said one sign. “Down with the US regime, long live US people,” said another. Iranians used the hashtag #LoveBeyondFlags on Twitter to express gratitude for Americans who opposed the travel ban. On 1 February 1979 Ayatollah Khomeini, the founder of the Islamic revolution, returned to Tehran from exile in Paris, two weeks after the Shah, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, had fled Iran. The Iranian military, which was under US influence, soon surrendered, and within months Khomeini was declared the supreme leader of a new Islamic Republic. Relations with the US were tense from the start, because America was closely identified with the Shah’s regime, and in November 1979 links with Washington broke down completely when a group of students stormed the US embassy and took 52 diplomats hostage. Direct talks between Iran and the US were held under the Obama administration, but relations have again become frosty since Trump took power."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2017/feb/13/stoke-byelection-we-cant-just-rehash-the-arguments-we-had-in-june","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-13T08:00:08Z","webTitle":"Stoke byelection: 'We can’t just be rehashing the arguments we had in June' Gareth Snell","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/feb/13/stoke-byelection-we-cant-just-rehash-the-arguments-we-had-in-june","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2017/feb/13/stoke-byelection-we-cant-just-rehash-the-arguments-we-had-in-june","fields":{"headline":"Stoke byelection: 'We can’t just rehash the arguments we had in June'","bodyText":"In a constituency with the lowest turnout in the country, Labour veteran Alan Johnson knows he needs a big pitch for Stoke-on-Trent voters. “There are three big events; there’s the EU referendum, the American election and the Stoke-on-Trent byelection,” he tells rows of students assembled at Stoke sixth-form college. Gareth Snell, Labour’s candidate in the town’s upcoming byelection, is standing beside Johnson on the podium. Snell faces a similar fight against the same forces of rising populism that elected Trump, Johnson says, in the shape of Ukip leader Paul Nuttall. “It is not hyperbole to say this is crucial in Stoke. Ukip have one MP, their leader is standing in this election,” he tells the group, straining to be heard above the noise from the nearby lunch tables. “He doesn’t care about Stoke, and Gareth is steeped in this area, his kids go to school here. Gareth’s vision is for what happens to cities like Stoke after Brexit. Your decision is about where that will take us.” In 2015, Stoke-on-Trent Central was the only constituency in the UK where the majority of the electorate did not vote. Former MP Tristram Hunt, who quit parliament in January to become director of the V&amp;A museum, was elected by just 19% of his constituents, with Ukip close behind. In a town where 62% of locals voted for Brexit, Labour’s key attack on the Ukip leader is that the town is nothing but a useful vehicle for Nuttall to get to Westminster, compared with Snell’s deep local connections. At the Ukip office in the city centre, there is a subtle change in the newest leaflets, which focus on the issues in the town such as homelessness rather than solely on the EU. Labour campaigners are confident that revelations by Channel 4 that Nuttall had not even moved into his new home in the town by the time his nomination papers were submitted, as well as his struggle to name the six towns of Stoke-on-Trent, have cut through. Snell, like Nuttall, was not born in Stoke but the 31-year-old local councillor has lived in the area for 13 years. Like many in the city, he describes himself as a member of “the turnover club” – people who turn over their plates, wherever they are in the world, to check whether the ceramic plates they are eating from are made in the Potteries. His six-year-old daughter, Hannah, has begun copying him, he said, though Snell’s pride was diminished somewhat when she tipped over one plate that was still loaded with food. Snell’s own achilles heel is his support for the remain campaign, once dubbing Brexit a “massive pile of shit” in a tweet from September. He admits the issue is still one of the key questions on the doorstep but says he is trying to turn the conversation towards how that will affect Stoke’s key industries. “The EU referendum is coming up, but it’s about why are we still here? People want to get on with it,” Snell said. “I’ve not hidden the fact that I voted for remain, but Stoke was very clear what it wanted. If I’m the MP for Stoke-on-Trent Central, I will deliver that. But it can’t just be rehashing the arguments we’ve had in June. I’ve been talking to manufacturers, the ceramics industry and the universities here and they want answers, how will trade look? What about imports? Where will funding come from? “I will not frustrate the will of the people, I will do nothing to slow it down but it is incumbent upon me to get the best deal that works for the Potteries, the investment, trade opportunities. I want to make it work.” The enthusiastic politics students at the sixth-form college fired Westminster insider questions about the article 50 vote and Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership at Johnson and Snell, but a mile away in Northwood, on the outskirts of the city centre, just one Labour poster was visible in the windows of the dozens of tightly packed terraced houses. Several people stopped in the street said they were unaware of an election. Keith Fletcher, a retired site manager walking his dog up the steep hill into town, said he thought the poll had barely made an impression, contrary to Johnson’s enthusiasm. “Young people don’t care at all, they don’t even know it’s happening,” he said. He said he would be voting, but did not expect many others in his family to do so. “I’m a Labour man. I also voted for us to come out [of the EU]. Just because people voted to come out doesn’t mean you vote for Ukip. We’re coming out now, no one can stop it and we need to think about other things now.” Darren Hopkinson, a young local community worker, also said he would vote Labour but said he feared there were some pockets of growing support for the Eurosceptic party. “The hard industry has gone in Stoke-on-Trent, and the working class guys have had their heads turned to more rightwing political views,” he said. “There’s been a lot of migration into the area and they think, maybe, they’ve been a bit neglected.” Nuttall’s status as an outsider would not necessarily preclude him being elected if he could portray himself as the change candidate, one woman said, who did not want to give her name. The Ukip leader, she said, was the latest in a long succession of politicians who took the city’s poverty and low turnout for granted, in the expectation they would vote a certain way. “There are no working class or people from ordinary backgrounds in politics any more, no ordinary person has gone through the grassroots and got there,” she said. “Paul Nuttall’s not from the area but Tristram Hunt got in and he’s not from the area. He wasn’t bothered about the Potteries and he got elected. He got a safe seat. I don’t think Ukip will get in, but there’s no opposition. And then what you get is apathy.” Snell said he believed his party had done some soul-searching in the area over the past few years, including during his time as a local councillor. The Labour party are realising we have to continue to work for people, we have to continue to provide reasons to vote for us,” he said. “I don’t take any votes for granted, I’ve been fighting Ukip for a very long time on various levels and I know the Labour party wins when we are talking to people. “If Labour lose the byelection on the 23rd, I can guarantee you I will still be working for this city on the 24th. Hand on my heart, if Paul Nuttall loses, he won’t be.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2017/feb/10/fatal-house-fire-withington-manchester","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-10T11:30:48Z","webTitle":"Man and woman die in fire at house in Manchester","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/feb/10/fatal-house-fire-withington-manchester","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2017/feb/10/fatal-house-fire-withington-manchester","fields":{"headline":"Man and woman die in fire at house in Manchester","bodyText":"A man and a woman have died and four children were taken to hospital after a fire broke out at a house in Manchester. Firefighters were called to the blaze in Withington, south Manchester, shortly before 2.30am on Friday. Neighbours described how the three boys and a girl, aged between 10 and 17, jumped from their upstairs bedroom window as flames engulfed the house. The deceased man and woman are understood to be their parents. The other man, who remains in hospital, is thought to be a relative who was visiting the family. Neighbours said they were woken in the middle of the night by screams from near the detached home. One described how she heard a woman who lived at the property pleading with firefighters to “save my house, please save my house” as the property was engulfed in flames. “I woke up at half two because I could hear screaming but it got more aggravated,” said Emily Puckering, 22, who lives opposite the house. “Then I could hear the popping of the window expanding – I know the sound because I’ve had a house fire before. “I looked out of my window and I could see thick black smoke – that shows how hot it was. The flames were coming out of the frontdoor, it was an orange glow. It was a really big fire.” Puckering, a student, said a police officer making door-to-door inquiries later asked her whether she had seen anyone “loitering around” before the blaze took hold. Another witness described the dramatic scenes as neighbours rushed out into the street to catch the children from their bedroom window. “There was a lot of commotion outside, then we heard screaming and loud bangs. My wife looked out of the window as sometimes students come home and throw wheelie bins around,” said one neighbour, who did not want to be named. “All she could see was black smoke, we went outside and saw the fire, we heard screaming from the window at the back of the house and could see a girl. “I went to get ladders and the fire crews arrived. One of the girls, a 17-year-old, jumped from the window and landed near the garage. She had really bad injuries to her legs and hips and was complaining of back pain. “My neighbour Robert picked her up and moved her and she told him her siblings were still inside. He told the kids to jump and said, ‘I’ll catch you’. “The fire was so bad you couldn’t see. The kids jumped and he broke their fall. Another neighbour got water and blankets for them. “Fire crews were told there were three more people inside and they went in. They found one man on the staircase and dragged him out. He was given CPR on the pavement.” Ch Supt Was Chaudhry said detectives were treating the fire as suspicious but were keeping an open mind about the cause. Appealing for help from neighbours, Chaudhry said detectives would carry out forensic analysis and comb CCTV to determine the cause of the blaze. He paid tribute to neighbours who he said worked “frantically” to help save the children before emergency services arrived. “It was absolutely fantastic what they did. Without their help, the individuals receiving hospital treatment would have had more serious injuries,” Chaudhry said. Councillor David Acton, the chairman of Greater Manchester fire and rescue authority, praised firefighters for tackling the huge blaze. He said: “Our firefighters did a great job in tackling the house fire, which was well alight when they arrived, so praise must go to them for dealing with this difficult and extremely sad incident.” Another neighbour, Athra Mania, said she was friends with a woman who lived at the house. She told the Manchester Evening News: “Our children go to the same school. They are very friendly and a very nice family. I saw her maybe two days ago. One of my friends told me what happened so I had to come down to see.” Two upstairs bedrooms and the roof of the property appeared to have been badly damaged by the fire. The road was cordoned off and police and fire service vehicles stood outside the house. Fire and crime scene investigators wearing white body suits worked at the scene, taking photos and carrying equipment into the property. DI Tony Lea, of Greater Manchester police, said: “My thoughts are with the family of the man and woman after such a tragic incident and we have specially trained officers supporting the family at this time. “We are continuing to work closely with [the fire service] to establish exactly how this fire started and I urge anyone who may have witnessed the fire, or anyone in the area in the hours before the fire: if you have any information at all, contact police as soon as possible so we can piece together what happened.” The Rev Mark Hewerdine from the nearby church of St Chad’s, Ladybarn, said the blaze had shocked the tightknit community. He said: “It’s an awful tragedy. As a parent it touches you quite deeply to hear that children are involved … Some people have been around here a long time and people are upset and shaken up by it.” He added that his church would open at 6pm for prayers and that there would be a book of condolences for the family."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"science/2017/feb/13/can-you-solve-it-the-mystery-of-portias-caskets","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-13T07:20:07Z","webTitle":"Can you solve it?

The mystery of Portia's caskets","bodyText":"“Why should I be worried about dying? It’s not going to happen in my lifetime!” So said Raymond Smullyan, the American mathematician, philosopher and prolific writer of logic puzzles, who died a week ago aged 97. Another of his playfully paradoxical statements was the following, which is how he began talks: “Before I begin speaking, there is something I want to say.” In that spirit, before I begin this post, there is something I’d like to write.... A former concert pianist and professional magician, Smullyan enjoyed a distinguished academic career in mathematical logic, but it was for his books of puzzles that he became best known. Not only are they hugely entertaining, but more than any other popular puzzlesmith he used them to explain deep and complex ideas in logic and philosophy. Smullyan’s 1978 debut, What is the name of this book? has been described as “the most original, most profound and most humorous collection of recreational logic and mathematics problems ever written.” It starts off with some witty gags and ends up with a discussion of Gödel’s Incompleteness Theorem. For today’s puzzle I thought I’d celebrate that book with a couple of its puzzles, which are based on the Merchant of Venice. Beautiful Portia has three caskets: one gold, one silver and one lead. Inside one of them is her portrait. Her father’s will has determined that any suitor must choose the casket with the portrait in order to win her hand in marriage. 1) Smullyan’s Portia wishes to choose her husband based on the size of his intellect. So she has the following words written on the caskets: Portia tells her suitor that of these three statements at most one is true. Which should he choose? 2) The suitor got it right and they married. But then Portia had second thoughts. She wanted a cleverer husband. So she divorced and went through the casket-choosing rigmarole again, with new statements on the caskets: In this case the suitor is told that at least one statement is true and at least one is false. Which one should he choose? I’ll be back at 5pm GMT with the answers and explanations. (UPDATE: Answers and explanations now posted here). NO SPOILERS PLEASE. Please use the comments to reminisce about Raymond Smullyan, share some of his other great one-liners, puzzles, or about the role of mathematics and probability in the plays of Shakespeare.

I have wonderful memories of the vinyl recordings my father used to play at home – Il barbiere di Siviglia (Abbado, Berganza, Pray, Alva), Le nozze di Figaro (Bohm, Prey, Mathis, Janowitz, Fischer-Dieskau) and Beethoven 9 (Karajan with the Berlin Philharmonic). I still have a big collection of vinyl, especially historical performances of Italian opera, but I don’t often have the chance to listen to them because I am rarely at home. But I consider these recordings to be some of the most precious things I own. As a student I bought lots of CDs, and nowadays I always listen with headphones on my phone or laptop to digital music. But of course, nothing is better than the live concert experience and live music making. What was the first record you bought? My infatuation with Wagner began when I was 14 and I bought the Ring Cycle with Levine and the New York Metropolitan Opera Orchestra. My piano teacher lent me the scores, I brought them home in a large suitcase and I then listened to the complete cycle twice in a week. It was a great experience, but I don’t think I would have the courage (or time!) to do it again. ... and what was the last piece of music you bought? Ten days ago I was in London and went to the Schott music store – one of my favourite places. I bought Berlioz Symphonie Fantastique in the Barenreiter edition, Debussy Jeux, Dukas L’apprenti Sorcier, Ravel Ma Mere l’Oye (complete) and Scheherazade Overture de feriee – I am conducting a lot of french repertoire in the coming season. What’s your musical guilty pleasure? Although I conduct a lot of operas, and the core of my symphonic repertoire is from the 19th and 20th centuries, I was an organist before I started conducting and I can’t live without playing some Bach on a daily basis. I know it sounds more like a “purification” than a guilty pleasure, a way to purge my operatic sins! I am in love with the six Trio sonatas and the Passacaglia &amp; Fugue in C Minor. If you had time learn a new instrument, what would it be? Definitely the cello. I studied it for three years before I changed principal studies to organ and piano, but I regret it. Maybe the cello is the closest instrument to the human voice – the best instrument in the world. Did you ever consider a career outside of music? The only other job I would consider outside of music or the arts in general is to be a park ranger or a geologist. There is nothing I love more than to be outside and amongst nature. What single thing would improve the format of the classical concert? The best thing we can do is to allow it to continue! If nations continue to cut subsidy, if we cannot offer the audience same quality because our budgets are reduced, if we cannot invest in outreach and education, then the audience will decline and we will be finished. It is a travesty that culture seems to come last on the agendas of so many countries. The world must fund one of its finest art forms to the level its dignity requires. Let us continue to share our great music, support our opera houses and orchestras, and support music education in schools. It is in the hands of our leaders to make this choice. If you had to pick one work to introduce someone to the wonders of classical music, what would it be? I would take him or her to a live performance of Beethoven’s 9th Symphony. Classical music needs an “active listener”, so before the concert it might be helpful to introduce them to the wonders and emotions of this immortal masterpiece. From the complex dramatic architecture of the first movement and the rhythmic ostinato of the second movement, to the purest metaphysical music ever written of the third movement, up to the majesty and joy of the final movement. And the next night I would take everyone to the opera to see La bohème! What is the most unusual venue you’ve performed in? Conducting at the Arena in Verona was unforgettable. The sheer weight of history surrounding us and the audience holding small white candles evoking thousands of fireflies made it magical. There is also a naturally perfect acoustic notwithstanding its majestic vastness. What’s been your most memorable live music experience as an audience member? Two musical epiphanies particularly come to mind. First, Carlo Maria Giulini conducting Schubert and Brahms at La Scala in 1997. He was a real Maestro in the grandest sense of the term, and his noble and sincere interpretation seduced me completely. And at end of that amazing concert I went backstage to congratulate him. He told me “music is simply an act of pure love”, which made the evening even more special. In 2008 I saw Yuri Temirkanov with his St Petersburg Philharmonic conducting Tchaikovsky’s 6th Symphony: the way he caressed, phrased and shaped the music was unbelievable, and the rich and unique sound of that orchestra was unforgettable. We’re giving you a time machine: what period, or moment in musical history, would you travel to and why? Vienna at the time of Haydn, Mozart, Beethoven and Schubert. It all began then, and it is so important to understand the historical and social environment in which our hero-composers lived. What was the last piece of music you danced to? I danced (just a bit!) on the podium the last time I conducted the Symphonic Dances from Bernstein’s West Side Story. Otherwise off the podium I danced only at my wedding, 18 months ago, to Bridge over Troubled Water by Simon and Garfunkel. What do you sing in the shower? Highlights from Tosca, Manon Lescaut, Le nozze di Figaro, Don Giovanni, Pagliacci, Il barbiere di Siviglia, Die Zauberflote… (which I guess in their entirety would make for a very long shower!). Opera Rara’s recording of Bellini’s first opera Adelson e Salvini featuring the BBC Symphony Orchestra conducted by Daniele Rustioni is released on 3 March."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"music/musicblog/2017/feb/15/britpop-songs-10-of-the-best-oasis-blur-pulp","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-15T12:10:24Z","webTitle":"Britpop songs – 10 of the best","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2017/feb/15/britpop-songs-10-of-the-best-oasis-blur-pulp","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/musicblog/2017/feb/15/britpop-songs-10-of-the-best-oasis-blur-pulp","fields":{"headline":"Britpop songs – 10 of the best","bodyText":"1. The Auteurs – Starstruck This year is the 20th anniversary of Oasis’s Be Here Now, an album ripe for sympathetic reappraisal, if only because any record that attracts so much rancour can’t be all bad. Along with marking the moment Oasis’s creative well ran dry, it turned out to be Britpop’s endgame, sweeping the whole genre into the dustbin. And that’s how many remember Britpop today: a backward-looking bubble of we-are-the-champions triumphalism. But it wasn’t always the embarrassing uncle that nobody wants to acknowledge. Before the fatal hubris of the Cool Britannia phase, which generated an NME article proclaiming Noel Gallagher the most influential person in Britain, Britpop’s bands were clever and observant, or at least interesting. The Auteurs were all three. Leader Luke Haines hated many things, not least the classifying of his arty indie band under the Britpop umbrella. In fairness to him, the Auteurs’ 1993 debut, New Wave, shared more DNA with groups like the House of Love than Oasis, but unfortunately for Haines the Auteurs simply happened to be in the right (or wrong) place just as Britpop gained momentum. New Wave’s loveliest track, Starstruck, is shot through with the bittersweet Kinks influence that was a Britpop cornerstone, while its lyric – a fictitious memoir of a child star whose career “took its first nosedive” when he was five – is as Brit as it comes. 2. Saint Etienne – You’re in a Bad Way Saint Etienne were fellow purveyors of small details and fleeting impressions. “Toast is burned and the coffee’s cold / And you leave all the post ’cos it’s nothing but bills again” are You’re in a Bad Way’s opening lines, establishing the quiet despair that counterpoints the song’s cascading 60s arrangement. “Home from work, put the TV on / Get your kicks watching Bruce on the old Generation Game,” it continues – you get the idea. Singer Sarah Cracknell, one of Britpop’s great voices, airily sketches a picture of everyday drabness before the chorus bursts into anthemic life. In Saint Etienne’s world, there was nothing that couldn’t be sorted out by a visit to the local caff (never “café”), and that was probably where the song’s protagonist ended up, regaining the will to live over a cup of tea at a Formica table. As with Starstruck, this 1993 single had the retro flavourings that would come to typify Britpop, but existed in a different universe to the genre’s TFI Friday bullishness. 3. Suede – Animal Nitrate To appreciate how outre Suede first seemed, watch their performance of Animal Nitrate at the 1993 Brit awards. Six months earlier, before they’d released so much as a single, Suede had featured on a Melody Maker front cover under the headline “The best new band in Britain”. But that kind of overhyping was standard music-press flummery – what got them out of the indie hinterland was their three minutes at the Brits. “Who was that?” was the reaction of both the TV audience and much of the crowd at the actual event, as well it might – even if that night’s other acts hadn’t been textbook-staid, Suede would still have been a glam hurricane. Introduced with a sardonic: “Please welcome the already legendary Suede” (at that point, their career consisted of two singles and that Melody Maker cover), they spent their slot burning themselves into the ears and retinas of everyone watching. Bernard Butler’s opening riff is one of the most undeniable in pop, and Brett Anderson – pirouetting in a lace blouse as he yowled: “Like his dad / you know that he had animal nitrate in mind” – imprinted himself on those viewers hungry for something different. The song’s dark dysfunctionality complemented the band’s sleazy glamour, and a sensation was born. 4. Blur – Parklife Though Blur ambitiously viewed the Parklife LP as “a loosely linked concept album”, they probably hadn’t anticipated the cultural significance its title track would have. This was the song around which Britpop coalesced, giving form to what had been vague ideas about UK popular culture and turning it into the zeitgeist. It didn’t hurt that the track had a magnetism that made it fit in everywhere, from the Radio 1 breakfast show to the Evening Session to Spanish dancefloors. Phil Daniels’ key narrator role had originally been written for Damon Albarn, who found it impossible to “get into character” and suggested Daniels for the part. Daniels’ acerbic Cockney patter, coupled with the unshakeable chorus, instantly created a new archetype: the resurgent working-class young Londoner with money in his pocket. Pressing the point home further, the video offers the sight of Alex James pushing Graham Coxon in a supermarket trolley, and a recreation of the Abbey Road cover, but with the zebra crossing relocated to East London. 5. Oasis – Supersonic When a band launch their career with their best song, the only way should be down, and thus it proved, eventually. Though Oasis had a decent run of memorable early singles, none quite equalled Supersonic – hearing it now, its uncluttered perfection still startles. As a calling card, the song was incredibly effective – raw, unapologetic and burning with confidence. Though it was about Oasis’s yearning for fame, Liam Gallagher swaggered as if success were a done deal, and from that point it was a self-fulfilling prophecy. Fortuitously, it came out the same month – April 1994 – as the Parklife album, and rumblings of a north/south rivalry began almost immediately, to the advantage of both bands. 6. Boo Radleys – Wake Up Boo! Britpop could be surprisingly malleable, as shown by this 1995 single. The Boo Radleys had the wrong hair and clothes, and had done time as shoegazers but a change of direction, and bang! – they were adopted by Britpop overlord Chris Evans, and lauded as the next shiny thing. For a tune about fundamental incompatibility in a relationship, Wake Up Boo! is insanely peppy; at the time it embodied better than any other song the thread of optimism running through the mid-90s. The band’s performance on the quintessential 90s “youth” show The Word pushes every giddy neon button. 7. Pulp – Common People (live at Glastonbury) Pulp’s breakthrough came when they stepped in as last-minute substitutes for the Stone Roses at Glastonbury in 1995. Common People was the last song of their set, and by the time it finished, the group had palpably crossed the line to bona-fide stardom. Though synonymous with Britpop, Common People has the qualities that make a song timeless: there’s Cocker’s fabulously louche delivery and the massive uplift into the chorus, obviously, but also the lyric. Addressed to a long-ago acquaintance who wanted Cocker to show her the world of “common people” in the hope that their supposed credibility would rub off, it resonates to this day. 8. Pulp – Something Changed The fourth and least remembered single from Pulp’s Different Class, Something Changed is rarely mentioned in the same breath as the game-changing first three, Common People, Sorted for E’s and Wizz and Disco 2000. As a lesson in what Pulp were about, however, it’s unsurpassable. While the first three singles set out their stall as observers of social and class mores, Something Changed is a love song, but one defined by Pulp’s intrinsic pathos and vulnerability. Cocker’s lyric considers the role that chance plays in relationships: what if he’d gone to see a film that day instead? What if she’d visited friends? When they woke that morning, they didn’t know they were about to meet: “Life could have been very different then / but something changed.” Cocker’s partiality to hammy vocal flourishes is absent; this is his most unadorned performance, and by a long way Pulp’s most moving song. 9. Elastica – Line Up From their 1995 debut, Elastica’s finest hour starts with the sound of energetic vomiting – an aural tribute, perhaps, to the Good Mixer pub in Camden Town, where thousands of Britpop hangovers were created. It resolves into a tirade against a groupie called Drivelhead, who hangs around the Camden gig scene in the hope of bedding some lunk whose band has just been third on the bill at the Dublin Castle. “Drivelhead wears her glad-rags / She’s got her keys, money and fags / I know her mind’s made up / To get rocked,” sings leader Justine Frischmann, though by the third verse, she’s dropped the subtlety: “Drivelhead knows all the stars / Loves to suck their shining guitars / They’ve all been right up her stairs / Do you care?” Line Up isn’t just three surging minutes, it’s also a screen-grab of a moment in time, when Camden was the epicentre of a movement that felt like something big. It’s rare for a woman to sing about groupies – Delaney &amp; Bonnie’s Groupie (Superstar) is the only other song that comes to mind - but Frischmann, who was dating Damon Albarn at the time, had presumably seen her share of Drivelheads and wanted to vent. 10. Mansun – Wide Open Space Mansun happened to be playing catchy guitar music at a time when every such group was labelled Britpop, but in their case it was a misnomer. Leader Paul Draper was a fan of Prince and John Barry rather than the Beatles, and his band’s 1997 debut album, Attack of the Grey Lantern, was a theatrical concept affair leagues removed from the breezy simplicity of contemporaries such as Cast and Dodgy. Along with a musical vision, Draper had a strong grasp of melody, yielding an album engaging enough to hit No 1. Wide Open Space was one of its singles, and – compelling and hugely anthemic – as close to Britpop as the band ever got. One got the impression that Draper had written it just to prove he could – the paranoia at its centre (“I’m in a wide open space / it’s freezing”) marked it as an outlier."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"education/2017/feb/10/opponent-of-new-grammar-schools-to-lead-headteachers-union-ascl-geoff-barton","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-10T12:44:50Z","webTitle":"Opponent of new grammar schools to lead headteachers' union","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2017/feb/10/opponent-of-new-grammar-schools-to-lead-headteachers-union-ascl-geoff-barton","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/education/2017/feb/10/opponent-of-new-grammar-schools-to-lead-headteachers-union-ascl-geoff-barton","fields":{"headline":"Opponent of new grammar schools to lead headteachers' union","bodyText":"An outsider who vowed to take the fight to the government over grammar schools and funding cuts has been elected general secretary of the biggest secondary school headteachers’ union in an upset victory. Geoff Barton, the long-serving headteacher of a secondary school in Suffolk, was on Friday named the winner in the Association of School and College Leaders’ first contested election for general secretary in a landslide win. Barton had strong support among his fellow heads as well as a strong social media presence. His win upset the plans of the union’s executive, which had handpicked a consultant who had never worked as a teacher as its favoured candidate. Barton, who steps down as head of King Edward VI school in Bury St Edmunds, said: “I am delighted to have gained this mandate as ASCL general secretary. I want to thank the association’s members for their encouragement over these past few months. The level of support has been both inspiring and humbling.” Barton secured 2,716 votes to the 677 votes for Chris Kirk, the former PwC consultant backed by the executive. The result means that Barton takes over ASCL, which has 18,000 members, mainly in secondary schools in England, as the government prepares to launch a new wave of grammar schools, as well as bringing in a controversial new funding formula for schools in England while freezing spending. Writing in the Guardian last year, Barton described the government’s plans for grammar schools as a “vanity project” and warned: “No school leader will be able to make the savings needed simply by postponing a decision to repaint the corridors.” Barton said after his victory: “I very much look forward to working closely with all members of ASCL, its elected representatives, and the staff team. There’s never been a more important time for leaders, in our various roles across all types of schools and colleges, to speak with a distinctive, authoritative, united voice.” Sian Carr, ASCL’s president, said: “The election has inevitably divided opinion, as elections always do, but what unites us as school and college leaders is far stronger than any differences we may have. “The membership has made its choice through an open and democratic process. Today, I have called on all members to unite in supporting the new general secretary.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2017/feb/10/last-weekend-was-special-but-now-were-focused-on-winning","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-09T22:42:22Z","webTitle":"Last weekend was special, but now we're focused on winning games of footy | Lauren Arnell","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/feb/10/last-weekend-was-special-but-now-were-focused-on-winning","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/feb/10/last-weekend-was-special-but-now-were-focused-on-winning","fields":{"headline":"Last weekend was special, but now we're focused on winning","bodyText":"Last weekend’s AFLW season opener was the biggest game I’ve ever played in. I don’t think anyone expected the way last Friday night panned out – 30,000 people trying to get into Ikon Park was just out of this world. The occasion of being able to play in the first game of the AFL Women’s competition, for it to be Carlton and Collingwood and to have the opportunity to lead the girls out onto the ground, was pretty special. The Carlton football club really does treasure its history and I had plenty of reminders during last week that this would be a very special moment for me. And it was. But now, I’m focussed on this season and doing everything I can to get the most out of myself and the team. When I get older, I’m sure I’ll look back and treasure it and be able to share those moments with people in my life in more depth. But at the moment, there is just such great focus on what we are trying to achieve. Last Friday was all about being ready to perform but at the same time soaking in the moment and enjoying doing what we love because it’s the only reason we do what we do. Despite the fact we’re now finally professional athletes, we do it because we love it. When we finally ran out onto the ground, the most poignant thing for me was the noise – we really struggled to hear each other throughout the whole night, and that was actually really cool. It was actually challenging trying to communicate but it’s an atmosphere I would like to play in every single week because the passion coming from both clubs’ supporters was just incredible. The crowd created a real happiness around the ground. It didn’t feel like the result mattered to anybody, it was almost like they were just so proud and happy for us to be able to achieve that moment and have that first game happen. It was a celebration. As far as the footy was concerned, I’m proud to say we stuck to our structures and our systems for the whole game. All of our girls played the role they were asked to play and it felt like a real team win and something that is a platform for us to begin our season. Our coach, Damien Keeping was really measured in his approach. He is very much an organised, planning coach, and he’s got a really good handle on emotion and channels his emotions to the group really well. We all felt as calm and as relaxed as possible, ready to perform how we wanted to. The hype around the competition is going to be a challenge for everybody – both the experienced and inexperienced players – because none of us have received attention like this for our performances before. But at the end of the day, we are footballers and we need to go out and play. So on Saturday, we do it all again when we take on GWS Giants. It’s fantastic that the game is again free and now part of a double header – so hopefully we’ll see another big crowd. One of the great assets of large crowds that I got to see at the end of last week’s game was when we were thanking everybody for coming there was a real family feel. It was just brilliant - so we’ll just soak that all in again. As for the group, I’m very fortunate as the captain in that there is fantastic leadership across all 28 of our players. I don’t have to do too much – the girls are quite switched on and leaders in their own right. So my messages will be basic and pretty simple and will echo what the coach needs. I’m sure the girls will be able to perform again and unite as a team with a lot of focus against GWS. The fact is we’ve won one game of football but there are seven rounds and a grand final at the end, of which we would like to be a part. So while we did celebrate our first up success to an extent, we have a long way to go."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2017/feb/10/peru-ex-president-alejandro-toledo-faces-arrest-on-bribery-charges","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-10T05:52:47Z","webTitle":"Peru ex-president Alejandro Toledo faces arrest on bribery charges","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/feb/10/peru-ex-president-alejandro-toledo-faces-arrest-on-bribery-charges","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/feb/10/peru-ex-president-alejandro-toledo-faces-arrest-on-bribery-charges","fields":{"headline":"Peru ex-president Alejandro Toledo faces arrest on bribery charges","bodyText":"A judge in Peru has ordered the arrest of ex-president Alejandro Toledo while prosecutors prepare criminal charges against the former leader for allegedly receiving $20m in bribes from the Brazilian construction giant Odebrecht in return for granting a lucrative contract to build a transoceanic highway between Brazil and the Peruvian coast. Judge Richard Concepcion ordered 18 months “preventive” prison and issued both a national and international arrest warrant for Toledo, 70, on Thursday. The ex-president, who was in France last week, has angrily denied any wrongdoing when interviewed by Peruvian journalists. His lawyer said he would not flee but declined to say what country he was in. Observers said the warrant marked the nadir of a precipitous fall from grace for Toledo, a one-time pro-democracy activist who headed street protests against the authoritarian former president Alberto Fujimori and pledged to clamp down on rampant corruption when he took office from 2001 to 2006. Fujimori is serving a 25-year jail sentence for human rights crimes, embezzlement and bribing the media. Many Peruvians are shocked that one of his leading adversaries could join him behind bars if found guilty. Earlier this week, Peru’s attorney general’s office formally charged Toledo with asset laundering and influence trafficking. The move came after police and prosecutors raided his home in Lima on the weekend, seizing documents, videos, mobiles phones and more than $30,000 in cash. Prosecutors allege the payments to Toledo were made through his friend Josef Maiman, a Peruvian-Israeli businessman who was also being investigated along with Odebrecht’s former boss in the country, Jorge Barata, whose testimony implicates the former president. Toledo, who came eighth in an electoral bid last year, said the charges had been orchestrated by his “traditional enemies”. However, he said he would return to be Peru if he could be guaranteed a fair trial. The president of Peru, Pedro Pablo Kuczynski, who served as Toledo’s economy minister and prime minister, urged the former leader to return home. The attorney general’s office is also investigating two more former presidents, Alan García (2006-11) and Ollanta Humala (2011-16) for allegedly having received bribes as part of the widening Odebrecht scandal. Gustavo Gorriti, a leading investigative journalist and pro-democracy campaigner, told local radio: “Toledo ended his government like the protagonist of a film about gangsters, who robbed and used power like a masquerade for what they really wanted.” “Having been handed the noblest possible mandate he betrayed it the most vile way imaginable,” he added. Gorriti who leads IDL-Reporteros, an investigative reporting outfit, told the Guardian the Odebrecht scandal could be “the biggest case of corruption in the history of Latin America”. It is estimated that Odebrecht paid out more than $730m in bribes across 12 countries in Latin America, according to a journalistic investigation."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"global-development/2017/feb/10/hans-rosling-remembered-a-kind-and-constantly-curious-genius-ann-lindstrand","type":"article","sectionId":"global-development","sectionName":"Global development","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-10T16:46:59Z","webTitle":"Hans Rosling: 'A kind and constantly curious genius' | Ann Lindstrand","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2017/feb/10/hans-rosling-remembered-a-kind-and-constantly-curious-genius-ann-lindstrand","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2017/feb/10/hans-rosling-remembered-a-kind-and-constantly-curious-genius-ann-lindstrand","fields":{"headline":"Hans Rosling: 'A kind and constantly curious genius'","bodyText":"Hans Rosling was a kind and constantly curious genius. He was truly committed to the poorest people in this world, passionate about statistics and dedicated to communicating a fact-based worldview. His knowledge, virtuosity and humour infused his unique data visualisations with a life of their own, encouraging people around the world to engage with facts about population, global health and inequality that might otherwise have passed them by. I first met him in his messy, overloaded office at Uppsala University in Sweden, where he was associate professor of internal medicine, in 1992. He showed me his now famous bubble graph on world statistics on handwritten overheads, and from that moment on he constantly provoked me to think and to become better. Hans was born in Uppsala on 27 July 1948, and the city – about 43 miles north of Stockholm – loomed large in his life. He attended medical school at Uppsala University, graduating in 1974, and lectured there on international health from 1983 to 1996. Along the way, he touched countless young lives. Fashion, food or sleep, he couldn’t care less about. The man who became famous as an “edutainer” on stage was just as mind-blowing, intense and inspiring in private discussions or in the classroom. He never accepted dogma, and had a boundless capacity to come up with new ideas. Hans was my mentor in public health, in research and in life. He believed in people and gave me the confidence to do what I thought impossible. He was a professor who understood how to make others grow, and he sparked energy and a willingness to effect change in numerous young people in so many places around the world. Once you became his friend, he was always there for you. We worked together for many years, organising courses in public health in India, Tanzania and Vietnam and collaborating on a textbook on global health. One paragraph in the book took weeks of conversations to agree upon, and it sometimes drove me crazy. But during our travels he never stopped educating me or anyone else who was interested, regardless of that person’s status or background. To Hans, it didn’t matter if you were Bill Gates, a first-year medical student or a traditional birth attendant in a village in Tanzania – as long as you really listened and tried to understand. By the same token, he listened to others and liked to be challenged himself. That appetite for challenge took Hans around the world. After graduating from Uppsala University in statistics and medicine in 1974 – by which time had already spent a year studying public health at St John’s Medical College in Bangalore, India – he worked as a doctor in northern Mozambique from 1979 to 1981. He subsequently began investigating the cause of a rare paralytic disease affecting people in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. His research on the subject, which continued across Africa and led to the disease being named “konzo” – or “tired legs” in the Bantu language Yaka – earned him a PhD from Uppsala University in 1986. Honesty came naturally to Hans. He once said to me: “To succeed, remember to always pay taxes and make no tricks with money.” No one worked for free around Hans, because he made sure everyone had a salary. His loyalty to his friends and family was strong. Agneta, his wife, who travelled to Mozambique with him when they were a young and idealistic couple, started as a midwife, became a psychiatrist, did her PhD and became head of clinic, encouraged by Hans. They married in 1972, when he was 24; he would later find statistical mileage even in those bare details. Ola, Anna and Magnus, his three children, were very close to him, but sometimes I wondered how his family could stand all his travels and his impossible work pace. Hans always worked. I think it was compensated by his absolute attention when he was present in front of you, full of warmth and with a great sense of humour. In 1997, he became professor of global health at Sweden’s Karolinska Institute; in 2005, still pursuing his dream of a fact-based global outlook, and determined to “fight devastating misconceptions about global development”, he co-founded the Gapminder Foundation together with his son Ola and daughter-in-law Anna Rosling Rönnlund. Within two years, Google paid an undisclosed amount for the Trendalyzer software behind the bouncing bubbles and animated statistics that, through his Ted talks and TV documentaries such as The Joy of Stats and Don’t Panic – the Truth about Population, propelled him into the global spotlight. When Hans became famous, he would sometimes laugh about it like an excited boy. Yet fame never changed his way of being. He just truly loved being on stage. I think what he enjoyed most about the elevation of his status was the access it gave him to influential people. That meant he could make things happen. One example of this occurred during the Ebola epidemic, when he mobilised funds and established an Ebola course for international aid workers. He gave an epic speech at the Medical Association on the importance of acting quickly against Ebola that left all 400 people present ready to leave the next day to help. One of his last missions involved assisting the ministry of health in Liberia during the Ebola epidemic. He really enjoyed working cheek by jowl in a small office with his Liberian colleagues, passionately charting, analysing and acting to stop the epidemic. Hans was discouraged sometimes. “I teach the same thing over decades and ignorance is still there,” he would occasionally lament. But Hans, you moved so many of us. No one can take your place, but we can all play our part in creating a fact-based understanding of the world that will help us make the right decisions for our future."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/feb/10/accountants-want-compensation-for-tax-office-computer-system-failures","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-10T03:40:12Z","webTitle":"Accountants want compensation for tax office computer system failures","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/feb/10/accountants-want-compensation-for-tax-office-computer-system-failures","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/feb/10/accountants-want-compensation-for-tax-office-computer-system-failures","fields":{"headline":"Accountants want compensation for tax office computer system failures","bodyText":"Accountants have demanded compensation for the havoc caused to their businesses by the failure of Australian taxation office computer systems. The federal government’s tax portal, website and other online services have been frequently unavailable, causing significant disruption to agents and accountants. The tax office has sought to blame the provider of its storage systems, Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE), and recently suggested it may have breached its contractual requirements. The Institute of Public Accountants, which largely represents small accounting firms, has demanded any compensation should flow to affected businesses. The institute’s general manager for communications, Wayne Debernardi, said the failure of the ATO’s systems had left staff unable to work during a traditionally busy period. When services did come back online, he said, staff were forced to work overtime to catch up, creating additional costs for businesses. He said the financial losses of each business should be assessed on a case-by-case basis and each compensated appropriately, regardless of whether the tax office or HPE was liable. The institute had made its case for compensation clear to the federal government. “We’ve put it on the table, we’re put it forward, and if they are going to get compensation from their provider ... there’s no question that the business world that has been affected should receive it,” Debernardi told Guardian Australia. The task would prove mammoth for the federal government, and adds yet another headache caused by the litany of tech failures in recent months. The government is conducting reviews, internally and externally through PricewaterhouseCoopers, about the failures and their source. An ATO spokeswoman said the agency would continue to operate on a “no detriment basis for our clients”. She said the agency would consider all compensation claims made. “Our immediate focus in the aftermath of these outages has been on resuming normal services for our key impacted stakeholders and the broader community,” the spokeswoman said. “There are a number of factors we will need to consider moving forward. As you know we have engaged PwC to undertake an independent review into the outages, and this will assist us in determining our next steps.” The tax office has already sought to attribute blame to HPE. Tax commissioner Chris Jordan said in a statement this week: “Initial indications are there has been a failure by Hewlett Packard Enterprise to provide contracted services in a reliable way and ensure stability of our systems. “I can assure the community that we are taking this seriously and it has the highest priority. I have already met a number of times with the most senior HPE representatives in the region and corresponded with their CEO to ensure they are aware of the disruption and damage this kind of event causes and remind them of their contractual arrangements.” He said initial indications were that the failures were caused by faulty hardware. The ATO bought new storage systems late last year from HPE. It has repeatedly stated that the shutdowns have not caused a loss of data. Debernardi said the results of the dual reviews should be shared with the institute’s members. “Our stance is quite simple – that conversation should be passed on to our members, to the accountants who we represent,” he said. The tax office has maintainted the problems with its storage systems will not delay processing of tax returns after the end of the financial year. “We are absolutely confident that taxpayers will be able to lodge their returns and receive refunds on time from 1 July,” Jordan said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2017/feb/10/rio-olympic-venues-already-falling-into-a-state-of-disrepair","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-10T01:38:08Z","webTitle":"Rio Olympic venues already falling into a state of disrepair","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/feb/10/rio-olympic-venues-already-falling-into-a-state-of-disrepair","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/feb/10/rio-olympic-venues-already-falling-into-a-state-of-disrepair","fields":{"headline":"Rio Olympic venues already falling into a state of disrepair","bodyText":"Just six months on from the 2016 Games, a number of Rio’s major Olympic venues have fallen into a state of disrepair. Since the Paralympics closing ceremony, the Maracana Stadium has been looted, the key Games precinct has been shut down and the city’s Olympic golf course is struggling. The most alarming visual deterioration can be seen at the Maracana, where worms have damaged the now-threadbare playing surface, windows inside the stadium have been smashed, copper wire stolen from walls and ceilings, and a reported 10% of the 78,000 seats have been torn up. Late in January local electric utility company Light cut off power to the stadium in response to unpaid bills, claimed to be in the region of three million reals (USD$940,000). At that point construction company Obrecht – part of the consortium managing the stadium – called for the state of Rio de Janeiro to take over the administration of the unloved venue. Earlier in January the Maracana had been looted, with thieves taking fire extinguishers, hoses, televisions and a bronze bust of Mario Filho, the journalist for whom the stadium was named. “The worries over the present and the future of the stadium are only increasing,” the Rio de Janeiro Football Federation said in a statement on 10 January, in response to reports that the venue – heavily modified in 2014 to accommodate the Games – had been further damaged. The ground, which hosted the final match of the 1950 World Cup, was also used by four major Rio club teams – Botafogo, Flamengo, Fluminense and Vasco da Gama – but has been empty since the conclusion of the Games as key stakeholders remain at loggerheads over who will manage it into the future. The city’s $20m golf course is struggling to attract players. The course superintendent, Neil Cleverly, says the company he works for, Progolf, hasn’t been paid for two months by the Brazilian Golf Confederation. And the course architect, Gil Hanse, is not impressed. “We are bitterly disappointed ... we witnessed this type of brinkmanship during the construction of the course, and we are hopeful that this is another example of having to hit a low point before things get better,” Hanse told Golf World. Four other venues at Olympic Park – two arenas, the tennis centre and the velodrome – have also failed to attract new operators following the conclusion of the Games, meaning the entire facility has been effectively closed down and remains off limits to the local community. Last used on 18 September during the Paralympics, Olympic Park had attracted 150,000 patrons per day during the Games. Management of the park has transferred from Rio’s City Hall – who couldn’t attract an appropriate bid for the facility during an attempted sell-off – to the the federal government. Olympic Park was entirely deserted until last weekend, when a beach volleyball event was staged on makeshift sands on what were previously the Olympic tennis courts. Spectators were aghast at the wider state of disrepair in the park. “It’s an abandonment, a disregard for public money for the visitors who come here and want to see it used,” one spectator, Wanderson Wygers, told Rio newspaper O Globo. “The legacy is incredibly poor,” said Theresa Williamson, executive director of Catalytic Communities – a Rio-based non-government organisation providing support to favela communities – in an interview with AAP. “This all coincided with the economic recession but in Rio, just like the boom here was more intense because of the Olympics, now the fall is more intense because of the Olympics. Everybody here is suffering right now, of all incomes and all stripes and colours.” The future of the Deodoro sports precinct, home to the second-largest concentration of Olympic venues, is also uncertain. The Olympic precinct in Rio’s western zone was slated to be a park and recreation area following the Games. But City Hall has closed it, terminating the operating company’s contract last December. Rio 2016, the organising committee of the Games, are holding another tender to select a company to manage Deodoro, hoping it will re-open around March. The Olympic athletes’ village remains open, but has proven an undesirable and prohibitively expensive housing option for local residents. The 800,000 square metre village – which the Australian Olympic Committee initially refused to move into at the beginning of the Games – was planned to be post-Olympic public housing, but few locals are buying into it. In response, Rio’s new mayor Marcelo Crivella struck an agreement with a government-owned financial institution and construction company Carvalho Hosken Group to provide low-rate loans to sell the accommodation to civil entities such as the navy and army. An Amnesty study found Rio’s Olympics left “a shady legacy of a city entrenched with marginalisation and discrimination ... and a record of human rights violations where violence remains part of the game”. Theresa Williamson said about 80,000 of Rio’s poor were removed from their homes to make way for the Games. “For the most part, they now live in worst situations than they did before - and these were already the poor in a very unequal city,” she said. The only tangible Olympic legacy are some public transport improvements, mainly in affluent areas. “Those are the only legacies that you could claim are positive ... everything else is very negative,” Williamson said. “People are overwhelmingly not well. Everybody you talk to is struggling in some sense.” • This article was amended on 10 February 2017.

It’s also that those present at the event will include the two leaders’ wives – both of them. In the three weeks since Trump took over the world’s most powerful job, his wife, Melania, has established herself as a worthy spouse every bit as baffling as him. She has displayed an equally effortless ability to confound and confuse, with the one important distinction that while he has studiously hogged the limelight, she has remained largely in the shadows. Mar-a-Lago will mark her debut in a formal role as first lady since her starring appearance on inauguration day when she evoked parallels with Jackie Kennedy. Since that heady start, she has virtually disappeared from view, vanishing into the bowels of Trump Tower, where her silence has been as deafening as her husband’s bark. Take Twitter, the medium that has so far defined the Trump presidency. While he has tweeted almost literally around the clock, her @FLOTUS handle, with its 7 million followers, still quaintly bears but a single tweet posted the day after the inauguration. In it she said that she was “deeply honored” to serve as first lady. But if that really is the case, then where is she? Last week, when the president made an unannounced trip to Dover air force base to receive the body of a slain navy Seal who had died in Yemen, at his side was not his wife but his daughter, Ivanka. That in itself was not an aberration: Ivanka Trump has relocated with her husband Jared Kushner to Washington to be with her father, while Melania has remained behind in New York with their 10-year-old son, Barron. Past first ladies have tried to minimize the agony of playing the fawning presidential spouse by limiting their formal functions, notably Bess Truman, the post-second world war first lady who spent as little time as she could in the White House. But there has never been anyone quite like Melania Trump. “This is unique, like so much of this presidency,” said Dr Jean Harris, a political scientist at the University of Scranton in Pennsylvania who has studied the evolution of the first ladyship. “It really does boggle the mind what’s happening – she is challenging American tradition.” She may be absent, but she has not been idle. On Monday, Melania Trump astounded observers by reigniting a $150m defamation lawsuit against the Daily Mail, an act unprecedented in itself from a sitting first lady. What was most astonishing about the legal filing was the terms in which her objection to the Mail’s retracted August 2016 article was put. Certainly, she resented what she alleges was the newspaper’s implication: that when she began her career as a model she had worked as an “elite escort” in the “sex business”. But then she went on to lament that the Mail had jeopardized her “unique, once-in-a-lifetime opportunity … to launch a broad-based commercial brand for a multi-year term during which [Trump] is one of the most photographed women in the world”. She didn’t spell out that the “term” would coincide with her husband’s term or terms in the White House, but she left little to the imagination. So how are the American people to interpret this puzzling combination of physical absence and commercial opportunism? The New York Times took a rather stuffy stance in answering that conundrum, pontificating that her invisibility raised “questions about her role” and cast in doubt the annual Easter Egg Roll. An alternative position would be to suggest that in 2017 it must be possible for an accomplished and ambitious woman (and first spouses have, of course, all been women in the 228-year history of the American presidency) to remain independent. After all, it was not Melania who ran for public office. “I haven’t yet heard Trump herself express a feminist angle to any of this,” said Professor Katherine Sibley, an expert on presidential matters at Saint Joseph’s University. “But maybe she does feel the role, which is unpaid, is suffocating and wants to focus on her own career.” The billion-dollar question is how this will go down with the American electorate. Trump’s supporters put him into the White House as a vote for change, but was this the change that his supporters – including many white working-class and conservative-minded people from the heartlands – had in mind? Harris is skeptical. “I don’t think Americans are ready for the kind of first lady Melania has so far shown herself to be. They still have traditional expectations that the first lady should be there to support her husband and present a loving family ideal to the American people.” First ladies have been obliged to reboot their images in the past. Hillary Clinton tried to be an active member of Bill’s administration in the early 1990s, taking healthcare reform under her wing. But when that failed, and she was castigated for overstepping her mark, she reined in her ambitions and reverted to a more conventional part. Melania Trump has veered in the opposite direction, opting to play a lesser role than her predecessors, who have each championed causes, such as Barbara Bush on literacy and Michelle Obama’s drive against obesity. The new first lady has said she wants to make the fight against cyberbullying her thing, though, as Mother Jones has pointed out, there is scant evidence that she is doing anything about it. Others have pointed out the irony of her chosen cause given her husband’s habit of frequent and often aggressively personal tweeting. Melania Trump has begun, rather belatedly, to pull together a team for the East Wing. She has appointed a chief of staff and a senior adviser, and this week added to the list her new social secretary, Anna Lloyd. In the press release announcing the appointment, the White House ticked off a number of conventional functions that Lloyd would oversee, including state dinners, social calendar events and unspecified “first lady’s initiatives”. Even more pointedly, Trump herself commented that she was looking forward to bringing “my ideas and traditions of entertaining to America’s house, my new home”. Maybe she means it, that the White House will soon become her home, the enigma that is Melania Trump will rapidly dissipate and she will settle into a traditional first lady’s role. But given that there is little traditional about the world of President Trump, you’ve got to doubt it."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/feb/10/structural-shift-on-coalitions-right-sets-off-some-frantic-repair-work","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-10T03:07:56Z","webTitle":"Structural shift on Coalition's right sets off some frantic repair work | Katharine Murphy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/feb/10/structural-shift-on-coalitions-right-sets-off-some-frantic-repair-work","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/feb/10/structural-shift-on-coalitions-right-sets-off-some-frantic-repair-work","fields":{"headline":"Structural shift on Coalition's right sets off some frantic repair work","bodyText":"The venerable Australian political commentator Paul Kelly wrote this week that conservatism was devouring itself, consumed, he said, by personal aggrandisement, ideological delusion and populist fervour. This “upheaval”, as Kelly termed it, was likely to “deliver power to the Labor party and generate a structural split among conservatives that will weaken their cause for years to come”. It was quite the cri de coeur. The challenges for centre-right politics in Australia were certainly on full display this week. First there was that Newspoll, showing a dive in the Coalition’s primary vote and a positive bump for One Nation and “others”. Pauline Hanson arrived back in Canberra for the new parliamentary year, minus the Rod Culleton irritant, looking enormously pleased with herself. Cory Bernardi finally defected, and George Christensen kept wandering around like an untethered bull, musing about crossing the floor, not leaving the LNP, then, possibly, leaving, no, staying. Tony Abbott fired the odd Facebook missile, Kevin Andrews boned up on Trumpism in full view of colleagues in the House of Representatives, yellow highlighter aloft. You can see why Kelly, the omniscient narrator of orderly arcs of Australian political history, is concerned about the trajectory of establishment centre-right politics. But the chaos of the week also yielded some insights. If we step back far enough to look through the static, these things can be observed. Malcolm Turnbull has come back from the Christmas break wanting, as one of his colleagues put it to me this week, to “give comfort” to the conservative element in the Coalition, which makes up the vast bulk of the grassroots membership. Obviously it’s not new for Turnbull to genuflect to the right. The prime minister, as everyone can observe, has been at pains to keep the peace with conservatives since taking the leadership in 2015, attempting to lead in collegiate fashion, at considerable personal cost. But this is a different sort of calculation. Right now, the right of Australian politics is fracturing, just as the left fractured when the ALP lost a chunk of its people to the Greens, and found itself left with a depressed primary vote, which makes it harder to win government at the federal level in its own right. Just before Christmas, I spent time with people in Adelaide, formerly rusted-on Coalition types, who had drifted over to the Nick Xenophon Team because Xenophon is seen to validate their concerns, and he attempts to get results. Time on the ground is illuminating. It tells you there’s a big structural shift going on. A chunk of the Coalition’s base is jack of Canberra incrementalism, and some voters are energised by reactionary responses to contemporary problems. That’s where One Nation sounds appealing. “We are going through a cathartic experience,” a member of the government said to me this week. So the post-Christmas fine-tuning isn’t an exercise in maintaining crude factional balance, or the “whatever it takes” calculations a leader makes to hold on to power. The effort right now is centred on trying to keep disaffected voters in-house, rather than drifting off to splinter groups. Government people know Hanson is a more accomplished politician than she was during her first stint in Canberra, and if the Bernardi movement somehow manages to catch fire, splinter groups on the right will not be a transient phenomenon. So that’s the government’s problem. What’s been the response? We’ve seen an outbreak from the government of coal devotion, in one case, a farcical outbreak, driven in part by the competition from “others” and surly voter sentiment in regional Queensland’s coal central, and in South Australia. (The coal pivot is considerably more complicated than courtship politics, but let’s just bank that element of the story for now.) We’ve seen the government rip the gold pass off those nasty establishment politicians – which is all about hitting the front bar nod test down at Disaffection Pub. The government also dumped plans to compulsorily acquire prime farmland in Queensland, which was to be used for joint training exercises with Singapore’s military. Hanson had arrived with her surfboard to jump on that issue, with Ray Hadley in tow, and the problem disappeared in five minutes flat. The opening of the parliamentary year has been an exercise in mass signalling to the base. And it’s not over yet. More is coming. Just a heads up. Peter Dutton is tanned, has a new buzz cut, and is raring to go. But having watched Abbott as prime minister speak more or less exclusively to the base, and no one else, perhaps the Coalition has learned the odd thing. Turnbull is also trying to be base plus. He’s trying to send a signal that the government cares about bread and butter issues – cost of living, affordable childcare, high power prices. The exciting times are gone. Clean-cut young T-shirted tech heads in start-ups, the masters of the ultra competitive and unforgiving global labour market, are on the back burner. Mums ’n bubs are in. The daily seminar about the virtues of trickle-down economics has been nixed. Turnbull is presenting himself as the man who will keep the lights on (never mind the fine print about lacking the policies to keep the lights on at the least cost to households.) It’s also been interesting this week to watch the prime minister make peace with himself, and in Trump style, try to make his biography a political virtue. While Turnbull’s wealth has been the subject of blue-on-blue attacks (most famously with Peta Credlin and that ferocious put-down, Mr Harbourside Mansion), and constant Labor negative messaging (Turnbull is out of touch, that’s why he cuts benefits he’s never needed to access) – the prime minister squared his shoulders this week and declared his privilege a virtue. Privilege meant he could not be bought. Privilege meant accomplishment, which translates to being prime ministerial. If he was Trump, he might have observed he wasn’t a creature of the swamp. As he is Malcolm Turnbull, he’s declared he is not a political “hack”. This too is a nod message for the base, where making something of yourself resonates. Barnaby Joyce translated the message into base speak best this week. “As I’ve said before, look, if I’m going to have a choice between someone running the country with the arse out of their pants, who’s never made a buck, or someone who’s actually made a dollar, got ahead … remember, Mr Turnbull owns a nice stack on the harbour because he’s worked very hard and been successful. And that’s what we want in this nation. We should celebrate success.” Outside the base, many people heard a nasty, reflexive classism in the Turnbull put-down of Bill Shorten this week – a very clear suggestion from the prime minister that Shorten should know his place, rather than hobnobbing with Melbourne billionaires – social climbing. The Labor MP Tim Watts summarised the unimpressed responses to Shorten being called a parasite and a sycophant by Turnbull. “I’m a public school boy and we know exactly what it means when toffs and snobs say someone is a social climber. It means know your place. It means don’t rise above your station.” A lot of people did hear Turnbull’s message in precisely those terms, and won’t forget it quickly. If there’s a pitched political battle on around the world for white working-class votes, it’s probably best to be a teensy bit careful about declaring global domination from Point Piper. But again if we look through the noise of the week to the prime ministerial calculation, it’s interesting. I’ve said consistently this year that Turnbull is in all sorts of trouble. I said his speech this week was a nothing-left-to-lose expression of personal frustration, as well as a punt from a position of political weakness. But the Shorten sortie is also a statement of intent. The government knows Labor has been winning the head-to-head battle, and is cutting through with voters. Sensible people in the government respect Shorten’s ability to shape a political message, and his dexterity on his feet, and the government also fears Labor’s massive field campaign machine with an existential kind of terror. But while admiring his backroom craft and his institutional heft, people also believe Shorten, as a public figurehead, is a drag on the Labor brand, a human hesitation factor for swinging voters. Rationally, that would be an argument to leave him well alone – but politics is often not very rational. Combat freaks are wired to go after weakness. Politicians are hunters, always on the lookout for prey. As the new political year opens, I’d much rather be Bill Shorten than Malcolm Turnbull. But we all need to bear in mind that combat freaks are singular characters, not inclined to forfeit – always backing themselves to belt their way off the ropes."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2017/feb/09/st-helens-leeds-rhinos-super-league-match-report","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-09T22:01:52Z","webTitle":"Mark Percival edges St Helens to victory over Leeds in Super League opener","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/feb/09/st-helens-leeds-rhinos-super-league-match-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/feb/09/st-helens-leeds-rhinos-super-league-match-report","fields":{"headline":"Mark Percival edges St Helens to victory over Leeds in Super League opener","bodyText":"It is difficult to gauge what fortune may hold for any side on the evidence of the first game of a new season and here the fans of St Helens and Leeds watching the opening fixture will have learned little as to what the next eight months have in store. Early-season games are so often decided by resilience and defensive efforts and, to that end, this was a heartening night’s work for two teams who will both have Grand Final aspirations after trophyless campaigns last year. Yes, there is work to be done with ball in hand for both – but for any side to be on top of their attacking game in the opening month, let alone on the opening night, is nigh-on impossible. That Leeds’ last two campaigns offered the complete contrast of a treble in one and a relegation battle in the other perhaps best illustrates the opening night is no yardstick to measure a side’s hopes. But, right now, that is all we have – so what did we learn about Leeds and St Helens? From Leeds’ perspective, there were comforting factors even in defeat. They look far better defensively than the side who collapsed on more than one occasion last year during the defence of their Super League title. “I thought it was a strong performance for the first game of the year,” said the Leeds coach, Brian McDermott. “You’ve got a few objectives and staying in the game and strong defensive efforts are two of them.” McDermott pointed to the kicking game of Leeds’ opponents as the difference. Without the influence and guile of his captain, Danny McGuire, the Rhinos’ attack did not possess enough cutting edge to secure victory – and the Saints did about enough in reply to capitalise. They too were below par in attack and devoid of a key pivot in the half-back Matty Smith, who will miss several months of the season owing to a broken leg. His replacement, Danny Richardson, showed glimpses of promise alongside Théo Fages in the halves but this was a match in which defensive supremacy proved telling for Keiron Cunningham’s men. On a number of occasions Cunningham has talked up the potential of his squad and while there is undoubted improvement to come, this was a solid, if unspectacular start, for the Saints. “The resilience of the players was second to none,” he said. “I’ve spoken about the unity we have and this is the best squad in terms of that. It wasn’t pretty but, boy, we worked exceptionally hard.” Cunningham is right. It certainly was not pretty but in terms of the spectacle expected from an opening fixture, it was far from the worst game the Super League has produced. Both sides’ defensive efforts cancelled each other out in the opening quarter but, as the Saints began to turn the ball over inside their own half, Leeds eventually took advantage when Joel Moon scythed through the defence to touch down. Leeds could, and perhaps should, have extended their lead as half-time approached, but they were guilty of spurning a number of golden opportunities that came their way courtesy of more lacklustre handling from St Helens. “I was a little bit disappointed with aspects of the first half,” Cunningham said and it was not hard to see where he was pointing the finger. Saints’ attack was noticeably off the boil in the opening 40 minutes but shortly after half-time, Fages produced an individual moment of brilliance to cut through and, amazingly, Mark Percival’s conversion to make it 6-4 was the final scoring act of the match. There were brief moments of interest thereafter though. Tommy Makinson denied Liam Sutcliffe with a superb covering tackle before his opposite number, Ashton Golding, who McDermott described as “outstanding”, did the same soon after as the Saints broke downfield. However, St Helens ultimately held on for the two points which they would have gladly settled for before the kick-off – even if the match itself will not take up too much room on the end-of-season DVD.

Guadalupe García de Rayos, a 36-year-old mother of two US citizens, was a non-violent felon who had for years complied with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) orders after being convicted of using a fake social security number to work. But on Wednesday, when she went for her usual check-in, Ice agents took her into custody instead, separating her from her husband and children, who were waiting outside. Under a new executive order that President Trump signed on 25 January, García de Rayos had become a priority for deportation. The order states that undocumented immigrants should be deported if they have been charged with any criminal offense. The president said the order was needed “to ensure the public safety of the American people”. By Wednesday night, more than 100 protesters gathered outside the Ice office in Phoenix and blocked several vans that were coming out. One of the vans was carrying García de Rayos. One man tied himself to one of the van’s front wheels, and seven demonstrators were arrested by Phoenix police officers, who showed up in riot gear at about 10pm. García de Rayos’s two children also tried to block the van carrying their mother. On Thursday, after learning the news that she had been deported, her children broke down crying. Jacqueline García de Rayos, 14, described having to pack her mother’s luggage so she could send it to Mexico. “I don’t think it’s fair that she was taken away from us,” Jacqueline said. “Her only crime was to work here so she could support us. “She is a very kind person,” Jacqueline said. “She treats everyone like family. She hasn’t done anything to harm anyone.” On Thursday, Ice said in a statement that her “immigration case underwent review at multiple levels of the immigration court system, including the Board of Immigration Appeals, and the judges held she did not have a legal basis to remain in the US. Ice will continue to focus on identifying and removing individuals with felony convictions who have final orders of removal issued by the nation’s immigration courts.” García de Rayos had been living in the US as an undocumented immigrant since she was 14 years old. Her husband, Aaron Reyes, is also undocumented. “This is our country, because this is where we’ve lived most of our lives,” Reyes said. “We went to school here. This is where we met and got married. This is where we formed our lives and this is where our children were born.” Reyes said his family’s “nightmare” began in 2008 when his wife was arrested during a workplace raid ordered by then Maricopa County sheriff Joe Arpaio at a water park in Mesa. After spending six months in jail, she was released. She was allowed to stay in the country on the condition that she check in with Ice for a brief review of her case and to answer a few questions once a year. She never had a problem until now. After going into the Ice office in Phoenix as usual, her husband and children anxiously waited for her outside but she didn’t come out. Instead she was taken into custody and Ice agents began procedures to send her back to Mexico. Ray Ybarra Maldonado, the immigration attorney representing García de Rayos, said his client was not deemed a priority for deportation under Obama because the administration’s focus was on deporting immigrants who were a threat to public safety, had ties to gangs or had committed serious felony offenses. García de Rayos didn’t fit those criteria, he said, which is why she was allowed to stay in the US. “I think this is a direct result of the new executive orders by the Trump administration that are being put into action,” Maldonado said about García de Rayos’s deportation. He also said the order “has nothing to do with public safety” and “has everything to do with separating families”. “All because she was trying to work to support herself and her kids – which is the same thing any of us would’ve done if we were in her situation – she was criminalized, given a class 6 felony and now she finds herself on the other side of the border,” Maldonado said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2017/feb/09/hospitals-state-of-war-government-adviser-says","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-09T22:00:34Z","webTitle":"Hospitals are in state of 'war', UK government adviser says","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/feb/09/hospitals-state-of-war-government-adviser-says","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2017/feb/09/hospitals-state-of-war-government-adviser-says","fields":{"headline":"Hospitals are in state of 'war', UK government adviser says","bodyText":"Hospitals are under such extreme pressure that they are in a state of “war”, a key government adviser on the NHS has admitted, in a frank assessment of the health service’s deepening crisis. Patrick Carter, who advises the health secretary, Jeremy Hunt, on NHS efficiency, warned that the service, which has just posted its worst ever performance on A&amp;E, cancer and other waiting times, is facing “a very, very difficult” time operationally and financially until 2020. In a speech to leading doctors, Lord Carter said: “We need to be incredibly proud that our hospitals are running so hot, and yet they haven’t broken. It’s a staggering achievement. This is like being [in] a war actually and we should be extraordinarily proud of it. But you can’t continue on a war basis forever, as we know.” Carter also said that an England-wide ban on what he called a “colossal” number of non-urgent operations, such as hip replacements, in December and January, designed to help avoid an NHS winter crisis, had been wrong, had forced surgeons to “remain idle” and had handed to private health firms £1bn that cash-strapped hospitals needed to stabilise their perilous finances. “I don’t know how many of you have had elective surgery cancelled since before Christmas. My own sense, when I look at the numbers, [is] it’s absolutely colossal,” Carter told the Royal College of Anaesthetists’ annual dinner on Tuesday. “If we aren’t doing the electives, how do we make the hospital budgets stack? It’s a nightmare. Idle theatres. Idle surgeons. Idle clinicians. Idle anaesthetists. I mean it just isn’t right”, added Carter. He is also a non-executive director of NHS Improvement, the financial regulator that issued the edict he criticised so heavily, which told hospitals to cancel planned surgery from 16 December to 19 January. Carter, a Labour peer, has undertaken a series of reviews of challenging and costly issues since 2002 for Tony Blair, Gordon Brown and David Cameron’s governments. They have included criminal records, legal aid, Wembley Stadium and NHS pathology services. Hunt is trying to achieve £5bn a year of NHS efficiency savings identified by Carter in 2015. Carter also warned that the NHS “is going to face a very, very difficult three years” between now and 2020. It is unlikely, on current prospects, to get any extra money, despite growing concern that it risks falling over unless it receives an emergency cash injection, he said. “Last year we spent £120bn on the NHS. That’s the equivalent of the whole of VAT collected in England. Now the Treasury takes a view that if they gave us another million or two we’d just swallow it up, as we have in the past, and we would not actually materially make a difference and we would stand there saying ‘more money, more money, more money’.” Labour seized on Carter’s comments. “Even the government’s own health advisers are now saying that austerity for the NHS has gone on too long and is creating war-like conditions for patients,” said Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow health secretary. “Yet again we are warned of the NHS crisis this winter in the most astounding of terms. What’s more, for it to come from a government adviser is quite simply staggering. It’s now blindingly obvious to everyone – other than ministers – that Theresa May’s decision to squeeze health funding this winter has caused chaos and misery for patients, who are having to wait longer than ever for basic services,” he added. His comments come as the latest official figures showed that NHS performance was the worst ever against most of its waiting-time targets in December, just as the service’s winter crisis was beginning. For example, a total of 25,157 people during 2016 had to wait more than the supposed maximum of two months after referral by their GP to start urgent cancer treatment – the highest number on record, and more than the 23,760 seen in 2015 and 13,191 seen in 2010. Similarly, just 86.2% of A&amp;E patients were treated and admitted, transferred or discharged within four hours – the lowest proportion since records began in 2004. Ambulances breached waiting-time targets to respond to the most seriously life-threatening of 999 calls by the widest margin ever. Crews responded to just 66.4% of Red 1 calls within eight minutes, when someone is not breathing or has had a cardiac arrest, when it should be at least 75%. And they reached only 58.8% of Red 2 calls within the required eight minutes, for which the target is also 75%. These involve fits, strokes and other life-threatening incidents. The percentage of patients given hospital treatment within 18 weeks has also fallen below 90% for the first time since March 2011. And the number of hospital bed days taken up by patients who are fit to leave – “delayed transfers of care” – hit 195,286 in December, another record. Carter lavished praise on the NHS and urged people to “talk the service up rather than down”. He also cast doubt on whether the sustainability and transformation plans (STPs) of NHS England boss Simon Stevens would transform care as much as promised, and said rationalisation of specialist hospital units, as many of the 44 STP plans envisage, was necessary but “politically extremely difficult”. The Department of Health declined to comment directly on Carter’s views, despite a request to do so. A spokeswoman said only that: “Despite the pressures of winter, more than 54,000 people were seen within four hours in A&amp;E every day during December. Rescheduling operations to free up space for other patients was a clinical decision made by medical experts.” Jim Mackey, NHS Improvement’s chief executive, said: “Our hospitals have never seen this level of demand and it is causing real problems for them. Despite this, the NHS continues to outperform health systems in other major nations. “Such intense pressure on emergency services has had a real impact on elective services and patients are having to wait longer for non-emergency treatment, and this is also adding to the financial pressures being felt by NHS providers.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2017/feb/09/six-nations-england-back-row-wales-eddie-jones-itoje-clifford-hughes","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-09T21:59:34Z","webTitle":"Six Nations: Injuries force England to run through back-row options against Wales","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/feb/09/six-nations-england-back-row-wales-eddie-jones-itoje-clifford-hughes","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/feb/09/six-nations-england-back-row-wales-eddie-jones-itoje-clifford-hughes","fields":{"headline":"Six Nations: Injuries force England to run through back-row options against Wales","bodyText":"When someone used the word “callow” to describe England’s starting back row to face Wales on Saturday, Eddie Jones asked his questioner for a precise definition. The dictionary offers several alternatives, ranging from immature, inexperienced and naive to green as grass, raw and untried. Not all are entirely suitable but a steep Cardiff learning curve definitely awaits in Cardiff. By choosing Maro Itoje, Jack Clifford and Nathan Hughes in tandem opposite the Wales trio of Sam Warburton, Justin Tipuric and Ross Moriarty, Jones can hardly be accused of conservatism. Itoje will be making only his second start on the blindside flank, Clifford has never started a Six Nations game, while Hughes will be wearing the England No8 jersey for only the third time. Warburton will be winning his 71st cap and Tipuric his 48th. Collectively the Wales back row have a tally of 130 caps compared with England’s paltry 20; it is just as well Taulupe Faletau (62 caps) is only on the bench. Experience is not the sole quality required to excel in the Six Nations but, by any standards, England are short of it. Can their combination neuter the threat of three strong candidates for Lions places this summer and extend their team’s winning Test run to 16 games? “I wouldn’t have picked them otherwise,” said Jones, brusquely. Individually there is no real problem. Itoje is already one of the key men in England’s pack, Hughes is the powerful next cab off the rank in the absence of the injured Billy Vunipola and Clifford, like Itoje, is a former England Under–20 captain long earmarked for senior prominence. The snag is that, as a well-oiled back-row blend, they have never operated together, not an ideal situation for a visit to the Principality Stadium. Jones’s hand has been forced to a large extent with James Haskell not yet deemed fit to start a Test following his lengthy injury layoff, Chris Robshaw out for the entire tournament and Northampton’s Tom Wood having barely trained this week after taking a bang to a shoulder against France. Quite what happens if the 6ft 4in Clifford twists an ankle in the opening minute will be one of several questions being raised by both sets of supporters between now and kick-off. The England management, nevertheless, remain publicly bullish. They need more pace in the pack, not to mention another ball-carrying option, and Clifford ticks those boxes. The 23-year-old Harlequins player also knows Moriarty well, having played with him in the same triumphant under-20 side before the latter declared for Wales, and Jones argues that talent ultimately trumps everything else. “Before Clifford was picked, everyone here was telling me he’s the best young player. Now I pick him he’s too inexperienced so I don’t see how you can win here. He’s a great young player and deserves the opportunity.” England’s captain, Dylan Hartley, unsurprisingly, was also quick to back the Brisbane-born Clifford, who scored a try in England’s 27-13 victory over Wales in their pre-Australia tour game at Twickenham last May and has also represented his country at sevens. “Jack went on tour in the summer so he has done his time,” Hartley said. “He has stuck in there and been a really good influence within the squad. He makes the team laugh but I can’t say any more. It’s a big game for him; I don’t want to create any banter. “I don’t think experience is going to be a deal-breaker. If you look what is in front of those guys it is a front five that is pretty hefty in caps. Maro has been in the team a long time and he’s a fantastic player. I don’t think experience is an issue for him and Nathan has been around the team for a long time too. We will be just fine.” Jones did admit to omitting Clifford, the son of a Kenyan father and an English mother, from last month’s training camp in Brighton as a hurry-up and did not attempt to downplay the breakdown challenge awaiting England. “Warburton’s an interesting player – he reminds me a bit of Chris Robshaw. He’s not a traditional seven but he’s a hard-working grafter who carries and tackles well … a good glue player. Tipuric’s a bit different: a bit like a French No7, an Olivier Magne-type player, a ball-carrier, fast feet, defensively good and bad. It’s an interesting mix and then they have a No8 that carries.” As a talking point it at least made a change from the stadium-roof debate; Jones’s vote to keep it open is presumably to allow all the pre-match hot air to escape. Where England do not want to be caught cold is out wide where the return of Jack Nowell for Jonny May is an entirely sensible choice for this fixture and allows the left-footed Elliot Daly to operate more often on his more natural flank. “Jack Nowell brings a bit more work rate and his great attribute is his ability to carry through contact,” Jones said. “Wales are not a side you get around because of the way they defend so you have to go through them. His running skills will suit us better this week than Jonny’s.” Always assuming England can first escape the clutches of Warburton, Tipuric, Moriarty and friends."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"technology/2017/feb/10/silicon-valley-right-wing-donald-trump-peter-thiel","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-10T10:00:49Z","webTitle":"Meet the rightwing power players lurking beneath Silicon Valley's liberal facade","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/feb/10/silicon-valley-right-wing-donald-trump-peter-thiel","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2017/feb/10/silicon-valley-right-wing-donald-trump-peter-thiel","fields":{"headline":"Meet the rightwing power players lurking beneath Silicon Valley's liberal facade","bodyText":"When a group of 97 technology companies filed a legal submission against Donald Trump’s travel ban for citizens of seven Muslim-majority companies, the immediate question for many was not who had signed, but who had not. Absence from the brief became a source of embarrassment, and many new tech firms – including Adobe, Tesla, Zenefits, Postmates and Fitbit – quickly jumped on board. As much as Silicon Valley likes to promote an image of innovative iconoclasm, companies have a herd mentality when it comes to political or social issues. Once one company goes out on a limb, the rest rush to follow. With near-unanimous opposition to Trump’s executive order, tech burnished its image as a bastion of progressive values – a reputation that had taken a major hit when top executives travelled to Trump Tower in December to make nice with the then president-elect. A certain amount of self-congratulation for the industry’s enlightened liberalism has since been widely on display, from Airbnb’s Super Bowl ad to the 10th annual Crunchies, which took place on Monday night. The industry award show – tech’s version of the White House correspondent’s dinner – saw numerous impassioned speeches about Trump and the responsibility of tech companies to change the world for the better. But the tech industry has long had a substantial rightwing streak. And outside of the spotlight, a cadre of powerful and well-connected industry figures with ties to Peter Thiel and some of tech’s most prominent companies are embedding themselves in the Trump administration. Thiel’s unusual support for Trump’s candidacy made him seem like the loneliest man in Silicon Valley during the 2016 campaign, but like any industry that accumulates massive amounts of capital in the hands of a select few, tech has its fair share of old-school Republicans. Figures like TJ Rodgers, the founder of Cypress Semiconductor, and Scott McNealy, co-founder of Sun Microsystems, represent an earlier generation of conservative Silicon Valley. Rodgers and McNealy combined the standard small government/low taxes economic conservatism with a strain of social conservatism that is practically verboten in the industry today – both fought back hard, for example, against the first wave of activism calling for the hiring of black and Latino tech workers. Other tech leaders, such as Oracle’s Larry Ellison, Intel’s Craig Barrett, Dell’s Michael Dell and AOL’s Tim Armstrong, have been major donors to the GOP, while HP’s Carly Fiorina and eBay’s Meg Whitman have both run (unsuccessfully) for elected office as Republicans. Intel’s current CEO, Brian Krzanich, appeared at the White House with Trump on Wednesday to announce the construction of a factory that had previously been announced alongside Barack Obama in 2011. But none of them embraced Trump’s brand of conservatism the way Thiel did, and now the idiosyncratic billionaire is poised to exert significant influence on the government. Thiel has long operated with a clubhouse mentality. As an undergraduate at Stanford, he co-founded the Stanford Review, a rightwing student newspaper whose writers regularly railed against free condoms and the divestment campaign against apartheid South Africa. Several of Thiel’s closest associates worked for the publication, including Keith Rabois, David O Sacks, Joe Lonsdale, Ken Howery, Stephen Cohen and Eric Jackson. Rabois, Sacks, Lonsdale, Howery and Jackson all joined Thiel at his next major venture – Paypal. He picked up more friends at the company, including Elon Musk, Mark Woolway, and Scott Bannister. Other rightwing associates – including Jim O’Neill, Kevin Harrington, Trae Stephens, Blake Masters, and Rob Morrow – are connected to the Thiel club through working for his various investment companies: Clarium Capital, Thiel Capital, Mithril Capital Management, Thiel Macro, and Founders Fund. Rob Morrow, who Politico described as Thiel’s “political consigliere”, is a longtime employee of the Thiel investment firms. The Thiel Foundation and Thiel Fellowship, led by Jack Abraham, and Palantir – a data analysis company whose clients include the US intelligence community and defense department – are other meeting grounds for the ideologically like-minded. Lonsdale, Cohen and Howery co-founded Palantir with Thiel; Rabois and Sacks have invested in the company, and Stephens worked there before moving to Founders Fund. To Aaron Ginn of Lincoln Network, a group that promotes libertarianism in the tech industry, many of Thiel’s associates form the core of the conservative movement in Silicon Valley. Ginn named Thiel, Lonsdale, Banister, Masters and Rabois as key leaders in the community, along with Ellison and Andreessen Horowitz’s Ted Ullyat, a former Bush administration figure who later served as general counsel to Facebook. “While overall the Bay Area is of a progressive persuasion, the actual people who work in technology are not,” Ginn said. “According to the polling that we have done, Silicon Valley technologists … are predominantly libertarian, with small government values outside the environment and healthcare.” The Thiel cadre has influence that extends into many of the hottest Silicon Valley companies. Thiel is well known for his position on the board of Facebook, but he and his friends also have reach into companies including Airbnb, Lyft, Reddit, SpaceX, Uber and Zenefits, among others. Now, while the rest of the tech industry turn up their noses at Trump, Thiel is placing his buddies in positions of power. Woolway and Harrington joined the Trump transition team in early December. Lonsdale and Masters were also advising Thiel on the transition, according to Politico, and Abraham expressed interest in joining the administration to the Washington Post. Musk is a member of Trump’s economic advisory council who remained committed to engaging with the administration despite a significant backlash that prompted Uber’s CEO, Travis Kalanick, to drop out. O’Neil has been floated as a possible head of the Food and Drug Administration, where he could bring his enthusiasm for cutting regulation to the agency that ensures drugs like thalidomide are not approved in the US. “Since when has there ever been a VC, let alone a successful tech entrepreneur, who is part of the transition team? This is the first time that has ever happened,” Ginn enthused. “We could have the FDA radically changed. That’s one of the things that Peter Thiel has been focusing on. That would be a huge win for consumers and people in Silicon Valley.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/mar/31/theresa-may-nicola-sturgeon-scotland-referendum","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-03-31T06:00:48Z","webTitle":"May and Sturgeon have set a wheel of fire rolling, and both will struggle to stop it | \r\nMartin Kettle\r\n\r\n","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/mar/31/theresa-may-nicola-sturgeon-scotland-referendum","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/mar/31/theresa-may-nicola-sturgeon-scotland-referendum","fields":{"headline":"May and Sturgeon have set a wheel of fire rolling, and both will struggle to stop it","bodyText":"In the pivotal scene of Alexander Pushkin’s Eugene Onegin, the heroine Tatyana writes a disastrously counterproductive love letter to the aloof hero. Mistaking Onegin’s reserve for nobility of character, Tatyana throws herself upon him. The scene that follows is one of the most touching in all of European opera. Britain leaving the European Union, set out in a letter from Theresa May to Donald Tusk this week, can hardly be described as touching. Yet, like Pushkin’s Tatyana, Theresa May is both an optimist and an idealist. Like Tatyana, she is prone to misread evidence and to prefer hope over experience. This is true of her approach to European. It is also true of the way she is trying to shape post-Brexit Britain. Which of us, for instance, would not want Britain to be a more united country than it is today? Unity was a key rhetorical element in May’s Commons speech on Wednesday. Two days before she sent her fateful letter to the EU, the prime minister made a speech in Scotland that spelled this out even more explicitly. The words are worth noting because they are very ambitious. The government’s post-Brexit plan for Britain, she said in East Kilbride, “has at its heart one overarching goal: to build a more united nation”. It is important to do May the credit of understanding that she really means this. She thinks, as she put it in Scotland, that she can get a good deal for Britain in the European negotiations while at the same time delivering for “ordinary working people at home”. She thinks she can bring people and communities together through measures that offer “integration and social cohesion”, while also strengthening the United Kingdom. A more united nation, in other words, means a renewed social union across the economic divide and a strengthened political union across the home nations. There was a time in Conservative party history when these were not controversial aspirations. No senior postwar Conservative of the pre-Margaret Thatcher era, with the important exception of Enoch Powell, would have hesitated before speaking in such terms. It was what that era understood by “one nation” conservatism. But Thatcher trashed these pieties. She preferred possessive individualism to a social compact, and she wrapped the party in a more Anglocentric version of Toryism. The party she left behind has struggled with that legacy ever since. It remains a defining constraint on many of May’s practical options. None of these are potentially more explosive than the union itself. May’s commitment to the union of the United Kingdom is beyond dispute. She is not a Tory who flirts with the idea of letting Scotland loose, as a means of securing Conservative rule more strongly in what remains of the UK. May talks of the “beloved union”. We should assume she means it. May is now committed to maintaining the union by getting a Brexit deal she can sell in Scotland. Both parts of this plan are highly ambitious. The two together is more ambitious still. On the first part, there have been opaque suggestions this week that May is prepared to compromise more than previously hinted on single market and customs union access, and the Brexit secretary, David Davis, has suggested a more open approach on EU migration. Nevertheless, even if May secured a softer Brexit than she has yet let on, she also has to sell that deal in Scotland over the objections of a Scottish parliament that has now voted for a second independence referendum. That is a huge ask. The SNP could hardly have been clearer that it opposes May’s approach, wants Scotland to have its own special deal with the EU, and is squeezing the last drop of grievance out of May’s refusal to make an agreement with the Scottish government before triggering article 50 this week. Although SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon does not want to be bounced prematurely into a second referendum she may lose, she is being inexorably pushed into one, thanks to a combination of pressure from her party and May’s stubborn determination not to make early concessions to the Scots’ case. This week’s vote at Holyrood makes it even harder for Sturgeon to back down, even if she wants to. The Tory brand in Scotland is not as toxic as it once was, at the height of post-Thatcher anger. Its ecumenical leader, Ruth Davidson, has led the party back into second place. But English Toryism can still be lethal in Scotland. With the SNP framing every question as a choice between “Scotland” (ie the nationalists) and “the Tories” (ie May and perhaps the English in general), it is hard for an English Tory prime minister in London to win a hearing – much less an argument – against Sturgeon and the SNP. Yet that is seemingly the course on which May is now embarked. After this week’s Holyrood vote, the SNP can now only realistically abort the second referendum if May produces a Brexit deal the SNP can embrace. Government sources put it graphically but in a way guaranteed to rile the SNP: “Nicola has climbed a tall tree and got stuck. It’s our task to find ways to help her down.” That’s not inconceivable, because substantial powers on farming and fishing are about to be repatriated from Brussels, and could then be devolved to Holyrood. Gordon Brown has recently added environmental regulation to that list, along with VAT powers and about £800m currently spent by the EU in Scotland. These are important issues and an SNP that wanted a reason to postpone a referendum could conceivably parade them as a prize worth taking as an alternative. Yet it is hard not to feel things have already gone too far, that Sturgeon and May have set a wheel of fire rolling that they couldn’t stop even if they wanted to. It’s possible that May believes Sturgeon needs to be drawn into battle on a soft Brexit amid continuing anxieties about the economic case for independence because, in May’s view, the sooner the SNP’s bluff is called, the greater the possibility that a non-nationalist government can take over in Edinburgh after the 2021 Scottish elections. Which is all fine if you are convinced, first, that Scots will like a soft Brexit when they voted for no Brexit at all; second, that May and Davidson have the reach and tonal command to out-argue Sturgeon and the SNP; third, that Scots, even though maybe not voting in such large numbers as they did in 2014, are willing to inflict an immense electoral defeat on the nationalists; and, fourth, that you have a strategy in place, perhaps even a federal settlement of the sort Brown now advocates, to cope with the anger that such a defeat would trigger. Perhaps May and Davidson really have got all this worked out. Perhaps May really loves devolution and federalism more than she, a great centraliser, has ever hinted. But if they haven’t, the alternative is the breakup of the “beloved union”. Either way, the stakes could hardly be higher for the UK. From now on, everything that happens on article 50 matters not just for the UK in Europe, but for the very future of the UK itself."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"media/2017/mar/30/bbc-urged-to-stand-firm-against-accusations-of-brexit-bias","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2017-03-30T14:19:06Z","webTitle":"BBC urged to stand firm against accusations of Brexit bias","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/mar/30/bbc-urged-to-stand-firm-against-accusations-of-brexit-bias","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2017/mar/30/bbc-urged-to-stand-firm-against-accusations-of-brexit-bias","fields":{"headline":"BBC urged to stand firm against accusations of Brexit bias","bodyText":"More than 80 senior politicians have written to the BBC urging it to stand firm against allegations of bias over its Brexit coverage. In a letter to the director general, Tony Hall, coordinated by Labour’s Pat McFadden, a cross-party group of MPs and MEPs calls on the corporation to “resist attempts at political interference”, and “report fearlessly and impartially” on the negotiations as Britain leaves the European Union. Signatories include Ed Vaizey, a Conservative culture secretary, Tim Farron, the Liberal Democrats’ leader, and Yvette Cooper, the Labour chair of the home affairs select committee. The letter is a response to concerns about political pressure on the broadcaster, after about 70 MPs, most of them sympathetic to Brexit, signed a letter published in the Daily Mail and the Telegraph earlier this month, claiming the BBC was being too pessimistic about Britain’s prospects outside the EU. McFadden and his co-signatories hope to strengthen the BBC’s arm, with the negotiations on leaving the EU set to begin in earnest after Theresa May triggered article 50 on Wednesday by dispatching a letter to Brussels formally declaring Britain’s intention to quit the EU. “The BBC and our broadcasters (unlike newspapers) are required to be objective and impartial by law,” the letter says. “The BBC rightly guards its independence and should resist attempts at political interference or pressure.” “We expect the BBC to defend its independence and report impartially, robustly and fearlessly on all issues relating to Brexit and not succumb to any pressure to skew its coverage one way or another.” The pair of letters – one attacking the BBC, and another defending it – underline the febrile atmosphere in which talks are set to get under way. Lord Hall defended the BBC’s coverage after the critical letter, coordinated by Tory MP Julian Knight, was published earlier this month. “Impartiality has always been the cornerstone of BBC News. It remains so today,” he said. “We go to great lengths to ensure that we balance our coverage and address all issues from a wide range of different perspectives.” The letter of complaint was signed by former cabinet ministers Iain Duncan Smith and Theresa Villiers."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"housing-network/2017/mar/31/class-war-housing-conservatives-young-people-unaffordable","type":"article","sectionId":"housing-network","sectionName":"Housing Network","webPublicationDate":"2017-03-31T06:03:48Z","webTitle":"Housing class war as Tories set their sights on young people | Dawn Foster","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/housing-network/2017/mar/31/class-war-housing-conservatives-young-people-unaffordable","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/housing-network/2017/mar/31/class-war-housing-conservatives-young-people-unaffordable","fields":{"headline":"It's a housing class war as the Tories set their sights on young people","bodyText":"With April heralding the new financial year, a number of political fresh starts are due this weekend. One is the removal of housing benefit for 18- to 21-year-olds. I’ve written about this before. Leaving aside its arbitrary and politically nonsensical rationale, supposedly stopping “dependence on benefits” by starving poor people into economic activity, the costs that the policy incurs will outweigh any potential savings. Young people will simply not be able to afford their rent, and will turn to loan sharks and the type of high-cost, dodgy credit available to people on low incomes. Or they’ll end up homeless, on the street or relying on the local council to place them in a hostel or temporary accommodation, which invariably costs many times more than the local market rate for a private rented flat. Now, in addition, the Chartered Institute of Housing has released research which shows that housing is almost totally out of reach for young single people in many areas. Single young people are finding that the gap between how much the cheapest properties in their area are and how much help they get with housing costs through the Local Housing Allowance (LHA) makes housing inaccessible. And a freeze on LHA until 2020 will only make matters worse. Young tenants can either attempt to find the cash needed to make up their rent from the rest of their budget – skimping on food, fuel and other bills – or will end up in arrears and face potential homelessness. In 50 areas, LHA covers less than a quarter of local rents and, with competition for cheaper properties already high, young people in receipt of benefits often find they aren’t private landlords’ preferred tenants anyway. So we have very young adults who’ve had housing support completely stripped away, and even on reaching their 21st birthday, there is no relief to be found, only a tough market increasingly squeezing them out. Housing simply isn’t working for millions of young people, and has become a huge source of constant anxiety on a scale it has rarely been in the past. But it isn’t all bad news for young people. This April the government is also bringing in the “Lifetime ISA”, a tax-free savings account that gives you £1,000 of cash from the government when you save £4,000 a year towards buying your first home. So if you save the maximum for five years, you’ll receive a £5,000 wad from the Treasury. The maximum you can receive is £32,000. This will encourage and help first-time buyers, we’re told. These policies are completely typical of the Conservative approach, dividing young people and entrenching deep inequality. The people who need help least, the minted with parental help available for purchasing homes, get a tax-free lump sum to make their lives even easier. The people who need help most are completely cut adrift, and have any hope of becoming solvent and achieving not even comfort but basic shelter destroyed by actively cruel policies. It’s typical of austerity policies in all its hypocrisy, combined with turbo-charged venom for the poor. After the financial crash, we were repeatedly told that paying wealthy financiers and bankers less, or even scrapping bonuses was out of the question: paying them more would incentivise them to perform far better and benefit everyone. But the poor are a different species to Conservatives: the only way to make them find a home, or a job, or to work harder, is to starve them into action, deny them a roof over their head, and threaten them with sanctions and the withdrawal of subsistence welfare payments. For years politicians and commentators have argued there is a generational war, shown in the effects of the housing crisis and the erosion of workers’ rights. But old habits die hard. April’s disparate approach to young people over housing shows the Conservative party is still fighting the class war.

Somehow it seems that I’m the same age as the last prime minister, Mike Tyson and Cindy Crawford. But I’m also the same age as Adrian Mole, and this makes much more sense. Adrian celebrated his 14th birthday with a tracksuit and football from his father, A Boy’s Book of Carpentry from Grandma Mole (“no comment”) and £1 inside a card from Grandma Sugden (“Last of the big spenders”). While I didn’t keep a diary at the time, I’m sure this list won’t have been far off. One of the great pleasures of reading at that age is a sense of “me too”, the relief and reassurance this brings, and it’s hard to think of a time when I’ve experienced a greater sense of recognition than when reading The Secret Diary of Adrian Mole Aged 13 ¾. The anxiety about acne and nuclear war, the perpetual sense of injustice, the anguish of the unrecognised intellectual, the reverence for the BBC and reliance on the public library in the endless quest for self-improvement, it was all here, and made blissfully funny in a sustained, near flawless piece of comic ventriloquism. Even the title had a good joke – the childish pedantry of the “¾”, an attempt at maturity that reveals its opposite. Comedy was another teenage obsession of mine, but the great tradition of British comic fiction seemed either posh – Waugh and Wodehouse – or decidedly upper middle-class. I loved Willans and Searle’s Molesworth books, but they might as well have been set on Mars for all I knew of Latin crammers and the prep-school system. There were exceptions; Billy Liar, for instance, another love-torn provincial fantasist with whom Adrian surely shares DNA, but so much other comic writing, the Pythons, Cook and Moore, even The Hitchhiker’s Guide, all had that Oxbridge tone. Adrian was entirely average; a middle-achieving Everyboy from the Midlands, not as posh as Pandora or Nigel, posher than the terrifying Barry Kent, unremarkable, invisible, with everything happening below the surface like, well, a mole. The Secret Diary was smartly written, stuffed full of in-jokes and references to Orwell and Flaubert and Simone de Beauvoir, but it made sense to people who weren’t quite sure what a campus looked like, and there was also a compassion so much other comedy seemed to lack. Often touching, sometimes angry, never sentimental but always sympathetic, and with an extraordinarily high joke-per-page ratio, no wonder its appeal was so immense. Boys and girls read Adrian Mole, adults and teenagers, all of us wondering the same thing: “How does Sue Townsend know?” It helped it was so rude. When not measuring his thing or hiding in his room, “racked with sexuality”, high on Sanatogen and copies of Big and Bouncy (“Felt like I have never felt before”), he’s having wet dreams (“WD’s”) inspired by what must surely be a misreading of The Second Sex. Had anyone ever been so frank and funny about male adolescence? When Adrian writes “Woke up with a pain in my goolies”, we asked, again, how does she know? There’s a gamble involved in returning to the books we loved in our youth, but I’m pleased to say that The Secret Diary is still wonderfully funny and entertaining. Some of that pleasure comes from a queasy nostalgia – butterscotch Instant Whip in front of Play School, Chinese chips and boil-in-the bag cod – and in this respect it’s hard to think of a better social document of a time when Lucozade was valued for its medicinal properties. Like Victoria Wood and Alan Bennett, Townsend has a brilliant ear for the precise gradations of class, the ritzy aspiration of going to Sainsbury’s or drinking wine for the first time (“it seemed a pleasant enough vintage”, writes Adrian ). As with those writers, there’s a precision to the language, an attention to economy and rhythm that is so often the mark of good comic writing; “Friday March 20th. It is the first day of Spring. The council have chopped all the elms down in Elm Tree Avenue.” Or read the great comic set piece, Class Four D’s trip to the British Museum, written in the urgent bark of a police report. (“4.30 Barry Kent disappears, last seen heading towards Soho.”) Even sitting alone, you feel compelled to read passages out loud. There’s a wonderful rhythm, too, in the diary form itself, the set pieces punctuated with a series of tiny vignettes or one liners that at times give it the pacing of a great standup act. Townsend sets up a joke on a Monday that will pay off on Thursday, Sunday and again the following March, and the diary form makes a virtue of this kind of repetition, turning routine into comedy, and providing a terrific narrative pull for the reader. Imagine Adrian Mole, or indeed Bridget Jones, as a third-person, past-tense novel, and the story wouldn’t have nearly the same drive. Just one more entry, one more day, then we’ll put the book down. Townsend also plays brilliantly with the contradiction of the diary form. Like a confessional or a psychiatrist’s chair, a diary offers an opportunity to be entirely open and honest, yet Adrian’s most private voice – like Bridget’s – is never entirely free from dishonesty and self-deception, so he can take War and Peace out of the library on Saturday, finish it on Sunday, and still pronounce it “quite good”. He sometimes resembles another aspirational working-class boy, Leonard Bast in Howards End, with whom he shares “the vague aspirations, the mental dishonesty, the familiarity with the outsides of books”. But there’s no condescension in Townsend’s depiction, and Adrian has a vulnerability that prevents him, for he most part, from being a pompous ass. One of the book’s smartest observations is that for all his radical posturing, Adrian is essentially conservative, fearful of change, longing for security and stability. His parents may be an embarrassment, but their break-up throws life into disarray, and the terrifying economics of the everyday are everywhere; the fear of the scene at the supermarket checkout, the unpaid bill, the bounced cheque. Townsend was an avowedly political writer, and there’s real anger in the book, yet the tone is never solemn, preachy or dogmatic. With politics, as with love and sex and culture, Adrian is just as likely to miss the point. (“Reading Animal Farm by George Orwell. I think I might like to be a vet when I grow up.”) In the years since that first encounter, I’m afraid to say I lost touch with Adrian. Adolescence is an ordeal that we all pass through, and Adrian’s humiliations were made bearable by the hope that he might shake off the self-absorption and infatuation and find requited love or success in a vocation other than poetry. But there’s no comedy in an older, wiser, happier Mole, no story in contentment, which is perhaps why the later books, still finely written, are sometimes so melancholy and angry. On 2 April 2007 Adrian celebrated his 40th birthday and received a Smythson A4 notebook from Pandora (claimed on parliamentary expenses), and a blow-up doll from Nigel (now blind and living with his boyfriend, Lance). Adrian has grown up into a bald, divorced father of three, struggling with a diagnosis of prostate cancer, yet he still manages to find some of his old fire. “Could the Smythson notebook and I together revive the English novel?” he wonders. Townsend herself suffered from illness throughout her life – diabetes, heart problems, arthritis and, in her final years, blindness – yet continued to work successfully at a time when most other writers might have felt justified in taking a rest. Her death in 2014 brought the diary to an end, and we’ll never know what Adrian receives for his 50th birthday, but she was, and remains, an inspiration for a generation of readers, and writers too, a passionate popular entertainer of great integrity and wit. My own son is reading The Secret Diary now, and while he may not understand the pleasures of Pebble Mill at One or Dream Topping, he recognises skilled, truthful comic writing. It’s a pleasure to sit and watch him laugh out loud. • David Nicholls’ novels include Starter for Ten, One Day and Us."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"artanddesign/2017/apr/02/marc-quinn-sir-john-soanes-museum-cerith-wyn-evans-tate-britain-review","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2017-04-02T07:00:47Z","webTitle":"Marc Quinn: Drawn from Life; Cerith Wyn Evans – review","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/apr/02/marc-quinn-sir-john-soanes-museum-cerith-wyn-evans-tate-britain-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2017/apr/02/marc-quinn-sir-john-soanes-museum-cerith-wyn-evans-tate-britain-review","fields":{"headline":"Marc Quinn: Drawn from Life; Cerith Wyn Evans – review","bodyText":"Marc Quinn is in love, and lustily so. That is the main news at Sir John Soane’s Museum. If you didn’t know it from the flood of celebrity photographs of the 53-year-old artist in superannuated baseball cap embracing his girlfriend, the towering dancer Jenny Bastet, you could easily deduce it from this show of new sculptures specially made for the Soane. Every single one testifies to his adoration of her lithe body, nude and forming the central, full-frontal figure in a sequence of pas de deux in which his arms hold her tightly. Who knows where one lover ends and the other begins? That’s certainly the first trick with these figures, cast from life but painted to look like classical sculptures in marble and bronze: you’re supposed to disentangle the bodies. Each stands upon two long legs, which might be male or female at first sight. Each has two sets of arms and shoulders, but neither heads nor feet. The immediate associations are with Greek warriors, Roman athletes and neo-classical lovers, twined in white marble embrace. Indeed, Quinn has been directly inspired by the fragments of ancient civilisations acquired by the Georgian architect John Soane, mounted floor to ceiling in the museum around you. Compelled to investigate, you draw in close – whereupon the ruthless accuracy of each body cast strikes home. The skin’s grain, the pores and veins, the slight irregularities and blemishes all reveal themselves with an abrupt realism that runs counter to the smooth classical aesthetic, not to mention the pleasing paint. For each work is a different colour, running from the white of marble to slate-blue, taupe and the darkness of ancient bronze. They look perfectly at home at the Soane; there is even a fetching Georgian grey. Tremendously tasteful but fundamentally flawed: that’s the second trick – an intriguing tension between the ideal and the human. Well it’s an idea, all right, and concepts have been Quinn’s career ever since 1991, when he cast five litres of his own blood in the frozen head Self (a life’s blood to make a portrait from life) and sold it to Charles Saatchi in the YBA heyday. And remodelling classicism has been his long-term modus operandi, what’s more. Think of the giant sculpture of Alison Lapper, pregnant and disabled, portrayed in white marble in Trafalgar Square in 2005. Or Kate Moss as a solid-gold goddess, reputedly costing £1.5m to make. Think of Quinn’s pregnant man, heroic in Carrara marble and rising tall as Michelangelo’s David. Now it is true that his latest series gets some purchase from the special commission, for the Soane is practically a museum of sculpture. One of Quinn’s works is positioned immediately between two classical nudes in the crypt, drawing sharp contrasts between modelling from the imagination and casting from the life. Another, headless, is surrounded by gargoyles, broken effigies and decapitated stone heads, prompting thoughts on the synecdochic power of fragments. And for a while at least, Quinn’s figures hold their own. He almost gets away with the classical fakery, especially when his specially aged surfaces blend in with the water-stained marble around them, or when light pours through a pair of fragile fibreglass hands, turning them into funereal wings. But warring against this are unfortunate technical glitches - where the hands are fudged, where a fringe of cast fabric looks like a secondary school project, where the dancer’s vulva appears incised as if with a child’s craft-knife in plasticine. Here and there the artifice is deliberately exposed, to be sure. Most of these sculptures are backless: walk round them and their hollowness is revealed. And one gallery is devoted to the process, including photographs of Quinn and Bastet up to their necks in the pink dental rubber from which the moulds were made, the rubber skins then peeled off like old overcoats. But these skins are presented here too like sacred relics in glass vitrines. Quinn, always so intelligent, if curiously drawn to the brash, appears to be losing his rueful sense of humour. Losing it to amour fou, perhaps. For the dozen works at the Soane Museum are all about Quinn’s passion for Bastet’s naked body. It is not just that she has no face, nor that he plays with the androgyny of her form – the broad shoulders, long arms and athletic legs – nor even nor that his hands are all over his muse. If classicism is all about the pure and depilated nude, genitals euphemised to the point of invisibility, Quinn’s figures are openly, candidly sexual. So are his swooning subtitles: Heaven, Lovely, Hot. It is a long time since Marc Quinn cast anything subtle. The recent The Sound of Silence – an aeroplane crash in the form of a mobile – was crass. His enormous sea shells, cast in polished bronze, are cumbersome and costly. His naked, bronze hermaphrodites make the Lapper statue look refined. Conceptualists are often drawn to casting as it allows them to invoke the history of figurative sculpture for their own purposes with maximum convenience (think of Ron Mueck, Gavin Turk, the magniloquent Antony Gormley, multiplying himself all over the land). Quinn used to be both original and eloquent with his body casts, especially the early self-portraits, in which he appeared flayed, turned inside out or collapsed on the floor like dropped trousers; crushed, melting, frozen – essentially metaphysical. But here he has repeated a single idea to no obvious gain (except presumably financial) in a sequence of works that will lose a lot when removed from their elevated surroundings, looking as they do, in the end, like the sexual trophies of a middle-aged man. This year’s Tate Britain Commission is by another White Cube artist, the Welshman Cerith Wyn Evans, and he too has recycled himself. Anyone who saw his last show will be familiar with some of the elements of the colossal white neon light piece, Forms in Space… by Light (in Time), hanging in the three neoclassical halls of the Duveen Galleries. At a distance, they cohere into something like an Ultra Brite cloud mass. Close up, the elements prove to be a fizzle of lines drawn in and through space. It all starts beautifully with a glowing circle that pulls the eye in, like a keyhole, to the strange forms beyond. These resemble bicycle spokes, cartoon exclamations and the diagrams from an optician’s chart (which indeed they are: an homage to Marcel Duchamp’s Large Glass where they also appear). The final gallery is a vast confusion of neon scribbles and whorls, lozenges, arcs, vectors and loops. Stand below it and the dazzle is cold and bright, like a sparkler’s frisson, yet curiously without the marvellous after-images. It is a feat of engineering (though the wiring is heavily conspicuous) and inevitably proposes some sort of theoretical origin that one might be able to identify in astronomy, for instance, or DNA. But the wall text tells us that Wyn Evans is transcribing the movements of Japanese Noh theatre. This fact hovers blankly in the air, adding no further dimension to the work. Whatever it means to the artist, the spectacular optical effect has already captured the public’s heart and turned the piece into an enormous photo opportunity.

That is the question that motivated a new study conducted at the University of Exeter in which participants were given descriptions of people being confronted after expressing certain views. When the views expressed a disregard for racial equality, the confrontations were approved of. But challenging – even politely – a disregard for climate change was seen as carrying a social cost by the students taking part in the experiment. Participants in the study felt less warm towards the character in the scenario (and were less likely to want to be friends with them) when they challenged views dismissive of climate change. The findings add to a long line of research showing the importance of social norms in guiding people’s attitudes and behaviours. But they might also tell us something important about the value of publicly debunking climate change contrarians. Clearly, neither people nor the planet are well-served by accepting, propagating or ignoring myths and falsehoods. But the potential collateral damage caused by challenging climate denial is important to consider too. It is well known that what drives people’s views on climate change are values and political ideology rather than levels of knowledge about climate science. Dismissing climate change has become a social norm on the right of US politics – reaction to the Republican party’s dismantling of Barack Obama’s energy policies is the most vivid current example – and is present to a lesser extent in the UK. What if debunking climate sceptics allows minor battles to be won, but risks losing the bigger fight for public opinion by stepping over invisible but powerful social lines? Bridging the ideological divide on climate change is essential. But that means changing the prevailing social norms – not ignoring them. While a lot of attention has been given to communicating the scientific consensus on climate change and concerns raised about the fact that people consistently underestimate it, the social consensus may be just as important. Several studies have shown that while most people in the UK are in favour of renewables, they don’t think other people are. Because of the continuing social silence around climate change and the space given to contrarian views in the media, the sense that other people don’t care is widespread – even when they do. Emphasising positive social norms is an important way of dispelling misconceptions around others’ views, and can help build momentum for a society to move towards lower carbon emissions. A commitment to the truth is a non-negotiable component of any credible communication around climate change, but campaign strategies also need to go with the grain of human behaviour. And if the unsettling swing towards “post-truth” discourse has taught us anything, it is that being right is not the same thing as being persuasive. Climate communicators need to get better at doing both at the same time."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/lostinshowbiz/2017/mar/30/linda-robson-reveals-pendolino-loo-trauma-but-keeps-quiet-on-brexit","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2017-03-30T16:46:51Z","webTitle":"Linda Robson reveals Pendolino loo trauma but keeps quiet on Brexit","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/lostinshowbiz/2017/mar/30/linda-robson-reveals-pendolino-loo-trauma-but-keeps-quiet-on-brexit","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/lostinshowbiz/2017/mar/30/linda-robson-reveals-pendolino-loo-trauma-but-keeps-quiet-on-brexit","fields":{"headline":"Linda Robson reveals Pendolino loo trauma but keeps quiet on Brexit","bodyText":"Heartbreaking scenes of self-censorship on Loose Women, as the ladies announce they are simply “too scared” to let viewers know which way they voted in the Brexit referendum. “We’re half and half,” explained Coleen Nolan of the panel’s psephological split. “And none of us want to sit here and say how we voted.” “We’re all too scared,” confirmed Saira Khan. “That’s why none of us are saying how we voted,” added Linda Robson.

Kiran Millwood Hargrave’s debut The Girl of Ink and Stars was named overall winner of the prestigious award by children’s laureate Chris Riddell at a ceremony in the bookselling chain’s flagship store in London’s Piccadilly. Influenced by Philip Pullman’s The Firework-Maker’s Daughter, the book was described by Waterstones managing director James Daunt as “wonderful”. “It’s a story that’s quite timeless, and I expect people will be reading it in years to come,” he said, adding that it represented the “heart” of the chain’s mission, which is to promote “good, old-fashioned storytelling”. The book tells the story of cartographer’s daughter Isabella Riosse. She lives on the island of Joya, which is reigned over by a strict governor. When her best friend Lupa disappears into a forbidden forest, she volunteers to find her using the island’s myths and the maps given to her by her father. After the ceremony on Thursday night, Millwood Hargrave, who is a graduate of Cambridge and Oxford and was a Barbican Young Poet, told the Guardian that she had not expected to win and felt “very grateful and happy”. “Normally in my head, when something good happens, there is that voice saying ‘you don’t deserve it’. But this feels different, this feels like I’ve done a good thing,” she said. “No matter what the future brings, I’ll have done this. I couldn’t have asked for a better start for my career.” Judge Florentyna Martin, who is Waterstones’ buyer for children’s books, described the novel as a joy to read. “It is always exciting when we see this level of outstanding talent in a new writer, and Kiran has crafted a mesmerising world full of myths, magic and adventure that evokes an atmosphere akin to Pullman’s His Dark Materials,” she said. The £5,000 prize champions new and emerging talent in children’s writing and is unique in that it is voted for solely by booksellers. The Girl of Ink and Stars beat strong competition for the overall award from Lizzy Stewart’s There’s a Tiger in the Garden, which won the category for illustrated books, and Orangeboy by Patrice Lawrence, which took the prize for older fiction. Stewart’s book was praised by Martin as “bold, bright and beautiful” picture book that “leaps off the page”. Lawrence’s debut Orangeboy was praised for its truthful and gripping storytelling, as well as its “rounded, believable teen characters”. Daunt said the three books showed that the trend for children’s books by celebrities had not pushed other writers out of the market. He was relaxed about the use of ghostwriters to produce books branded under the names of TV, sports and reality stars. “Ultimately the quality of the book will out,” he said. “If a celebrity brings people into a bookshop and brings people into reading books, it is all for the good.” He did add a caveat, however. “If a celebrity is producing tosh, then readers won’t come back for another one. It’s like bad TV, bad films or bad anything. The only thing that really works is quality.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"us-news/2017/mar/30/trump-gets-flamed-robot-prints-and-burns-presidents-tweets","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-03-30T17:02:15Z","webTitle":"Trump gets flamed: robot prints and burns president's tweets","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/mar/30/trump-gets-flamed-robot-prints-and-burns-presidents-tweets","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/mar/30/trump-gets-flamed-robot-prints-and-burns-presidents-tweets","fields":{"headline":"Trump gets flamed: robot prints and burns president's tweets","bodyText":"A robot that prints out Trump’s tweets and burns them has caught the imagination of Twitter users.

Walking into the StubHub Center through the players’ entrance, past the tunnel that leads on to the field, they’re off to your left. The two comet-like statuettes commemorate titles from Major League Soccer’s early years, and the three cups that complete the quintet speak to the LA Galaxy’s staying power. If such a fleeting thing as success can come to define a club’s ethos, the trophy case represents what the Galaxy have been, and what they have strived for in every season since. Where it gets more complicated is further down the hallway, where the nameplates in the home locker room have been in heavy rotation for the past 24 months or so. It’s not as though Los Angeles is that far removed from the glory years. The Galaxy won a record fifth MLS Cup title in 2014, when they sent Landon Donovan into his first retirement on a high and solidified coach Bruce Arena’s reign as one of the most successful spells in league history. They have qualified for the playoffs in every season dating back to 2008. The question now – more so than perhaps since the moment David Beckham signed in 2007 – is where the club goes from here. Donovan, despite a brief return last autumn, is gone now, he says for good. Arena has left, too, to take over the US national team in the wake of Jürgen Klinsmann’s dismissal. Robbie Keane, perhaps the most successful import in league history, saw his contact expire at the end of last season, and Steven Gerrard parted ways after a mostly unhappy year-and-a-half spell. To those still around, the expectation hasn’t changed, even if the highest-profile names have. The focus is now on building from within, leaning on a loaded local talent base and academy system that has long been renowned as one of MLS’s best. The Galaxy were the first team in the league to debut their own in-house minor-league squad, and the philosophy of building from within has spread to the whole organization. Curt Onalfo, Arena’s longtime deputy, is now in charge, and he’s not about to lower the bar. “We’re going to continue to be who we are, and that’s a team that’s successful and wins games and positions itself, hopefully, by the end of the year, to be a championship team,” he told the Guardian this week. “The only difference is that in the past we’ve often utilized players in their mid-30s to come off the bench. That’s different now. We’re using players who are younger in those roles. That’s really the only difference. You’ll continue to see a team who is hungry and plays good soccer.” It’s not as though Onalfo is picking from a bare cupboard. Mexico international Giovani Dos Santos may not be posting the raw numbers to back up the fanfare that greeted his arrival from La Liga’s Villarreal in 2015, but on his day, the 27-year-old is as gifted as just about any player in Concacaf. Belgian center-back Jelle van Damme was a finalist for the league’s defender of the year in his first season after joining from Standard Liège. Perhaps no player encapsulates LA’s shifting emphasis like Romain Alessandrini, a 27-year-old French winger who signed from Marseille in January in a designated player slot that had previously been the realm of more celebrated (and older) European stars. Onalfo, for his part, bristles at the idea that the Galaxy is drastically breaking from the formula that brought it such past success. “Focus on Alessandrini. Focus on Dos Santos. Focus on Van Damme. Focus on [Ashley] Cole,” Onalfo said. “We have stars. [The media] want to spend all your time harping about the depth of our team. “It’s a smart way – because in the end, guys that have been developed in our system, they don’t cost as much at the beginning. It’s what every club in the world does. That’s your guys’ job, to focus on that kind of stuff. All I’m focused on is getting better each day.” A rash of early-season injuries have complicated that task. Gyasi Zardes, who for a time was viewed as a budding US national team regular, broke his foot last August and has recently been sidelined with a knee injury. Dos Santos suffered a right leg injury in an early-season match against Portland, and Cole has been dealing with a lingering calf issue. A further blow came during this international break, when midfielder Sebastian Lletget suffered a foot injury shortly after scoring for USA against Honduras, which will cause him to miss between four and six months. Taken together, the absences help excuse Los Angeles’ consecutive home losses to open the new campaign, and give more legitimacy to the 2-1 victory at Real Salt Lake that preceded the bye weekend. “I think we’ve played very well,” Onalfo said. “We’ve gone into two of the three games, at least in theory, without five starters. So that means we’ve utilized the depth our team.” While player turnover has been significant, the coaching change hasn’t been as revolutionary as one might think. Onalfo has known Arena since he was 17 years old, when the veteran coach recruited him to play for the University of Virginia. Onalfo was as an assistant during Arena’s first USA reign from 2002-2006, and he has worked under him while with the Galaxy since 2011. “Bruce has his own way,” Onalfo said. “He’s great at getting the most out of people. I’ve learned a ton from him. I’ve learned that aspect. There are countless things that I’d say he helps me with. He’s the most influential person in my coaching career, for sure.” At least one coach on his staff knows well the value of fresh blood and perspectives. Ante Razov was a Sounders assistant last season, when Seattle fired longtime boss Sigi Schmid in July before closing the season on an 8-2-4 clip and winning their first MLS Cup under new coach Brian Schmetzer. “I think people see the Galaxy as being down a bit,” Razov said. “I think it’s quite the opposite. I think bringing refreshing things and change is not too dissimilar to Seattle. I think the resources that the club has here and the people in place, all of that is going to work really, really well for us.” To players with the tendency to look on the bright side, the new regime offers a blank slate. Rafael Garcia has been with the Galaxy since 2012, which might not sound like much, but in this locker room makes the 28-year-old midfielder an elder statesman. Famous names have come and gone, potential challengers risen and fallen, but when the postseason rolls around, the Galaxy have remained. “The Galaxy is known for winning Cups,” Garcia said. “There’s a reason why we have the most in the league. Nothing changes. The personnel might change, but the mentality and the desire to be successful remains the same.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2017/apr/02/s-town-serial-exceptional-storytelling-week-in-radio-review","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2017-04-02T06:00:46Z","webTitle":"The week in radio: S-Town review – exceptional storytelling","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/apr/02/s-town-serial-exceptional-storytelling-week-in-radio-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2017/apr/02/s-town-serial-exceptional-storytelling-week-in-radio-review","fields":{"headline":"The week in radio: S-Town review – exceptional storytelling","bodyText":"S-Town | stownpodcast.org I’d just quickly like to mention yesterday’s Between the Ears on Radio 3. Entitled Second Side Up – a Life Captured in Radio, it concerned Mark Talbot, a man who made a cassette radio show called Second Side Up for 40 years, and the programme was thoroughly engaging and sweet. Talbot documented his own, small life, punctuated by music, and his shows had a lovely, almost Partridge-y feel. I recommend. It’s a short mention because on Tuesday, S-Town arrived. All seven episodes of it landed into the stream of anyone who had previously clicked subscribe. And there were many of us. Why? Well, S-Town is the third series from the creators of Serial. S-Town is Serial 3. There are many differences between S-Town and Serial 1 and 2, though. The most noticeable being: you get all of the episodes at once. The USP of the amazingly successful Serial 1, which investigated an old Baltimore murder case, was that each episode, after the initial few, was made in the week preceding its broadcast. In that 2014 series, there was a hectic sense of a trail being followed, as presenter/producer Sarah Koenig and her producers chased up leads, went over old records, puzzled over the central mystery as we listened in. The series was developing as it was made, and that gave it excitement. But the format had its problems – legal procedures don’t stick to a week-by-week schedule – and almost inevitably, it came to an inconclusive end. Then 2016’s Serial 2, about a US soldier that was held for five years by the Taliban, quickly ran into difficulties with the format. Its episodes went from weekly to fortnightly, and the series lost momentum. By releasing all of S-Town in one go, not only does the new show avoid such hitches, it plonks itself very definitely in the Netflix/Amazon binge-consuming bracket. And it sits very naturally there: this is a story that unfolds in unexpected ways, and it’s one with a lot of atmosphere. Much of the action takes place in Woodstock, a small, poor town in Alabama (the S in S-Town stands for shit), and there’s a gothic, we-don’t-get-many-of-you-folks-around-here ambience. Gradually, through interesting emails and phone calls, New York-based presenter/producer Brian Reed is drawn into investigating what seems like a local murder. The man that draws him in is John McLemore, an exceptionally bright, charismatic watch-mender and carer for his mother. McLemore takes Reed to places that he and we don’t expect. There’s a scene in a tattoo parlour, another in a maze. One scene takes place in a shed, with McLemore’s friend sharpening his chainsaw, and McLemore himself rushing around, mixing lethal chemicals together, drunk. His messed-up giggles, the tick-tock rasp of the sharpening… we’re not in New York any more, Toto. S-Town might seem unlike Serial 1 and 2, but it is made by Serial and This American Life; its associate producers include Sarah Koenig and Ira Glass. And what it has in common with those first two series is its exceptional storytelling. There is such care in these programmes. They are such a pleasure to hear, so clear yet evocative. Reed’s explanations are timed perfectly to the audio. There are “aha!” moments, and moments of complete shock. The voices of the speakers, whether on the phone or in situ, are captivating, and they are allowed to breathe, so that we can hear their charisma. We are guided by Reed – we are his companions and he is ours – but we are given enough information and respect to be able to make our own decisions about what’s going on. Sometimes, Reed appears foolish, or nerdy, or socially awkward. Sometimes, he seems like a G. Honestly, I am in utter awe of the makers’ ability to sift through what must be thousands of hours of recording to create such a beautifully paced, enthralling listening experience. Each episode is around an hour long, and at the end of each one you want more. Perhaps this is the true USP of Serial shows: the way they make you want to rush to the next episode. I’ve heard four of S-Town’s seven, and I can’t wait to stop writing so I can listen to the rest."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"uk-news/2017/mar/30/westminster-terrorrist-attack-khalid-masood-died-of-gunshot-wound-to-chest-inquest-hears","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2017-03-30T13:45:40Z","webTitle":"Khalid Masood died of gunshot wound to chest, inquest hears","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/mar/30/westminster-terrorrist-attack-khalid-masood-died-of-gunshot-wound-to-chest-inquest-hears","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2017/mar/30/westminster-terrorrist-attack-khalid-masood-died-of-gunshot-wound-to-chest-inquest-hears","fields":{"headline":"Khalid Masood died of gunshot wound to chest, inquest hears","bodyText":"Khalid Masood, who killed four people in a terrorist attack in Westminster, died of a gunshot wound to the chest, an inquest has heard.

More than 35 people were injured in the attack, with wounds ranging from cuts and bruises to extensive bone and skull fractures. One person remains in a coma with extensive injuries. The inquest into Masood’s death was opened and adjourned until a pre-inquest review on 19 May at the Royal Courts of Justice. The senior investigating officer, Det Supt John Crossley, told the hearing: “Masood was challenged by armed police and shot. He was taken to St Mary’s hospital by ambulance. He was pronounced dead at 15:35 on 22 March.” Crossley said there were in excess of 1,500 potential witnesses, of whom at least 140 were considered significant. Inquests into the victims’ deaths opened and adjourned on Wednesday. Palmer’s cause of death was given as haemorrhage and a stab wound to the chest, the inquest heard. American tourist Kurt Cochran, 54, and teacher Aysha Frade, 44, died at the scene on the bridge after being struck by the car. Cochran died of multiple injuries and Frade died of head and chest injuries, the inquest heard.

But in a late night Senate debate on Thursday, a majority of senators in the chamber rejected the proposed reworking of the section, meaning the legislation will remain as it is. Labor, the Greens, the Nick Xenophon Team and the Tasmanian independent Jacquie Lambie voted together to defeat the proposed legislative change. The late-night defeat on 18C came amid corridor wrangling on the government’s $48bn company tax cut package. The negotiations have been complicated because the NXT leader, Nick Xenophon, had to leave Canberra because of a family bereavement and did not return to parliament until early on Thursday evening. Xenophon has been arguing he will only allow a tax cut for firms with turnovers up to $10m but the government has been attempting to persuade the NXT to vote for a higher threshold – a turnover of $50m. The government has persuaded the One Nation Senate bloc, and the Victorian senator Derryn Hinch, to vote for a tax cut for firms with turnovers of $50m. The government needs a vote on the company tax package this week because it is the last sitting week before the May budget. In an interview with the ABC on Thursday evening, the treasurer, Scott Morrison, refused to say whether the government would preserve the full $48bn package in the budget if the Senate only endorsed tax cuts for smaller firms. The government is under significant pressure from big business lobby groups to commit to keeping the full tax cut package, regardless of the Senate result. After the defeat of the proposed 18C changes at 10.30pm on Thursday night, the Senate went on to determine some changes to the Australian Human Rights Commission’s procedures. The attorney general, George Brandis, summing up the lengthy and at times combative chamber debate on 18C, declared it was “a very sad day for the country”. “As a result of tonight, the law will continue in its current, distorted fashion,” Brandis said. He had attempted to amend the government’s 18C proposal to make it clear that harassment could occur online and did not require people to be in each other’s presence. The government amendment also made it clear that harassment in the revised 18C could involve a single act – a definition that troubled the One Nation leader, Pauline Hanson, and the Australian Conservatives senator Cory Bernardi, who argued that the commonsense meaning of the word harassment was multiple acts. Regardless of the amendments, a majority of the Senate went on and rejected the entire legislative proposal. Labor and the Greens declared the result a victory for racial tolerance and for multicultural Australia. The Greens senator Nick McKim said the result meant senators stood “shoulder to shoulder” with multicultural Australia. Immediately after the vote, the influential rightwing thinktank the Institute of Public Affairs declared the Turnbull government must take its proposed changes to section 18C to the next federal election. “If another Andrew Bolt, QUT, Bill Leak or Ashfield Uniting church-type case occurs that will be on the heads of Labor, Greens, Xenophon and Jacquie Lambie who voted today against removing restrictions on freedom of speech,” said Simon Breheny, director of policy at the IPA. “Senators who voted against this bill have failed a test of their commitment to basic human liberty.” But Amnesty International welcomed the Senate’s stance, saying Thursday’s vote should be the end of the matter. “The message to prime minister Turnbull is clear: this conversation is over,” said Tammy Solonec, Indigenous rights manager at Amnesty International Australia. “He needs to get on the right side of history and firmly put an end to the debate around racist hate speech.” The renewed debate has sparked a significant backlash from ethnic and religious communities, and it has divided the Coalition. During a debate spanning many months, a number of moderate Liberal MPs defending marginal seats have urged the government leadership to leave 18C alone and focus instead on overhauling the processes administered by the Australian Human Rights Commission to ensure vexatious cases don’t end up in court. Some ministers, including the deputy prime minister, Barnaby Joyce, have been open in arguing that the pursuit of 18C should not be a priority for the government. Concetta Fierravanti-Wells, the minister for international development and the Pacific, warned during a party-room debate that taking on 18C would hurt the government in ethnic-minority communities and would invite a significant campaign against the government by the Labor at the next election. But the right faction of the Liberal party has pursued the changes vigorously, and a number of government senators spoke strongly in favour of legislative change during the Senate debate."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/apr/01/can-thought-control-technology-be-used-to-overcome-physical-paralysis","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-04-01T07:00:18Z","webTitle":"Can thought-control technology be used to overcome physical paralysis?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/apr/01/can-thought-control-technology-be-used-to-overcome-physical-paralysis","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/apr/01/can-thought-control-technology-be-used-to-overcome-physical-paralysis","fields":{"headline":"Can thought-control technology be used to overcome physical paralysis?","bodyText":"Is it possible to overcome paralysis by harnessing thoughts? A man who was paralysed from the shoulders down after a bicycle accident in which he ploughed into the back of a mail truck is now able to move his arm for the first time in eight years, thanks to thought-control technology, also known as neuroprosthetics. “He can now think about moving his arm, and his arm moves,” said Robert Kirsch, a professor of biomedical engineering at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio, who was involved in the research. Using sensors implanted in his brain and electrodes in his arm, the patient is now able to carry out a range of tasks, from drinking through a straw to eating pretzels, and even feeding himself mashed potato with a fork. How does the technology work? Put simply, the man – Bill Kochevar, now 56 – had two arrays of microelectrodes implanted in the region of his brain that is involved with movement, the motor cortex; specifically, in the area of the motor cortex that deals with the hands. But decoding which thoughts – or more precisely, which signals in the brain – are linked to which movements is a tricky business. To help the computer system match them up, Kochevar spent four months in training, during which he used a virtual-reality setup to learn to control the movements of an on-screen arm with his thoughts. The team implanted 36 electrodes into various parts of the muscles in his arm. After 18 weeks’ training, in which the electrodes in the arm were used to stimulate the muscles and to build their strength, the electrodes were connected to the computer system and to the implants in Kochevar’s brain, allowing him to make and control arm movements with his thoughts. A mobile arm support, which is also thought-controlled, helped to combat the effect of gravity on Kochevar’s arm. “We have been able to take the electrical signals that represent his thoughts and use them to control stimulation of his arm and his hand,” said Bolu Ajiboye, lead author of the research, who is also from Case Western Reserve. “Now we can tell the world that it is possible to reconnect the brain and make the arm move again,” added Kochevar. Are brain implants safe? According to the study, Kochevar had the brain implant for almost two years before the end of the reported research, and had just four minor issues relating to the device. Nevertheless, this is invasive brain surgery, which always carries risks. Does this mean we can cure paralysis? No. This doesn’t heal damaged tissue, and hence does not repair the underlying spinal injury. Instead it bypasses the injury, providing an alternative route through which the brain can control movements of the body. But is it a solution for paralysis? Unfortunately, this is only one individual and a proof-of-principle study – the technology is not yet ready for use outside of the lab. What’s more, the movements were slow and restricted. While the technology allowed Kochevar to move his arm and grasp objects, it did not restore a sense of touch, meaning that he was not able to feel the object he was picking up or holding. But he was able to complete tasks even with his eyes closed. How does this fit in with previous work? Last year it was revealed that 24-year-old Ian Burkhart, who has less severe paralysis than Kochevar, had regained movements in his hand and fingers, allowing him to carry out a range of actions, from swiping a credit card to playing the video game Guitar Hero. The success was achieved using a system similar to that in the latest study, but the electrodes that stimulated Burkhart’s muscles were contained in an external sleeve. Thought control has also been used to command robotic limbs: in 2015, gunshot survivor Erik Sorto demonstrated the ability to reach and grasp with a robotic arm controlled by a neuroprosthetic device. The sense of touch is also being explored, with the hope that eventually paralysed individuals will not only be able to make movements, but also receive some form of haptic feedback on these movements. Last year it was revealed that a paralysed man, Nathan Copeland, could not only control a robotic arm using his thoughts, but could also “feel” when the robotic hand was touched. What does the future hold? Despite being in the early stages, this latest work is an exciting development that adds weight to the hope that, through technology, paralysed individuals will be able to carry out a wide range of previously impossible movements and actions, thus allowing them far greater independence. “It’s going to help a lot more people, for years to come,” said Kochevar."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"media/2017/mar/30/dozens-of-alleged-hacking-victims-join-action-against-sun-publisher","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2017-03-30T15:05:14Z","webTitle":"Dozens of alleged hacking victims join action against Sun publisher","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/mar/30/dozens-of-alleged-hacking-victims-join-action-against-sun-publisher","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2017/mar/30/dozens-of-alleged-hacking-victims-join-action-against-sun-publisher","fields":{"headline":"Dozens of alleged hacking victims join action against Sun publisher","bodyText":"Actor David Tennant and former racing driver Eddie Irvine are among dozens of alleged victims of phone hacking joining legal action against Sun publisher News UK. Nearly 20 people including former footballer Jonathan Woodgate and entertainer Les Dennis were already suing News Group Newspapers over allegations they were hacked by journalists at the now closed News of the World and the Sun, but the new claims bring the total number of people suing to around 50. Further claims are likely to be added before a deadline on Friday, with up to 70 cases in total expected to be part of the litigation. A trial is scheduled for October. The expansion of the case comes at a sensitive time for Rupert Murdoch, the owner of News Group’s ultimate parent company News Corp, who is awaiting a decision by regulator Ofcom over whether to approve a bid by his film and TV business, 21st Century Fox, to take full control of UK broadcaster Sky. The regulator is considering both the deal’s impact on competition, and whether Murdoch and his family are “fit and proper” people to hold a UK broadcasting licence. Fox is run by Murdoch’s son James, who was also chair of News International, the company which owned News Group, when the phone hacking story broke. Although there was no suggestion Murdoch knew of hacking when it took place, an Ofcom report in 2012 was scathing about his stewardship of the company. Law firm Collyer Bristow is representing nine of the new claimants, also including actor Sophia Myles and designer Jess Morris. The lead legal firm for the claimants are Hamlins. Collyer Bristow partner Steven Heffer said his clients had been forced to bring the claims after News Group closed its compensation scheme for victims of phone hacking in 2013. The scheme paid compensation to more than 250 people. Heffer said: “News Group withdrew its compensation scheme in 2013, giving no proper explanation for this move and has failed to compensate victims despite all attempts by lawyers to settle cases out of court.” “My clients have been left with no alternative but to issue claims in the high court, and a number of other firms have done so this week. News Group has refused to provide disclosure of its wrongdoing forcing victims into court.” Previous phone hacking cases against News Group have focused on the News of the World, but lawyers acting for claimants in the ongoing action have successfully argued that any trial should also consider whether phone hacking took place at the Sun. They have also asked the court to order News Group owner News UK, which replaced News International, to hand over emails from the accounts of executives including James Murdoch and Rebekah Brooks, the former chief executive of News International who now runs News UK, which they say could prove allegations there was an attempt to cover up the scale of phone hacking. News UK declined to comment."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/mar/30/narcissist-drama-queen-pop-psychology-quizzes","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-03-30T13:40:57Z","webTitle":"I can tell a narcissist from a drama queen.

I learned it in a quiz","bodyText":"It was 15C spring weather in New York this week and my timeline was full of pictures of daffodils and checklists on how to spot and deal with a narcissist. I feel as if we go through this every few years: a condition, vaguely defined, emerges as the focus of a million quizzes and pop psych columns that encourage us to diagnose those who displease us. For ages it was being “on the spectrum”. It didn’t matter what that “spectrum” was – and in its popular usage, it had nothing to do with the medical definitions of autism – but everyone who had ever annoyed us was on it. You could identify them by their use of nonsequiturs or some aspect of their body language, or by their unwillingess to share, and you could deal with them by terminating your friendship. After that, I think, there was the era of borderline personality disorder, and then a surge in the perennially popular and interchangeable conditions of sociopathy and psychopathy. These days, it is narcissism. Ten Ways To Tell If You’re Involved With a Narcissist is a pleasant way to kill a few minutes, before moving on to Is Your Best Friend an Emotional Vampire? – to which the answer is probably yes. The criteria in these quizzes tend, for obvious reasons, to be broad enough to cover every behavioural trait from standard issue bastardry to trapped gas, and if you try hard enough you can apply them to anyone. It is not hard to understand their appeal. When you fall out with someone, how satisfying to “diagnose” them not only as bad but as pathologically malignant. The advice, too, is gratifying. Short of termination, you are always encouraged to “reset your boundaries”, for which read: don’t feel guilty about diverting calls or not responding to text messages for three days or simply sulking and refusing to talk. After all, you don’t want to enable – you learned that this morning when you took the quiz Are You an Enabler? Of course, in this era of selfies and social media updates, narcissism may genuinely be on the rise, or else it has always run rampant and only recently found universal expression. Just this week I identified two narcissists and a drama queen, one of whom I had never even met, but whose posts on Facebook ticked every box. Luckily, I knew what to do. Not block her, obviously, but – as per How To Deal With the Drainers In Your Life – stand back with my arms folded, silently judging, then take a quiz to confirm I am right. Lose the Groupon gags I tried to use a rideshare app this week, and the service was temporarily unavailable due to a technical hitch their end. The break-in-service announcement appeared in a text bubble on my phone: “Sorry we can’t help! Our servers have probably popped out for a macchiato!” I don’t mind a bit of tone. But the relentless effort to inject personality into the conveyance of neutral information is exhausting, a never-ending thumbs-up-for-the-camera that has the opposite to its intended effect: gig economy capitalism posing as jaunty, anti-corporate joie de vivre. I blame Groupon, the ads for which always used to labour under the delusion that people might be willing to sign up for a six-week trapeze course because they found a joke in the trail to their liking. Now, every passing announcement comes dressed in an outsize clown costume written by a depressed intern or a suicidal copy-writer with nothing to go on. Macchiato madness If the rideshare’s server had, in fact, popped out for a macchiato, it would have faced a dizzying array of options. At my local Starbucks, the list of milk possibilities includes coconut milk, almond milk, soy milk, regular milk, skimmed milk, and half and half – insistence on at least two of which can be cross-referenced with definitions of narcissism. Meanwhile, if you’re sugar-free you have to drink your coffee black, and if you’re still paleo you shouldn’t even be in here."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"football/2017/apr/04/jessica-fishlock-louis-van-gaal-was-awe-inspiring-but-also-a-little-crazy-wales-100-caps","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-04-04T10:00:48Z","webTitle":"Jessica Fishlock: ‘Louis van Gaal was awe-inspiring but also a little crazy’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/apr/04/jessica-fishlock-louis-van-gaal-was-awe-inspiring-but-also-a-little-crazy-wales-100-caps","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/apr/04/jessica-fishlock-louis-van-gaal-was-awe-inspiring-but-also-a-little-crazy-wales-100-caps","fields":{"headline":"Jessica Fishlock: ‘Louis van Gaal was awe-inspiring but also a little crazy’","bodyText":"“I’m incredibly proud but it’s not something I think about too often,” Jessica Fishlock says as she looks ahead to becoming the first Wales international to win 100 caps, a milestone the midfielder will achieve when the women’s side face Northern Ireland in a friendly in Ystrad Mynach on Wednesday evening. She is refusing to get carried away but then comes a refreshing moment of honesty. Asked how the Football Association of Wales is planning to mark the occasion, Fishlock replies: “I have no idea what the FAW will do but I hope they do something.” And so they should. Reaching a century of international appearances is a standout achievement for any player and in Fishlock’s case is testament to her longevity, talent and desire to test herself constantly at home and abroad. She undeniably deserves recognition, having already represented her country more than any other person, male or female. More caps than Neville Southall (92), Gary Speed (85) and Craig Bellamy (78) and 33 more than the current darling of Welsh football, Gareth Bale (66). “When I play for Wales I concentrate purely on doing the best I can for the team and that’ll be the same on Wednesday. It’ll just be another game,” says the 30-year-old. “But yes, I do recognise reaching 100 caps is an unbelievable achievement, as is being Wales most capped player. To be ahead of some of the greats we’ve had is humbling.” The friendly on Wednesday, the first of two Wales are playing against Northern Ireland in preparation for the upcoming World Cup qualifying campaign (the second is on Friday, also at the Centre for Sporting Excellence in Ystrad Mynach), will be a particularly special occasion for Fishlock given she thought her international career had come to an end two years ago when she was dropped by the Wales manager, Jayne Ludlow. Fishlock was the team’s captain and most influential player but suddenly, with 82 caps to her name, found herself in the wilderness. “That was the low point of my career,” says Fishlock. “At the time I didn’t understand why it had happened and I definitely wasn’t ready to be dropped. It broke me completely. “At the end of day Jayne has done a phenomenal job for Wales and, when she came in, she felt she needed to make changes to the group. Her way of doing that was dropping me. That was her right and I grew to respect that decision.” Getting a recall soon after was a “special moment” for Fishlock and she has not looked back since, with a history-making moment now on the horizon. It is one that will also represent the high-point of a 15-year career that began at Cardiff City Ladies and via spells in Bristol, Scotland, the Netherlands, Germany, Australia and the United States has made Fishlock one of the most travelled and successful players in women’s football history. Among her achievements are back‑to‑back National Women’s Soccer League shields with her current club, Seattle Reign, in 2014 and 2015, a Champions League medal while on loan at FFC Frankfurt from Seattle in 2015, two Eredivisie titles with her first overseas club, AZ Alkmaar, in 2009 and 2010, and, most recently, back-to-back W-League titles with Melbourne City. The second of those was secured in February and made Fishlock, having again travelled to Australia during the NWSL off-season, the first player-coach to win the W-League in the competition’s nine-year history. “I’ve travelled a lot and that was initially the case because when I started playing there was nothing for women’s football back home. I joined Cardiff, my local team, at the age of seven and made my debut at 15, during the days before professionalism and the WSL [Women’s Super League]. As a female player you still had to pay to play for a club and overall the standard was not great, something I found even after I moved to Bristol Academy [in 2011]. It got to the stage where I knew that, if I was going to achieve what I wanted to achieve from football, I had to go abroad.” Fishlock got her chance to do so somewhat by chance. Having impressed for Wales in a match against Holland, she received an email from one of the Dutch assistant coaches, Ed Engelkes, asking if she would like to play in the new, fully professional Eredivisie Women league for Alkmaar, who Engelkes managed. “I didn’t think twice about it. I immediately gave up my job [working for 02], packed my bags and headed to Holland,” says Fishlock. “It was the best decision I’ve ever made. Going to Alkmaar undoubtedly improved me as a player. When I arrived there, I was all hustle and bustle, someone who always wanted to get forward from midfield with no real thought process behind what I was doing. But that is not how they played in Holland; it was, and is, far more possession-based. So I had to strip back my game and start again and over time I grew to love the ball and being someone who dictates the tempo of a match.” Fishlock’s passing accuracy and range significantly improved during her two years in Holland, something aided by a figure who in recent years became well known to her fellow Manchester United supporters. “Louis van Gaal took a couple of our training sessions,” she says. “He was head coach of the men’s team at the time and was very pro the women’s game. “Both sessions he put on started with a basic passing routine but they lasted for ages because he was obsessed with them being perfect. He’d shout: ‘Stop, back to the beginning,’ if someone did something that was not 100% right. I’ve never seen attention to detail like it. It was awe-inspiring but also a little crazy, which tallies with the stories you hear about how he drilled the players at United. “I spoke to him a few times and he was really nice. His knowledge of football is insanely good.” Fishlock’s love of the game developed from being part of a “football-mad family” and playing in the park directly outside their home in Cardiff with her two older brothers, Gareth and James. “They were half-decent and playing with boys made me tougher,” Fishlock remembers before going on to reflect on the changes she has seen in women’s football since making her debut for Cardiff as a teenager and going on to become the club’s record goalscorer. “The biggest change has probably been investment. It’s not been everywhere but in most countries where women’s football is played there are at least one or two teams who have benefited from major funding. That’s good but the downside is that it creates a big gap between rich and poor. I’d love to see investment spread through every league in every country so they’re all as competitive as they can be. “Another pleasing development has been the medical side. As recently as a few years ago, if a girl got injured, she would be treated on the NHS. Now most clubs have full-time medical staff who can treat their players quickly and to a high level, which is crucial.” Another crucial development has been visibility. By Fishlock’s own admission, there were no role models for her to aspire to when she was young. Now, however, and thanks to the steady rise in the profile and prominence of the women’s game, there are such figures, with Fishlock among the leading lights. “I’ve had girls come up to me and say I’m their inspiration,” she says. “To have a positive impact on the next generation of female footballers is amazing.” And Fishlock will get to inspire further on Wednesday having returned to Wales from Seattle, where she has lived since 2013 and describes as home. But the girl from Cardiff who grew up with posters of Eric Cantona and Paul Scholes on her wall remains very much Welsh. Dedicated to playing for her country ever since making her debut in 2006 and via ups and downs – the later including not so far being able to help Wales qualify for a major tournament – reaching a landmark which will take some beating. “My family will be at the game on Wednesday, which is important as they are my support system – without them I wouldn’t have achieved anything. Once the whistle goes, I’ll want to do them and my country proud.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"politics/2017/mar/30/hollande-tells-may-agree-brexit-terms-first-then-well-talk-trade","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-03-30T14:38:18Z","webTitle":"Hollande to May: agree Brexit terms first, then we'll talk trade","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/mar/30/hollande-tells-may-agree-brexit-terms-first-then-well-talk-trade","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/mar/30/hollande-tells-may-agree-brexit-terms-first-then-well-talk-trade","fields":{"headline":"Hollande to May: agree Brexit terms first, then we'll talk trade","bodyText":"François Hollande has told Theresa May the EU is not prepared to discuss Britain’s future relationship with the bloc until the conditions of its exit have been agreed. The French president used a phone conversation with the prime minister on Thursday to echo remarks by the European council president, Donald Tusk, and German chancellor, Angela Merkel, that trade and divorce talks could not be held in parallel. Meanwhile, May published articles in five European newspapers that linked security cooperation with the Brexit talks, reiterating the controversial position taken in her article 50 letter on Wednesday. According to a statement released by the Elysée Palace, Hollande told May: “First we must begin discussions on the modalities of the withdrawal, especially on the rights of citizens and the obligations arising from the commitments that the United Kingdom has made. “On the basis of progress made, we could then open discussions on the framework of the future relations between the United Kingdom and the European Union,” he said, calling for clear and constructive talks that respected the rules and interests of the EU. Merkel said on Wednesday that the negotiations “must first clarify how we will disentangle our interlinked relationship … and only when this question is dealt with can we – hopefully soon after – begin talking about our future relationship”. Downing Street said the government saw Merkel and Hollande’s stance as a negotiating tactic. “It’s the beginning of the negotiation. We expected robust positions to be taken at the start and let’s see where we get to,” a spokesman said. “We believe the negotiation should take place in parallel. Our position is clear. And it does make clear in article 50 that the future arrangements for the country leaving should be part of the framework for the article 50 process.” No 10 said May had spoken by phone on Thursday to the leaders of France, Poland, Italy and Spain, as well as the president of the European parliament, Antonio Tajani. Articles written by the prime minister were published in several European newspapers on Thursday morning, including the Irish Times, Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung in Germany, and le Parisien in France. In near-identical pieces, she said security cooperation remained vital, but indicated it would be part of the new discussions. “In an increasingly unstable world, that collaboration is more, not less, important for us all,” she wrote in the Irish Times. “I want the UK’s new relationship with the EU to ensure that – whether it comes to exchanging the information our security services need, or working together to protect Europe’s borders – we have the closest possible relationship.” In her six-page letter triggering article 50, which was formally presented to Tusk by the UK’s ambassador to the EU, Sir Tim Barrow, on Wednesday, May said she believed it was “necessary to agree the terms of our future partnership alongside those of our withdrawal from the European Union”. But the EU institutions and 27 remaining member states have long said the details of the divorce settlement, such as the rights of EU citizens in the UK and Britons on the continent and the size of Britain’s exit bill, must be agreed before substantive talks on a future relationship can begin. Downing Street said the government did not know how long it would take for the negotiating stances to be decided. “Our position is we are ready to start negotiating,” the spokesman said. He reiterated that May was aiming for a comprehensive deal, with trade and security as part of a whole package. “We are looking to negotiate as a whole. We want a comprehensive deal of all aspects of our relationship with the EU.” He added that feedback from May’s European counterparts about her article 50 letter was that the “tone of the letter was appreciated and considered to be constructive”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"money/2017/mar/30/vw-emissions-fix-left-our-car-undriveable-plus-new-1-coin-launches","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2017-03-30T13:17:45Z","webTitle":"VW emissions ‘fix’ left our car undriveable, plus new £1 coin launches","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2017/mar/30/vw-emissions-fix-left-our-car-undriveable-plus-new-1-coin-launches","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2017/mar/30/vw-emissions-fix-left-our-car-undriveable-plus-new-1-coin-launches","fields":{"headline":"VW emissions ‘fix’ left our car undriveable, plus new £1 coin launches","bodyText":"Hello and welcome to this week’s Money Talks – a roundup of the week’s biggest stories and some things you may have missed.

Since returning from an ankle ligament injury in January, Coutinho has recaptured his early-season form only sporadically and scored once in 13 outings for his club. However, his goal and performance for Brazil against Paraguay in midweek, when he helped his country to qualify for the World Cup in Russia before flying back to Merseyside on a private jet with Roberto Firmino, suggest his sharpness and confidence is returning. Everton’s psychological state at Anfield Eighteen years have passed since Everton last celebrated victory on the other side of Stanley Park. In that time Liverpool have endured varying stages of crisis, had key players sent off in the derby, finished the season below their rivals and been genuinely mediocre – and yet at no point have Everton looked likely winners at Anfield. In truth, they have rarely shown up since Kevin Campbell’s goal secured their last win, in 1999. Everton have won only one of the past 20 league derbies and their record plus their performances at Liverpool suggests a mental barrier as much as a quality issue. How Jürgen Klopp strikes the right balance in midfield With Jordan Henderson struggling to recover from the foot injury that has sidelined the Liverpool captain for more than a month, the absence of Adam Lallana is an untimely setback for Klopp. That is putting it mildly. Lallana had been in excellent form before suffering a thigh problem with England, the second injury he has sustained on international duty this season. Klopp has lost two thirds of his favoured midfield and must find a solution that can both handle the intensity of a derby while continuing to supply his three-man attack. Restoring James Milner to his preferred role with Alberto Moreno at left-back offers solidity whereas dropping Philippe Coutinho into midfield, with Divock Origi or Daniel Sturridge in attack, would help creatively. A delicate balancing act. Romelu Lukaku’s pursuit of the Golden Boot The Belgium striker recently surpassed Duncan Ferguson’s Premier League goals tally for Everton and became the club’s first player since Gary Lineker in 1985-86 to score more than 20 league goals in a season. He has raced to 21 goals and top of the Premier League goalscoring charts thanks to eight goals in four home matches, against Bournemouth, Sunderland, West Bromwich Albion and Hull City. But what Ronald Koeman requires – and Lukaku needs to show given his aspirations of playing in the Champions League – is a similar impact away to a top-four contender in what may be his final Merseyside derby. The appointment of Anthony Taylor The odds are above average on a referee influencing the outcome of a Merseyside derby. It is the fixture that has produced the most red cards in the Premier League era – 21 dismissals in 49 matches – and for good measure this match on Saturday will be officiated by the most card-happy referee in the Premier League this season. The Cheshire-born official has shown 132 yellow and four red cards in 32 top-flight matches this term but, in fairness, he handled the intensity of Manchester United’s visit to Anfield in October expertly after his appointment was unfairly questioned by José Mourinho."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"books/2017/apr/02/the-day-that-went-missing-richard-beard-review-memoir-brother-drown-tregardock-beach-cornwall","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2017-04-02T05:00:45Z","webTitle":"The Day That Went Missing review – oddly moving","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/apr/02/the-day-that-went-missing-richard-beard-review-memoir-brother-drown-tregardock-beach-cornwall","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2017/apr/02/the-day-that-went-missing-richard-beard-review-memoir-brother-drown-tregardock-beach-cornwall","fields":{"headline":"The Day That Went Missing review – oddly moving","bodyText":"When I was a child, we often visited Tregardock Beach, in north Cornwall. My siblings and I called it “the scary beach”, on account of the precipitous walk down, the unusually brown sand, and the huge rocks that reared up from either sand or water, depending on the rapidly shifting tides. In August 1978, when Richard Beard was 11, he discovered just how dangerous Tregardock can be. Towards the end of the day, as his family were packing up, he and his nine-year-old brother, Nicholas, crept to an area shielded from the main beach by rocks, and entered the water for “one last swim”. In the opening pages of The Day That Went Missing, Beard recalls what happened next: “I don’t know how, but suddenly he was out of his depth. I think I tried to push him back in, but the logistics are confused and I, too, am up to my neck. With my feet touching the sand my mouth is barely above the water. The instinct, because I’m not a good swimmer, is to walk back in towards the shore but when I feel with my toes the sand sucks out from beneath me.” Beard realised that he couldn’t help Nicholas, that he had just one shot at saving himself. And so he did the unavoidable thing: “I decided to leave him.” By the time he made it back to his family, it was too late. In the wake of the tragedy, a very English stoicism kicked in. Having returned home to Swindon for the funeral (which Beard and his two other brothers didn’t attend), the family repacked their bags, minus one set of clothes, and drove back to Cornwall. The rental still had a week to run, and guests had been invited – so why not resume the holiday? And why, for that matter, not return to Tregardock? None of this was deliberately gratuitous: it was a question, for Beard’s parents, of trying to maintain a semblance of normality, of “carrying on”. For a certain type of family at the time, such behaviour probably wasn’t abnormal. Over the ensuing years and decades, however, this stiff-upper-lipped attitude hardened into something else: a conspiracy of silence, almost a project of erasure. Nearly 40 years on, Beard – now a well-regarded writer, known for his archly experimental fictions – realises how shamefully little he knows about his brother. Among family members, Nicholas’s name is rarely mentioned; Beard avoids visiting his grave, doesn’t even know the date on which he died. “This, surely, is the definition of ceasing to exist… I have unhitched him from time, from his precise span of existence.” And so, belatedly, Beard resolves to find out all that he can about Nicholas, and to “conduct an inquest” into his death. The main body of The Day That Went Missing consists of this research: Beard rummages around in his mother’s attic (where he unearths old school reports and photos), visits the prep school they both attended (where a cricket scorebox erected as a memorial to Nicholas has been repurposed as a groundsman’s shed), and interviews everyone connected to the tragedy. He also pays several visits to Tregardock, where he spends a lot of time studying sun positions and tides, in the hope of working out the precise time at which he and Nicholas embarked on their fateful swim. Perhaps inevitably, there’s a quality of hopelessness to these efforts. You can find out all there is to know about a dead person, but that won’t alter the dreadful irreversibility of their absence. It’s clear that no amount of ferreting around in the past is going to make up for the central tragedy of Beard’s life, which is that he wasn’t allowed to mourn his brother properly at the time. Yet it is precisely this too-late quality that makes The Day That Went Missing so oddly moving. This is a grief memoir with little actual grief in it: its true subject is denial. And ingeniously (though perhaps not surprisingly, given the tricksy bent of Beard’s fiction), the book’s form raises the question of whether, even now, that denial is being confronted or reinforced. By conducting an “inquest” into Nicholas’s death, is Beard emotionally reconnecting with his brother, or merely stage-managing his emotions? One oddity, for me, is that Beard doesn’t say more about his present-day life. Near the start, he alludes to “troubles” he has been having, and he links these to the unexamined trauma of his brother’s death: “The older I get, the harder it is to pretend that denial works as a strategy for sustaining inner peace.” But that’s about it, so far as personal information goes. It’s his right, of course, to be discreet, and he may have sound reasons for being so. Yet I can’t help feeling that a little more candour would have made the links between past and present even more explicit – and potentially turned an interesting book into a truly excellent one. • The Day That Went Missing by Richard Beard (Harvill Secker £14.99) is one of the Guardian Bookshop’s Ones to watch this April.

Dacre was the only media figure to receive hospitality from the new prime minister in the first six months she was in post. The dinner in October underlines the closeness of the Daily Mail to the prime minister, who hired the newspaper’s political editor, James Slack, to be her spokesman last year. The Daily Mail has long been a supporter of May and published a full page editorial and front page trail backing her leadership bid last July. She also received hospitality from the Daily Mail Group at a dinner with Geordie Greig, editor of the Mail on Sunday, and the group’s proprietor, Viscount Rothermere, in September. The prime minister did not host anyone at Chequers. In the last quarter of the year, May received hospitality from three media organisations at awards ceremonies – the Sun, Spectator and Trinity Mirror group. She had meetings with a number of other newspaper editors, including John Witherow, of the Times, and Chris Evans, of the Daily Telegraph, but Dacre was the only one to get the honour of a dinner in Downing Street between July and December last year. May also recorded a meeting with the former prime minister Tony Blair in November to discuss his former role as Middle East peace envoy. The prime minister was given a raft of gifts held by the department, but purchased two pieces that she wished to keep in line with the ministerial code: a £225 piece of clothing from Lady Jubie Wigan and a £344 piece of jewellery from Nadja Swarovski."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2017/mar/30/people-are-thirsty-for-something-new-the-shows-shaking-up-scandi-noir-at-last","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2017-03-30T14:56:02Z","webTitle":"'People are thirsty for something new': the shows shaking up Scandi-noir at last","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/mar/30/people-are-thirsty-for-something-new-the-shows-shaking-up-scandi-noir-at-last","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2017/mar/30/people-are-thirsty-for-something-new-the-shows-shaking-up-scandi-noir-at-last","fields":{"headline":"'People are thirsty for something new': the shows shaking up Scandi-noir at last","bodyText":"A fog cloaks Oslo, so thick and impenetrable that every pedestrian becomes a looming shadowy spectre as they pace the icy pavements. They’re not actually doing anything suspicious – shopping, going to work, cautiously jogging – but thanks to endless exposure to the TV phenomenon that is Scandinavian noir, it’s hard not to think that everyone is a tortured detective or hiding a grisly secret. Yet while Danish and Swedish dramas have had their grip over British audiences for several years now, Norway’s contribution to the Nordic noir obsession has been somewhat muted up till now. As Nicolai Cleve Broch, one of Norway’s most successful actors, says: “Norway has always been like the kid brother in the relationship between Denmark and Sweden. We always looked up to what they do – but it takes us a few years.” This year, four Norwegian-made dramas will make their way to British TV screens. Acquitted, Eyewitness and Valkyrien were all picked up by Channel 4’s Walter Presents and dabble in not just murder but intrigue, survivalists and confused sexuality. In another export coming later, Young and Promising, the noir element is dropped entirely in a female-driven exploration of the frustrations of being young and reckless in Norway today, with characters closer to Girls’ Hannah Horvath than The Killing’s Sarah Lund. Like The Killing, The Bridge, Borgen and Modus, these shows are all driven by complex characters grappling with inner turmoil. Yet they are not filled with the serial killers and bodies in the snow that have become such familiar Scandi tropes, and Walter Iuzzolino, who selects shows for Walter Presents, believes these Norwegian series mark a sea change for Scandinavian television. Cleve Broch, who stars in Acquitted, the first of the Norwegian dramas which landed on Channel 4 in January, says that until recently, most quality crime drama on Norwegian TV had either been from their Swedish and Danish neighbours or from the UK. However, increased investment from big broadcasters NRK – their BBC equivalent – and TV2 has meant that new production companies are springing up in Oslo, driving up the quality and ensuring that Norwegian programmes are now picking up international Emmys. Valkyrien, which starts in June, is another export that is not so easily categorised. Rather than occupying the insular hygge world of many Scandinavian dramas, it focuses on a doctor who performs experimental medicine in an underground bunker but also grapples with the global phenomenon of “prepping” people, often on the fringes of society, who actively prepare for a catastrophic disaster and often live entirely off-grid. “As a script it was unlike anything I’d ever read before,” says Pal Sverre Hagen, who plays the lead role of Leif, an outsider who spends most of his life in tunnels under Oslo. “Norway is a small country so I see a lot of the scripts and this was something completely original.” He based his character on a childhood friend who for 15 years has lived in a community of people ostracised from mainstream society, whether they are refugees or those with mental health issues. Filming Valkyrien took him and the cast into the shadowy tunnels and sewers beneath Oslo, as well as on to the online forums where preppers around the world share their fears. “When we shot this series there was such a feeling of change coming to the world,” he says. “The immigration crisis was just beginning and we are still seeing change happening which makes the world feel more unstable, makes our society feel more fragile than ever before. “This uncertainty has also led to fear being expressed in different ways, whether that’s people voting to shut down borders on a national level or preparing for catastrophe by stockpiling in their own homes. I don’t think we should all adopt this mentality but I do think it’s wise to reflect on our current vulnerability. I think the preppers may end up having tricks to teach us all.” Also coming soon is Eyewitness, another show that breaks from the standard Scandi crime thriller format. It starts not with a single murder, but with two teenage boys who find themselves entangled in an embrace, much to their own confusion and shame, and subsequently witness a gang killing spree. It also touches on the struggles of being a foster child, and Anneke von der Lippe became the first Norwegian to win an Emmy for her performance as detective Helen Sikkeland, who has to adjust to becoming a foster parent. “The last 15 years I have been writing crime but I started out writing contemporary social drama,” says the Eyewitness director and writer Jarl Emsell Larsen over coffee in an Oslo cafe, where the scent of cinnamon hangs heavy. “This series is not just about finding out who the killer is. It’s also a complicated love story, it looks at what it means to belong if you’ve lost your parents and also explores how difficult it is, at the age of 50, to try and learn how to be a good mother to a foster son.” In terms of engaging with the social and economic issues of the country, Young and Promising, which arrives on Channel 4 in the summer, has also covered new ground for Norwegian TV. Taking its cue directly from Lena Dunham’s Girls, the show, penned by and starring Siri Seljeseth, is highly autobiographical, drawing on her own experiences of what it feels like to be floundering in your 20s. Focusing on three women, it challenges everything from everyday sexism, consent, sexual harassment and the weight of expectation from an older generation who, particularly in Norway – a country where most people securely worked in oil-related business for decades – often look at a career in the arts as indulgent and irresponsible. “I just thought there wasn’t really a show about being in your 20s here, and finding out that life might not be what you expected,” says Seljeseth. Thanks to national testing introduced across all schools in Norway, she says there is now an “extreme pressure on young people to be exceptional” that had led them to be branded “generation perfection”. “I wanted to show people it’s actually ok to fail,” she adds. “In Norway the pressure not to fail is a huge problem and means people have breakdowns and develop eating disorders because they don’t have straight As.” The show was expected to draw in a small, primarily female audience in Norway, but has instead become a hit and is now on its third season. It’s been a cathartic success for Seljeseth, who was repeatedly told that hers was a series written “by women for women”, an idea she always disputed. “There’s been a real shortage of portrayal of women here as something other than a high achiever, someone’s girlfriend or even just a dead body in the woods,” she says. “People were so thirsty to see something new.” Acquitted is on Walter Presents on All4 now; Eyewitness is on Walter Presents from 31 March; Valkyrien starts on Channel 4 in June; Young and Promising starts on Channel 4 in August. • This article was amended on 4 April 2017.

If you were desperate to watch that US TV show, you could try the dodgy VHS guy down the market (ahem). So for a long time, I just heard about US comedian Dave Chappelle’s legendary show. When I finally got to watch, on a grainy DVD copy, I laughed so hard I cried. Dave Chappelle, 43, moved to New York as a teen and was soon on stage at the world famous Apollo theatre. By 19, he was cast as Ahchoo in the spoof Robin Hood: Men In Tights. The 90s were good to him (more film and TV work, and his first standup special) but it was the 2000s that cemented his legacy: he co-created Chappelle’s Show in 2003, influencing a new generation of TV comedians in the process. The sketches and characters are iconic now (professional hater Silky Johnson and Chappelle as Prince are my favourites) and still relevant. His standup style is warmly sly and anecdotal: he’s your best friend but, like, 2,000 times funnier. I will never not laugh at his bit on chicken and racism, or applaud his incredibly nuanced “how old is 15, really?” bit on how black kids are perceived. When he walked away from his show (and a $50m deal) because of the pressures of fame, it was a sensation. But he (almost) never looked back. Until now. Truthfully, his return to standup (via two Netflix specials) is not his best work (whether as a consequence of fame or the passage of time, he’s alarmingly tone deaf on some current issues). My love is tinged with disappointment now, but we’ll always have those DVDs."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"stage/2017/mar/31/henning-wehn-westphalia-is-not-an-option-leicester-square-theatre-brexit-review","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2017-03-31T08:50:12Z","webTitle":"Henning Wehn review – Brit-baiting banter from Germany's comedy ambassador","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/mar/31/henning-wehn-westphalia-is-not-an-option-leicester-square-theatre-brexit-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2017/mar/31/henning-wehn-westphalia-is-not-an-option-leicester-square-theatre-brexit-review","fields":{"headline":"Henning Wehn review – Brit-baiting banter from Germany's comedy ambassador","bodyText":"In the age of Brexit, is self-styled German comedy ambassador Henning Wehn an immigrant, a Londoner, or both? “I woke up on 24 June thinking, ‘Cor, blimey!’,” he says, setting the sly tone for a show – Westphalia Is Not an Option – that is determined to disrupt simplistic definitions of what an immigrant is and isn’t. Wehn never considered himself one, he says, partly (cue supercilious smirk) because the word immigration implies a step up in the world. There are plenty of trademark mocking gags about Britain’s inferiority to his home country, including an old Wehn favourite about our non-German tendency to self-deprecation, and another marvelling at British buildings’ external plumbing. But this touring show sets its sights higher than the comedy of national stereotypes, as Wehn asks: what makes a good or bad immigrant? Is there a pecking order? From the Vietnamese cabbie gone native to the Saudi princelings bulk-buying London penthouses, what does the incomer owe to Britain? And what does naturalised Britishness look like? Wehn offers his own guide, leading us from darts matches, via the “high-stakes pub quiz” that is the UK citizenship test, to the semiotics of the St George’s flag. It’s a playful, upbeat set that whizzes by, even if, by Wehn’s own admission, it yields few consequential insights. Having undermined the idea that he, and the Royal Family, might be immigrants, Wehn doesn’t dig deeper, leaving wider assumptions about immigration and citizenship intact. But we can’t say we weren’t warned: “I’m worried,” he confesses, with disarming candour, that “my opinions might be guided by what works as a joke”. Most of them do work as jokes, particular those that toy with bien pensant pieties. A standout routine, drawing on a newspaper’s Odd One Out quiz about England footballers, ribs Britain’s well-meaning silence around race. “Noticing skin colour is not a problem!” Wehn insists. It’s in this teasing of liberal propriety, rather than in investigating immigration per se, that Wehn’s heart – and talent – lies. At Leicester Square theatre, London, until 8 April.

On Full Frontal with Samantha Bee, the comic noted that last week many had anticipated the “long national nightmare of somewhat affordable health coverage would finally be over”, only for Republican plans to fall apart. While Trump will now be turning to other issues – “back issues of Maxim magazine” – Democrats celebrated their “kinda” victory. “They won the same way the cops kinda won that car chase at the end of Thelma and Louise,” she suggested. Bee mocked Trump’s insistence that further phases of the bill would have proven its value over Obamacare. “I believe that’s known as the ‘I’m a grower not a shower’ defence,” she quipped. The comic also noted reports of Trump’s now-infamous request to conservative Republicans to “forget about the little shit” and consider the bigger picture when deciding on healthcare reform. “Which they assumed was Trump’s nickname for Sean Spicer,” Bee joked. On the Late Show, Stephen Colbert also reflected on Republican failure to agree on a reform bill. “Moderates wanted to keep popular stuff like maternity coverage, while the far right wanted to give women in labour a bite stick and a bottle of whiskey,” he explained. Colbert then questioned the lack of public support for a recent vote in Congress to allow internet service providers to sell information about their customers’ web browsing history. “No one in America stood up at a town hall and said: ‘Sir, I demand you let somebody else make money off my shameful desires,” he argued. The only thing less popular than elected representatives taking the side of cable companies would be a bill “allowing traffic jams to call you during dinner and give you gonorrhea”, the comic added. Colbert also noted Trump’s attendance at a women’s empowerment forum, suggesting it was “the first women’s event he’s attended since sneaking into the dressing room at the Miss USA pageant”. On Late Night with Seth Meyers, the host joined in the ridicule of Trump’s suggestion that, despite recent failures, reaching a new deal on healthcare would be easy. “OK, make sure your healthcare plan covers amnesia,” he scoffed. The comic also gave a mention to Brexit, noting that the leader of the European council, Donald Tusk, said he would not pretend to be happy about it. “Which makes sense, as that’s more of a British thing,” Meyers joked. On The Tonight Show, Jimmy Fallon mentioned Hillary Clinton’s speech in San Francisco where she encouraged her supporters to “resist, insist, persist and enlist” following her election defeat. “She then pointed to herself and said: still pissed,” Fallon joked. Following comments by Trump’s son-in-law and adviser Jared Kushner that the government should be run like a company whose customers are the citizens, Fallon imagined the response of the public might be: “In that case, we have a president we’d like to exchange.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"artanddesign/2017/apr/02/syria-photographs-sergey-ponomarev-imperial-war-museum","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2017-04-02T14:00:03Z","webTitle":"Skeleton cities and snipers: the shocking photographs that show the scale of Syria's loss","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/apr/02/syria-photographs-sergey-ponomarev-imperial-war-museum","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2017/apr/02/syria-photographs-sergey-ponomarev-imperial-war-museum","fields":{"headline":"Skeleton cities and snipers: the shocking photographs that show the scale of Syria's loss","bodyText":"In the middle of 2014, after the Syrian government had retaken the city of Homs from rebel fighters, Sergey Ponomarev stood with his camera and surveyed the damage. The photojournalist found a family who had returned to their old flat and captured the scene: in a street buried in rubble and lined with destroyed buildings, they load whatever possessions they can salvage into a taxi. Their son wears a brightly coloured party hat he has found. It is at once mundane – the family calmly going about their business – and devastating. In another photograph, four boys play amid the rubble. They have been burning the plastic from electrical cables they’ve found in shelled buildings – to get to the copper wire, which they can sell. Another shows a recently built shopping centre. Never opened, it is now crumbling and skeletal, a giant portrait of Syria’s president Bashar al-Assad adorning the front. “The rebels didn’t have a lot of arms or fighters,” says Ponomarev. “But they had snipers and RPGs [rocket-propelled grenades]. If they saw a tank, a sniper would hit a small hole in the tank’s armour and an RPG man would try to hit the same spot so the RPG would go deeper into the tank and explode. The tanks suspected that, in every window, every hole in the wall, there were snipers. So the tactic of the Syrian army was to shell every suspected window.” Ponomarev’s photographs, from his series Assad’s Syria, are about to go on show at the Imperial War Museum in London. His series The Exodus – which documents the resulting refugee crisis and features photographs that won Ponomarev, along with New York Times colleagues, the 2016 Pulitzer prize – will also be on display. We’re in the museum’s cafe, surrounded by the machinery of war. Ponomarev tells me what he looks for when taking a photograph: “Everything should come into the right place at the right time – the light, the people, the event or action. Everything should be well balanced, so the frame will be perfectly shaped. That’s the skill you develop over years.” Ponomarev’s other talent is to capture vast, complex situations – the war in Syria, the Arab spring – and set them on a relatable, human scale. In Damascus, near the rebel-held zone, a shell hit a car. “It exploded and set other cars on fire,” he says. “Instead of rushing about and shooting the burning cars, I decided to capture a pedestrian.” The photograph, taken from behind, shows a man holding on to his bicycle, calmly standing and watching. “It’s obvious he’s a resident who just stumbled on the scene.” Ponomarev went to Damascus in 2013. Before you can even check into your hotel, he says, “you have to go to the information ministry and they assign you a translator – a minder who will escort you”. The minder would report back to the government. “I’d see him reporting on what we did,” says the photographer with a smile. “I was doing my stories, he was doing his.” There was, at one point, a frustrating period when he was trying to find out if there had been a chemical attack in the suburbs. But most of the time, he says, there wasn’t a huge amount of conflict between what he wanted to see and what his minder, or rather the government, allowed. “I wasn’t intending to meet with any diehard supporters of the opposition. My photography is slightly different. I’m showing the life of normal people, whether they are inside this government-controlled bubble or outside.” One of the most striking things about reporting from the parts of Syria controlled by the regime, he says, was witnessing how people went along with government propaganda. “You see that they have their own ‘truths’, none relevant to real things that are happening.” But much of the western media’s reports were from the rebels’ side, he adds, so that wasn’t balanced either. “I got this possibility to get inside, to see that it’s a normal society, to explain why they support the government.” The photographer asked to visit Assad’s prisons. At one, according to a recent Amnesty report, thousands of detainees were tortured, starved and executed in mass hangings. His request was granted, but Ponomarev’s visit was tightly controlled. “They showed us several detainees. One was a Russian-speaking Syrian who was trying to bring in money for fighters. There were four others who also spoke Russian, but pretended they didn’t. They were, the state said, producing explosives and car bombs. We were requesting to meet with some Chechen detainees but [prison officials] said they were not ready yet. I guess they were probably beaten and their bruises were still visible, so they cannot present them to journalists.” Ponomarev, who is 36, started taking photographs as a teenager and studied photojournalism at Moscow State University. He worked for Russian papers, and was a staff photographer for Associated Press for eight years, before going freelance in 2012. A year later, he was largely working for the New York Times. Although he doesn’t think of himself as a war photographer, Ponomarev has seen plenty of crises and conflicts. At Associated Press, he covered the Beslan school siege in 2004, the Lebanon war in 2006, and the fall of Tripoli in 2011. He has also shot stories in Ukraine and, last year, was in Mosul when Iraqi forces launched an offensive against Isis. Then there was the month he spent in Gaza: “You’re constantly hearing the metal buzz of drones flying around, like metal mosquitoes. If you don’t hear the sound of the drone, that means it’s cleared the airspace for a jet. So a jet will come and bomb something. That was scary – you don’t know which house it will bomb.” He has a therapist. “That’s the best way, to talk to a professional who will try to get all your bad feelings and fears out, rather than talking to your friends. Your friends will say, ‘This dude just constantly talks about war – it’s not that fun.’” He smiles. Having been to all these places, does Ponomarev think photography can change the world? “No,” he says. “We are now so overwhelmed with visual information, it’s always around us.” However, he does think his pictures might “disturb people from living in their normal, cosy lives and probably encourage them to take action”. This could be making a donation or volunteering. But it’s not like the late 1960s and early 70s, he says, when photographs of the Vietnam war had the power to really shock – in particular, Eddie Adams’s picture of a Vietcong prisoner being executed or Nick Ut’s photograph of a nine-year-old girl running from a napalm attack. “Those images could stop war, but not any more.” These days, he says, we’re used to distressing images, and find it easier to turn away. “Some people are feeling like they don’t want to be disturbed – and some editors now put warning signs before images. Imagine if the ‘napalm girl’ had been shown with a warning saying, ‘You will see war crimes and nudity.’ It’s not that shocking. You click or you don’t click. It won’t provoke you to take action. “In a way, the value of our work has been a little bit lowered.” He pauses then adds: “But still we are able to produce strong and iconic images. We have to do that.” Sergey Ponomarev: A Lens on Syria is at the Imperial War Museum, London, 27 April to 3 September."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/mar/30/cameron-legacy-millennials-brexit","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-03-30T10:42:49Z","webTitle":"Cameron’s legacy is secure – he’s the man who sold millennials down the river | Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/mar/30/cameron-legacy-millennials-brexit","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/mar/30/cameron-legacy-millennials-brexit","fields":{"headline":"Cameron’s legacy is safe: he’s the man who sold millennials down the river","bodyText":"Oh, Dave, you were doing so well at pretending you didn’t exist. As Britain set about the political catastrophe of beginning its EU exit process, Cameron had almost got away with the tactic of keeping his pink, smug head down, as indeed he has been doing since he resigned in the aftermath of the referendum. At the time, Britons scoffed at the arrogance of a man who could take a risk on fundamental constitutional change with far-reaching consequences for millions of people, on the basis of settling the internal divisions in his own party – and who then, having lost, could casually wash his hands of the whole disaster. Such complacency, many of us thought, was entirely in line with the man’s whole shtick – an egotistical public schoolboy encased in shiny PR guff, a man incapable of contemplating the possibility that he might ever be wrong, gambling the fortunes of an entire country before coolly walking away from the ensuing fiasco literally humming. Spameron’s Teflon arrogance is largely the reason that he is now back, defending his decision to call the EU referendum. “I was right to hold the referendum because the issue had been poisoning British politics for years,” he said on Wednesday (for “British politics” read “a Conservative party over which I feared losing control, and which was in the process of haemorrhaging votes to Ukip”). Men such as Cameron cannot bear their legacies unfolding in ways that do not correspond to their own ideas of themselves. Blair is the same. Both will go down in history for their botching of one issue alone: the former Brexit, the latter Iraq. And they hate this so much that they feel compelled to pop up at regular intervals to insist they were right when it is just the moment when they should be piping down. Everyone remembers that kid at school who would spend most of the class monopolising the teacher’s attention only to ask one last protracted question just as the bell is ringing, which is naturally met by a collective groan because, guess what: it’s time to move on. We have other lessons to be learned, new hate figures to focus on (May, Farage, Fox, Davis, Johnson, even the tedious Hammond), other peas to shoot. Just go, Dave. Of course, he will not be forgotten. I have spent more than half my adult life disliking David Cameron, and I’m not about to waste the energy and commitment that that has entailed; and neither, I suspect, are many of the rest of my generation. After all, it is our futures and our children’s futures that he gambled with, and the majority of us had no desire to leave the European Union. Forgive my indelicacy, but unless our scientists somehow miraculously discover how to halt the ageing process, despite a lack of EU funding or co-operation with their fleeing European colleagues, within 10 years, many of those who voted for Brexit will either be dead or in care homes that millennials will be subsidising, probably in a deregulated, privatised environment in thrall to US corporate interests and hostile to workers’ rights. That’s if care homes even exist. So Cameron has no need to worry. He will never fade entirely into obscurity. Just as Thatcher cast a long shadow over my parents’ generation, so he will be remembered as the guy who sold younger people down the river in order to scratch a political itch. You only get to live your 20s and 30s once – and he has royally ballsed ours up. Sure, a politician actually keeping a manifesto promise is always novel, but his reasons for doing so were entirely craven. And if he must insist on a fuller legacy than Brexit, we will be happy to provide him with one. There are the austerity measures that created a stagnant economy, destroyed public services, impoverished millions and partly created the mess we are in today by motivating disempowered people who were suffering to give the establishment a kicking. There’s the bedroom tax, and the tormenting and demonisation of disabled people. Tuition fees, an NHS and social care system at breaking point, a housing crisis of epic proportions, a rise in homelessness. Libya wasn’t great either. Not to mention that our kids might grow up not knowing what a library is, women who are being beaten by their partners now having precious few places to turn for refuge, over 1 million Britons having to feed themselves from food banks, and socks and newspapers being used by girls who are missing school because they can’t afford proper sanitary towels. Could this be the man who truly hated Britain? And isn’t it time that he shut up?"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"business/2017/mar/30/jp-morgan-dublin-office-building-1000-jobs-city-london","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-03-30T18:48:06Z","webTitle":"Leading City firms begin to lay groundwork for London jobs exodus","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/mar/30/jp-morgan-dublin-office-building-1000-jobs-city-london","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2017/mar/30/jp-morgan-dublin-office-building-1000-jobs-city-london","fields":{"headline":"Leading City firms begin to lay groundwork for London jobs exodus","bodyText":"A growing number of leading City firms have revealed they are now laying the groundwork for an exodus of thousands of jobs from London after Britain’s vote to leave to EU. Just a day after Theresa May formally triggered the process for Brexit it was confirmed that the insurers Lloyd’s of London and Royal London are setting up subsidiaries outside the UK, while the investment banks JP Morgan and Citigroup are actively exploring the relocation of key operations. Luxembourg also threw its hat into the ring in the battle to attract the European Banking Authority, which employs 159 people at Canary Wharf in London. Frankfurt and Paris also want to host the organisation. JP Morgan is in talks to buy an office building in Dublin big enough to hold more than 1,000 workers, increasing speculation that it will move a substantial number of jobs from London as a result of Brexit. Citigroup said it was planning for a hard Brexit that would require “relocating certain client-facing roles to the EU from the UK”. A number of banks and insurers have already confirmed they could move staff. Goldman Sachs is to move hundreds of bankers to Frankfurt and Paris, while HSBC could switch 1,000 investment banking jobs from London to Paris. A key concern for financial firms is whether the UK will still hold passporting rights that allow British-based banks and insurers to do business in the rest of the EU. Lloyd’s, the world’s biggest insurance market, confirmed that it will set up a subsidiary in Brussels to allow it to continue underwriting insurance policies across the EU. The new subsidiary will have about 60 staff. Lloyd’s employs 700 people in London out of global workforce of 1,000. Inga Beale, chief executive of Lloyd’s, said: “I am excited about the opportunities this venture will offer the market by providing that important European access efficiently. “It is now crucial that the UK government and the European Union proceed to negotiate an agreement that allows business to continue to flow under the best possible conditions once the UK formally leaves the EU. “I believe it is important, not just for the City but also for Europe, that we reach a mutually beneficial agreement.” The Lloyd’s chairman, John Nelson, told the Financial Times he now expected other insurers to follow the market to the Belgian capital. Royal London, the insurance and pensions group, said it would be converting its existing Irish operation into a regulated subsidiary to ensure it could press ahead with work in Europe amid the uncertainty surrounding Brexit. The US investment banks JP Morgan and Citigroup sent memos to their staff confirming that they were exploring options regarding the location of their operations. JP Morgan is in talks to acquire a site in Dublin’s Capital Dock from the developer Kennedy Wilson and the National Asset Management Agency, which was created by the Irish government after the financial crisis to buy property loans from banks. Jamie Dimon, chief executive of JP Morgan, said before the EU referendum last June that the bank could be forced to move as many as 4,000 jobs from the UK if the country voted to leave. JP Morgan employs about 16,000 people in the UK, with its main offices in Canary Wharf, Bournemouth and Glasgow. Citi employs almost 9,000 people in Britain. It is understood that JP Morgan has not yet made a decision about if or where it will move staff from London, but the Dublin office would be an option. In an internal memo sent to JP Morgan staff on Wednesday, Mary Erdoes, head of asset and wealth management, and Daniel Pinto, head of the firm’s corporate and investment bank, said: “Our size, scale and existing footprint across the continent mean that we have choices in terms of locations and legal entity structure. “We may need to make adjustments to our legal structure, but we will maintain our strong commitment to our clients in the UK and the EU. “We have spent the last several months reviewing the many variables in this process – client needs, employee considerations, regulatory requirements, operational risks, our inventory of licences, political issues in the region and dozens of other factors. This is a complex process and we will not rush into any decisions.” Citi confirmed to staff that London would remain its headquarters for Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) and an “important global hub”. However, James Cowles, Citi’s chief executive for EMEA, said the bank was planning on the basis of a “hard Brexit” that would result in the UK losing its passporting rights. Cowles said: “A hard Brexit would require certain changes, including relocating certain client-facing roles to the EU from the UK, and the possible creation of a new broker-dealer entity within the EU. “Citi has been discussing our options with representatives from a number of different countries, as well as with our clients.” The Liberal Democrats warned that JP Morgan’s potential Dublin deal and the new Brussels office for Lloyd’s were a sign that jobs could be lost in the City of London due to Brexit. Susan Kramer, the Lib Dem Treasury spokeswoman, said: “It is the prime minister’s choice to drive Britain out of the single market, and that is driving jobs and wealth creation out of the UK. Estimates suggest leaving the single market could cost Britain up to £200bn over 15 years. “When the P45s start to land and the NHS operations are cancelled, this will be the government’s fault.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2017/mar/31/clit-rock-we-dont-get-together-every-few-months-and-cry-for-five-hours","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2017-03-31T11:03:34Z","webTitle":"Clit Rock: 'We don’t get together every few months and cry for five hours'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/mar/31/clit-rock-we-dont-get-together-every-few-months-and-cry-for-five-hours","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2017/mar/31/clit-rock-we-dont-get-together-every-few-months-and-cry-for-five-hours","fields":{"headline":"Clit Rock: 'We don’t get together every few months and cry for five hours'","bodyText":"Six years ago, musician Dana Jade learned about female genital mutilation (FGM) and became adamant that she could do something to help. Clit Rock was born. Now working with international anti-FGM campaigner Leyla Hussein, the duo are putting on the 10th event to raise money for a safehouse for girls in Kenya at risk of FGM. Why did you start Clit Rock? I saw something, probably a documentary or something in the news about FGM (female genital mutilation) and I was publicly screaming about how angry it made me. I said maybe someone should do a music event or something to raise awareness and they could call it Clit Rock. That was the end of 2011. You’re raising money for Kepsteno Rotwo (Abandon the Knife), a charity co-founded by Domtila Chesang. What made you decide to support her? Here we are at 2017, with the 10th event and we’ve raised money for Daughters of Eve, Integrate Bristol, Agnes Pareyio, and now Domtila (Chesang, co-founder of Abandon the Knife). Leyla let me know that’s she’s trying to build a safehouse for girls and I thought yes, sounds great. The night is known for billing women or women led bands. Who’s playing? The opening act is an acoustic singer called Rose Red and the Butterflies. Then we have Art Trip &amp; Static Sound which is punk, a very formidable DIY punk led by Melodie Holliday (manager and mother of two members of Skinny Girl Diet). I love that we’re getting diversity in ages among all the other diversities that happen organically at this night. The headliners are an all girl rock band called The NYX and then we have DJs until 3am, so pace yourself. Women in rock bands get most of the credit for leading the fight for equality. Are there musicians from other genres that sound like protest to you? Can you have a night about women and not play a lot of Queen Bey? She’s come out really firmly on our side and strongly as a feminist and I just think she’s priceless and I’m so happy to be alive in this era of Beyoncé. You’ve got to go from ***Flawless into M.I.A. and other types of political music but also you sometimes just want to dance so there might be some fluff in there. There’s definitely some Spice Girls. FGM is a sensitive topic. How does it go down at club night? Let me take this moment to assure you that we don’t get together every few months and cry for five hours. Yes, it’s about raising awareness of very serious issues but it’s also a celebration of how far we’ve come as women, as feminists and on this road to equality. So many activists show up at this night and oh my god they need it. They really let their hair down and have a good time because you have to balance your life with some joy and celebration in the long marathon of a fight. I hope it’s a renewal and something to rejuvenate the warrior spirit to keep going towards revolution. Clit Rock is on Friday 30th March at Zigfrid von Underbelly of Hoxton, London. You can buy tickets here: All profits will go to Kepsteno Rotwo.

If you go in July for the Guelaguetza festival, the whole city explodes. People from the surrounding villages come in their traditional costumes and perform dances at the Cerro del Fortín, a huge amphitheatre on a hill overlooking the city. Guelaguetza means “offering” and refers to the tradition – still alive and strong in rural communities – where if there is an event, everyone contributes, so they have these amazing parties. Oaxacans are very creative. The area is famous for textiles. The boutique Los Baules de Juana Cata works directly with local artisans and sells beautiful huipiles (embroidered tunics). They can cost up to $1,000 but they take six months to make. There are more crafts on display at the Museo Textil de Oaxaca. I also love the Centro Cultural San Pablo (san-pablo.mx), a beautiful conversion of a 16th-century convent that preserves indigenous traditions. One of Mexico’s most famous artists, Francisco Toledo, is a Oaxacan, who has lent his support to several cultural projects. He designed a stained-glass panel for the San Pablo centre. Oaxaca’s famed creativity extends to the food scene. The state has the most diverse and the rarest varieties of corn in the entire country and a lot of restaurants focus on traditional recipes. At Itanoní, everything is made from corn. It does amazing tortillas rolled with a whole hoja santa leaf and filled with salsa and bean purée. I love La Teca, too, which is in the chef’s own home. She specialises in local dishes – the mole is delicious. If you really want to eat like a local you have to try insects. Grasshoppers, agave worms and ants are all popular and sold everywhere, from street stalls to expensive restaurants. Chapulines (grasshoppers) have a very distinctive flavour. I love the small ones in guacamole; and the grasshopper quesadillas at La Popular restaurant are really tasty. Escamoles, or ants’ eggs, are a local speciality too – fried in garlic and butter. Have a tejate for breakfast and you won’t be hungry for seven hours. It’s the drink of the ancients, made from corn, cacao, cinnamon and mamey fruit and served in a bowl. You’ll find it in any of the markets. The biggest and best-known market in town is 20 de Noviembre. There’s a long row of barbecue stands where you order meat by the kilo and they grill it for you. Then women come along and sell you tortillas or guacamole to go with it. I live in Mexico City but travel to Oaxaca 12-13 times a year to visit mezcal producers. Unlike in the capital, everything in Oaxaca city is in walking distance. One of my favourite places is the Jardín Etnobotánico. All the plants are from Oaxaca and there are cactus and agave plants saved from development sites. Outside the city, the ancient Zapotec site of Mitla is a very special place that’s not well-known. It’s made up of rectangular buildings, not pyramids, and is famed for its intricate mosaics and stone carvings. Mezcal is everything tequila is not. Tequila is industrialised. Jose Cuervo can produce up to 3 million litres a month. We sometimes have problems producing 1,500 litres a month because everything is done manually. The agave is still ground by millstones operated by horses. Tequila is made from one type of agave but mezcal uses 23 varieties, so there are many different flavours. Because it’s organic and the fermentation is natural, you can drink more of it without being intoxicated. One of the best places to try it is Los Amantes, the oldest mezcalaría in Oaxaca city. The owner is a famous artist who used to run one of the best clubs in Oaxaca. Spend a few hours there and test the theory that mezcal gets you high, not drunk. • Santiago is the founder and ceo of artisan mezcal company Mezcal Amores"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"artanddesign/2017/apr/03/john-evelyn-diary-returns-scene-battle-medway-river-dutch-raid","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2017-04-03T09:30:41Z","webTitle":"'The Dutch are doing us mischief': John Evelyn's diary returns to scene of Battle of Medway","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/apr/03/john-evelyn-diary-returns-scene-battle-medway-river-dutch-raid","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2017/apr/03/john-evelyn-diary-returns-scene-battle-medway-river-dutch-raid","fields":{"headline":"'The Dutch are doing us mischief': John Evelyn's diary returns to scene of Battle of Medway","bodyText":"In June 1667, the diarist John Evelyn sat on “the hill above Gillingham” watching the greatest humiliation ever inflicted on the English navy. Many of the king’s best ships were burning, sunk or being towed away before his eyes, as the Dutch fleet sailed almost unopposed up the river Medway. “The Dutch … were fallen on our fleet at Chatham, by a most audacious enterprise, entering the very river with part of their fleet,” Evelyn wrote, “doing us not only disgrace, but incredible mischief in burning several of our best men-of-war lying at anchor and moored there, and all this through our unaccountable negligence in not setting out our fleet in due time.” The king’s flagship, the Royal Charles, was among those captured and towed away by the Dutch: for a time it became a tourist attraction in the Netherlands, before it was broken up and the lion and unicorn transom carving displayed as a trophy. Evelyn’s diary will return to the scene of the disaster this summer, on loan from the British Library to an exhibition at the Historic Dockyard Chatham, one of a string of events planned across both banks of the Medway in June to mark – “celebrate” is perhaps the wrong word – the 350th anniversary of the debacle. There will be events on and around the river, including “living history” days at Upnor Castle, where the garrison tried to fight off the invasion before the Dutch ships broke the chain barrier across the river and sailed on – and fireworks, art installations, films and exhibitions. A fleet of Dutch ships sailing up the Medway is being organised by Frits de Ruyter de Wildt, a descendant of the Dutch commander – “this time by invitation”, he said. The dockyard was spared through the loss of more ships, deliberately scuttled by the English to block the river. The poet Andrew Marvel wrote bitterly “of all our navy none should now survive, but that the ships themselves were taught to dive”. The three-day attack is politely referred to as the Battle of Medway on the English side; on the Dutch side, where the triumphant officers were rewarded with gold chains and goblets, it’s known as the trip to Chatham. Sitting on his hill, Evelyn was convinced the Dutch would reach London, and arranged “to send away my best goods, plate etc, from my house to another place. The alarm was so great that it put both country and city into fear, panic and consternation such as I hope I shall never see more: everybody was flying, none knew why or whither.” Evelyn, who had been working with prisoners and injured sailors throughout the war with the Dutch, sent news and a sketch of the scene to his fellow diarist Samuel Pepys, a naval administrator. Pepys also sent his family and his cash out of London, and wrote: “All our hearts do now ake; for the news is true that the Dutch have broke the chain and burned our ships.” The raid happened when the royal coffers were almost emptied by the twin disasters of the great plague and the Great Fire of London in 1666, but it led to the rebuilding and reorganisation of the navy. The diary, along with international loans including from the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam, will be on display at the dockyard from 8 June until September. The main festival will run from 8-17 June."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"film/2017/mar/30/paramount-disney-flops-hollywood-ben-hur-star-trek-beyond","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2017-03-30T12:13:26Z","webTitle":"Paramount looks to Disney model to recover after string of flops","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/mar/30/paramount-disney-flops-hollywood-ben-hur-star-trek-beyond","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2017/mar/30/paramount-disney-flops-hollywood-ben-hur-star-trek-beyond","fields":{"headline":"Paramount looks to Disney model to recover after string of flops","bodyText":"With Star Trek Beyond failing to hit warp speed and Zoolander 2 and Ben-Hur bonafide box office bombs, Paramount racked up one of its biggest losses last year. The $455m (£365m) loss, the worst in the 12 years Paramount Pictures had been run by Brad Grey, prompted parent Viacom to make a change at the top and pledge to bring the studio behind Titanic, Braveheart and The Godfather back to its former glory. The minnow of the “big six” Hollywood studios has turned to the former chief of Rupert Murdoch’s 20th Century Fox, Jim Gianopulos, whose releases include Fox’s biggest-ever hit Avatar and the X-Men series, to learn the lessons of its rivals and bring back the box office mojo. Just six years ago, Paramount was the most successful studio group dominating rivals with blockbusters including Transformers and Mission: Impossible, and hitting home runs with micro-budget films such as Paranormal Activity. In 2011, its film revenues were almost $6bn. Last year, they came in at just $2.66bn, cementing Paramount’s place as the minnow of the big six Hollywood studios for the fifth year running. “It’s like Disney in reverse,” said Brian Wieser, senior research analyst at Pivotal. The runaway success of Disney, which became the first studio to break $7bn at the global box office in a year in 2016, has provided something of a template for success in the studio business. Paramount’s biggest film last year was Star Trek Beyond which brought in $343m globally, lukewarm compared with the $500m its predecessor managed, and a minnow in the blockbuster stakes. By comparison, Disney’s production line rolled out a slew of $1bn-plus-grossing films across a breadth of genres including Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, Captain America: Civil War and Finding Dory. Paramount also struck out with fare including Zoolander 2 and Ben-Hur, considered to be the biggest flop of 2016, and the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles franchise is running out of steam, last year’s offering managed half what the first film earned. “The recipe for studios in recent years has been to scale back and make fewer films by defining successful franchises and bludgeoning the way to the top of the charts,” said Richard Broughton, of media research firm Ampere. “That has been the big issue at Paramount which has a mediocre set of franchises. The reduction in output of films has led to a reluctance to take risks. That has to be reversed to create a successful studio if you are stuck in a rut of making average films. That takes guts.” To be fair to Paramount, it has struggled in recent years at least in part because parent Viacom, owner of MTV and Comedy Central, has focused on returning capital to shareholders instead of investing in the film unit. Disney has spent $15bn building a multi-genre hit machine, buying Finding Nemo and Toy Story creator Pixar, Marvel Comics’ sprawling superhero universe and Lucasfilm, maker of Star Wars and Indiana Jones. Paramount, which used to distribute films for Marvel and Dreamworks, never got off the start line when they were sold. However, buying success through acquisitions is not the only way to get to build a competitive film studio. Universal, which topped the industry in 2015 taking almost $7bn at the box office, has developed a string of franchises in-house including Fast and Furious, Jurassic Park, Despicable Me and spin-off Minions. “It is about shrewd intellectual property licences too,” said Broughton. “Can Paramount, or any studio, find un-utilised IP out there. There is probably a gold mine or two that has been over-looked or yet to be discovered. Look at the more recent success of teen/young adult books converting rapidly into new titles, such as Hunger Games and Maze Runner.” Bob Bakish, who was promoted to chief executive of Viacom in December, recently outlined a Disney-esque plan to drive Paramount up the movie charts. It includes exploring spin-offs in the Transformer franchise – this year’s Transformers: The Last Knight will bring in $1bn-plus if it performs like its predecessors – as well as films based on Hasbro toys. He also wants the film operation to work more closely with the TV business: a channel is being rebranded The Paramount Network, and four feature films are being developed with Nickelodeon. The first, Amusement Park, is expected to be released next summer. Paramount has also said it will build a family film division; it hasn’t had a winner in the hugely lucrative kids’ market since it distributed 2012’s $750m-grossing Madagascar. Viacom, which explored selling a minority stake in Paramount last year only to abandon the process in a change of heart over its future value to the conglomerate, has said that the studio’s problems are “executional”, not terminal. “It’s not curing cancer,” said Bakish recently. “Whether Paramount’s lack of success and growth has been by design, ill fortune or incompetence it is hard to know from the outside,” said Wieser. “To be successful you want a bunch of tentpole films that you can rinse, repeat and cycle through again. The downside of making movies is that it still requires throwing stuff against the wall to see what sticks.” Paramount’s flops Ben-Hur The biggest flop of 2016, racking up an estimated loss of $120m. With a budget of $100m and a huge marketing budget the global box office take of just over $90m was dismal. Paramount distributed the film, it was co-produced with MGM, and has an estimated 20% stake in the movie. Zoolander 2 Derek Zoolander and friends failed to strut their stuff a second time in a sequel that was demolished by critics. A $50m budget, not including marketing, for a $56m global take meant Hansel is certainly not hot right now. Allied Featuring Brad Pitt and Marion Cotillard, and directed by Robert Zemeckis, this second world war spy adventure should have been a winner. It cost at least $85m to make, before marketing, and is estimated to have lost $75m to $90m for Paramount. It wasn’t helped by Pitt curtailing publicity because of his divorce from Angelina Jolie. Star Trek Beyond The blockbuster that wasn’t. On the face of it, the $343m global box office take for the latest instalment of the revitalised franchise doesn’t seem too bad. Except that is well down on the $500m its predecessor took, and with a production budget of $185m and marketing estimated at $120m it barely washed its face. So not a bomb, but not the banker it was expected to be. And the ‘surprise’ hit Arrival Hailed as an instant sci-fi classic, it is the runaway success of the relatively smaller budget ($47m) Arrival that harks back to Paramount’s roots. Starring Amy Adams and Jeremy Renner and directed by Denis Villeneuve, who is working on the next Blade Runner movie with Ryan Gosling and Harrison Ford, Arrival took $200m worldwide."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"football/2017/mar/30/leyton-orient-manager-danny-webb-quits","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-03-30T07:51:03Z","webTitle":"Danny Webb quits as Leyton Orient manager after only two months","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/mar/30/leyton-orient-manager-danny-webb-quits","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/mar/30/leyton-orient-manager-danny-webb-quits","fields":{"headline":"Danny Webb quits as Leyton Orient manager after only two months","bodyText":"Danny Webb has resigned as Leyton Orient manager after only two months in charge, becoming the tenth man to leave the job in less than three years under the club’s Italian owner Francesco Becchetti. News of the 33-year-old’s departure comes 10 days after a winding-up petition against the League Two club was adjourned until 12 June to give the owner more time to settle outstanding debts and possibly sell the club. Becchetti has said he would be interested in selling up but no deal has yet been secured. Webb stepped up from his youth-team coaching role in late January and given the task of keeping a thin squad in the Football League. But Orient’s young and inexperienced side have won only two matches since and Webb had talked of his frustration at the uncertainty off the pitch. Speaking after last Saturday’s 3-0 defeat at Crawley Town, their fourth loss in succession, Webb said: “I am certainly going to try and ask the chairman questions. We are all in limbo. I am out of contract at the end of the season and the frustrating thing is I am trying to think ahead and think about the future when I am not guaranteed a future.” The goalkeeping coach, Martin Brennan, has also left the club. Webb’s assistant, Omer Riza, will take over. A club statement said: “Omer Riza will take over duties of first team manager until the end of the season, and his first game in charge will be Saturday’s home League Two game against Wycombe Wanderers. He’s very determined to make sure that the team finishes the season strong and he’s looking forward for the challenge.” The Leyton Orient Fans Trust said Webb’s departure demonstrated “that there is no leadership at the football club”. The trust, which has been drawing up recovery plans and has raised more than £114,000 for a regeneration fund to cover contingencies in the event of a change of ownership, said in a statement: “Mr Becchetti – enough is enough. Go, and go now. Sell the club for a realistic price. Let someone else try to take the club forwards, rather than let it continue to slide backwards.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"artanddesign/2017/apr/13/food-cooking-washing-machine-designers-modern-cuisine","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2017-04-13T06:00:19Z","webTitle":"Your dinner's in the washing machine … the designer pioneering a cooking revolution","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/apr/13/food-cooking-washing-machine-designers-modern-cuisine","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2017/apr/13/food-cooking-washing-machine-designers-modern-cuisine","fields":{"headline":"Your dinner's in the washing machine … the designer pioneering a cooking revolution","bodyText":"A sprinkle of washing powder, a dash of fabric conditioner and a good slug of teriyaki sauce? Next time you load the washing machine, you might be adding some extra ingredients, if Israeli design student Iftach Gazit’s idea catches on. In response to our increasingly energy-conscious, time-poor existence, he has come up with a plan for boil-in-the-bag meals you can throw in with the laundry. Your dinner will come out steamed, pummelled and spun to a T. His project imagines a range of pre-packed foods, from steak with garlic and herbs to salmon in teriyaki sauce, that come in waterproof Tyvek bags complete with washing temperatures and nutritional information displayed in the style of clothing labels. “I was inspired by the craze of sous vide cooking, where food is vacuum-sealed and immersed in hot water for long periods of time,” says the 31-year-old from Tel Aviv. “But rather than cooking a piece of meat at 58C for two and a half hours, you could just set your washing machine to ‘synthetics’ for a long cycle. For vegetables, you could set it to a short hot ‘cotton’ programme.” His idea wasn’t initially prompted by the restaurant fad for sous vide, but by time spent researching the daily routines of homeless people in New York. He was struck by how important launderettes have become as 24-hour havens. As one homeless blogger put it, the launderette is “probably the most useful place on earth for the homeless, besides the library”. It is a place where “you can clean your laundry, fill your water bottles, find an electrical outlet to plug in a computer or phone, take a bird bath, take a dump ... rest for a good few hours and not get hassled”. So, Gazit thought, why not create an easy and free way of cooking there too? He tested his idea with a Tupperware container filled with pasta and green beans, which he says was “edible, but not great”. So he tried again, putting it in the drier to give it a “final finish”, but it turned into a congealed mushy ball. He describes the project as an “object for discussion” rather than a practical solution, a commentary on the postwar western dream of TV dinners and labour-saving domestic appliances – a vision that came crashing down after the sub-prime mortgage crisis, leading to the highest levels of homelessness in the US since the Great Depression. “What is the next step for the TV dinner when you don’t have a house?” he asks. As a student at Jerusalem’s Bezalel Academy of Arts and Design, which overlooks the contested West Bank, Gazit’s other provocative projects have included a “negotiation table” for the Israeli-Palestinian peace process, made of a hefty slab of concrete that crumbles on touch; and a “panopticon chandelier” of security lights and CCTV cameras. “I suppose I’m the weird bird in school,” he says, of an institution that has been traditionally focused on craft. “I think, as designers, we have a duty to take a position on these political issues.” His laundry dinners may be more social commentary than the stuff of Jamie’s 30-Minute Meals, but he is not alone in exploring the unlikely culinary potential of domestic appliances. Italian food writer Lisa Casali made waves in 2013 with her recipe book Cucinare in Lavastoviglie (“Cooking in the dishwasher”), accompanied with jovial online recipe videos. “All you need is a dishwasher and the will to experiment,” says Casali, proceeding to demonstrate how, with the help of some plastic bags, a vacuum sealer and airtight jars, you can conjure a dish of sea bass fillet in a poppy seed crust served on a yellow pepper cream, at the same time as doing the dishes. “This technique allows you to spare water and energy, thus cooking at zero cost and with no carbon footprint,” she beams – before finishing off the fish using a more conventional frying pan. One Chinese blogger, meanwhile, has done away with the needless paraphernalia of vacuum bags and jars and gone the whole hog, throwing his ingredients straight into the drum to make the perfect “washing machine potato and pork rib soup”. Simply put chopped potatoes, pork ribs and seasoning into the machine, set it to a 95C cycle and – hey presto! – you have a surefire way to destroy your washing machine and produce a disgusting broth in the process. Other enthusiasts have demonstrated how DIY power tools can be easily converted into handy kitchen appliances, transforming a cordless drill into everything from a food mixer to a high-octane pepper grinder, even showing how a scouring sponge can be attached to help with doing the dishes. Just don’t be tempted to use it for eating corn on the cob at high speed. That way lies disaster. And dentures."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"books/2017/apr/01/happy-50th-birthday-adrian-mole-sue-townsend","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2017-04-01T08:00:19Z","webTitle":"Happy 50th birthday Adrian Mole","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/apr/01/happy-50th-birthday-adrian-mole-sue-townsend","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2017/apr/01/happy-50th-birthday-adrian-mole-sue-townsend","fields":{"headline":"Happy 50th birthday Adrian Mole","bodyText":"Tempus fugit. Tomorrow, Adrian Mole is 50. We can be precise about this. In the book that introduced him to the world, The Secret Diary of Adrian Mole Aged 13 ¾, Sue Townsend’s famous diarist noted in his entry for 2 April 1981, “I am fourteen today! Got a track suit and a football from my father. (He is completely insensitive to my needs.)” When this first volume of his diaries was published in 1982 we found him nursing his unappreciated intellectual ambitions – “I saw Malcolm Muggeridge on the television last night, and I understood nearly every word” – and, above all, looking forward to growing older. His diary entry for his birthday ends with him looking in the mirror. “I think I can detect a certain maturity. (Apart from the rotten spots.)” Well, grow older he did, the spots giving way to even worse afflictions. Over the next quarter century, Townsend charted the tragic-comic vicissitudes of his life in seven further volumes of his diaries. In these he lived through the same times as the rest of us and grew older at just the same rate. The final volume of his observations and anecdotes, Adrian Mole: The Prostrate Years, appeared in 2009. It found the Pepys of modern Leicestershire approaching his 40th birthday, which duly takes place, in appalled capital letters, near the end of the book. Time moves on, but disappointment is pretty much a constant. “My presents were the usual rubbish, apart from a Smythson A4 moleskin notebook, which came in the post from Pandora.” Petrarch and Laura; Heathcliff and Cathy; Adrian and Pandora: the great literary love affairs are unconsummated, and Pandora Braithwaite remains the impossible object of Adrian’s love and desire. In this last volume, Adrian actually gets to spend the night in the same bed as her – though, of course, nothing happens except sleep. Would Adrian and Pandora have ever become lovers? In The Prostrate Years, Adrian’s wife, Daisy, has left him for a wealthy if dim-witted local toff, so our hero is once again available. At the very end of the book, as Pandora’s Audi draws up outside Adrian’s house and he walks towards her, we are free to speculate. For there would have been more. Townsend had plans for further Mole diaries and there is every indication that we would have been able to keep company with him deeper into his middle age if his creator had not died in 2014, at the age of only 68. According to her publisher, she was working on a new volume, provisionally entitled Pandora’s Box. Townsend was always going to return to Adrian Mole. His birthday was her birthday too, a clear enough clue that he was her indispensable alter ego as well as a figure of fun. Ageing has become an irresistible narrative technique in popular culture. Harry Potter was 11 for the first volume of his adventures, felt more and more the darkening powers of adolescence over succeeding volumes, and departed from his readers in the seventh volume as he was about to turn 18. Bridget Jones, suspended at thirtysomething for Helen Fielding’s original newspaper column, duly matured and ruefully passed 50 for Bridget Jones: Mad About the Boy. (She was still in her early 40s for the film Bridget Jones’s Baby.) On both page and screen she looks back with us on her more youthful follies. Even the never-young Alan Partridge has been made to feel the passing of the years as he has progressed from radio to TV to film and now to life as a literary character. In his latest blithely incompetent and conceited memoir, Nomad, he confesses himself to be “pushing sixty” (but therefore presumably older). His body is not quite what it used to be. “I’m not ashamed to admit that since 2010 my buttocks have become increasingly slack and gelatinous.” So he embarks on a long-distance walk from Norwich to Dungeness, a trip his father once failed to make for a job interview at the power station – a “sepia-tinted journey of yesteryear”. Vaunting his new-found reflectiveness, he is still as unself-knowing as ever. The French have a term – roman fleuve – for the novel sequence that takes a cast of characters through the years. There should be a matching name (le protagoniste vieillissant?) for the fictional character who grows older in real time, through succeeding volumes and different stages in an author’s own life. Such a protagonist is a special kind of companion. In the past it was common for fictional characters who reappeared in one book after another never to age. I remember noticing, aged nine or 10, that Biggles, dashing hero of my favourite tales of adventure, had flown for the RFC in the first world war (admittedly while still in his teens), been an air ace in the Battle of Britain, and then, in the 1950s and 60s, worked for Scotland Yard in their special air police division with his also still sprightly friends Algy, Ginger and Bertie. What elixir of youth had he drunk? Townsend liked to recall that William Brown, Richmal Crompton’s buoyant yet fatalistic protagonist, was her prototype for Adrian. She had devoured the tales of his exploits when a child. William featured in some 40 books over half a century. Yet though his author took account of changing times (motor cars, the second world war, television) her antihero remained forever 11 years old, an unageing monitor of adult follies and vanities. That other great protagonist of the English comic novel, Bertie Wooster, remained similarly forever young. He was a gormless, emotionally susceptible chap in his 20s when he first blundered into life in 1917 and remained no older and absolutely no wiser through many a misadventure over the next five decades. These characters live in some golden age, eternally youthful, brave and foolish. Their wise creators could never let them become sour. In contrast, Adrian Mole takes us through our own times and our own disillusionments. He lives through Thatcherism and Blairism and pronounces judgments on both with his usual self-serious sagacity. At the end he is writing letters to prime minister Gordon Brown about the complications of his tax affairs. In this respect he is just like those protagonists created by some of the great American novelists of the late 20th century. Three of the most stylish and sombre of these – John Updike’s Rabbit sequence, Philip Roth’s Zuckerman novels, and Richard Ford’s Frank Bascombe narratives – have pursued a fictional alter ego across the decades of their nation’s history. All three mark the events of their lives with reference to political events and great socio-economic movements. Bascombe is first encountered in The Sportswriter (1986), in his late 30s, and is subsequently the narrator – perhaps the hero – of three further novels. In The Sportswriter he is a would-be novelist who makes his living writing about sport. A divorce and the death of his son behind him, he seems to be becoming detached from his own life. Independence Day came nine years later and found Frank nine years older and selling real estate. The Lay of the Land (2006) took him into his mid-50s and contemplating a second failing marriage as the votes for George W Bush and Al Gore are being recounted in Florida. By the fourth volume, Let Me Be Frank with You, published in 2014, he is in his late 60s and is enduring retirement. He has aged at exactly the same rate that time has passed for his readers. His second marriage holds together, though one memorable episode is his visit to his ailing first wife in her luxury care home. The past stretches before him as it does before the novelist. The book’s very title seems to be Ford’s signal that he is helplessly attached to his ageing everyman. Yet Frank’s latest volume is really a collection of four separate novellas, as if the assurance of an overarching narrative were disappearing with age. Across all those years, Frank is always switching into the present tense, trying to catch the ordinary and the actual as it happens. As he says at the end of The Lay of the Land, “Here is necessity. Here is the extra beat – to live, to live, to live it out.” The tense is appropriate, for the hero who has outgrown a single novel no longer lives inside a narrative with a decided shape. Updike settled on a continuous present tense for his Rabbit novels. These track the life of Harry “Rabbit” Angstrom from his mid-20s in Rabbit, Run (1960) – which Adrian Mole is diligently rereading in The Prostrate Years – to his mid-50s in Rabbit at Rest (1990). The present tense in which each novel is narrated has him trapped in his time, whatever it is. Rabbit does think that he knows his times. In the third volume, Rabbit Is Rich, we hear about the middle-aged protagonist’s waning enthusiasm for sex with his wife thus: “Somewhere early in the Carter administration his interest, that had been pretty faithful, began to wobble and by now there is a real crisis of confidence”. The presidential allusion comes from the character’s consciousness, so entangled does he think his story is with that of America. By now he is in his mid-40s and chief sales rep of the Toyota dealership in his home town of Brewer, Pennsylvania and (thanks to the money inherited from his father-in-law) affluent. Updike knows how to offer the satisfaction of consistency amid change: Rabbit is still that lecherous slob with a poet’s sensibility. Ever alive to physical details, he will switch easily from thinking of sex with his son’s girlfriend to lyrical details about the sounds of rain on the different kinds of leaves outside his kitchen. And he is alive to the changed shapes of middle-aged bodies, especially his wife’s and his own – now that he is so expanded “he has become a person and a half”. All of these fictional Americans could manage laments like Adrian Mole’s: “What have I done with my life? I have lost two wives, one house and one canal-side apartment, a head of hair and my health” – though it takes Townsend to see that the disappointment is funny. Indeed, it sometimes seems that Adrian’s narrative parodies the melancholy ageing of more literary protagonists. The subtitle of Townsend’s final Mole volume, “The Prostrate Years”, is taken from the mistake that many of Adrian’s acquaintances make when he tells them of the cancer with which he has been diagnosed. “Why do so many people mispronounce ‘prostate’? I am sick of correcting them.” The prostate theme is one sure marker of a character’s progress down the vale of the years. In The Lay of the Land Frank Bascombe has prostate cancer. There is a compensation, which is that his disease brings his 25-year-old daughter, Clarissa, back to him. She tells him how well he “deals with things”. “She only believes this because I have cancer and my wife left me both in the same year and I apparently haven’t gone crazy yet.” The “perfidious” (Frank’s word) prostate exerts its power over Nathan Zuckerman too. Roth’s Exit Ghost (2007), narrated by his alter ego, begins, “I hadn’t been in New York in eleven years. Other than for surgery in Boston to remove a cancerous prostate, I’d hardly been off my rural mountain road in the Berkshires.” Roth outdoes even Mole in the surgical specifics of his treatments (“… a catheter inserted in the urethra to inject a gelatinous form of collagen where the neck of the bladder meets the urethra …”). This is the final Zuckerman novel, so our once-sensualist narrator, though gifted with every evocative word he needs, must be robbed of his inspiriting libido. Zuckerman is 71, incontinent and impotent. In the hospital where he is being treated he sees a woman he once knew, Amy Bellette, first encountered 50 years earlier in The Ghost Writer (1979). He is reading the short stories of EI Lonoff, the masterful writer he visited in that earlier novel, and the dissolution of whose marriage he witnessed. The allusion reminds us that we are at the end of a long line of Zuckerman novels that has sometimes seemed to follow the path of Roth’s own career. Zuckerman has not exactly grown old with us; he has grown old faster than us. Now he seems to rely on the reader for memories of his past sensualism. In Exit Ghost he agrees a house swap with a young married couple, Billy and Jamie, both writers. He is immediately “transfixed” by Jamie, and readers of earlier Zuckerman novels will recognise his fierce interest in his own sexual feelings. He is “subjugated as quickly as I imagined Billy to have been, though for reasons having to do with finding myself at the other edges of experience from him, at the rim that borders oblivion”. She makes him conscious of “the ghost of my desire”. British novelists have occasionally attempted in all seriousness to take a single, changing yet consistent character through changing times across succeeding volumes. AS Byatt has done it in her four novels tracing the fortunes of Frederica Potter, a schoolgirl in the 1950s at the beginning of The Virgin in the Garden (1978) and, by the fourth volume, A Whistling Woman (2002), set at the end of the 1960s, an experimental writer and TV personality. Yet it is notable that each of these novels looks back from the time of its publication to some earlier era, its interest essentially historical. A very different English – you might say, quintessentially English – example is Edward St Aubyn’s Patrick Melrose quintet. In the first volume, Some Hope, St Aubyn’s protagonist is a five-year-old child, first bullied by his frightening, sarcastic father, David – then raped by him. By the second volume, Bad News, Patrick is a drug addict in his 20s and his father is dead, though in memory and anecdote he will keep returning. Subsequent volumes take him into marriage and fatherhood. Finally, in At Last, he has a failed marriage behind him but, in middle age, the prospect of a relationship with his children unpoisoned by his own childhood. The spine of St Aubyn’s sequence is autobiographical; the times through which Patrick lives are a blur. There is none of that American sense of a character’s experiences expressing those of a nation or society. It was probably an English novelist who first developed this way of using fiction to track changing times: in his six so-called Palliser novels, beginning with Can You Forgive Her in 1865 and ending with The Duke’s Children in 1880, Anthony Trollope wove stories involving Britain’s political classes centred on the character of Plantagenet Palliser. Notably this allowed him to deal with the vicissitudes of his central character’s marriage across the years. Yet Palliser (later Duke of Omnium, no less) is often peripheral to Trollope’s socio-political interests. The sense of a protagonist who is a means to an end is even stronger in the great English roman fleuve of the mid-20th century, Anthony Powell’s A Dance to the Music of Time. Powell’s narrator, Nicholas Jenkins, is so much like a lens through which we view the unravelling follies of his acquaintances that we often hardly notice him. He loves and works and suffers in the margins of his own narrative. No one could say this about Adrian Mole, as living a character as comic fiction has known. By the last instalment of his diary, the comedy has darkened a little, naturally. The adolescent Adrian may have declared Crime and Punishment is “the most true book I have ever read”, but you get to the end of the first volume of his diaries, and just into the 15th year of his life, without any tragic events. Seven books and 25 years later there have been deaths, divorces and real disasters. But hope, as well as disappointment, springs eternal. A lesson in rueful pertinacity, his parents Pauline and George are alive and opinionated still, and – after all their separations – back together and living next door to their appalled son. When we hear the middle-aged Adrian we remember the younger Adrian. He is only so frequently disappointed because he hopes for better. On that original birthday he hoped that he was growing into a better self. “So at last I am fourteen. Had a good look at myself in the mirror tonight and think I can detect a certain maturity”. Whether 14 or 40 or later still, we surely recognise, Adrian Mole, c’est moi."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"public-leaders-network/2017/apr/29/new-computer-systems-sending-fire-engines-wrong-places-brigade","type":"article","sectionId":"public-leaders-network","sectionName":"Public Leaders Network","webPublicationDate":"2017-04-29T09:37:26Z","webTitle":"New computer systems are sending our fire engines to the wrong places","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/public-leaders-network/2017/apr/29/new-computer-systems-sending-fire-engines-wrong-places-brigade","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/public-leaders-network/2017/apr/29/new-computer-systems-sending-fire-engines-wrong-places-brigade","fields":{"headline":"New computer systems are sending our fire engines to the wrong places","bodyText":"I have worked in a fire brigade control room for two decades – and things have changed drastically for the worst in the past two years. Now, every time I take a call my heart stops. My main job is to take emergency calls and use our computer system to get fire engines out to an incident as quickly as possible. But two years ago a new computer system was brought in. We were promised it would be more efficient and help us find people’s locations more quickly. In reality, we now often resort to writing vital information down on scraps of paper because the system is inconsistent, temperamental, and crashes a lot. Our training to use the new system was haphazard and many of my colleagues – most of whom had proudly served in the fire brigade for some 30 years – have left because of the stress of using it. There was pressure to get the system online and despite our unions and staff flagging the issues, the brigade still gave the green light to go live. When I take a call, the clock starts ticking in my head – that fire might be getting larger and I haven’t been able to send any help. What if someone is trapped in their house and I can’t find the address? What if the computer crashes again while I’m taking a call? When the system crashes we write addresses and all further communications on sheets of paper, looking them up in map books and then calling stations on the telephone to send fire engines out. We use a wall board to keep track of everyone’s movements. It is chaotic and wastes time. The biggest cause of stress is the address-searching capability of the new system. The address database is not designed for our use but imported into the system. The address records are inconsistent or non-existent. They have also been out of date since the day we went live. The tension is always there: the stress is immense. I have sent engines to incidents when there are other crews nearer the fire but the computer hasn’t picked that up. I have been unable to find an address and had to send assistance to another property nearby to satisfy the computer system; then I have to let the fire crew know that the fire isn’t exactly where I am sending them. I’ve been taking a call and my computer has crashed; a colleague has had to start the call again for me. Every day we are sending extra sets of fire engines to emergencies that are already being taken care of, because the computer doesn’t recognise that a fire crew has already been dispatched. We have to recall one, two maybe even four fire engines. This has always happened to a small degree, but now it is prolific. I am sure the ambulance crews, police and other agencies we work with regularly must think that I am inadequate at my job when I interact with them. I feel deflated. I used to feel so proud of myself; that has been taken away. Callers don’t know the difficulties I am having and I would not want them to. I want them to feel secure and safe. I want them to believe in me and that I am going to help them. They are in a crisis when they call and it’s important that they have no idea of any difficulties that I may have. Deep down, though, I want the public to know how ineffective this system is and what harm it is causing. Stress eats away at you. Its damage is often invisible for many years. No one who is good at their job should feel so useless and ineffective. We will all carry on making it work through perseverance and a desire to serve those that need us, because that is what we do – but there is a toll.

The only drawback? It will cost you the thick end of $6.5m. The item in question is David Bowie’s old three-bedroom apartment in New York, in which he lived from 1992 to 2002 with his second wife, Iman. It is being sold through the real estate firm Corcoran for $6.495m. It should be said, it’s a fairly splendid setup, located in the famous Essex House apartment block on Central Park South. The living room of apartment 915 has panoramic views of the park, “and opens into a stately walnut-panelled office that also faces Central Park – the perfect place from which to close the next big deal, write the next bestselling novel or make into a third bedroom”, according to the listing. The apartment also comes with a Yamaha piano that belonged to Bowie, but which he evidently did not feel the need to remove when he left the property. Or perhaps the removers took one look at a grand piano and refused to take it down nine floors. When Bowie and Iman lived in the apartment, they reportedly had a panic room installed. That has since been converted back into a master bedroom, removing the opportunity for Bowie obsessives to recreate the cocaine-and-paranoia years from the safety of a sealed box. The couple left the apartment to move downtown, to a property in SoHo that Bowie had bought in 1999. The listing for the Essex House apartment reads: Calling all Central Park and music lovers! Make beautiful music in this elegant, Central Park-facing condominium home that includes a pristine Yamaha piano that was David Bowie’s! This tremendous home offers a gracious limestone entry foyer and generously proportioned rooms with incredible storage space. Large picture windows frame a clear and direct view of the incomparable Central Park. Look on to the perfect landscape, enjoy the serenity of the trees, flanked by the historic and commanding buildings – the view is not to be missed. The grand-scaled living room measures 28 feet wide and opens into a stately walnut-panelled office that also faces Central Park - the perfect place from which to close the next big deal, write the next bestselling novel or make into a third bedroom. The pass-through kitchen is newly renovated and features top of the line appliances. There are two master-sized bedrooms, with beautifully crafted en-suite baths made of custom marble, porcelain and limestone. The master bedroom offers a separate dressing area and extra large bath with separate deep soaking tub, rain shower and heated floors."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"uk-news/2017/mar/30/rescue-teams-search-snowdonia-for-missing-helicopter","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-03-30T12:55:54Z","webTitle":"Snowdonia helicopter crash: five people from same family killed","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/mar/30/rescue-teams-search-snowdonia-for-missing-helicopter","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2017/mar/30/rescue-teams-search-snowdonia-for-missing-helicopter","fields":{"headline":"Snowdonia helicopter crash: five people from same family killed","bodyText":"Five people from the same family have been killed in a helicopter crash in north Wales. Two of those thought to have been on board were named locally as construction businessman Kevin Burke, 57, and his wife, Ruth, from Hulcote, Milton Keynes. They were travelling with three other family members to Dublin where, it is understood, they were to attend a christening. A North Wales police spokesman confirmed the five victims, all adults, were part of the same extended family from the Milton Keynes area. The bodies were found with the wreckage of a red Twin Squirrel helicopter following a massive air and land search launched on Wednesday afternoon when the aircraft vanished after taking off from a private address in the Luton area. The couple are directors of the Staske Construction company, which is the registered owner of a Twin Squirrel. Kevin Burke, a qualified pilot, was believed to originally be from Manchester, while his wife was from Dublin. The couple have a daughter, 19, and son, 14, it was reported. A spokesman for the family told the Milton Keynes Citizen: “Six children have lost their parents in this tragedy. At this stage, the family wants to be left alone to be able to deal with their grief over this terrible loss and concentrate on looking after the children.” A mountain rescue team found the wreckage in the Rhinog mountains in what the force described as difficult and challenging terrain. Weather conditions were described as atrocious with search teams operating with visibility of less than 10 metres. Efforts to recover the bodies were proving difficult and faced being suspended overnight, due to worsening weather conditions, and formal identification of the bodies had not yet taken place. A force spokesman said: “Owing to the nature and remoteness of the terrain, the poor weather conditions and the absolute need to carry out this delicate task with sensitivity and dignity, it may take some time.” Kevin Burke, a former deputy chairman of Hulcote and Salford parish councils, was described by one source as an experienced pilot who flew to Manchester almost daily. Neighbours said the couple had moved into their house just before Christmas. Richard Mann, 78, told the Press Association, it had been a total shock hearing the news. Supt Gareth Evans said: “The aircraft, a red Twin Squirrel helicopter, had failed to arrive in Dublin from Luton yesterday [Wednesday] afternoon, instigating a full sea and then land search-and-rescue operation. “Initially, its last known position was believed ‘over sea’ in the Caernarfon Bay area, but this was then narrowed to a land-based search coordinated by North Wales police in Snowdonia involving all local and RAF mountain rescue teams.“Formal identification has not taken place so details of the passengers are not being revealed at this time. Families of those on board the aircraft are being supported by specialist police family liaison officers. The incident is being investigated by the Air Accident Investigation Branch.” Police are appealing for help from the public and asked anyone who sighted the aircraft flying over Snowdonia on Wednesday to contact the force."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2017/mar/30/article-50-letter-pain-and-puzzlement-among-european-newspapers","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-03-30T11:11:46Z","webTitle":"Article 50 letter: how press reacted on both sides of the Channel","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/mar/30/article-50-letter-pain-and-puzzlement-among-european-newspapers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/mar/30/article-50-letter-pain-and-puzzlement-among-european-newspapers","fields":{"headline":"Article 50 letter: how press reacted on both sides of the Channel","bodyText":"European newspapers greeted the formal start of Britain’s exit from the EU with a mixture of pain, puzzlement and predictions that the coming two years of negotiations could get nasty – especially if the UK resorts to “blackmail” over security cooperation. In Britain, a week after the attack on Westminster, most of the UK press saw Theresa May’s speech triggering article 50 as a direct threat to the EU over fighting terror. Le Monde in France said May’s letter triggering article 50 was not a good start: It “alternated between concessions to the EU and threats”, demanding a special future relationship but warning of a reduction in defence and security cooperation if she did not get it. “Instead of responding to the EU27’s expectations by informing them of her intentions as regards the divorce she is requesting,” the paper said, “Britain’s prime minister stressed … a new ‘deep and special partnership’, which Europe does not want to discuss until the exit bill and details are settled.” And for the UK, that partnership must cover not just economic relations but the continent’s security, Le Monde said: “What a surprise … This is barefaced blackmail: if you don’t open your single market to our products, the UK will cease police, intelligence and anti-terror cooperation.” Germany’s Die Welt said the final outcome of Brexit would not be known for years and would probably turn out to be “somewhere between apocalypse and wonderland”, but warned that the “two-year marathon” facing Britain was the country’s “toughest race since the second world war”. It identified four key stumbling blocks, which could cause “the entire process to collapse at an early stage”: money, the rights of EU and UK citizens, the role of the European court of justice – and the issue of security cooperation. NRC in the Netherlands said despite her assurances to the contrary, May would be hobbled in the coming talks by the “zealotry of the extreme Brexiteers”, Scottish opposition and a dawning realisation among voters that Brexit “also, and to a great extent, means giving up control, not taking it back”. NRC, too, said the letter contained a clear threat. But it questioned whether it had any weight: “An insecure Europe rapidly becomes a menace for the country on the other side of the Channel.” Spain’s El País waxed more lyrical, saying the “time of poetry is over, and now it is the turn of hard prose”. Sir Tim Barrow’s delivery of the article 50 letter marked the start of negotiations that took both Britain and the bloc into “uncharted territory … A colossal project for which there is no precedent.” It said Britain’s stance was relatively clear: “Basically, its priorities are to end the free movement of people between the UK and the EU, and to leave the jurisdiction of the European court of justice. May acknowledges and accepts that these two demands involve the exit from the common market.” El País was heartened by what it saw as a “softening of language” on the UK’s part, moving from “no deal is better than a bad deal” to “We must minimise as much as possible the disturbance on both sides.” The Sun summed up May’s speech as a highwayman threat: “Your money or your lives,” in reference to the security ultimatum. The “PM’s Brexit threat to EU – Trade with us and we’ll help fight terror,” it went on, trumpeting “Britain’s world-beating skills on fighting terror”. This was not a rogue reading by Britain’ biggest selling daily: its sister title the Times took the same line with a front page headline that read: “May threat to EU terror pact.” The Telegraph’s story took the same line, while its treatment offered the Tories the closest they will ever get to a souvenir edition for the Brexit letter itself. The Telegraph, once so proud of its news coverage, went for a descriptive rather than newsy headline. “A magnificent moment,” was the headline, with the entire top half of the one remaining mainstream daily broadsheet given over to the letter itself on Downing Street headed notepaper, signed by May. The standfirst talked of “Jubilation as article 50 is finally served”. In many ways, the Times offers the closest newspaper parallel to May herself. Both offered weak support for remain, remember, against the known preference of their masters; in the paper’s case Rupert Murdoch and for May, the great British people. A surface calm and sense of balance for both can never quite remove the internal struggles within. The Times and the Sun were unusual yesterday in putting a picture of May on their front pages. Only the Mirror, in relatively muted coverage, used a larger picture of her rather than the two men delivering and receiving the letter itself. May’s threat provoked the European negotiators of course, a fact that was seized on by both the Mail and the Guardian. The way both papers portrayed that reaction was completely different, unsurprisingly. While the Guardian ran “EU warns: don’t blackmail us” above a picture of a lonely-looking president of the European council, Donald Tusk, gazing at the departing back of Barrow, Britain’s EU ambassador, exiting stage left, the Mail could not resist a full-page picture of the former Ukip leader Nigel Farage in his trademark pose, gurning over a pint of ale while wearing union jack socks. “Cheers to a great British future,” was the triumphalist headline."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/askjack/2017/mar/30/cloud-avoid-pc-microsoft-windows","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2017-03-30T09:03:41Z","webTitle":"How long will I be able to avoid the cloud?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/askjack/2017/mar/30/cloud-avoid-pc-microsoft-windows","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/askjack/2017/mar/30/cloud-avoid-pc-microsoft-windows","fields":{"headline":"How long will I be able to avoid the cloud?","bodyText":"How long will I be able to continue avoiding the cloud? I mean things like Microsoft accounts (my computers all use Windows 10), Facebook, Google and so on. I like everything to be stored on my computer and I don’t need to “share” stuff with others, but I have a feeling that Microsoft and others want everyone to sign up. BJG It’s almost impossible to avoid the cloud now, because of the movement of commercial and government services to the web, the multiplication of computing devices and the rapid growth in smartphones. These different trends reinforce one another. There’s nothing new about moving services online: the first online shopping service appeared in 1984. Billions of websites, email services and applications are now cloud-based. Many of them run from giant cloud server farms such as Amazon’s AWS (Amazon Web Services), Microsoft Azure and the Google Cloud Platform. Many of the things people used to do offline are now done via cloud services. Streaming music, video and TV services are gradually replacing DVD players, standalone hi-fis and MP3 players. Some of us still prefer CDs and Blu-ray BDs for their quality and reliability, but we’d all miss BBC iPlayer, Netflix and Amazon Prime. You’re not obliged to use social networks, and there are alternatives to Google/Microsoft such as DuckDuckGo, ProtonMail and Zoho Workplace. But taken literally, “avoiding the cloud” would mean avoiding all of those as well. Speciation Computers used to be so expensive that only governments and large corporations could afford them. Since the 1970s, however, microprocessors have made computer power cheaper and cheaper. This led to a sort of Cambrian explosion of digital devices. The desktop PC, which democratised personal computing, was a multi-purpose device. People used the same PC for word processing and accounting etc, doing email, playing music and games, and much more. Today, people often have half a dozen devices for different purposes. These can include desktop and laptop PCs, smartphones and tablets, television set-top boxes, media servers and games consoles. To those we can add even more devices such as smart TV sets and digital radios, home security systems, electricity meters and thermostats, doorbells, fitness bands and interactive assistants such as Amazon’s Echo and Google Home. People who hype the Internet of Things see few limits to the expansion of the smart gadget market. The idea of a computerised toothbrush, kettle or toaster does not sound as silly as it did 20 years ago. Given that people have, or will have, a plethora of intelligent devices, they will certainly need a way to monitor and control them, receive error messages, and synchronise data between them. You’re not going to do that without the cloud. Mobility and smartphones Many people started to use handheld phones in the 1990s. It started a boom in SMS text messaging, and soon people were doing email on their phones, too – often with a RIM Blackberry. In the early 2000s, a few hardy souls even used phones to view WAP sites on the web. The market started to explode after the launch of the Apple iPhone in 2007. The smartphone changed the cell-phone into another computing device, just like a PC but with a small screen. You could use it to browse the web, and it had wifi to connect to home networks and the internet for free. Web service providers catered to the new market with mobile (and, later, “responsive”) websites, and apps. Smartphones are now cloud-integrated devices. They are monitored and updated from the cloud, and the cloud is used to install and update apps, collect photos and data for longer-term storage, and to provide streaming media, messaging and other online services. These include intelligent assistants, such as Apple’s Siri and Microsoft’s Cortana. You can still buy “feature phones”, but if you use a smartphone, you’re using the cloud. Windows 10 In the early 1990s, when sales of Microsoft Windows 3 started to take off, Microsoft had a vision of “Windows Everywhere”. Where some other firms had different operating system for different devices (IBM had at least five just for minicomputers), Microsoft intended to run everything on Windows. That meant Windows had to grow and adapt for different functions – hence things like Windows Server and Windows XP Tablet Edition. With the world going mobile, Windows had to go mobile as well. Microsoft made that leap with the touch tablet-oriented Windows 8 and Windows Phone. Today, Windows 10 runs on everything from thumbdrive PCs, smartphones and tablets to laptops and desktops, plus the Xbox One games console. Some of Windows 10’s features have come directly from the smartphone world, including notifications, sandboxed apps, the cloud-based Windows Store and Cortana. Window 10 also switched to the rapid data-driven software development that is common to mobiles and large websites like Gmail and Facebook. There will never be another “big bang” upgrade where Windows 10 is replaced by Window 11. Not everyone likes that, but Microsoft is doing what it has always done: moving with the times. It doesn’t want to be left behind, like IBM, or in the computer graveyard with so many others. Ecosystem wars A few years ago, you could think of the PC market as a battle between Windows, MacOS and Linux, even though Microsoft had 95% of it. Today, the battle is between the three major ecosystems owned by Apple, Google and Microsoft. (Amazon is becoming the fourth player.) Each ecosystem bridges different devices, applications and services, including an app store. Each requires an account linked to an email address, though both Apple and Microsoft let you use another company’s email service. Apple’s ecosystem is based on selling high-margin Apple hardware and, increasingly, digital media and services such as Apple Music. (Providing iTunes for Windows was a trade-off that was originally required to sell more iPods, and there’s also an iCloud app for Windows.) There’s not much Apple hardware to choose from, but it’s all intended to work together with iCloud. Google’s ecosystem is based on doing everything online, preferably via its Chrome web browser on PCs, tablets and smartphones. It has marketed some hardware, including smartphones, tablets and Chromebooks, and it’s trying to ramp up its cloud platform. However, it still makes almost all of its money from web-standard surveillance-based advertising. Microsoft’s ecosystem is based on selling Windows-related software and services, but unlike Google, it lets you work “on premise” with your own PCs, servers and software or online with Office 365 and OneDrive. Unlike Apple, it doesn’t care who makes the hardware you use. (Remember that Microsoft was the Mac’s biggest supporter when it was launched in 1984, and Microsoft Office first appeared on the Mac.) Today, Microsoft has dozens of apps for Apple iOS and Android smartphones and tablets, and it’s hosting Linux in its Azure cloud and in Windows 10. (See How to Install and Use the Linux Bash Shell on Windows 10) Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella’s mantra is “mobile-first, cloud-first” rather than “Windows Everywhere”, and that’s where he’s steering the company. In sum, you can’t avoid the cloud completely, unless you give up your internet connection and swap your smartphone for a dumb one. Of course, you will have difficulty updating Windows 10, and might consider switching to Linux, which doesn’t have a consumer-oriented ecosystem. If you plan to stay online and use a smartphone, then best accept that Windows 10 benefits from cloud integration and exploit the cross-platform apps and online services. There are far worse things to worry about, including what Al Gore called the web’s “stalker economy”, British and American government snooping, and the huge cybercrime industry.

The 15-year-old Aboriginal boy, who died at Don Dale in 2000, was serving a 28-day period of mandatory detention after stealing stationery worth less than $100. Barrister John Lawrence SC, who acted for the boy’s family during a 2001 coronial inquest into the death, told the commission the teenager had taken his own life after being locked down in a room on his own. The boy had been moved to a “cell placement” to calm down and officers were supposed to check on him every half hour. A subsequent coroner’s inquest in 2000 produced recommendations that all staff receive regularly updated formal training in recognising risk factors and behaviours in young people, and in recognising signs of mental illness. Michael Yaxley, the former assistant general manager of the Don Dale centre, told the commission the first recommendation was followed through and continued on “as a very strong focus” in at-risk procedures. He said such procedures during his time were followed “stringently” and there had been no further deaths in custody. However, the second recommendation he “considered as not being as strong”.“The department of health would have had a lot of input into that, I believe,” he said. There were “some” applied intervention programs attended by staff, and mental health first aid, “but if you want me to make comment on an overall conception of mental health procedures and introduction to Don Dale centre, then there wasn’t a formalised, continuous growing program for that,” he said. During his tenure there was some reliance on private practitioners, including using psychologists contracted to the adult jail. There were “limited” after hours mental health services, Yaxley said. The commission has also previously heard evidence about the inadequacy of training among staff. Yaxley said the minimal response and restraint training officers undertook prior to 2010 was appropriate at the time because the level of aggression among detainees at the time was limited. “As time progressed and we got into the latter parts of 2010 the restraints for [the training program] at times were not to a point that allowed for effective restraint of larger boys, more aggressive boys, and that created more assaults on staff.” Yaxley also gave evidence of programs which he had managed to get up and running in the centre and which he resulted in great improvements. He said the upfront cost of appropriate programs was likely to lead to massive savings in the future, but many were defunded. Previous witnesses have spoken of tensions in the centre exacerbated by a lack of activities and programs for detainees. Yaxley identified the Past Present Future program, which ran for about a year until the end of 2014 under grant funding, and a bridge program taught by an elderly woman. He said there was a need for permanently funded Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander cultural programs. An artist program ran for many years, and included a fence painting initiative working alongside the North Australian Aboriginal Justice Agency which saw about a dozen youth, all from different areas of the NT, decorate a panel representing their area “from the desert to the sea”. “They were totally impressed. It was just an amazing experience,” said Yaxley. He also said he identified a “huge gap” in care – available through Naaja for pre and post detention – for children on remand. “There needs to be something. That percentage [of children on remand] has just been too high forever.” The commission continues in Darwin.

Then we'll begin the evolutionary 'fairytale' of coral","bodyText":"Science and storytelling don’t seem like obvious bedfellows but recently there’s been a serious vein of science communication research that suggests a strong narrative can help with dissemination, understanding by nonexperts and number one for most publishing scientists, citations. Of course, sciencing the art of storytelling, with narrativity indices and reader appeal charts does sound typically soul-suckingly dry, but it is at the heart of the science communication movement and many of the Lost Worlds Revisited blogs are retellings of decades of palaeontological research into narratives with a beginning, middle and end. Tentative justification preamble out of the way, here’s a classic fairytale retold as the ‘story’ of hexacorallian evolution*. Oh it was also National Tell A Fairy Tale Day last month, which I am sure we all celebrated. Now, I hope you are sitting comfortably. The Three Little Corals Once upon a time, possibly in the Precambrian there was an ancestral hexacorallian mother who had three little orders** of corals and not enough food to feed them. So when they evolved into distinct orders, she sent them out into the world to seek their fortunes. The first little order of corals, order Tabulata, appearing in the early Ordovician was very lazy. He lacked distinctive characteristics which created taxonomic problems for palaeontologists and didn’t want to work at all and he built his corallites from feeble septa without axial structure. The second little order, order Rugosa, who appeared later in the Ordovician worked a little bit harder but he was somewhat lazy too and he built his corallites out of serial septa with some axial structure. Then, they sang and danced and diversified together the rest of the day. The third little order, the Scleractinia, which appeared sometime during the Palaeozoic worked hard all day and built his skeleton with lightweight but rigidly supporting cyclic septa. It was a sturdy bauplan complete with a wide diversity of forms and aragonitic skeletons. In the Late Devonian, dynamic global climate systems happened to pass by the lane where the three little coral orders lived; and he saw the weakly developed septa of tabulate corals, and he smelled the coral inside. He thought the corals would make a mighty fine meal and his mouth began to water. So he knocked on the door and said: “Little coral! Little coral! Let me in! Let me in!” But the little coral saw the dynamic global climate systems through the keyhole, so he answered back: “No! No! No! Not by the mural pores on my modular corallites!” Then the dynamic global climate systems showed his teeth and said: “Then I’ll huff and I’ll puff and through a complex series of climate changes including glaciation caused by the greening of the land, a possible bollide collision and magmatism activity, I’ll blow your house down.” So he huffed and he puffed and he blew the house down! Dynamic global climate systems opened his jaws very wide and bit down as hard as he could, but tabulate corals escaped and ran away to hide with the rugose corals. Dynamic global climate systems continued down the lane and at the end of the Permian he passed by the rugose coralllites with serial septa and with the tabulate feeble septa of the tabulate corals; and he smelled the corals inside, and his mouth began to water as he thought about the fine dinner they would make. So he knocked on the door and said: “Little corals! Little corals! Let me in! Let me in!” But the little pigs saw the dynamic global climate systems through the keyhole, so they answered back: “No! No! No! Not by the dividing walls of my massive coralla!” Answered the rugose corals. So the dynamic global climate systems showed his teeth and said: “Then I’ll huff and I’ll puff and I’ll cause the most severe mass extinction event that has ever been known, causing the extinction of several major groups of terrestrial and marine organisms and at the same time I’ll blow your house down.” So he huffed and he puffed and he blew the house down! Dynamic global climate systems destroyed over 90% of all marine organisms including trilobites, eurypterids, acanthodian fish and blastoid echinoderms. Rugose and tabulate corals also went extinct. Dynamic global climate systems then merrily skipped down the lane arriving at the robust scleractinian corals at the end of the Cretaceous. The scleractinian corals were very frightened, they knew the dynamic global climate systems wanted to eat them. And that was very, very true. Dynamic global climate systems hadn’t eaten all day and he had worked up a large appetite causing mass extinctions and the like and now he could smell the last of the corals inside and he knew that the coral would make a lovely meal. So the wolf knocked on the door and said: “Little coral! Little coral! Let me in! Let me in!” But the scleractinian saw the dynamic global climate systems through the keyhole, so they answered back: “No! No! No! Not by the symbiotic dinoflagellates in our cells!” So the dynamic global climate systems showed his teeth and said: “Then I’ll huff and I’ll puff and I’ll bring down an asteroid or two as well as mess around with the Deccan traps and cause eustatic changes which will also, I hope, blow your house down.” So he huffed and he puffed. He puffed and he huffed. And he huffed, huffed, and he puffed, puffed; he destroyed the non-avian dinosaurs, the pterosaurs, the ammonoids and belemnoids, the polyglyphanodontians, the mosasaurs and plesiosaurs and although he destroyed roughly 60% of the scleractinian corals he just could not blow the house down. At last, he was so out of breath that he couldn’t huff and he couldn’t puff or breathe anymore so he had a bit of a lay down. The damaged scleractinian corals emerged, repaired their house and went on to diverge into the stony corals we know and love today and they lived happily ever after. Well until anthropogenic impacts started to cause widespread bleaching events but that’s a story for another time. THE END *Yes, yes I know that perhaps storytelling in science wasn’t supposed to be taken quite so literally but its corals we’re talking about here they need all the narrative index help they can get. ** She had other children who also got into escapades but those are stories for another time.

So it’s little surprise that some girls are missing school because they can’t afford the right equipment. Imagine the mess, anxiety and shame they could be facing. And that’s on top of all the other unpleasantness. This being on the women’s pages of the website, you’re probably already familiar with it: unpredictable bleeding – sometimes seeping, sometimes in worrying great blurts – the aches, smells and poking about, extracting, grovelling for lost threads, dealing with a part of your body that you may not be too keen on. But perhaps the people in charge of public happiness, health and hygiene don’t know all this. Maybe they think that periods are a breeze. I have only had one tiny bad experience of having no access to sanitary products. There I was – 14, at home with asthma, mum in hospital nearly dead from a brain haemorrhage, dad at work, a childminder looking after me – and, late one night, I got my first period. The minder initially refused to give me a sanitary towel as she needed the few she had for herself. And those were the days of scratchy, nonabsorbent toilet paper. Eventually, she gave me one. Horrid, but not a microscopic patch on what those schoolgirls, plus refugees, homeless or incarcerated women and millions in the developing world have to deal with. You’d think we’d be managing by now to supply women here in the UK with such necessities, but we’re even lagging behind the US. New York City gives away tampons, while poor women here are using old socks and newspapers. But we’re still rather coy about it. Even in newspaper features about periods, blood has been referred to as “fluid”. Blood is fine in horror films, but somehow becomes taboo when it’s pouring from vaginas. But pour it does, and we need to mop it up efficiently, and keep ourselves clean.

Bruno Le Roux was summoned to explain himself to the prime minister, Bernard Cazeneuve, on Tuesday after admitting he paid his children €55,000 (£48,000) of public money over seven years to work as his parliamentary assistants. The financial prosecutor’s office announced it had opened a preliminary inquiry into the affair on Tuesday afternoon. The scandal broke a month from the first round of the presidential election and weeks after it was revealed that Fillon, the candidate for the rightwing Les Républicains, paid his British-born wife and children up to €900,000 over more than a decade to work for him. French parliamentarians are allowed to employ relatives, if the jobs are real and work is actually done. Fillon has denied wrongdoing but admitted he “made mistakes”. He has been officially put under investigation over allegations that his wife, Penelope’s, role was fictitious. Le Roux, a leading member of French president François Hollande’s Socialist party, is accused of giving his daughters, now aged 20 and 23, 24 short-term contracts, known as CDD (Contrat de travail à durée déterminée) between 2009 and 2016 while he sat in the Assemblée Nationale. The details were revealed on TMC’s Quotidien programme on Monday night. Le Roux rejected comparisons with the Fillon scandal. “Yes, my daughters worked with me, mainly during the summer or other school holidays, but never on a permanent basis,” he told French journalists. “We’re talking about a summer job with a parliamentarian. When it’s a case of doing filing or a number of parliamentary tasks, I think it’s a good life experience.” The eldest Le Roux daughter was 15 when she first worked for her father, for 12 days in 2009, it is claimed. The legal work age in France is 16, unless the person is employed by a parent. However, Le Roux is under pressure to explain how the date of one contract, during the 2013 summer holidays, coincides with the time his daughter was doing work experience at the cosmetic company Yves Rocher in Belgium. Le Roux, 51, was appointed interior minister last December, after Hollande reshuffled his government following Manuel Valls’s resignation as prime minister to concentrate on his presidential campaign, which ended in a primary vote defeat in January. On Tuesday morning, Le Roux cancelled an official engagement to inaugurate a national security and intelligence institute, the Institut National des Hautes Edudes de la Sécurité et de la Justice, at L’Ecole militaire in Paris. He was expected to make a statement during the day. The affair is particularly damaging for France’s socialist government as, at the height of the Fillon scandal in February, Le Roux was among the first to call for greater transparency in French political life. The opposition Les Républicains party has demanded a judicial inquiry into the affair. As calls for Le Roux’s resignation grew louder, Jean-Christophe Cambadélis, the head of the Socialist party, told RTL radio the problem was not “employing relatives, but establishing whether they had worked”. He insisted there was no suggestion Le Roux had given his daughters “fake jobs”. “We don’t force people to resign on the basis of a suspicion,” Cambadélis added. Marine Le Pen, the leader of the far-right Front National, is also under investigation in a “fake jobs” scandal. She has been accused of misusing €300,000 of European parliament funds to finance FN party staff, including a personal bodyguard."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/mar/21/what-makes-norway-the-worlds-happiest-country","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-03-21T09:41:28Z","webTitle":"What makes Norway the world's happiest country?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/mar/21/what-makes-norway-the-worlds-happiest-country","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/mar/21/what-makes-norway-the-worlds-happiest-country","fields":{"headline":"What makes Norway the world's happiest country?","bodyText":"Norway has moved up four places to knock Denmark off the top spot as the world’s happiest country, with Iceland and Switzerland rounding out the top four.

In the final version of the film, the Rebel fighters are killed at the conclusion of their ultimately successful mission to steal the blueprints for Darth Vader’s lethal space station, the Death Star. However, in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, screenwriter Gary Whitta and director Gareth Edwards revealed that an early draft of the script had some of the Rebels escaping the tropical planet of Scarif, including the film’s protagonists Jyn Erso (Felicity Jones) and Cassian Andor (Diego Luna), in case Disney found their preferred ending too dark. “The original instinct was that they should all die,” said Whitta “That’s what we always wanted to do. But we never explored it because we were afraid that Disney and Lucasfilm might not let us do it, that Disney might think it’s too dark for a Star Wars movie or for their brand.” However, the film-makers managed to convince the studios that a noble sacrifice would make for a stronger conclusion. “We told them, we feel they all need to die, and [Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy] and everyone else said to go for it. We got the ending that we wanted.” Whitta said. That said, even in the original script not everyone made it off Scarif, where the blueprints were held. “[Security droid] Kaytoo always died,” Whitta said. “Jyn did survive. Cassian also survived. There were a lot of casualties on both sides, in both versions of the scripts.” Edwards and Whitta also revealed that the original version of the film didn’t include the characters Bodhi Rook (Riz Ahmed), Chirrut Îmwe (Donnie Yen) or Baze Malbus (Jiang Wen), while Jyn was originally written as an enlisted Rebel soldier, rather than a street criminal-turned-freedom fighter. Rogue One was the first of a proposed series of standalone Star Wars anthology films that will expand the franchise’s universe. The next film in the series will centre on a young Han Solo, played by Alden Ehrenreich. The Lego Movie’s Phil Lord and Christopher Miller will direct the film, which has the working title Red Cup and is due in cinemas on 25 May 2018. A third entry in the series is planned for 2020, although no details have yet emerged about the project."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2017/mar/21/new-zealand-accused-of-cover-up-afghan-civilian-deaths","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-03-21T08:18:28Z","webTitle":"New Zealand accused of cover-up over Afghan civilian deaths","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/mar/21/new-zealand-accused-of-cover-up-afghan-civilian-deaths","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/mar/21/new-zealand-accused-of-cover-up-afghan-civilian-deaths","fields":{"headline":"New Zealand accused of cover-up over Afghan civilian deaths","bodyText":"A botched raid by New Zealand special forces in Afghanistan, which led to the deaths of six civilians including a three-year-old girl, was the subject of a military and political cover-up, according to allegations contained in a book by investigative journalist Nicky Hager. Hit &amp; Run: The New Zealand SAS in Afghanistan and the Meaning of Honour, co-authored by war correspondent Jon Stephenson, appears to contradict official statements that raids on two villages in Baghlan province in August 2010 killed “numerous insurgents” but no civilians. In the book, the authors say “there are reasonable grounds to suspect that New Zealanders and their United States allies were indeed involved in war crimes and other serious breaches of the laws of war”. The raid in question was launched as retaliation for the death of a soldier in a roadside bomb and signed off by then prime minister John Key. The authors have called on Key’s successor, Bill English, who faces an election in six months, to commission an independent investigation into the case. According to the book, which relies predominantly on unnamed sources, there were in fact no insurgents present in the areas targeted by the raid, undertaken by New Zealand forces supported by US helicopter gunships, with six civilians killed and 15 more injured. The subsequent denials, its authors argue, amount to a “dark and guilty secret of New Zealand’s recent history”. The elite troops involved in the raid failed to meet the requirements of their code of conduct, which requires them to give aid to the wounded, and instead “shot through”, Hager told media following the book launch in Wellington. It is unclear, he said, how much Key knew about what had taken place. “I suspect we know far more about what happened than John Key was told.” The chief of the NZ Defence Force at the time, Lt Gen Jerry Mateparae, was later appointed as governor general, the Queen’s representative in New Zealand, and is due to take up the appointment of high commissioner in the UK. In keeping with his practice in previous books, Hager did not seek comment from the government or military officials, largely to forestall injunctions. “You don’t get a comment, you just get people trying to sabotage you,” he said. The NZ Defence Force has rejected the book’s claims, saying: “The NZDF is confident that New Zealand personnel conducted themselves in accordance with the applicable rules of engagement.” It said it stood by its response in 2011 to claims of civilian deaths. It added that a joint investigation had been conducted by the Afghan ministry of defence and Isaf, the Nato-led security mission in Afghanistan, which “concluded that the allegations of civilian casualties were unfounded”. A spokesperson for acting defence minister, Chris Finlayson, said in a statement: “The matter was investigated at the time and I am advised by the New Zealand Defence Force they stand by what they said at the time.” In a 2014 interview, Key said: “We don’t discuss the detail of SAS operations, but what we do say categorically is that no New Zealand soldier was involved in killing civilians.” There had been speculation that the book had been timed for the eve of Key’s valedictory speech. The authors said that was a coincidence, with printing under way before Key’s early exit from parliament was announced. “I would rather it hadn’t got tangled up in that,” said Hager. They also said they did not believe the publication of the book or its contents influenced Key’s decision to resign as prime minister in December last year. The chief executive of Amnesty International NZ, Grant Bayldon, has called for an inquiry. “This is crucial, for not only the integrity of New Zealand and its operations overseas, but also for the women, men and children who may have been victims of this raid and have seen no justice,” he said in a statement. Key, who has yet to comment on the book, has previously dismissed Hager as a “conspiracy theorist”. Hager’s 2014 book Dirty Politics, which drew on hacked emails to expose links between the then prime minister and an attack blogger, was published weeks before the last election. While it dominated the campaign and led to the resignation of a cabinet minister, Key’s National party was re-elected with almost exactly the same level of support. More than 31,000 Afghan civilians are estimated to have been killed since the US invasion in 2001."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/live/2017/mar/21/uk-inflation-expected-to-hit-a-three-year-high-of-21-business-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-03-21T15:02:30Z","webTitle":"UK inflation jumps to 2.3% in February, pushing the pound higher - as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2017/mar/21/uk-inflation-expected-to-hit-a-three-year-high-of-21-business-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/live/2017/mar/21/uk-inflation-expected-to-hit-a-three-year-high-of-21-business-live","fields":{"headline":"UK inflation jumps to 2.3% in February, pushing the pound higher - as it happened","bodyText":"The earlier gains on Wall Street have been erased, and the FTSE 100’s losses have accelerated: Dow Jones: -0.5% at 20,798 S&amp;P 500: -0.3% at 2,367 Nasdaq: -0.1% at 5,406 FTSE 100: -0.4% at 7,399 On that note we’ll close up for the day. Thanks for reading the blog and for all the comments. We’ll be back tomorrow. Monday’s Eurogroup meeting of finance ministers ended without a decisive agreement between Greece and its creditors. The Guardian’s Helena Smith brings this report: The Greek finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos has decided to stay on in Brussels in all out bid to come to some agreement on the festering issue of labour reforms, now seen as the central obstacle to finally ending the review. Many fear a repeat of the the summer of 2015 when Greece came closest yet to euro exit in the face of default. Athens owes hefty repayments of €7.4bn this July, mostly to the the European Central Bank - money it does not have. Greece is now under immense pressure to come to some deal with lenders but few believe it will be able to achieve this before May at the earliest, with Tsakalotos holding out for a comprehensive solution that will also include debt relief - something unlikely to be discussed before the International Monetary Fund’s spring meeting at the end of April. The next few days could prove decisive, Greek government sources say. Meanwhile, banks are reporting that with the backdrop of uncertainty caused by the stalled review, bank deposits have fallen by €4bn since the end of 2016 - effectively wiping out the increase in deposits last year. The EU economic affairs commissioner, Pierre Moscovici, warned against further delays, describing them as “very harmful.” “That would impair the confidence of investors and consumers,” he said after the meeting. “That would be detrimental to economic recovery.” The pound is still up 0.8% against the dollar at $1.2458. Meanwhile the euro is also having a good day, climbing to six-week highs of above $1.08 following the French presidential election debate, where the centrist Emmanuel Macron appeared to come out on top over the far-right’s Marine Le Pen. Over in the US, markets have opened higher, tracking rises in Europe (with the exception of the FTSE) and higher oil prices. Dow Jones: +0.1% at 20,919 S&amp;P 500: +0.2% at 2,379 Nasdaq: +0.4% at 5,435 It’s another record high for the Nasdaq, helped by Apple shares which are also at a record high, up 0.9% at $142.70 after the tech company released the latest version of the iPad. The Nasdaq’s biggest risers: Pay packets in the UK are probably already shrinking according to the Resolution Foundation. Stephen Clarke, economic analyst at the thinktank, says: After 38 months inflation is back above the Bank’s target, bringing to an end the era of ultra-low inflation that has boosted living standards in recent years. Today’s rapid increase is part of a wider trend with price rises set to the big living standards story of this year. To date pay settlements have failed to respond to rapidly rising prices, meaning there’s a good chance pay packets are already shrinking in real terms. While there is little that can be done to prevent oil price rises and a falling pound driving up inflation, today’s figures reinforce the risks to living standards of weak wage rises, especially in the context of the recent slowdown in employment growth. February’s inflation data was the first time the ONS focused on the CPIH measure of inflation, which is “consumer prices index including owner-occupiers’ housing costs”. As my colleague Katie Allen explains, this move is not without controversy: Some economists say CPIH is lacking as a measure because by using figures based on “rent equivalence”, it does not truthfully capture people’s experience of the housing market. CPIH lost its status as a “national statistic” in 2014 and has yet to regain it. As it turns out, CPIH was 2.3% in February, the same level as the more traditional consumer prices index (CPI). The ONS says CPIH is the most comprehensive measure of inflation, but the fact remains it is not classed as a national statistic and the Bank of England continues to target CPI. Here in the UK, the big jump in inflation to 2.3% in February is in focus. Philip Shaw, economist at Investec, says the Bank of England is unlikely to raise interest rates until 2019, despite rising inflation: So far in 2017, CPI inflation is running ahead of the Bank of England’s forecasts – February’s outturn [of 2.3%] compares with a BoE projection of 2.1%. UK markets reacted sharply to today’s data. Sterling rose to $1.2470, its highest level against the dollar since late-February. Interest rate markets sold off, but remain sceptical of a hike this year, and are not fully pricing in a tightening until the second half of 2018. We continue to believe that the first move will not occur until 2019, but figures on growth and pay will be as important as inflation in determining the timing. Ruth Gregory, UK economist at Capital Economics, says while there is no immediate pressure the Bank’s Monetary Policy Committee to raise rates, that could change: The MPC looks likely to stand pat at least until 2018. But if the economy continues to hold up as well as we expect, interest rates could rise rather sooner than the markets have recently been anticipating. Time to take a look at the markets. The pound’s gain is the FTSE 100’s loss, as the modest gains made earlier have been erased. Here’s how it looks: FTSE 100: -0.1% at 7,422 Germany’s DAX: +0.2% at 12,076 France’s CAC: +0.6% at 5,040 Italy’s FTSE MIB: +1.3% at 20,236 Spain’s IBEX: +0.9% at 10,310 Europe’s STOXX 600: +0.2% at 379 Wall Street is expected to open higher, tracking the broad gains in European markets. On a busy day for UK data, the CBI has got in on the act with its latest industrial trends survey. Manufacturers’ expectations for growth were at the highest level in 22 years in March as export orders and output both rose at an accelerated rate. Anna Leach, head of economic intelligence at the CBI, said the drop in the value of the pound appears to be boosting to be exports: It’s been a strong month for UK manufacturers, with production growing robustly and overseas demand on the up. The past fall in the pound seems finally to be helping lift demand for UK manufactured exports, which rose at one of the fastest paces in this survey’s history. And manufacturers are positive about the quarter ahead, expecting output to grow at the fastest rate since February 1995. But the flipside is that cost pressures are widespread, and manufacturers expect factory-gate prices to continue to rise strongly over the next three months. And this will also put pressure on prices generally. Here’s our full story on Mark Carney latest comments on the Charlotte Hogg debacle: Mark Carney was not amused when he was lobbed a question about today’s inflation data during the Q&amp;A on banking standards. Asked what he made of the jump to 2.3% - a faster acceleration than the Bank expected - he answered rather abruptly that we shouldn’t “overreact to a single data point”. The government borrowed £1.8bn in February, £2.8bn lower than a year earlier and the lowest amount for the month of February since 2007, before the financial crisis took hold. So the government is still spending more than it earns, but economists had forecast higher borrowing of £2.1bn for last month. With just one month to go before the end of the fiscal year, borrowing totalled £47.8bn - £19.9bn less than at the same point last year. Tax receipts were strong last month, with income tax receipts up 13.3% and corporate tax receipts up 17.9%. That’s good news for the chancellor, putting him firmly on track to meet the 2016-17 borrowing target of £51.7bn. As Howard Archer points out, it’s a boost for Philip Hammond after his national insurance U-turn shocker last week: Some much needed good news for chancellor Philip Hammond as the February public finance data (and an upwardly revised January surplus) put him on track to meet the markedly lowered 2016/17 fiscal target contained in March’s budget. This is a particular relief for the chancellor as he has been under pressure after swiftly and embarrassingly scrapping his budget plans to raise national insurance contributions for the self-employed. The fiasco over the national insurance contributions for the self-employed means that the chancellor really could do with meeting his 2016/17 budget targets. Missing the 2016/17 budget deficit forecast contained in March’s budget - even modestly - would be a further blow as he looks to regain credibility after the fiasco over the self-employed’s national insurance contributions. Carney suggests he did not want Charlotte Hogg to resign: An honest mistake that is freely admitted for which a firm takes prompt remedial action is not a firing offence. He has given some some interesting details on the Bank’s response to the revelation that Charlotte Hogg had broken Bank rules by failing to disclose her brother worked for Barclays (in a potential conflict of interest). He says: Hogg was “formally warned in the strongest – and most public – of terms” She waived her salary increase this year Hogg’s responsibilities as chief operating officer were reassigned (she was originally going to stay on as COO as well as taking on the role of deputy governor for markets and banking) Reporting lines and internal structures have been changed to improve governance and disciplinary processes The Bank is undertaking a review following the incident and the results will be made public Bank of England governor Mark Carney is giving a speech on banking standards over at Threadneedle Street. He has taken the opportunity to address the issue of Charlotte Hogg - who resigned as deputy governor - less than two weeks after taking up the role - after failing to disclose her brother works for Barclays: Carney says the Bank understands it should be held up to the highest standards and accountability: For those who have questioned whether we “get it”, we do. We know this honest mistake was also a serious mistake – one that was compounded by the fact that Charlotte Hogg had overseen the development of our new code. We were clear upfront that there must be consequences for both her and the Bank. Here is a reminder of the story: UK inflation is on its way up...here’s how it looks: Lots of reaction coming in to the inflation data but first a quick look at some of the detail from the ONS report. The main drivers of the sharper-than-expected rise in inflation were food and fuel prices. A sustained period of food deflation appears to be firmly over. Food prices increased by 0.3% in February compared with a year earlier, ending 31 consecutive months of falling prices. Over the month, food prices rose by 0.8% Fuel prices rose by 1.2% between January and February The price of computers (including laptops and tablets) rose 2.3% during the month Vegetables were major factor behind the rise in food prices, largely because of weather-related shortages in southern Europe. The price of an iceberg lettuce, for example, rose by 67% between January and February, having fallen 5.1% a year ago, The larger-than-expected rise in inflation to 2.3% in February further closes the gap between the rise in prices and wage growth. Inflation is now higher than wage growth (2.2% in the three months to January), signalling a return to falling real pay for UK workers. Frances O’Grady, general secretary of the TUC, has commented on the inflation figures: Working people across the UK are now facing the double blow of rising prices and slower wage growth. If the government doesn’t wake up, we risk sleepwalking into another living standards crisis. We urgently need more investment in skills and infrastructure to build strong foundations for better paid jobs. And it’s time to scrap the pay restrictions hitting hardworking teachers, nurses and other public servants. The pound is up 0.8% against the dollar after the sharp jump in inflation, to $1.2455. Responding to the inflation figures, a spokesperson for the Treasury acknowledged that families are growing increasingly concerned about the rising cost of living. A strong economy and sustainable public finances are vital to achieve rising living standards. The spring budget set out plans to build a stronger, fairer economy by investing in skills, schools, social care and cutting-edge technology, while continuing to bring down the deficit and live within our means. The government appreciates that families are concerned about the cost of living, and that is why we are cutting tax for millions of working people, increasing the National Living Wage to £7.50 per hour from next month, and freezing fuel duty for the seventh year in a row. Breaking: UK inflation rose to 2.3% in February from 1.8% in January. Food and fuel prices were the main drivers. It’s a bigger-than-expected rise after economists forecast 2.1%, and the highest level since September 2013. Also a return to the Bank of England’s 2% target. More soon... The pound is up 0.5% against the dollar, at $1.2412. The annual inflation rate is expected to rise to a three-year high of 2.1% in February from 1.8% in January, which in theory raises the prospect of an interest rate hike. In reality, economists expect Bank of England policymakers to keep rates on hold at an all-time low of 0.25% for the foreseeable future, as the Brexit road aheads remains hugely uncertain. Meanwhile the dollar index - which measures the performance of the US currency against other key currencies - fell below 100 for the first time since early February. Just five minutes to go until the inflation data... The UK house builder Bellway has warned on possible labour shortages after Brexit because the industry is so reliant on workers from abroad. It could exacerbate the housing shortage in the UK, according to the chief executive of the Newcastle-based builder. Speaking to the Guardian, Ted Ayres said: The big thing for construction industry is we have a reliance on overseas labour, and [the question is], will it have any impact on people not wanting to live in the UK or will it stop further people coming to the UK to help us meet the housing demand? We’re not going to able to build the number of units completely off the UK workforce. He made the comments after Bellway posted a 9% rise in first half profits to £247m, pleasing investors and sending shares up 2.4% this morning. Neil Wilson, senior market analyst at ETX Capital, says house builders have been more resilient than expected since the Brexit vote. Shares in Bellway now stand above where they were before the Brexit vote. It’s a far cry from June. To all those who bet against UK housebuilders in what was a bloodbath for the sector on June 24th [the day after the referendum], the last few months have been a lesson in fundamentals. The likes of Taylor Wimpey and Persimmon are also back to pre-referendum levels. Redrow has surged well past that level. Bovis is the laggard and left itself open to a takeover as a result. Part of it is down to the resilience of the UK economy and in particular the continued strength of consumer spending and confidence. The Bank of England played its part too in slashing interest rates to help boost confidence and ensure access to credit was not about to be a problem. This was an important signal at the time. Mortgage rates and availability remain very supportive. But the most important factor is the fundamental mismatch in the property sector between supply and demand, which across large parts of the country continues to exert upward pressure on selling prices faster than wages can keep pace. Europe’s main indices are up this morning. The FTSE 100 is up by a modest 4 points at 7,433 as investors ponder Theresa May’s decision to trigger Article 50 next Wednesday, formally kickstarting divorce proceedings with the EU. Markets have also shrugged of last night’s presidential election debate in France, where the far-right Front National’s Marine Le Pen came under fire from rivals. Here are the scores on the board: FTSE 100: +0.04% at 7,433 Germany’s DAX: +0.1% at 12,070 France’s CAC: +0.3% at 5,029 Italy’s FTSE MIB: +1% at 20,166 Spain’s IBEX: +0.8% at 10,298 Europe’s STOXX 600: +0.1% at 378 Also coming up today is UK public finances data for February, which will show how much the government borrowed over the month and reveal how the chancellor is doing as the fiscal year to the end of March 2017 draws to a close. In Philip Hammond’s Spring budget earlier this month, the outlook for the public finances was revised to show lower borrowing over the coming years than previously expected - partly because economic growth has been more resilient. Borrowing in the full 2016-17 fiscal year is now expected to be £51.7bn, after budget forecasts were revised down from £68.2bn. That would be sharply lower than the £76bn borrowed by the government in 2015-16. Here is our preview story on the UK inflation data, out at 9.30am: Traders at IG, the spread-betting firm, are expecting markets to be pretty subdued when trading gets underway in Europe this morning: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It’s UK inflation day, and it is expected to a significant one. The consumer prices index has been rising since October and the latest data from the Office for National Statistics is expected to show a further rise in February to 2.1% from 1.8% in January. That would be the highest since November 2013 and mark a return to the Bank of England’s 2% target after a prolonged period of below-target inflation. Brexit has put an end to the weak inflationary pressures of recent years, as the sharp drop in the value of the pound since the vote has pushed up the cost of imports from abroad and is starting to feed through to higher prices in the shops. Higher food and petrol prices are expected to contribute to the higher rate of inflation in February. Inflation is expected to rise to about 3% by the end of the year, putting increasing pressure on household finances at a time when wage growth is slowing. Higher inflation does not mean the Bank will raise interest rates any time soon though, as Philip Shaw from Investec explains: We still expect inflation to surpass 3% over the summer. But we do not expect the MPC to respond by raising rates unless there is a material acceleration in pay rates, a scenario which data earlier this week suggest is unlikely for now.

They will give a free pass to ugly and damaging forms of racist vilification which do not satisfy the stringent legal criteria of harassment and intimidation. The publication of virtually any derogatory generalisation about an entire community group would, of itself, be permissible. To offend, insult or humiliate a person or group because of their ethnic background necessarily sends a message that such people, by virtue of who they are, and regardless of how they behave or what they believe, are not members of society in good standing. This cannot but vitiate the sense of belonging of members of the group and their sense of assurance and security as citizens, and constitutes an assault upon their human dignity. This has nothing to do with a contest of ideas or free speech and falls far short of the mutual respect about which we have heard. Under the government’s proposals, vulnerable community groups will now have no peaceful, legal means of redress against these kinds of attacks against their dignity. This would send a signal from government of a more lenient attitude to racism and would damage social cohesion. It is especially ironic that the government put forward these proposals on Harmony Day. The proposal to insert a generic “reasonable person” standard into the legislation has superficial appeal but is unfair and unworkable. The proverbial person in the pub or on the “Bondi tram” does not have the background knowledge and insight into the particularities of a minority group that would be needed to make a fair and informed assessment of what is reasonably likely to “harass or intimidate” members of that group. Under the existing law, the assessment is made by a reasonable member of the targeted community – that is, by a member of that community who is neither overly sensitive nor overly thick-skinned. This is both more logical and more just. A generic reasonable person test would also create the possibility that members of a group that happens to be unpopular at any time for any reason would be unfairly treated. Section 18C is not needed to protect members of minority groups who are popular in the wider community. It is needed to protect members of vulnerable and, in particular, unpopular minorities. There is cause to improve the process for handling section 18C complaints, so that trivial or spurious complaints are terminated quickly. The parliamentary joint committee on human rights was unable to reach a consensus, or even a majority opinion, in favour of any of the government’s proposals to amend the substantive law. Its recommendations were all limited to suggested reforms to the complaints-handling process. This is the sensible way forward. The problems identified by the QUT case and the Bill Leak complaint all related to deficiencies of process. The government’s reforms should, as the inquiry recommended, address that problem specifically, and not be distracted with an abstract ideological debate, divorced from the social realities. Alex Ryvchin: While the desire to cripple our protections against public racial vilification appears to be a boutique issue driven by conservative ideology and libertarian theory, the impact of racial hate speech is as broad as it is deeply personal, and anything but theoretical. In 1992, I was nine years old and living with my late brother and parents in an apartment in Randwick in the eastern suburbs of Sydney. We had arrived in Australia four years earlier as refugees from the former Soviet Union. The status of Soviet Jews as a persecuted minority group had been recognised on the basis of institutional discrimination, which imposed entry quotas on Jews to many universities, inhibited their entry into various professions and totally denied them the right to practise their faith. As cruel and unjust as the state-sanctioned discrimination against Jews in the Soviet Union was, the every day, casual racism stung more. Ask any Soviet Jew about their experiences and they will recall with unhealed sorrow and pain the humiliation they suffered daily on public transport, in the schoolyard, in the workplace. They will tell you about the fear and debasement they felt when reading stories in the state press about the cunning agitators and capitalist speculators, always given caricatured Jewish names, undermining the state from within. We thought that dark chapter of our lives had been permanently sealed when we came to Australia and, for the most part, it has been. We live freely in this great land and are thankful for it daily. But above us in that apartment in Randwick we came across someone intent on importing foreign prejudices and in reminding us that, in spite of our studied efforts to integrate into our new society, we were not welcome. It began one day with bellowing rants from his balcony, which sat directly above ours, about “the Jews”. I remember well the deep bass of his voice, mocking in tone and utterly terrifying in pitch as he would lament that “Hitler did not finish the job.” I would read many years later about the Nobel laureate Elie Wiesel’s observations of the Soviet Jews when he travelled there in the 1960s. He recorded seeing fear etched on every Jewish face, without exception. As a boy of nine I needed only to look at the terror-stricken faces on my parents at that moment to see what Wiesel had. The abuse would continue daily for months. “I will finish the job,” was frequently added to the critique of Hitler’s unfinished genocide. The police were called many times. My parents beseeched them not to wait until he acts but were told each time that, until an act of violence occurs, his mere words were outside the operation of the law. There was no 18C then and in truth I do not know if it would have provided us adequate comfort or protection. Legal processes are invariably cumbersome and rarely do they fully erase the loss that has been suffered. But what is clear is that to remove existing prohibitions on racist hate speech, to make lawful the public humiliation of others on the basis of their ethnicity would be a dark and retrograde measure. It would articulate a new official position of laxity towards racism. Such a move would be unbecoming of our great and liberal nation. • Peter Wertheim is the executive director of the Executive Council of Australian Jewry and was previously a lawyer for 32 years.

The author of Half of a Yellow Sun plunged into a row about identity politics when she suggested in an interview last week that the experiences of transgender women, who she said are born with the privileges the world accords to men, are distinct from those of women born female. She was criticised for implying that trans women are not “real women”. But Adichie defended her comments during a public appearance in Washington on Monday night. “This is fundamentally about language orthodoxy,” she told a sellout event organised by the bookshop Politics &amp; Prose. “There’s a part of me that resists this sort of thing because I don’t think it’s helpful to insist that unless you want to use the exact language I want you to use, I will not listen to what you’re saying. “From the very beginning, I think it’s been quite clear that there’s no way I could possibly say that trans women are not women. It’s the sort of thing to me that’s obvious, so I start from that obvious premise. Of course they are women but in talking about feminism and gender and all of that, it’s important for us to acknowledge the differences in experence of gender. That’s really what my point is.” The controversy erupted after a Channel 4 interview broadcast on 10 March in which Adichie argued gender is about experiences, not anatomy, and a person who has lived as a man – with the privileges according by society to men – before transitioning has experiences that cannot be equated with those of someone born female. In the face of a number of angry responses, Adichie followed up with a Facebook post on 12 March but described it as a clarification rather than an apology. “I didn’t apologise because I don’t think I have anything to apologise for,” she said on Monday. “What’s interesting to me is this is in many ways about language and I think it also illustrates the less pleasant aspects of the American left, that there sometimes is a kind of language orthodoxy that you’re supposed to participate in, and when you don’t there’s a kind of backlash that gets very personal and very hostile and very closed to debate. “Had I said, ‘a cis woman is a cis woman, and a trans woman is a trans woman’, I don’t think I would get all the crap that I’m getting, but that’s actually really what I was saying. “But because ‘cis’ is not a part of my vocabulary – it just isn’t – it really becomes about language and the reason I find that troubling is to insist that you have to speak in a certain way and use certain expressions, otherwise we cannot have a conversation, can close up debate. And if we can’t have conversations, we can’t have progress.” Adichie distanced herself from academic feminism and said her new book, Dear Ijeawele, or A Feminist Manifesto in Fifteen Suggestions, is careful to avoid jargon. “I don’t really partake in that kind of language orthodoxy and there’s a part of me that really resists it. So I resist to be coopted into it.” A campaigner for LGBTQ rights in Nigeria, Adichie is a star of the progressive left and not accustomed to finding herself on the receiving end of its ire. She said: “It was unpleasant, and I think it was unpleasant not because of the sort of criticism and vitriol and hostility – which I’m used to, because I think if you make the choice to label yourself feminist publicly it just comes with the baggage – but in this case it came from my tribe, my tribe being women who believe in equality. “But really, my position remains: I think gender is about what we experience, gender is about how the world treats us, and I think a lot of the outrage and anger comes from the idea that in order to be inclusive, we sometimes have to deny difference. I think that because human difference for so long, in all its various forms, has been the root of so much oppression, sometimes there’s the impulse to say let’s deny the difference, as though by wishing away the difference we can then wish away the oppression.” This echoes over-optimistic claims of a post-racial society, the award-winning author continued. “In some ways it’s like the idea of colour-blindness, which is, I think, just a really hollow idea that if we say we don’t see colour, then somehow all the oppressions will disappear. That’s not the case … “I think there were people who felt I was somehow making a point about the Oppression Olympics: you haven’t suffered enough. It’s not at all that. It’s simply to see that if we can acknowledge there are differences, then we can better honestly talk about things.” Adichie gave violence against transgender women, reproductive rights, participation in sport and the debate around same-sex schools as examples where such acknowledgement would broaden the feminist conversation. She insisted that she has always stood up for the rights of trans women and would continue to do so. During a question and answer session, Adichie was asked about issues of “intersectionality”, the overlap of social identities such as race, gender and sexuality. She remained sceptical: “Speaking of language, even the word ‘intersectionality’ comes from a certain kind of academic discourse that sometimes I don’t know what it means.” Feminism was a useful word to rally around despite understandable reservations, she added. “I think the history of western feminism is one that is fraught with racism, and I think it’s important to acknowledge that, and at the same time to say that feminism is not the western invention, that my great-grandmother in what is now south-western Nigeria is feminist … “I think white women need to wake up and say, ‘Not all women are white’, three times in front of the mirror.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"politics/2017/mar/21/david-cameron-jokes-listening-trump-wiretaps","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-03-21T04:40:24Z","webTitle":"David Cameron jokes: 'I don't have to listen any more to wiretaps of Donald Trump'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/mar/21/david-cameron-jokes-listening-trump-wiretaps","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/mar/21/david-cameron-jokes-listening-trump-wiretaps","fields":{"headline":"David Cameron jokes: 'I don't have to listen any more to wiretaps of Donald Trump'","bodyText":"David Cameron has joked that a major advantage of being an ex-prime minister is that he is no longer required to listen to Donald Trump’s wiretapped conversations – adding swiftly, perhaps for the benefit of the Twitter-happy president: “Just to be clear, that’s a joke.” The former British prime minister was speaking on Monday at Brown University, Rhode Island, where he delivered the 94th Ogden memorial lecture on international affairs, touching upon Brexit, Vladimir Putin and making America great again in front of a sold-out audience of around 2,400. He told them that despite 2016 being marked by the election of Trump and Britain’s vote to leave the European Union – a result that guillotined his premiership – tolerance, rather than nationalism and isolation, would be the way forward, the Providence Journal reported. “When the Berlin Wall fell in 1989, it felt a bit like all the big arguments were over. It was obvious that we needed more democracies, we needed more rule of law, we needed free enterprise, we needed free trade, we needed Nato, we needed to stand up to aggression, we should invest in the United Nations … today, all of these questions are under debate. “Your president doesn’t agree with some of the things I’ve just said.” The US and UK were, Cameron said, “the guardians of freedom, of tolerance, of equality and, yes, of justice. Fight for them and we really will be great again … “Far from being in retreat, democracy has been on the march.” In the wake of comments by Trump and his administration expressing scepticism bordering on hostility about the effectiveness of Nato, Cameron cautioned: “We should treasure Nato, not undermine it. We won’t make American great by making eastern Europe weaker again.” Instead, he argued, countries should be outward-looking: “Stop the World – I Want to Get Off might have been a good movie, but it’s a hopeless philosophy in a shrinking world. “There is a powerful moral argument that we should love our neighbour, whether at home or the other side of the world.” Such affection could still exist between Britain and its European neighbours, he insisted, despite the imminent divorce, the process of which Cameron’s successor, Theresa May, has announced she will trigger next week. Cameron said the tricky negotiations of untangling Britain from the EU were “not impossible to get right”, adding: “Leaving the European Union does not mean we’re leaving Europe.” Since late last year, Cameron has embarked on a lucrative US speaking tour – the proceeds of which he does not not need to declare publicly, having resigned as an MP in the wake of his departure from 10 Downing Street. On Monday, in remarks that reportedly drew laughter and applause from the audience, Cameron weighed in on the row between Trump and almost everyone else – British spy agency GCHQ, the FBI and Barack Obama himself among them – over whether the president was, as he claimed without evidence, “wire-tapped” by his predecessor. There was one plus point of his departure from politics, Cameron – who was previously labelled “a dummy” by the then Apprentice host – joked: “I don’t have to listen any more to the wiretaps of Donald Trump’s conversations.” Another relief has been the end of invitations from Russian leader Vladimir Putin to go hunting with him, Cameron said, adding of the famously chest-baring president: “I’m very fond of riding horses, but I don’t look quite the same with my shirt off.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2017/mar/22/afl-season-preview-giants-expected-to-walk-tall-with-bulldogs-and-swans","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-03-21T19:00:14Z","webTitle":"AFL season preview: Giants expected to walk tall with Bulldogs and Swans | Russell Jackson","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/mar/22/afl-season-preview-giants-expected-to-walk-tall-with-bulldogs-and-swans","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/mar/22/afl-season-preview-giants-expected-to-walk-tall-with-bulldogs-and-swans","fields":{"headline":"AFL season preview: Giants expected to walk tall with Bulldogs and Swans","bodyText":"As befits the surreal nature of modern life, the AFL’s season-launching TV commercials have set a disorienting template for the 2017 football season ahead. In one, the reigning premier Western Bulldogs – a working class club who used to be content with the brand exposure gained from window displays at Footscray butchers shops – find themselves in the nouveau riche wonderland of being spruiked by their very own Hollywood superfan Chris Hemsworth. Doggies loyalists must shake their heads at such a turn of events; 25 years ago they had Danny Del-Re selling them a membership, now they’ve got Thor crashing through the living room window as they re-watch their special edition premiership DVDs, thumb glossy commemorative books and sing along one more time to Sons of the West. Last week the once-untouchable and tragically unfashionable club was even invited to appear on the Seven Network’s Sunrise program and yuk it up with Kochie and the gang. At this rate a Married at First Sight spin-off matching up eligible singles from the club’s men’s and women’s teams can’t be far off. If this plane makes it to the first week of the 2017 finals without losing both wings and an engine, Luke Beveridge should be knighted. The Dogs start their premiership defence this weekend with a quite hairy Friday night fixture against unknown quantities Collingwood. To cause an upset the Pies will need to move past the “crisis talks” required since they learned of the most delightfully screwball scandal of the off-season; on Tuesday it emerged that injured Pies midfielder Jordan De Goey actually broke his hand in a bar incident not related to football, rather than, as earlier claimed by the player, a roustabout-gone-wrong with his pet dog. A summit in David King’s war room surely beckons. I digress. The primary threat to the Bulldogs’ premiership defence – a threat felt by every other club, and the subject of heavy-breathing obsession from the Melbourne football media – is the rise and rise of Greater Western Sydney. The Giants were dismantled by the Dogs in last season’s preliminary final, but are probably an improved side since that September misstep. According to bookmakers they now sit in pole position for the flag, just ahead of the Swans. A worthwhile disclaimer: the same bookies liked the look of Fremantle during the 2016 pre-season. Counter-moves are afoot. Victims of their own almost-success, GWS have had their unfettered access to the Albury/Murray recruiting region curtailed following complaints from other clubs that too many future Toby Greenes lurk in the club’s academy system. The uppity Giants have also had their salary cap relief yanked from them two years early, ensuring this season is the first since the national competition’s inception that all teams are on a level playing field. In all honesty, the flag race is probably a three-way shootout between GWS, Sydney and the Dogs. The latter boast a list far too strong to suffer a genuine hangover, though if ever a reigning premier was to put in a farcical premiership defence, the Dogs would surely do it in lovable style. The next tier of challengers comprises Geelong, Hawthorn, West Coast and Adelaide – all known quantities at this point but all looking like either semi or preliminary final losers to us. The rest of the pack should bunch together tightly, so it’s best to start at the very bottom. In the post-season period last year Brisbane did what struggling clubs do, replacing the coach who presided over their nightmare plummet of the last few years with one from a dynastic club. They also demoted their captain to send a message: at the very least, new scapegoats are required. Expectations for Gold Coast Suns are set at similarly subterranean levels, meaning the Lions’ AFLW side is almost single-handedly providing the good news quota in Queensland football. I know which one of the three I’d pay to watch. Carlton’s dismal pre-season performances have convinced many that the initial lift gained from first-year coach Brendon Bolton’s upbeat presence in 2016 will flatten out. Still, when you look at Jacob Weitering and Patrick Cripps carving their way through play you stop feeling sorry for the Blues. Fremantle are a little harder to place; unquestionably well-drilled by Ross Lyon but possessing a fringe finals list at best. Richmond and their resilient coach Damien Hardwick have discovered in the last few seasons that the opposite of disaster isn’t necessarily success, and another middling season looms. A little higher up in projections than last year sit remodelled Essendon. Notwithstanding an unwelcome guest appearance from Mick Gatto, the Bombers can only improve on the horrors of their self-inflicted mess of the last four years. They might however take time to find their feet as a coherent side. The raw components are certainly there. Talent-stuffed Collingwood often struggle for credibility when their win:loss ratio is contrasted with fan expectations, but they could do with a passing of the injury cloud that wreaked havoc with their last few campaigns. Both the Pies and Dons will fight for lower-tier finals spots with downward trending hype teams of seasons gone by (Port Adelaide, North Melbourne) and upward trending cellar-dwellers of the same period (St Kilda, Melbourne). This season the media landscape will be shaken up most noticeably by the sad absence of retired broadcasting doyen Dennis Cometti, and every footy fan would been shocked by the recent news of a serious health scare to his former partner in crime, Bruce McAvaney. If you think you’ve suffered through a pre-season of fake and non-news, spare a thought for the poor AFL reporters who cover the code year-round and have content quotas to hit all summer. Each player in this high-stakes game merely hopes to avoid the ignominy of 2011s benchmark: the “Andrew Walker wears a hat” headline (subject to an extensive thread on a Carlton FC message board). The Andrew Walker’s hats of this off-season campaign were many and varied, but we liked Footy Classified’s gripe about players failing to address members of the media by their given name – outrage sparked by a bunch of AFL captains greeting SEN radio host Francis Leach as “mate” during the annual pre-season media cattle call. Knowing Leach’s extensive body of work handling talkback calls, it’s a decent bet he’d be happy with any host-guest dynamic more sophisticated than grunts and farts. Thank Gary Ablett Sr there will be some actual football to discuss by Friday morning. Remarkably, AFL administrators are in an even greater lather than the media as the season kicks off. League chief executive Gillon McLachlan set a not entirely endearing precedent for his 2017 management style this week, bellyaching about the failure of Gabba ground staff to get that venue in shape for Brisbane and Adelaide’s AFLW final, despite a three-week lead time. “Of course I’m angry,” McLachlan stropped, before descending into a tirade of such breathtaking arrogance that you were left longing for the days of well-mannered wallflowers like Andrew Demetriou. “The lesson out of this is that AFLW is here to stay. People need to make a decision about prioritising that. This is a serious mainstream sport and people need to get their head around that. I mean, really, three weeks? These venues are billion-dollar pieces of infrastructure and they’re there to be used and that is the incumbency on the people managing them, to get them ready to play.” One might call that a mighty high horse to be riding when you’re in charge of a code which ignored women for the best part of two centuries, so “people” might also call out the CEO’s theatrics for what they are. Two months earlier McLachlan needed to placate the incensed hordes of fans who’d been locked out of the second undersized venue his administration had chosen for the season-opening game of this very serious, very mainstream sport of his. For that historic occasion McLachlan made tickets free, when most attendees would have paid. The game was also played in the shadows of a dispute in which players had to fight tooth and nail simply to be provided health insurance, boots and the grossly inadequate wage they’re being paid to provide the league with a 10-week extension of its media dominance. But you know, it’s not just players who are itching to lay that cathartic first shirtfront of the season. If recent days are anything to go by, players might well take McLachlan’s bossypants lead and speak their minds this season, so it’s not all bad. “Super excited for the first Ashes Test,” was the sarcastic response of Lions player Josh Walker to the Gabba situation. Hopefully he’ll also provide a more viable goal-kicking option than Phil Tufnell. What the AFLW has done this off-season is completely disturb football’s tired Old Grammarians ecosystem. Perhaps it will also remind a few male players that the they’re not the centre of the universe. The longer-lasting consequences of this rise in the women’s game remain to be seen, but possibilities have certainly opened up for the sport at large. The bloated men’s season, with its innumerable meaningless fixtures and split rounds, has been crying out for NFL-style truncation for years. Perhaps in some not-too-distant future, the AFLW season will spread out across a 12 or 14-game regular season with two weeks of finals, thus enabling the league to shorten and sharpen the men’s season schedule without the loss of the TV rights revenue to which they and clubs have grown accustomed. Yet just as things change they remain the same. Having revealed they’re open to breaking one of their holy commandments by shifting the men’s grand final to a twilight start time, the AFL stubbornly persist with made-up traditions like the daft season-opener between well-supported mediocrities Carlton and Richmond. Heaven forbid that top-performing sides with a relevant and compelling modern rivalry – like, say, that shared between the Bulldogs and Giants – be rewarded for fostering something fans actually want to watch. As Gillon McLachlan would say, people need to start making better decisions about priorities."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2017/mar/21/neighbours-jumps-the-shark-can-toadies-goatee-and-a-bonkers-plot-twist-save-the-soap","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2017-03-21T05:00:04Z","webTitle":"Neighbours jumps the shark: can Toadie's goatee (and a bonkers plot twist) save the soap?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/mar/21/neighbours-jumps-the-shark-can-toadies-goatee-and-a-bonkers-plot-twist-save-the-soap","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2017/mar/21/neighbours-jumps-the-shark-can-toadies-goatee-and-a-bonkers-plot-twist-save-the-soap","fields":{"headline":"Neighbours jumps the shark: can Toadie's goatee (and a bonkers plot twist) save the soap?","bodyText":"Oh Toadie, you bloody fool. Dee, you bloody scammer. Melodrama and scandal have always been the mainstay of the soap opera but, lately, the wholesome family cul-de-sac vibe of Australia’s long-running series Neighbours has been jolted by plotline renovation. Something is up in Ramsay Street. At the centre of the show’s newly spinning narrative vortex is an ill-fated couple: gorgeous blonde Dee Bliss (Madeleine West) and mischievous rogue Toadie Rebecchi (Ryan Moloney), who share a loving yet traumatic history. Toadie hasn’t seen Dee since their wedding in 2003; a tearful, romantic event that brought together two much-adored fan favourites. But their fateful wedding day was also the day Dee died, after Toadie accidentally drove their car off a cliff while passionately, stupidly kissing his new bride at the wheel. He escaped but her body was never recovered. After 13 years spent in heartbroken guilt, Toadie remarried and had babies – yet never stopped loving Dee. But what if she didn’t drown at sea after all? With news that Neighbours could disappear from British screens, is the fresh scandal enough to save Australia’s longest-running soap – and most wildly successful TV export – from redundancy? Let’s dive a little deeper. The re-entry of Dee accompanies the revelation that she was pregnant at the time of her death – Dee and Toadie share a beautiful teenage daughter named Willow! Naturally, this is a rank lie: Dee is in fact Andrea Somers, a woman with eerie physical similarities to Dee and an aim to defraud the Bliss/Rebecchi family estate. Her fake daughter Willow is a masterful juvenile blackmailer who, incidentally, harbours extremely realistic ambitions to be an airforce pilot. Having defrauded Toadie of $100,000 last week on the pretext of needing school fees for Willow, Dee fled to London. This week’s London episodes promise what the Neighbours Australian PR team calls “A week of shocking secrets and scandals” and a next-levelling of soap farce: Fake Dee finally moving Toadie towards infidelity, spousal spying via Skype and the revelation of Dee’s true identity as Andrea the Lying, Cheating Swindler. So far, the promises haven’t been fulfilled; Monday night’s episode was no more than an excuse to run Toadie around in a black cab to some pretty standard tourist locations like Piccadilly Circus and Buckingham Palace. Crucially, the London plotline also transplants the show to the shores of its biggest market; Neighbours has far more viewers in the UK than Australia. The overseas trip is a tried and true soapie strategy. It invigorates dusty suburban settings with an injection of drama and the new locations take the main plotlines to a more sensational climax. The US soap The Bold and The Beautiful, for example, takes occasional trips to Milan for fashion week and Aspen for sexy ski trips, using wonderfully dodgy green screens and adding fake seaside backdrops to their usual sets. It’s not the first time Neighbours has gone to London (Karl and Susan got remarried, again, on the Thames in 2007) but this storyline has been prefaced with about two months of pretty great soapie nonsense on Ramsay Street. We’ve seen eavesdropping in bushes, characters exhibiting childish gullibility (Toadie: “Oh, Dee, you love me and we have a secret daughter? Gee whiz, here’s that $100,000 you were after!”), unbelievable permissiveness (Sonya Rebecchi, who ridiculously calls her husband Jarrod, and delusionally lets him chase his ex-wife overseas), gaslighting, gold-digging, blackmail, stolen identity, resurrection from the dead (except not), fake paternity and clunky exposition-as-dialogue (straight-faced Steph: “My mental health issues are starting to flare up again”) as well as your standard sociopathic deception and manipulation. The show’s media strategy has also taken a self-aware turn, coming in on the joke. Consequently, Neighbours’ cultural capital has intensified: social media mentions are everywhere, episode recaps are going viral. But it hasn’t been enough to quiet rumours of a breakdown in negotiations between the show’s producers and its British broadcaster Channel 5. A petition has surfaced to keep the show on UK screens, attracting the signatures of 7,000 diehard fans. Broadcast television is scratching desperately at relevancy. What does the old TV model offer that the new streaming websites don’t? Reality TV, news, sports and soap operas. These dependable formats are the salve of the traditional channels, the richest markets for linear television and the beating heart of nostalgic, throwaway, weeknight entertainment. But producers and network executives need to constantly update the way they approach these shows now that the television landscape has gone digital and changed forever. Unlike film, television offers assured distribution to assured viewers – it’s a far less risky proposition for a show to find an audience. To secure international deals, Neighbours has to find ways to make itself relevant to its international audience and it has the most fans in Britain: a country with a stronger, bigger culture of television viewing than Australia. Neighbours generally draws 400,000 TV viewers in Australia and peaks at just over a million in the UK when there’s a sufficiently silly plotline. Historically, the UK has provided the biggest audience, with up to 20 million in the glory days of Scott and Charlene’s wedding. Those days are gone. By taking its most popular characters to the UK, Neighbours is trying to retain its threatened place in the global marketplace; without a place on UK screens, the show becomes a far less viable economic prospect for its production company Fremantle Media. And so, in the war for digital screens, old mate Toadie has become an unlikely, global Australian icon: an invaluable, weaponised goatee to lure back British eyes. The terrible truth, however, is that Neighbour’s recent litany of plotline insanity has nothing on the overreaches of American soap operas. The Bold and The Beautiful’s long-deceased Darla Forrester has been known to pop up as a disembodied, low-tech head, hovering on the edges of the screen to wish her loved ones well and provide thoughtful advice from beyond the grave. On the same show, Ridge’s wife Taylor came back to life, having been whisked away from her deathbed by a psychopathic foreign prince and imprisoned for years in the Middle East. Blatant racism aside, this is inspiring! If Neighbours wants to really save itself, it needs to quit the filler plotlines (Gary and his “ladybug” Therese’s budding romance?! Ugh) and go all out: true resurrection from the dead, ghosts, brothers in love with the same woman, long-lost evil twins and flashbacks. Compared with the true heights that soap opera can scale, the Toadie and Dee saga is, quite frankly, lame. Beyond escalating the plotlines, Neighbours also needs to ramp up the camp acting (Toadie has been wild-eyed and on fire lately – the man was put on planet Earth to be a soap star) and the OTT production conventions (exaggerated close-ups, lingering zoom-ins on wordless facial expressions at the end of scenes, plus black-and-white dream sequences). Traditional television is dying. What better way to revitalise a soap than with an old-school, sexist storyline in non-continental Europe that paints women as liars and gold-diggers! It’s a good start. But if Neighbours is going to outlive the shift in the media landscape, it’s going to have get a hell of a lot soapier. Here’s hoping Toadie and Dee’s shenanigans are just the beginning of a brave new world of weeknight hysteria."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/mar/21/british-second-world-war-veteran-92-facing-deportation-from-australia","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-03-21T05:27:16Z","webTitle":"British second world war veteran, 92, facing deportation from Australia","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/mar/21/british-second-world-war-veteran-92-facing-deportation-from-australia","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/mar/21/british-second-world-war-veteran-92-facing-deportation-from-australia","fields":{"headline":"British second world war veteran, 92, facing deportation from Australia","bodyText":"A 92-year-old second world war veteran in ailing health is facing the threat of being deported to Britain from Australia after he was refused a resident’s visa. James Bradley and his wife, Peggie, 91, applied for permanent residency under the aged parent visa in 2007, when they moved to Sydney to join their daughter Sharon and her family. Both passed their medical examinations and were put on a waiting list. The Australian immigration department had warned that there could be waiting times of up to 30 years for the visa, for which only applicants aged 65 and over are eligible. “We knew there’d be a waiting list,” Peggie Bradley told the Guardian at home in Croydon, in Sydney’s inner west. “There’s obviously a lot of people wanting to come to Australia. But things just didn’t work out for us.” In 2014 she and James were told that they were nearing the head of the queue and were asked to undergo further tests. Peggie passed her second medical but James did not, after having suffered a fall in which he broke his collarbone and pelvis, affecting his mobility. He now uses a walking frame and is in the early stages of dementia. “The waiting, I think it’s had an effect on us all but mostly on my husband because he’s been so poorly,” Peggie said. Because they made a joint application, they are both at risk of being deported. She said there would be “serious repercussions” if they were told to leave. “My husband is too frail to undertake a 24-hour journey,” she said. “And he doesn’t want to do it anyway – he wants to stay here, where he’s always wanted to be.” An administrative tribunal in November upheld the original ruling, which was confirmed in February. The Bradley family has now escalated Peggie and James’s case to the office of the immigration minister with a compassionate appeal. A department spokesperson told the Guardian that their request for ministerial intervention had been received and was “being actively considered” but would not comment further. Sharon – who moved to Sydney in 2006 and was herself granted Australian citizenship only in September – said the process had been “incredibly stressful” for her parents. “The uncertainty affecting Dad’s immigration status is just weighing so heavily on him – he’s so worried about what will become of them, what will become of Peggie,” she said. “There are not many world war two veterans left and I feel Australia should be embracing him, rather than rejecting him. It’s just unthinkable that they would ask a 92-year-old veteran of the second world war to leave and go back to England.” James Bradley was based in Sydney while serving in the British Pacific fleet of the Royal Navy, fighting against Japan. Peggie said her husband “left his heart behind” in Australia when he returned to England after the war and had always intended to return. After 10 years settled in the country, Sydney was home. “The house is here,” Peggie said. “Our family are here. Our grandchildren are here. Our great-grandchildren are here. Everything, and everybody that we care for, is here. “Even if supposing my husband was well enough to go back to England, go back to what? Because we just uprooted and transferred here 10 years ago. “There’s nobody there, no home there.” Their son Stuart, one of Sharon’s two older brothers, was killed in a car accident at the age of 23. Their eldest, Duncan, died of cancer in 2005. In October 2007, Peggie and James – then in their early 80s – moved halfway around the world to be with Sharon, who had given birth to her daughter Karis five months before. Peggie collects her now nine-year-old granddaughter from school most days. The decision over their futures in Australia now rests with the assistant immigration minister. The ministerial intervention was a “final roll of the dice”, Sharon said, that she hoped would allow for some “humanity ... and a sense of decency” in the proceedings. “As I said in my letter of appeal, Dad failed to tick a number of boxes on a form in the Department of Immigration but those boxes don’t tell the history of a man, or the story of a man and his family,” she said. “It’s all so awful. The possibility that they could be asked to leave – it feels surreal.” Their last-ditch appeal was reported by the national Fairfax press (for which Sharon works as an associate editor) on Sunday and she and Peggie were hopeful that the media coverage would help their case. The ministerial office had contacted them on Monday to request supporting documentation. The supporting documents were due Wednesday but there had been no indication given of when they could expect a decision from the minister’s office: it could be weeks, months, or even years, Sharon Bradley said. “The weight of uncertainty ... would be crushing for anyone but it’s a terrible burden for people who are in their early 90s,” she said. “They don’t need to be wondering where they are going to be in four months’ or six months’ time. “It’s completely barbaric to place them under that pressure.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/mar/21/malcolm-turnbull-tries-to-contain-backlash-from-indigenous-and-ethnic-groups-over-18c","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-03-21T09:22:26Z","webTitle":"Malcolm Turnbull tries to contain backlash from Indigenous and ethnic minority groups over 18C","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/mar/21/malcolm-turnbull-tries-to-contain-backlash-from-indigenous-and-ethnic-groups-over-18c","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/mar/21/malcolm-turnbull-tries-to-contain-backlash-from-indigenous-and-ethnic-groups-over-18c","fields":{"headline":"Malcolm Turnbull tries to contain backlash from Indigenous and ethnic minority groups over 18C","bodyText":"The Turnbull government is expected to proceed with its controversial overhaul of the Racial Discrimination Act in the Senate on Wednesday, as the prime minister reached out to Indigenous and ethnic minority community leaders in an effort to contain a significant community backlash. The government confirmed on Tuesday it would attempt to remove the words offend, insult and humiliate from section 18C of the RDA and insert the word “harass” – a move that weakens the existing protections against race hate speech. While the controversial proposal appears certain to be blocked in the Senate, with the Nick Xenophon Team signalling opposition to changing the wording in the legislation, groups representing Indigenous Australians and a wide range of ethnic minorities have responded furiously, telling Guardian Australia the changes will validate and fuel racism against their communities. In the lead-up to Tuesday’s decision, and during a debate in the Coalition party room meeting, a number of moderate Liberal MPs defending marginal seats urged the government leadership to leave 18C alone and focus instead on overhauling the processes administered by the Australian Human Rights Commission to ensure vexatious cases don’t end up in court. Concetta Fierravanti-Wells, the minister for international development and the Pacific, warned during Tuesday’s party room debate that taking on 18C would hurt the government in ethnic minority communities and would invite a significant campaign against the government by the ALP at the next election. In an effort to contain the political damage from the decision to proceed on 18C, Turnbull made phone calls after question time to members of his Indigenous advisory group and to ethnic minority community leaders. Guardian Australia understands the government made the in-principle decision to proceed with both legislative and process changes on 10 March, just before the sudden death of the cartoonist Bill Leak, whose work became emblematic in the controversy. The cabinet on Monday night considered the bill the government intends to introduce to the Senate on Wednesday before taking that proposal to the Coalition party room for discussion and confirming its intentions publicly on Tuesday. With Labor intent on pursuing parliamentary attacks against the proposal, and the activist group GetUp preparing a ground campaign against the changes, it is clear the government wants prompt consideration of the 18C proposal. Indigenous, ethnic minority and faith groups are now turning their attention to the Senate, preparing for an intense lobbying effort to ensure, as the Ethnic Communities Council puts it, that “common sense prevails”. Xenophon told Guardian Australia on Tuesday night the NXT would stand firm against any changes to 18C but would support changes to the processes administered by the AHRC to stop frivolous complaints going forward. Unless Xenophon changes his mind, the government will lack the requisite parliamentary numbers to make the change. The National Congress of Australia’s First Peoples described the government’s proposal as an embarrassment to the nation. The congress co-chair, Rod Little, pledged to stand with ethnic minority groups to fight the reforms, as he did last time changes to 18C were floated under Tony Abbott’s leadership. “I think the message this sends is that certain sections of privileged persons want further privilege to insult, be racist, or prejudiced to others who are generally defenceless,” Little said. “To me that is embarrassing for a nation that is supposedly built on principles of a fair go and equality.” The Lebanese Muslim Association expressed dismay at the government’s position, saying it would “inflame racist attitudes” and “embolden their vilification and discrimination in a Trump-like manner”. The association said the government failed to understand the extent of racism in Australian society. “Our community continues to be the target of disparaging and disgusting attacks based on their background and this kind of announcement will only aggravate their current struggles,” a spokesman said. “We look to our government for leadership and strength in the face of discrimination, and not an ideological machine intent on stripping protection against hate in the name of a far-right ideal. “The LMA hopes the Senate, especially the crossbenchers, will understand the mistake the government has made in kowtowing to racists and bigots, and stand up against the normalisation of hate.” The Ethnic Communities Council said the cabinet’s position was incongruous with the government’s statement in support of multiculturalism on Monday. The council’s Western Australian president, Ramdas Sankaran, said the reforms were supported largely by Anglo-Saxon males, who had no ability to understand what it was like to experience discrimination. “In Australia, across whatever sector you’re talking about, disability, aged care, Indigenous – they all talk about the importance of lived experience in terms of decision-making,” Sankaran said. “The vast majority of people involved in this are white Anglo-Saxon males who have been the largest perpetrators of racism in this country. “They don’t realise how difficult it is particularly when you’re from a new and emerging community. “To be spat at and that is what is happening … and these guys want to give more licence to them. It’s absolute nonsense.” The Chinese Australian Forum has been campaigning against the changes for years and campaigned against Pauline Hanson when she was first elected in 1996. The forum’s president, Kenrick Cheah, said Turnbull’s announcement on Tuesday sent a clear message to the community. “You’re letting children know that it’s OK to make fun and humiliate on the basis of people’s race and colour,” he said. “It’s preposterous as a society we should be moving away from that. Yet it’s 2017, with a PM who is supposed to be very moderate, and we’re actually trying to change laws to make it easier for racists to hurt people.” Most organisations welcomed the clarification of the Australian Human Rights Commission’s complaints handling process. That included the Australia/Israel and Jewish Affairs Council, who said the changes would help reduce procedural inequities But the council’s executive director, Colin Rubenstein, said he remain opposed to any change to 18C. “We certainly see no justification for changing 18C which we believed has worked well,” Rubenstein said. “The truth is that it would unleash another bout of litigation to work out what the new terms mean.” Asked whether the council would now lobby senators against the changes, Rubenstein said: “We have been heavily involved in the debate all along, our views are well known. And I’m sure when called by people like you we’ll continue to put our views.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/live/2017/mar/21/death-martin-mcguinness-reaction-politics-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-03-21T17:29:43Z","webTitle":"Scottish parliament debates call for second independence referendum - Politics live","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2017/mar/21/death-martin-mcguinness-reaction-politics-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/live/2017/mar/21/death-martin-mcguinness-reaction-politics-live","fields":{"headline":"Scottish parliament debates call for second independence referendum - Politics live","bodyText":"Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland’s first minister, has opened a debate in the Scottish parliament on her call for a second independence referendum by challenging the UK government to offer its own timetable for a vote if it won’t accept hers. (See 4.11pm.) The debate will conclude tomorrow afternoon, and it is expected that MSPs will back the motion (see 2.05pm.) The SNP and the Scottish Greens are voting in favour, but Conservative, Labour and Lib Dem MSPs are against. The UK government has announced a sweeping new cabin ban on all laptops and tablets on inbound flights from six Middle East countries – regulations that are wider than similar US restrictions. The European Union will not hold its first Brexit summit until 29 April, a month after Theresa May triggers article 50, underlining how Britain will no longer be in control of the process. Martin McGuinness, the former IRA chief of staff and a key figure in the Northern Ireland peace process, has died just two months after stepping down as deputy first minister. We posted many tributes to McGuinness earlier in the day. Here are two more worth noting. David Trimble, the former Ulster Unionist Northern Ireland first minister, released this letter he sent to McGuinness before he died. And Bill Clinton, the former American president, posted a tribute on his website. Clinton said McGuinness “believed in a shared future, and refused to live in the past, a lesson all of us who remain should learn and live by.” The Financial Conduct Authority and fraud police will examine allegations that Britain’s high street banks processed nearly $740m from a vast money laundering operation run by Russian criminals, a Treasury minister has told MPs.

Two of the private companies that provide 50% of probation services in England and Wales have confirmed to MPs they will have to consider quitting if a Ministry of Justice review fails to deliver improvements. That’s all from me for today. Thanks for the comments. Here are some more extracts from the debate. The tweets are from the BBC’s Philip Sim, who has a rather good take on what its like watching a debate when you know what the result will be (a vote in favour of the SNP motion when this ends, tomorrow afternoon.) The SNP’s Bruce Crawford The Conservative Adam Tomkins The SNP’s Richard Lochhead The Conservative’s John Lamont The SNP’s Ruth Maguire The Conservatives’ Douglas Ross The SNP’s Ash Denham Labour’s Alex Rowley The SNP’s Ivan McKee The Conservatives’ Donald Cameron Labour’s Jenny Marra The SNP has retweeted this tweet about what the Lib Dem Willie Rennie and the Conservative John Lamont have been saying in the debate. Here are the key points from the opening of the debate: Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland’s first minister, challenged the UK government to come up with its own referendum timetable if it refused to accept hers. Opening the debate, and moving the SNP motion calling for a referendum between autumn 2018 and spring 2019 (see 2.05pm), she said she was willing to discuss a possible alternative with Theresa May. Let me make this clear – if the UK government disagrees with that timeframe, then they should set out a clear alternative and the rationale for it. As I have said in recent days, I am, within reason, happy to have that discussion to see if we can find common ground that I can then propose to this parliament. Sturgeon rejected repeated claims from opposition MSPs that the SNP did not have a mandate for a second referendum. Its manifesto specifically talked about the need for a second referendum if there were a material change of circumstances, she said. The suggestion that an emphatic election victory on the basis of a clear manifesto commitment and a parliamentary majority on an issue does not provide a mandate begs the question, what does? She said Brexit would probably turn out to be harsher than many people, including leave supporters, expected. The probability is that our exit taking us outside the single market will be on harder and harsher terms than most people, including many Leave voters, would have supported in the run-up to last June’s referendum. She claimed that she was only proposing a second referendum because the UK government had not tried to accommodate her demand for Scotland to remain in the single market after Brexit. But commentators expressed some scepticism about her claim that she did not want to be in this position. This is from the i’s Chris Green. ITV’s Peter MacMahon also points out that some MSPs found it hard to accept her claim that she was not motivated by party political concerns. Ruth Davidson, the Scottish Conservative leader, accused Sturgeon of going back on her promise not to push for a second referendum unless public opinion changed. Support for independence had not increased, Davidson said. Never mind though. In the SNP, you don’t even need to acknowledge old promises, still less honour them. Instead, we are told today to forget about what was once said and instead submit to the SNP’s will. Well, we don’t. And we won’t. Sturgeon countered this point by saying the SNP’s manifesto made it clear that a change in circumstances, and not just a change in public opinion, could justify a second referendum. Davidson also criticised the SNP for not be willing to reach agreement with Westminster over the terms of a second referendum, arguing that this was not the approach it adopted before the 2014 poll. Furthermore, the SNP wants to unilaterally decide on the rules and the timing of the referendum. We now know there is no agreement between the UK and Scottish governments on the prospect of this referendum. I remind the SNP today that they once described the last referendum, with the Edinburgh agreement, with unanimous backing in this chamber, with 92% support across the public, as the ‘gold standard’ approach. This today, this is not the gold standard – it’s a tinpot approach to the biggest decision we could ever be asked to make. And she also said that the SNP could not insist on the UK government complying with a Scottish parliament vote because it often ignored Scottish parliament votes itself. She said this had happened five times in the last six months, such as when the Scottish parliament voted to scrap the controversial Offensive Behaviour at Football Act. Why do they exclaim that the Westminster government should recognise votes in the Scottish parliament when the Scottish government does not do so? Stephen Daisley, a Scottish journalist often very critical of the SNP, says it was Davidson’s most powerful speech for years. But the nationalist Wings Over Scotland website mocked her stance. Labour’s Kezia Dugdale accused Sturgeon of being obsessed with independence to the exclusion of matters like education. She said: Nicola Sturgeon wakes up every single day thinking of ways to engineer another referendum. Because leaving the UK is the only thing that matters to her. It isn’t improving education in Scotland. It isn’t lifting children out of poverty. It’s independence. That will always come first and it always has. She also claimed that independence would make Scotland poorer. Now, I hate what the Tories are doing to Britain. I’ve never felt anger like it. Their austerity programme is destroying public services that we all value and the poorest rely on. But the SNP cannot escape from the facts. Leaving the UK would make things much worse for the poorest people in Scotland. Patrick Harvie, the Green party co-convenor, who is backing the SNP motion, said delaying a referendum until after 2019 would be a mistake. He said: The idea of delaying this until after 2019 after we’ve been given the opportunity to see how our new relationship with Europe is working fundamentally misrepresents leaving the EU as something good instead of the act of political wreckage that it is. Autumn 2018 will be after the negotiations conclude when there is clarity about the arrangements. A deal negotiated by a UK government Scotland didn’t choose, with an EU institution on which Scotland is no longer represented about Brexit which Scotland didn’t vote for either, and then a period of ratification by every other European country. That would leave the future of Scotland in the hands of everybody else in the whole of Europe, the citizens of Scotland the only people voiceless, voiceless, in that process. I don’t think that we can accept that, I won’t vote for it. Willie Rennie, the Scottish Lib Dem leader, accused the SNP of cynically shifting its position on EU membership. In his speech he said the SNP was not promising that in the referendum they would guarantee EU membership. He said Alex Salmond has said the SNP is after Efta (European free trade association) membership instead. So they will use the EU to get the referendum even though the referendum won’t get the EU. And we know the reason why; they are cynically courting the one in three independent supporters who backed Brexit. So they are prepared to use pro-Europeans to get a referendum but sell them out to win independence. It is low politics for narrow gain. Davidson claimed this point made MSPs feel embarrassed. Earlier, when Rennie rasied this point during Sturgeon’s speech, Sturgeon said the SNP was in favour of EU membership. She told Rennie: The SNP’s position in favour on membership of the European Union is clear and it is longstanding, and what is beyond any doubt is that if we do not become independent, then that membership of the EU is ended because we are taken out against our will. Rennie says the case for the union is not just an economic one. He says the UK has been a force for compassion, with one of the biggest aid budgets in the world. He says no Scottish nationalist will ever tell him he should be ashamed of that. And that’s it. The frontbench speeches are over. I will post a summary shortly. Rennie says Alex Salmond denied saying that the last referendum was a once in a lifetime opportunity. But there was a clip on YouTube of him saying that. And Salmond denied denying that he had said that, even though that was on YouTube too. He quotes from Alice in Wonderland. Alice asked: “How long is forever?” The white rabbit said it could just be one second. Rennie suggests the SNP’s stance is like this. Willie Rennie, the Scottish Lib Dem leader, is speaking now. Here is his amendment. As an amendment to motion S5M-04710 in the name of Nicola Sturgeon (Scotland’s Choice), leave out from “and therefore mandates” to end and insert “believes that a second referendum on Scottish independence would only compound the uncertainty of Brexit and its risk to the economy, environment and security; notes that all measures of public opinion show that there is no appetite for such a vote; further believes that there is no mandate for another Scottish independence referendum on the basis of the UK leaving the EU when there are no cast-iron guarantees that full membership of the EU will be sought or granted, and supports the development of a positive future for Scotland inside a federal UK.” He accuses Harvie of saying manifesto commitments do not count. That prompts angry jeering. This is what the Scottish Greens’ manifesto for the Scottish parliament elections said in 2016. Citizens should be able to play a direct role in the legislative process: on presenting a petition signed by an appropriate number of voters, citizens should be able to trigger a vote on important issues of devolved responsibility. As we proposed on the one year anniversary of the independence referendum, this is the Scottish Greens’ preferred way of deciding to hold a second referendum on independence. If a new referendum is to happen, it should come about by the will of the people, and not be driven by calculations of party political advantage. Harvie says leaving the EU is “an act of political wreckage”. He says other EU countries will get a vote on the Brexit deal. But under the UK government’s plans, the people of Scotland would be voiceless. They would be the only voiceless country in Europe, he says. He says that is not acceptable. Harvie says many leave campaigners said there was no threat to the UK’s place in the single market. Even Ruth Davidson said after the referendum that she wanted the UK to stay in the single market. He says her abandonment of that position has been “disgraceful”. He says young voters and foreigner were deliberately excluded from the EU referendum last year. But they should be allowed to vote on the future of the country they live in. He says the treatment of EU nationals in the UK has been particularly shabby. He says the Tory and Labour amendments both read like wishful thinking. Patrick Harvie, the Green party’s co-convenor in Scotland, is speaking now. Here is is amendment. As an amendment to motion S5M-04710 in the name of Nicola Sturgeon (Scotland’s Choice), insert at end “; believes that this gives people in Scotland a choice at a time when there is both the most information and most opportunity to act; further believes that 16 and 17-year-olds and EU citizens, who were excluded from the EU referendum, should be entitled to vote, and considers that this referendum is necessary given the Prime Minister’s decision to negotiate a hard exit from the EU, including leaving the single market, which conflicts with assurances given by the UK Government and prominent Leave campaigners, and which takes no account of the overwhelming Remain vote in Scotland.” He acknowledges that people have mixed feelings about a second referendum. He says 2014 was an expression of the will of the people. But so was 2016, he says. Dugdale says leaving the UK would make things worse for the poorest people in Scotland. In six years in this chamber she has never heard an argument to the contrary, she says. An SNP MSP, Kevin Stewart, says the Tories are making the poor poorer. Would Dugdale be happy to see the Tories in power for the next 10, 20, 30 years? Dugdale says independence would lead to turbo-charged austerity. Dugdale says Sturgeon says the referendum was not divisive. But Dugdale says from her conversations with people she knows it was. Every family and workplace was divided. And last Monday, when Sturgeon announced her call for a referendum, felt just as divisive as the final day of the last campaign. She says she believes in the union, as a living, breathing union of countries in the UK. Dugdale says the SNP used to say the will of the Scottish people should be respected. But it was expressed in 2014. More than 2m Scots voted to remain in the UK. That is the will of the Scottish people and that is what should be respected, she says. Kezia Dugdale, the Scottish Labour leader, is speaking now. Here is her amendment. As an amendment to motion S5M-04710 in the name of Nicola Sturgeon (Scotland’s Choice), leave out from “and therefore mandates” to end and insert “; believes that a strong Scottish Parliament within a federal UK would meet these needs; recognises that the overwhelming will of the Scottish people is that there should be no second divisive independence referendum; believes that far from giving Scots a choice, a second independence referendum would only increase uncertainty and cause greater division as the UK faces a hard Tory Brexit, and asserts that there should be no second independence referendum.” She says she wishes they were having a debate about education. But they are debating independence because that is all that matters to the SNP. Davidson says five times in the last six months the SNP government has ignored the wishes of the Scottish parliament. So why should the UK government recognise votes in the Scottish parliament when the Scottish government does not do so? Davidson says the SNP said the will of the people should drive a second referendum. But there is none, she says. She allows an intervention from Patrick Harvie, the Green co-convenor, saying he is going against his own manifesto. Harvie says the Tory manifesto said the UK would stay in the single market. Davidson says the government wants to keep access to the single market. Davidson says the SNP motion amounts to a “bulldozer” approach. That is not what happened in 2014, she says. She says the terms of that referendum were agreed in talks with Westminster. She says the SNP described the approach taken in 2014 as “the gold standard approach”. This is not the gold standard approach, she says. She accuses the SNP of rushing to any microphone “with the angry face on” and making the same old complaints. It won’t work, she says. She says most people in Scotland are sick and tired of these old games. She says Brexit will pose challenges. Why start an independence campaign now when we don’t know how it will play out? And the SNP cannot answer basic questions, such as what the currency will be. The first minister wants a date, but she cannot give us a plan. Ruth Davidson, the Scottish Conservative leader, is speaking now. Here is Davidson’s amendment. As an amendment to motion S5M-04710 in the name of Nicola Sturgeon (Scotland’s Choice), leave out from “acknowledges” to end and insert “declines the Scottish Government’s proposal for a referendum on independence before April 2019; believes that it would be unfair to ask this question while the process of leaving the EU is still ongoing and while the Scottish Government has failed to set out its own position on independence; considers that no referendum should take place while there is no public or political consent for one, and urges the Scottish Government to focus its efforts on working with the UK Government to secure the best possible new relationship with the EU.” She says the SNP is prioritising independence, not education. She quotes Nicola Sturgeon saying on various occasions in the past she was opposed to a second referendum. Sturgeon says she should consider what was in the SNP’s referendum. Davidson says she is coming to that. She quotes Sturgeon saying there would be no referendum if support for independence did not increase. The latest polling shows it has not increased, she says. Sturgeon says there is a fundamental decision to be taken. It can only be made by the people, she says. And that’s it. Her speech is over. Sturgeon says the SNP will set out its plans for independence, so people can make an informed choice. She says that is in contrast to Brexit, where people were not told what it would involve, and where nine months later people still do not know what it will be like. Sturgeon says the Scottish parliament should take the decision over the timing of the referendum. She says the latest time for a referendum should be around the time the UK leaves, in the spring of 2019. If the UK government disagrees, it should set out an alternative timescale, she says. She says she is prepared to discuss an alternative. Sturgeon challenges UK government to set out its alternative timetable for a second referendum. Sturgeon says she understands why many Scots don’t want another referendum. But the alternative is to drift through the next two years, hoping for the best, but fearing for the worst. Scotland would have to accept a hard Brexit, she says. And Scotland would not then have the option to reject that. Sturgeon says the UK government rejected her compromise plan for the single market. And it has also refused to commit to giving repatriated powers from Brussels to Scotland, she says. She says the Tories could be in power in Westminster until 2030. So Scotland should decide what future it wants, she says. Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland’s first minister, is opening the debate. She says that she offered the UK government a compromise plan that would keep Scotland in the single market after Brexit. The UK government refused that, she says. She says the SNP’s manifesto said a second referendum would be justified if there was a material change in circumstances. Brexit qualifies, she says. She says she did not immediately call for a second referendum after the Brexit vote on 23 June. Ruth Davidson, the Scottish Conservative leader, says she heard Sturgeon on the radio that morning saying she had asked civil servants to draw up legislation. Sturgeon says she said at the time she would seek a compromise first. The Scottish parliament is now debating Nicola Sturgeon’s call for a second independence referendum. Here is the motion. That the parliament acknowledges the sovereign right of the Scottish people to determine the form of government best suited to their needs and therefore mandates the Scottish government to take forward discussions with the UK government on the details of an order under section 30 of the Scotland Act 1998 to ensure that the Scottish parliament can legislate for a referendum to be held that will give the people of Scotland a choice over the future direction and governance of their country at a time, and with a question and franchise, determined by the Scottish parliament, which would most appropriately be between the autumn of 2018, when there is clarity over the outcome of the Brexit negotiations, and around the point at which the UK leaves the EU in spring 2019. And here is a verdict on the UQ from my colleagues Luke Harding and Nick Hopkins. Labour politicians were clearly unimpressed by assurances from Simon Kirby that the government has got a grip on money laundering. It hasn’t. Today’s Guardian Laundromat story shows how profound the problem is: $740m flowed through UK banks and nobody noticed. Kirby said that the National Crime Agency (NCA) was investigating. But when we went to see the NCA last week it admitted Moscow was refusing to cooperate. Without active help from Russian authorities it’s difficult to see how detectives can arrest money launderers or stop similar schemes in future. For the moment, then, it’s easy for anyone to set up a UK limited company and use it for criminal purposes. This point was made by the SNP’s Roger Mullin who noted – correctly – that limited partnerships were at the heart of the Laundromat scandal. One of the companies we found, Seabon Limited, claimed its assets were £1. In fact, it was involved in transactions worth $9bn. The most intriguing question came from Labour’s Ben Bradshaw, who wanted to know if any of the Laundromat billions had gone to fund the Trump campaign or Leave.EU. We don’t know the answer. But there are clear signs that some of the money has gone to support pro-Kremlin thinktanks and parties across Europe. Recently it was revealed that Simon Kirby, the City minister, had been stripped of his responsibility for Brexit-related matters. A City source told the Sun that Kirby was someone with “no knowledge, no experience and no apparent interest in the City”. Kirby did not do much to restore his reputation with his response to today’s UQ. He floundered badly, prompting unusually harsh criticism from the oppositon. Here are the key points. Labour accused the government of “complacency and inaction” over money-laundering. John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, told MPs after hearing Kirby’s opening statement: I don’t believe the minister recognises the immense gravity of the situation we are facing and that statement reflected, I believe, a complacency on behalf of the government itself ... Money-laundering through London and elsewhere threatens the financial stability of our economy ... It obvious from today’s revelations that the current arrangements are not working. There is widespread, organised and sophisticated criminal activity ... Urgent action is needed by the government to protect the standing of our finance sector and indeed protect our economy. Complacency and inaction is not good enough. Later other Labour MPs criticised Kirby very strongly. John Mann said he gave the impression of being over-promoted. (See 12.53pm.) Angela Eagle said he was “appallingly complacent”. (See 1.04pm.) Rushanara Ali also said his performance was “appalling”. (See 1.08pm.) McDonnell called for an inquiry into what measures might be needed to strengthen money-laundering laws. Kirby said the latest Guardian allegations would be investigated. The Financial Conduct Authority and the National Crime Agency take any such allegations seriously and will investigate closely whether recent information from the Guardian newspaper regarding money laundering from Russia, or indeed any other media source, would allow the progression of an investigation. He claimed the government was doing “more than any other” to tackle money-laundering. This government already does more than any other to tackle the global threat of money-laundering. Since 2010 we have already seized £1.bn in illegal funds and put hundreds of millions more beyond the reach of criminals. We have set up the Panama Papers taskforce, we have hosted the global anti-corruption summit last year and now we are preparing the most significant changes to our anti money-laundering and terrorist finances regime in over a decade ... We are determined to make the UK the most difficult place in the world for international crime networks to channel their finances and we won’t relent in our efforts to do that. On Tuesday morning, Theresa May told a cabinet meeting that the triggering of article 50 next Wednesday would be a “historic event and will precipitate a shift in our role in the world see Britain begin a bold new chapter as a prosperous, open and global nation.” No 10 said the prime minister had told cabinet ministers that the letter would be “one of the most important docs in our country’s recent history and will start to deliver the result of the referendum and set the tone for our new relationship with Europe and the world.” The content has not been finalised and was not discussed, the spokesman said. A meeting of the cabinet will be held next Wednesday, the day of notification, to discuss the letter, he said. During the meeting, May stressed her desire to come to a swift agreement on the rights of EU citizens living in the EU and those of British citizens in the EU, the spokesman said, as well as praising the work of the cabinet sub-committee on exit and trade, calling it a “strong platform” from which to start negotiations. May said she expected negotiations to be “smooth and orderly, giving certainty to individuals and businesses and allowing us to make preparation that will see an independent UK prospering outside the EU.” A white paper on the great repeal bill, which will migrate existing EU laws directly into British law after the UK leaves the EU, is expected to be published by David Davis shortly after the letter is sent next week. Labour’s Rushanara Ali says Philip Hammond, the chancellor, should have been here. She says Kirby’s answers have been “appalling”. Kirby says he is sorry that Ali thinks that. And that’s it. The UQ is over. I will post a summary shortly. Labour’s Kerry McCarthy says the Russian authorities are refusing to cooperate with the National Crime Agency. What is the Foreign Office doing about this? Kirby says he thinks the FCA are in contact with the Foreign Office about this. He says if there is new information, the FCA and the NCA will act on it. Here is Labour’s Angela Eagle, who asked Kirby a question earlier (see 12.51pm), responding to his performance. Labour’s Ian Austin says the home affairs committee has estimated that £100bn is laundered through the UK. But only 0.17% of it gets detected. What is necessary to make the authorities do their jobs? Kirby says the FCA and the NCA are independent. They do investigate, he says. The Lib Dem’s Greg Mulholland asks what will happen if the government secures its aim of turning the UK into a tax haven. Kirby says that is not the chancellor’s policy. Labour’s Catherine McKinnell asks if Kirby accepts that the law on money-laundering needs to be tightened. Kirby says the Ministry of Justice will have heard what McKinnell said. Labour’s Ben Bradshaw asks if any laundered money was donated to the leave campaign or to the Trump campaign. Kirby says he is not aware of any donations of that kind. Philip Hollobone, a Conservative, asks how many money launderers have been sent to prison in the past five years. Kirby says he does not know, but will write to Hollobone with an answer. Jonathan Djanogly, a Conservative, says Russians are allowed into the UK on the assumption they will do nothing wrong. Kirby says the authorities will address any action that needs to be taken to tackle this problem. Labour’s Helen Goodman asks if Kirby has discussed this with George Osborne, who intervened with the US authorities to stop HSBC being prosecuted in 2012. Kirby says he has not had that conversation. Labour’s John Mann asks Kirby to counter the impression that he has been promoted beyond his competence by telling MPs which British banks have been accused of money laundering, and what he has learned from reading those reports. John Bercow, the Speaker, says the question was discourteous, but not disorderly. Kirby says a number of firms have been investigated. Angela Eagle, the former shadow business secretary, says Kirby has shown “real complacency” about this scandal. His answers are not good enough. Kirby rejects this, he says. We have world-leading regulation and world-leading financial services. The SNP’s Roger Mullin says at the heart of this scandal is the use of limited partnerships. He says on Friday the business department closed its review of limited partnerships. Will that now be reopened so that Mullin and others can submit fresh evidence, based on the latest revelations? He says it is hard to believe the UK is a world leader. And he says the government should do more to encourage whistleblowing. Kirby says, in this case, he does not think limited partnerships were involved. But he says any MP is free to write to the secretary of state. We are world leaders in this, he says. Kirby is responding to McDonnell. He rejects the charge of complacency. And he suggests that it would not be appropriate for the government to tell the FCA and the NCA what they must investigate. John McDonnell is responding. He says he does not think Kirby realises the seriousness of these allegations. He accuses him of being complacent. He says HSBC has previously faced money-laundering allegations. Money laundering threatens the stability of our economy, he says. Can Kirby give MPs more details about what steps are being taken to address this? Could there be criminal proceedings? This is in effect a criminal network, says McDonnell. He says the main risk comes from inactivity. The government should ensure British banks are clean and fit for purpose. The Financial Conduct Authority stresses the need for banks to self-police. It is obvious this is not happening, he says. He asks the government to commit to an inquiry into this. And, when the government owns banks, especially RBS, can it ensure taxpayers its banks are not involved in criminal activity. McDonnell accuses the government of “complacency and inaction” over money laundering. John McDonnell asks for a statement. Simon Kirby, the City minister, is responding. He says he wants the UK to take a lead in the drive against money laundering. This is to keep Britons safe. He says the authorities take any such allegations seriously. The allegations in the Guardian will be investigated, he says. He says the government is doing more than any other to tackle the threat posed by money laundering. He lists measures taken by the government and says reforms being introduced are the most serious for a decade. He says the UK is working closely with international partners to address this problem. We are determined to make the UK the most difficult place in the world for international crime networks to channel their money, he says. Here is our latest story on this topic. John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, is asking the urgent question. Here is the Guardian’s main story yesterday about the Global Laundromat scheme. We are about to get a Commons urgent question on the Guardian’s revelations about the Global Laundromat. We revealed that Russian criminals with links to the Kremlin laundered $20bn … and that much of this cash ended up in Britain. The UK’s high street banks handled $740m in dirty money from Moscow. Even worse, most of the shell companies used in the fraud were UK ones, registered at Companies House in London. David Cameron’s much-vaunted anti-corruption summit last summer was meant to tackle offshore secrecy, and the fact that anonymous companies were used to own assets in the UK, especially real estate. Since then, not much appears to have changed. The Laundromat features about 70,000 banking transactions, with billions simply vanishing into opaque UK companies. The questions for the government are: 1) What does the Treasury intend to do to stop the UK being used as the world’s pre-eminent money-laundering destination? 2) Will the National Crime Agency and other financial regulators investigate? 3) when will the government begin prosecuting the UK intermediaries – lawyers, accountants, company formation agents – who facilitate money-laundering and other financial crimes? And, while we’re on the subject of Tom Watson, the Unite general secretary Len McCluskey has hit back at him for what he said about McCluskey yesterday with an article for Huffington Post. It’s strong stuff. Here’s an excerpt: There is another world in our movement, alas. A world of skulduggery, smears and secret plots. That is where you will find Tom Watson. When Labour has needed loyalty he has been sharpening his knife looking for a back to stab. When unity is required, he manufactures division. It is small surprise that he has then worked to split the party again this week. He has form as long as his arm. And now his sights are set on abusing the internal democracy of Unite. As the Guardian reports, 76 MPs - mostly, but not exclusively, Tory pro-leave campaigners - have signed a letter to the BBC complaining about its Brexit coverage. They are particularly angry about what they dub “despite Brexit” coverage, by which they seem to mean reporting that pre-supposes Brexit will damage the economy. (Growth and employment figures have been positive since last June, and claims that a leave vote would trigger an immediate downturn turned out to be wrong, but it remains the case that most economists think that when the UK does leave the EU there will be a hit to growth in the short and medium term.) Here is an extract from the letter containing the MPs’ key arguments. We know many leave-voting constituents have felt their view have been unfairly represented. This phenomenon is weakening the BBC’s bond with the 52% who voted leave and all who wish to make a success of the decision made. In particular, the corporation’s focus on ‘regretful’ leave voters, despite there being no polling shift towards remain since the referendum, has led some to believe it is putting its preconceptions before the facts. Meanwhile the posturing and private opinions of EU figures are too often presented as facts, without the vital context that they are talking tough ahead of the exit negotiations. It particularly pains us to see how much of the economic good news we’ve had since June has been skewed by BBC coverage which seems unable to break out of pre-referendum pessimism and accept new facts. Some of the signatories of this letter shared many of the concerns about theeconomic impact of Brexit, but all are delighted to find forecasts of immediate economic harm were at best misplaced. So-called ‘despite Brexit’ reporting may be expected of a partisan press, but licence fee-payers have the right to expect better ... BBC coverage also shapes international perceptions of the UK: we fear that, by misrepresenting our country either as xenophobic or regretful of the leave vote, the BBC will undermine our efforts to carve out a new, global role for this country. Here is the Guardian’s story about it. You can read the full text of the letter here, on the website of Julian Knight, the Conservative MP and former BBC and Independent journalist who coordinated it. He voted remain. In response Tom Watson, Labour’s deputy leader and the shadow culture secretary, has urged the government to stand up for the BBC. In a statement he said: The BBC is one of the world’s finest news broadcasters and we should all value its impartiality, integrity and balanced coverage. It is the BBC’s job to report the facts, not to be a cheerleader for any cause or party. All politicians sometimes dislike the way some stories are covered, but we should never seek to interfere with the independence of the BBC by publicly accusing it of bias and making implicit threats about its future. Theresa May and Karen Bradley must make clear their commitment to the independence of the BBC and distance themselves from attacks on it by politicians who have an agenda the BBC does not and should not share. Nick Robinson, the Today presenter and former BBC political editor, has also leapt to the corporation’s defence. De Volkskrant, a respected Dutch newspaper, has published a long article about the negotiating strategy the EU will adopt during Brexit. It appears under the headline: Dit is de geheime EU-strategie voor scheiding van de Britten or, as Google Translate puts it, This is the secret EU Strategy for separation from the British And that article says it is based on information provided by insiders about what it says is the draft negotiating strategy that has been drawn up. It says these will come out when Theresa May presses the “Brexitknop” (Brexit button). Based on feeding it through Google Translate, here are the key points. The EU will insist access to the internal market depends upon accepting the four freedoms, including freedom of movement, de Volkskrant claims. The EU will propose a deal guaranteeing the reciprocal rights of EU nationals in the UK and Britons in EU countries, de Volkskrant claims. The EU will demand an exit “bill”, de Volkskrant claims. Interestingly, it says that David Cameron is partly responsible for the possible demand being so high. Cameron demanded cuts to the EU budget for 2014-20. But, in return for spending going down in the early years, planned spending in the future rose sharply. There is an argument now that the UK is obliged to contribute to those future spending commitments. The EU will demand that the UK loses some of its existing trade advantages, de Volkskrant claims. The EU has yet to decide whether to allow talks on the withdrawal deal and talks on the future trade deal to take place in parallel, as the UK wants, or sequentially, de Volkskrant says. If the UK tries to leave without a deal, the EU could take it to court at the Hague to try to recover the money it thinks is owed, de Volkskrant says. Only six people, including Donald Tusk, the European council president, and Jean-Claude Juncker, the European commission president, have seen the 10-page draft negotiating guidelines, de Volkskrant claims. This is what Donald Tusk, president of the European council, said at his press conference about the special EU summit. In view of what was announced in London yesterday I would like to inform you that I will call a European council on Saturday 29 April to adopt the guidelines for the Brexit talks. I personally wish the UK hadn’t chosen to leave the EU. But the majority of British voters decided otherwise. Therefore we must to do everything we can to make the process of divorce the least painful for the EU. Our main priority for the negotiations must be to create as much certainty and clarity as possible for all citizens, companies and member states that will be negatively affected by Brexi, as well as our important partners and friends around the world. And here are the key points. Tusk calls special summit for Saturday 29 April where the EU 27 (the countries not leaving) will decide their Brexit negotiating strategy. He says he wants to make the process “the least painful for the EU”. He says his priority will be to create “as much certainty and clarity” for people, organisations and countries negatively affected by Brexit. Tusk clearly did not get the memo from Theresa May about why she thinks Brexit is not a divorce. And he clearly did not get the memo either from the 76 MPs, mostly pro-leave Tories, who have written to the BBC complaining about “despite Brexit” reporting - ie, reporting that presupposes Brexit will have negative consequences. Donald Tusk, the president of the European council, has just announced at a press conference in Brussels that he will call a summit of the 27 other EU countries on Saturday 29 April where they can consider their response to Theresa May’s triggering of article 50. I will post his quotes shortly. Here is Donald Tusk, the president of the European council, on Martin McGuinness. John Bruton, who was taoiseach from 1994 to 1997, has said he is sorry Martin McGuinness did not live to see complete reconciliation in Northern Ireland. He said: Notwithstanding our profound political differences, I always found him to be a very friendly person and easy to talk to. The good and warm personal relationship he developed with Ian Paisley set a very good example. But it has yet to be followed by a genuine political reconciliation between the two communities they represented. It is sad that Martin will not be around to complete the important task he undertook. Later this morning Donald Tusk, president of the European council, is due to give the date when the other members of the EU will agree and announce their response to Theresa May triggering article 50. I’ll cover that as soon as it happens. Alex Salmond, the former Scottish first minister, has issued a tribute recalling his visit to the Northern Ireland assembly in 2007 to express support for Ian Paisley and Martin McGuinness’s power-sharing administration. Here’s an extract: I gladly did so and found a remarkable partnership, which was the anchor of the institutions consolidating the peace process . The friendship which developed between them was real, enduring and profound, private as well as public and allowed Northern Ireland to move away from violence. They were both solid and continuing friends of Scotland. And Alastair Campbell’s assessment of Martin McGuinness for the Guardian is well worth reading too. Here it is in full: And here is an extract. At various moments during the years of negotiations that followed, Sinn Féin would frequently be exasperating, and some of us would lose our patience. Tony once suggested we should be a little more sympathetic to their difficulties, pointing out that they were going about this business with a not unreasonable fear that someone might put a bullet in their heads even for talking to us. Whenever there is a terrorist attack politicians and media will rise as one to call it “a cowardly act”. But that means we should acknowledge the flipside too: what Martin McGuinness and the Sinn Féin leadership did in negotiating for peace took courage. Once he decided to make the change to pursuing democracy – and I believe he did so some years before New Labour came on the scene – I think he genuinely made the change. As time went on I saw somebody very different from the murderous hardman IRA commander image. I saw someone was was very human, very likeable, and dedicated to making the new path he had chosen work for the people he represented. Here is my colleague Henry McDonald’s assessment of Martin McGuinness. And here is an extract. Trimble said he continued to monitor McGuinness’ career after he had left Northern Ireland. McGuinness’ capacity to seek compromise endured in the year running up to his death, Trimble acknowledged. He added: “I heard recently from a very senior government minister in Downing Street that they had to call in McGuinness last year to act as a peacemaker between London and the Scots Nats! “On the joint ministerial council between the devolved governments of Edinburgh, Cardiff and Belfast – in cooperation with the national government in London – there was a lot of shouting, a lot of bad blood. It was caused by the Scottish nationalists roaring and ranting against central government representatives who eventually called in McGuinness for help. “By contrast Martin McGuinness was calm and rational, and he helped turn down the temperature at that meeting.” Here’s the Guardian’s obituary of Martin McGuinness. While Enda Kenny has led the warm tributes to Martin McGuinness among the Irish Republic’s political establishment there are a discordant voices in southern Ireland pointing out his record. Austin Stack’s prison officer father was murdered by the IRA in 1984 in the Irish Republic. His son has led a dogged campaign to demand the truth about what happened to his father and has personally confronted McGuinness about the murder in the past as did the son of an Irish Army soldier, Patrick Kelly, whom the IRA also killed in the 1980s. Stack, as spokesperson for the Independent Victims and Survivors Coalition, had this to say this morning on McGuinness’ legacy: While acknowledging Martin McGuinness’s passing it think it’s entirely appropriate to focus on all his legacy, not just the last few years. Let’s today remember McGuinness never acknowledged his many victims and in fact told Pte Paddy Kelly’s son “just move on you”. Pte Kelly was a brave Irish soldier who was rescuing Don Tidey when he was gunned down, the man who shot him stood over him and said “take that you Free State Bastard”. McGuinness had serious questions to answer regarding the Claudy bombing and Enniskillen bombing where many innocent civilians were murdered. He also is directly responsible for death of Frank Hegarty, a young man the IRA had exiled and who McGuinness told to come home only for him to be murdered within days. This is the real legacy of Martin McGuinness, he took what he knew about each of these cases to his grave. We should look at his real legacy in its totality. Bertie Ahern, who was taoiseach at the time of the Good Friday agreement, has told Ireland’s RTE Radio that Martin McGuinness was a good person. He was a good person, in my view. He moved from a very difficult past where he took a particular side and he was a good person to negotiate with and certainly I considered him as a good friend as we went through 25 years of discussions. Ahern also said McGuinness had the ability to compromise. In negotiations when there is a lot at stake and it can’t be winner takes all Martin understood compromise. He listened and he was able, I think, to arbitrate between different points of view. Lord Tebbit, the former Conservative party chairman whose wife Margaret was paralysed when the IRA bombed the Grand hotel in Brighton during the Conservative party conference, and who was injured himself by the attack, has welcomed McGuinness’s death. He told the Press Association: I’m just pleased that the world is a sweeter and cleaner place now. He was not only a multi-murderer, he was a coward. He knew that the IRA were defeated because British intelligence had penetrated right the way up to the army council and that the end was coming. He then sought to save his own skin and he knew that it was likely he would be charged before long with several murders, which he had personally committed, and he decided that the only thing to do was to opt for peace. He claimed to be a Roman Catholic. I hope that his beliefs turn out to be true and he’ll be parked in a particularly hot and unpleasant corner of hell for the rest of eternity. Tebbit said he refused to forgive McGuinness for his terrorist past because “forgiveness requires confession of sins and repentance”. “There was none of that,” Tebbit added. Jeremy Corbyn has posted a tribute to Martin McGuinness on Twitter. John Simpson, the BBC’s world affairs editor, tweeted this about Martin McGuinness earlier. Simpson was a correspondent for the BBC in Belfast in the 1970s and he has just been talking about McGuinness on the Today programme. He recalled being followed by McGuinness at one point in a Republican area at a time when McGuinness was known as “the butcher of Bogside”. Simpson said he was “absolutely terrified”. James Brokenshire, the Northern Ireland secretary, has offered his condolences to Martin McGuinness’s family. His full tribute is here, on the department’s website, and here is an extract. Whilst passionate and robust in his politics, on a personal level I always found Martin to be thoughtful and reflective and appreciated the personal consideration he showed. The importance of family and his home in Derry shone through. Martin will be remembered for his contribution to politics in Northern Ireland and particularly during his near ten years as deputy first minister. Tim Farron, the Lib Dem leader, has highlighted Martin McGuinness’s meeting with the Queen in his tribute to the former deputy first minister. Farron said: Martin McGuinness, for all his past, became a statesman. One moment sticks with me, the remarkable – and unlikely – images of McGuinness’ when he shook the hand of the Queen on her visit to Belfast in 2012. This single picture epitomised the changes in Northern Ireland. The historic handshake with the Queen in the quest for peace. This is something I, and millions of others, are thankful for. Peace in Northern Ireland is down, in part, to his leadership of the Republican community. The Irish taoiseach, Enda Kenny, has issued this tribute to Martin McGuinness. I was deeply saddened to hear of the death of Martin McGuinness today. His passing represents a significant loss, not only to politics in Northern Ireland but to the wider political landscape on this island and beyond. Martin will always be remembered for the remarkable political journey that he undertook in his lifetime. Not only did Martin come to believe that peace must prevail, he committed himself to working tirelessly to that end. Martin was one of the chief architects of the Good Friday agreement and he worked resolutely in the years that followed it in pursuit of its full implementation. I got to know Martin well in recent years, including through our working together in the North South ministerial council. His commitment to securing enduring peace and prosperity for all of the people of Northern Ireland was unwavering throughout this time. He strove to make Northern Ireland a better place for everyone, regardless of background or tradition. Above all, today is an especially sad day for Martin’s family - his wife Bernie, and his children - and for the people of Derry, who held a special place in Martin’s heart. My deepest sympathies are with all of them at this sad and difficult time. Q: What would you say to those who argued that the Good Friday agreement showed violence worked? Blair does not accept this. Q: But they are in power. But not through violence, says Blair. He says Sinn Fein are in power because they committed to peace. He says he hopes McGuinness’s life will remind people how important it is to remain committed to peace. Q: The settlement is at risk. Blair says the peace process is “fragile”. And it is at risk. Q: It is extraordinary that a former prime minister is saying we can draw inspiration from the life of a terrorist. It is, says Blair. But it shows that sometimes politics can work. And that’s it. The Blair interview is over. UPDATE: Here is some video. Tony Blair is being interviewed on Today now about Martin McGuinness. Q: When did you realise the IRA was willing to negotiate? Blair says the IRA ceasefire had broken down as Labour was coming into office in 1997. He says he met McGuinness then. McGuinness was clear that there was a stalemate, and that it was doing immense damage. He says McGuinness wanted to see if there was a way forward. John Humprhys is interviewing Blair. He was a correspondent in Northern Ireland in the 1970s and he says interviewing McGuinness then was frightening, because you could imagine him looking down the barrel of a gun. Blair says he can understand why people felt that. But he says the determination that McGuinness showed at that stage was also deployed when he committed himself to peace. He recalls his first proper meeting with McGuinness, in the cabinet room. McGuinness said this was where the damage was done. He explained that he meant the partition agreement, but Blair and his team thought they were talking about the IRA mortar attack. Blair says McGuinness thought pursuing peace was consistent with the motives behind the armed struggle. But he pursued it with courage, Blair says. He says if McGuinness had not been committed to the peace process, it would not have succeeded. Q: Did you for a moment think you should not have been speaking to him? Blair says he never forgot the victims of terrorism. But, when he thought there was a possibility of peace, he was determined to pursue it. He says without McGuinness they would never had got the Good Friday agreement. That was in 1998. But the peace was not fully agreed until just before he left office in 2007, when McGuinness formed a government with Ian Paisley. It was extraordinary, Blair says. If someone had said in 1997 that that would have happened, Blair says he would have thought they were completely mad. Hello. I’m Andrew Sparrow, taking over from Matthew and Claire. Gerry Kelly, a former IRA figure and a leading Sinn Féin politician, is on Today now, paying tribute to Martin McGuinness. He says he wants to explain what was happening when McGuinness was young. There was no democratic way forward for his community, Kelly says. He says later it became clear that there was a military stalemate. There was always a belief that the conflict would have to end. McGuinness showed “massive leadership”, Kelly says. He says, had he been born anywhere else, he would have been a huge figure, because he had that kind of intellect. The prime minister, Theresa May, has issued a statement saying that while she could “never condone the path he took in the earlier part of his life, Martin McGuinness ultimately played a defining role in leading the republican movement away from violence”. In doing so, he made an essential and historic contribution to the extraordinary journey of Northern Ireland from conflict to peace. While we certainly didn’t always see eye-to-eye even in later years, as deputy first minister for nearly a decade he was one of the pioneers of implementing cross-community power-sharing in Northern Ireland. He understood both its fragility and its precious significance and played a vital part in helping to find a way through many difficult moments. At the heart of it all was his profound optimism for the future of Northern Ireland – and I believe we should all hold fast to that optimism today. The former prime minister Tony Blair, who worked with McGuinness on the peace process, said he was sorry to learn of his death. ‎I grew up watching and hearing about the Martin McGuinness who was a leading member of the IRA engaged in armed struggle. I came to know the Martin McGuinness who set aside that armed struggle in favour of making peace. There will be some who cannot forget the bitter legacy of the war. And for those who lost loved ones in it that is completely understandable. But for those of us able finally to bring about the Northern Ireland peace agreement, we know we could never have done it without Martin’s leadership, courage and quiet insistence that the past should not define the future. After first meeting in Northern Ireland and then again shortly after in Downing Street ‎– an historic meeting, between a British PM and the republican leadership in the cabinet room where so much Irish history had been made – he explained at length to me the causes of republican grievance. I listened. We talked. And as the meeting went on he explained why he thought, despite all the grievance, there was a chance for peace. Over the years – through the arduous negotiation of the Good Friday agreement – and for the years after it, I got to know ‎Martin well. We met many, many times and as the trust grew between himself, my team, Gerry Adams and their team, so the discussions became increasingly open, frank and therefore productive. By the time that extraordinary day arrived in 2007 after almost a decade of hard work where we could witness the – to my generation – incredible sight of he and Ian Paisley sitting down together in government, the transition of Martin to reconciliator was complete. Whatever the past, the Martin I knew was a thoughtful, reflective and committed individual. Once he became the peacemaker he became it wholeheartedly and with no shortage of determined opposition to those who wanted to carry on the war. I will remember him therefore with immense gratitude for the part he played in the peace process and with genuine affection for the man I came to know and admire for his contribution to peace. Here is a bit more from Colin Parry whose son Tim died in a IRA bomb in Warrington in 1993. “I don’t forgive the IRA, nor does my wife, nor do my children,” he told the BBC. “But, setting aside forgiveness, the simple fact is I found Martin McGuinness an easy and pleasant man to talk to – a man who I believe was sincere in his desire for peace, for maintaining the peace process at all costs. “And I think he deserves great credit for his most recent life rather than more than his earlier life, for which I don’t think anything in his most recent life can atone. That said, he was still a brave man, who put himself at some risk within some elements of his own community in Northern Ireland.” Arlene Foster, the Democratic Unionist party leader and former Northern Ireland first minister, has expressed her “sincere condolences” at the death of Martin McGuinness. Today’s news will come as a shock to many people. First and foremost, Martin McGuinness was a much loved husband, father and grandfather. My thoughts and prayers are with his wife and the family circle at this very painful time of grief and loss. The former Northern Ireland secretary Peter Hain described McGuinness as a “pivotal figure” in the peace process. The Guardian’s Ireland correspondent Henry McDonald has more reaction from the outgoing Ulster Unionist leader, Mike Nesbitt, who said this would be a “challenging day for victims of the Troubles”. I believe no one needed to die to get Northern Ireland to where it is today. Clearly Martin McGuinness very actively disagreed with that analysis, but I also accept in his later years he was on a journey to create change through politics, becoming a pivotal figure at Stormont. It would be less than honest if I said other than that I found him a straight-dealing politician in any engagement I had with him. History will reflect a complex life story. Norman Tebbit, who was injured along with his wife when the IRA bombed the Tory party conference in Brighton in 1984, has been reacting to McGuinness’s death. The Alliance leader, Naomi Long, has said she is saddened to learn of the death. On behalf of myself and my colleagues I would extend our heartfelt condolences to Bernie, to Martin’s children and to the wider family circle on Martin’s passing. They are very much in our thoughts and prayers at this sad time, she said. I want to pay tribute to the hard work and dedication Martin invested as an MLA and as deputy first minister to serving not only his constituents, but all of Northern Ireland. Whilst our politics were very different and his past is well documented, the compromises he made, the leadership he demonstrated and his willingness to work with others despite those differences as part of the peace process helped secure the peace we all now enjoy. For that, we are grateful and our best tribute to him would be to do all in our power to secure that peace and progress for future generations. Senior republican and former IRA volunteer Gerry Kelly paid tribute to McGuinness. My thoughts are with Bernie and all his family first. He will be missed by Irish republicans, nationalists and freedom fighters around the world. Equally proud of having been a freedom fighter and peacemaker. His huge legacy lives on. RIP Colin Parry, whose son Tim died from his injuries after an IRA bombing in Warrington town centre in 1993 has told the BBC the McGuinness he knew was “a quiet man of peace”. Colum Eastwood, the Derry-based leader of the rival nationalist party, the SDLP, said McGuinness’s “remarkable journey from paramilitarism to peace was a hallmark of the transformative effect of the peace process”. He expressed his condolences to the McGuinness family, adding: History will record his political career as a journey – one born in a tradition of violence but, in a testament to Martin’s character, that arrived at his true calling in politics, people and the art of persuasion. Those who knew him will know that his warm and affable nature undoubtedly made it easier to reach beyond his own political base. The generosity that he displayed in developing relationships with Ian Paisley and Peter Robinson demonstrated a rare gift that came as much from his personality as his politics. It is that gift which is needed in our politics at this moment. People in the UK are waking up to news that Martin McGuinness has died. Reactions will, of course, be mixed. This is from Kyle Paisley, a son of the late Ian Paisley, who as the DUP first minister of Northern Ireland had McGuinness as his deputy. This from Tony Blair’s former communications chief Alastair Campbell. Ireland’s president, Michael D Higgins, has issued a long statement on McGuinness’ death. You can read it at the Irish Times here, but here’s part of it: The world of politics and the people across this island will miss the leadership he gave, shown most clearly during the difficult times of the peace process, and his commitment to the values of genuine democracy that he demonstrated in the development of the institutions in Northern Ireland … His death leaves a gap that will be difficult to fill. May he rest in peace. One of the most remarkable – and unlikely – images of McGuinness’s political career came when he shook the Queen’s hand on her visit to Belfast in 2012. As Anne McHardy writes in the Guardian obituary of McGuinness: The image of McGuinness, as deputy first minister of Northern Ireland, standing side by side with a smiling [Peter] Robinson, [Ian] Paisley’s successor as Democratic Unionist party leader and first minister, and shaking the Queen’s hand during her visit to Belfast in 2012, vividly portrayed not only how far McGuinness himself had developed over the years, but how far Northern Ireland had moved from the violence of 1968. The two met on a number of subsequent occasions, the last coming in June 2016 at Hillsborough Castle, when the Queen unveiled a portrait of herself. After a 20-minute private meeting, McGuinness said: “I am an unapologetic Irish republican and I value very much the contribution Queen Elizabeth has made to the peace process and to reconciliation.” In a statement, Sinn Féin said: It is with deep regret and sadness that we have learnt of the death of our friend and comrade Martin McGuinness, who passed away in Derry during the night. He will be sorely missed by all who knew him. McGuinness died overnight in Altnagelvin hospital. He had been diagnosed with a rare genetic disease caused by deposits of abnormal protein in his tissues and organs. Martin McGuinness, Northern Ireland’s former deputy first minister and ex-IRA chief of staff, has died at the age of 66. The Sinn Féin president, Gerry Adams, confirmed the death of his longtime political ally, saying on Tuesday morning: Throughout his life, Martin showed great determination, dignity and humility and it was no different during his short illness. He was a passionate republican who worked tirelessly for peace and reconciliation and for the reunification of his country. On behalf of republicans everywhere we extend our condolences to Bernie, Fiachra, Emmett, Fionnuala and Grainne, grandchildren and the extended McGuinness family. We will have reaction to McGuinness’ death here, as well as the politics of the day when Andrew Sparrow takes over later."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2017/mar/20/trump-kentucky-rally-fbi-russia-investigation-james-comey","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-03-21T01:38:36Z","webTitle":"Trump stays silent on FBI's Russia investigation at Kentucky rally","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/mar/20/trump-kentucky-rally-fbi-russia-investigation-james-comey","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/mar/20/trump-kentucky-rally-fbi-russia-investigation-james-comey","fields":{"headline":"Trump stays silent on FBI's Russia investigation at Kentucky rally","bodyText":"Just hours after FBI director James Comey confirmed that there was a federal investigation into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia during the 2016 presidential race, Donald Trump regaled supporters at a Kentucky rally with tales of 19th century political history and 21st century NFL quarterbacks. Without addressing Comey’s testimony to Congress earlier in the day, the president appeared in front of a crowd of 18,000 supporters and basked in their applause. He boasted that he was the reason that former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick had yet to sign with an NFL team. Kaepernick famously refused to stand for the national anthem throughout the 2016 NFL season and was the subject of national controversy as a result. Trump claimed “there was an article today it was reported that NFL owners don’t want to pick him up because they don’t want to get a nasty tweet from Donald Trump”. To the loud cheers that followed, he added: “The people of Kentucky like it when people stand for the American flag.” Trump, who had been touting the perceived historic similarities between himself and Andrew Jackson, also spent much of the rally touting the philosophy of Jackson’s arch-rival, Henry Clay. The president lauded Clay for his American System, which called for funding internal improvements with canals. Trump’s praise for Clay – who served as speaker of the House, senator, secretary of state and three-time Whig nominee for president – was deeply discordant with his previous praise of Jackson. The seventh president of the US vehemently opposed the American System and once said that one of his great regrets in life was not shooting Clay. Despite ignoring Russia in his speech, Trump did mention the ongoing Capitol Hill fight over healthcare reform. He described repealing and replacing Obamacare as important because it was necessary before any tax reform legislation could be passed. “We want a very big tax cut,” he said, “but cannot do that until we keep our promise to repeal and replace the disaster known as Obamacare.” Trump also engaged in his usual dark populist rhetoric, warning “of a financial system stacked against the American people”. In his view, “These entrenched interests will do anything they can to keep the broken system in place, but they will fail and we will win because we are fighting on the side of our great American heritage.” He also seemed to take pleasure in needling the crowd about the upset loss of their hometown basketball team, the Louisville Cardinals, in the NCAA tournament on Sunday. Speaking in the venue where Louisville played for more than a half century, he told the crowd, “You just worry about your basketball and I’ll take care of the rest.” Not only is the team loyally supported in Louisville, but Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell, attending in support of the president on Monday, is an alumni of the school and a diehard fan. Attendees shared the lack of concern about Russian influence in the 2016 election. Wendy Lambert of Lynchville, Kentucky said: “I don’t believe in any of the Russian hacking or all of that stuff. I don’t believe so because it was all a setup.” She added that in her opinion the setup “was mostly on the Democrats, on the Hillary side”. Janice Whitworth of Louisville, Kentucky, echoed those views, noting “there hasn’t been found any evidence of it yet”. She said that while Russia was “maybe using the media ... none of the election devices or machines are connected to the internet” so she wasn’t concerned about hacking."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/mar/21/french-presidential-debate-le-pen-comes-under-fire-from-rivals","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-03-21T00:56:32Z","webTitle":"French presidential debate: Le Pen comes under fire from rivals","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/mar/21/french-presidential-debate-le-pen-comes-under-fire-from-rivals","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/mar/21/french-presidential-debate-le-pen-comes-under-fire-from-rivals","fields":{"headline":"French presidential debate: Le Pen comes under fire from rivals","bodyText":"France’s main presidential candidates rounded on the far-right Front National’s Marine Le Pen in the first televised debate on Monday night, with the independent centrist Emmanuel Macron accusing her of lying and seeking to divide the country. The three-and-a-half-hour live debate between the top five candidates saw Le Pen and Macron repeatedly exchange verbal blows. At the start of the debate, Macron, the 39-year-old former economy minister who has never run for election before, seemed subdued, perhaps more used to making speeches alone on stage than debating rivals. But when Le Pen accused him of being in favour of the burkini, a full-body swimsuit worn by Muslim women that created weeks of controversy in France last summer when some mayors banned it from beaches, Macron exploded. “You are lying by twisting the truth,” he said, accusing her of “dividing” society. Later, she attacked Macron for being a former investment banker, then again on foreign policy, shouting over him: “What you’re saying means nothing. We don’t understand any of it.” Polls currently show Le Pen and Macron looking likely to make it through to the second, final round, but the race remains open and impossible to predict. Le Pen’s main challenge was to appear credible on economic policy, but she stressed security and immigration issues. “I want to put an end to immigration – that’s clear,” she announced, before talking about a rise of Islamic fundamentalism in France and saying the security situation in France was “explosive”. The rightwing François Fillon has in recent weeks gone from favourite to fighting to stay in the race after a formal judicial investigation was launched into claims that he paid his wife and children vast taxpayer-funded salaries for alleged “fake jobs” as parliamentary assistants. Le Pen’s Front National is also under investigation over the misuse of European parliament funds to pay party workers. Both have denied wrongdoing, but on Monday they got away without anyone going into detail about the allegations during the debate. The hard-left Jean-Luc Mélenchon, who commentators said had won the sense of humour contest during the debate, said he admired the “prudishness of gazelles” of the other candidates in avoiding detail on the corruption cases that have dominated the campaign. Fillon, a former prime minister, concluded the debate by saying: “I have some flaws. Who hasn’t? But I know how to run a small town, a region, a government.” For much of the debate, Fillon stood back, attempting to look reserved and presidential. He didn’t tackle Le Pen on immigration or security, but then he savaged her plans to leave the euro. “You want to drag the country into social and economic chaos,” he told Le Pen. “That’s called Project Fear, Mr Fillon. It was used before Brexit,” shot back Le Pen, who has pledged a referendum on France’s EU membership. Macron, staunchly pro-Europe, noted that “all those who said Brexit will be wonderful … ran away and hid”. The Socialist candidate, Benoît Hamon, took issue with Le Pen’s claim that public schools were racked with violence, calling her remarks “nauseating”. He later accused her of being “addicted to crime stories”. Meanwhile, the Socialist interior minister Bruno Le Roux was summoned to meet the prime minister early on Tuesday morning after allegations surfaced that, as an MP, he had employed his two daughters as parliamentary assistants several times during their school holidays. Since the Fillon allegations, the hiring of family members at taxpayers’ expense has become a hot button issue. It is legal in France for MPs to hire family members as long as they genuinely carry out work."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2017/mar/22/jackson-irvine-its-an-expectation-now-that-australia-should-be-in-the-world-cup","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-03-21T19:00:13Z","webTitle":"Jackson Irvine: 'It’s an expectation now that Australia should be in the World Cup'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/mar/22/jackson-irvine-its-an-expectation-now-that-australia-should-be-in-the-world-cup","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/mar/22/jackson-irvine-its-an-expectation-now-that-australia-should-be-in-the-world-cup","fields":{"headline":"Jackson Irvine: 'It’s an expectation now that Australia should be in the World Cup'","bodyText":"Two Australians have caught the eye in a big way this year in England’s second tier. Both have arrived this season from foreign clubs, both are midfielders and both are earning rave reviews. One is Aaron Mooy, the playmaker pushing Huddersfield Town towards promotion into the Premier League. The other is a tall, pony-tailed AFL fan who came through the ranks in Scotland and is fighting hard to keep one of the division’s smallest clubs up – Jackson Irvine. While previously the Australian contingent in the Championship had been focused purely on the likes of Massimo Luongo, Bailey Wright and Socceroos skipper Mile Jedinak, now Irvine is taking centre stage. In his just his first season in the division Irvine has stamped his authority at Burton Albion. Nine goals in 36 appearances as a defensive midfielder have demonstrated both his ability and versatility, sending many rivals scrambling for his signature. While his club career is taking off, so is his international career about to skyrocket. Irvine was almost lost to Australian football when he represented Scotland’s Under-19s, but he was enticed back into the fold five years ago and then played for the Young Socceroos and the Olyroos. His full senior international debut came at Craven Cottage in 2013 in a 3-0 win over Canada, Australia’s first game after the sacking of Holger Osieck. Socceroo caps have been rare since then but Irvine is building a strong case for regular inclusion. With Mooy, Luongo, Jedinak, Mark Milligan and Tom Rogic all battling for spots in a crowded Australian midfield, the 24-year old has had to bide his time. “That’s only the boys who play overseas, there’s the Luke Brattans, the James Troisis who are having great seasons in the A-League,” he says. “Jimmy Jeggo’s having a really good season as well. The midfield is a really tough area, it’s one we’ve always been strong in but we’re lucky we have a lot of different players who bring different qualities within the team. We just all hope we can contribute in some way, whether we’re selected in the 23 or the starting XI, you’re just part of the wider squad.” Australia face crucial games in their next two World Cup qualifiers, with matches against Iraq in Tehran on Thursday and the United Arab Emirates in Sydney next week. Losses in either game could see the Socceroos slide down their group as the qualifying period enters its critical phase. Irvine says the national team aren’t taking anything for granted in Iran. “That’s something we’re used to, playing in Saudi Arabia and UAE with the heat and hostility of the crowd and everything, the surfaces. These are the things people don’t probably look into when they see the results when we play in these sorts of places. It is extremely difficult but we don’t use that as an excuse, we just approach it the same way and try and play our football. We know if we do it the right way it will be enough to win the games.” After those two games a Confederations Cup, and a potential World Cup next year, await in Russia. The Socceroos have been drawn to face world champions Germany, South American champions Chile and African champions Cameroon in June. Irvine’s excitement at continuing his football evolution against the best in the world is palpable. “It’s incredibly exciting,” he admits. “I think it’s going to be a great time for football in our country, to be playing in such high-profile games.” Qualifying for their fourth World Cup in a row would be huge achievement for Australia, but the Socceroos’ and Irvine’s ambitions do not stop there. The midfielder wants to help take the national team to a new level. “It’s a testament to how Australian football’s come that it’s an expectation now that we should be there,” he says. “We’ve sort of proven ourselves at that level now and we need to keep pushing. It’s not just about qualifying for World Cups now, we need to do well and progress and go further than any Australian team has before. That’s got to be the goal. As difficult as it is, you need to believe that if you keep playing the right way and believing in the system that we have that it will get us to the next level.” Irvine’s story began in Melbourne in the early 1990s. Like many boys in that city he grew up playing Australian rules football and idolising Collingwood. It was only through his Dutch grandfather’s influence that he was introduced to the round-ball game. “My granddad used to pick me up from school and take me to training when I was in primary school, that was where it all started,” he says. “Once I started playing I was obsessed from an early age.” Irvine’s talent was evident early and at just 15 years of age he was playing against men for Frankston Pines in Victoria’s State League Division 1. Soon he was spotted by Melbourne Victory scouts, before getting a trial and signing with Scottish giants Celtic at 17. Irvine worked his way through the Bhoys’ youth teams, captaining their Under-19s and learning his trade before making his Scottish Premier League debut in 2012. But with opportunities limited in Glasgow, the then 20-year old went on loan to Kilmarnock the following season. A loan spell to Ross County followed, where Irvine excelled, before the club signed him permanently in July 2015. After another impressive year with the Staggies, including winning the Scottish League Cup, England beckoned and promoted Burton Albion snapped him up for a £330,000 transfer fee, the biggest in their history. “Scotland has played a massive role in my life, half of my family’s Scottish,” Irvine says. “I played for Scotland at Under-19 level. To make the move down here, it was something I was very keen to do. You want to test yourself at another level. People will compare the SPL but at the end of the day I just saw it as a new challenge and another step in my career.” South of the border Irvine hit the ground running, quickly becoming an indispensable part of Nigel Clough’s starting XI. As a defensive midfielder, who has spent time as a right-back and centre-back in the past, Irvine has benefited from the manager’s tactical tweaks and use of a 3-5-2 formation. “He’s a big name in English football,” Irvine says of Clough. “He’s very well respected. He’s very good at looking after the players and he’s the one who’s given me that freedom to make runs into the box. He’s probably identified a part of my game that I didn’t even know was there.” A humble character, Irvine is settled at no-nonsense Burton, a club that just two years ago was in League Two. “Since I came here it’s all gone as well pretty much as I could have imagined it going,” he says. “The club made me feel welcomed and comfortable straight away. “I sort of adapted into Championship football relatively quickly. The club, and the players and the staff made that really easy for me. To go on the goal-scoring run before New Year, that was down to a more positional change. I don’t think maybe I’m playing that much better than I was last season, but when you add a few goals to your game it probably highlights things a bit more than when you are just playing in midfield.” The Brewers’ fast rise up the divisions has mirrored Irvine’s quick rise from Melbourne schoolboy to Championship star and Socceroo. “I joined Burton knowing about their past few years. Back-to-back promotions has been an amazing achievement. I was very aware of the club and it just seemed like a perfect fit. It all seemed to click into place straight away.” Irvine’s dynamic displays this season have put Premier League clubs on notice. In January he even rejected a massive £5m a year offer from the Chinese Super League. The midfielder is matter-of-fact about knocking back a contract that would have set him up for life: “It wasn’t the right move for me at this point in my career. Maybe one day it will be, but at this point in time it didn’t feel like the right career decision. Most people probably think I’m crazy when they saw the numbers and I probably am a little bit.” The 24-year old’s burning desire, one he has held since childhood, is to crack the Premier League. “The most important thing for me is that I keep playing football and testing myself and trying new things and challenging myself. Whether that means playing more in the Championship, or overseas, you just keep going and see how things progress. “In the more immediate future, I’ve got two years left at Burton and priority No1 is to keep Burton in the Championship. That’s going to be the immediate goal for now and then from there you see what develops. If any opportunities arise to push forward in some way then you assess them at the time.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"us-news/2017/mar/20/brooklyn-bridge-al-qaida-plot-iyman-faris-citizenship","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-03-21T00:45:03Z","webTitle":"US tries to strip citizenship of man convicted in New York terror plot","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/mar/20/brooklyn-bridge-al-qaida-plot-iyman-faris-citizenship","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/mar/20/brooklyn-bridge-al-qaida-plot-iyman-faris-citizenship","fields":{"headline":"US tries to strip citizenship of man convicted in New York terror plot","bodyText":"The Trump administration has moved to strip American citizenship from a man convicted 14 years ago of being involved in an al-Qaida plot in New York. Federal prosecutors led by a Trump appointee filed on Monday a rare denaturalization lawsuit against Iyman Faris, who is serving a 20-year prison sentence for conspiring to destroy the Brooklyn Bridge. Faris, a 47-year-old Pakistan native who worked as a truck driver in Columbus, Ohio, is accused of illegally obtaining citizenship in 1999 by falsely swearing allegiance to the US. The government alleged that by affiliating with al-Qaida, Faris had retrospectively proven himself “not attached to the principles of the constitution” and “not well disposed to the good order and happiness” of the country, as new citizens must promise to be. Faris is also accused of entering the US on another man’s passport in 1994 and failing to disclose past involvement in military combat in Kashmir and Afghanistan in the 1980s, along with connections to jihadist groups in Bosnia and Pakistan. Monday’s lawsuit was submitted in the names of Chad Reader, who is an acting assistant attorney general and former lawyer for Trump’s presidential campaign, along with Donald Boyce, the US attorney for southern Illinois, where Faris is serving his prison sentence. Appearing to suggest that similar lawsuits would be brought in other cases, Reader said in a statement that the US government “will continue to pursue denaturalization proceedings against known or suspected terrorists who procured their citizenship by fraud”. Spokespeople for the Department of Justice did not respond to questions about the involvement of Jeff Sessions, the new US attorney general, in the decision to proceed with action against Faris. Faris pleaded guilty to plotting with senior al-Qaida operatives to bring down the bridge to avoid more severe charges. Prosecutors said in court filings that in late 2000 he met Osama bin Laden and the September 11 ringleader Khalid Sheikh Mohammed. Although such actions are relatively rare, the US government is authorized under immigration law to revoke citizenship from a naturalized citizen if he or she is found to have illegally obtained the citizenship or obtained it by making false representations. Prosecutors in Oregon are seeking a similar denaturalization against Mohamed Sheikh Abdirahman Kariye, the imam of what is said to have been Portland’s biggest mosque, for alleged ties to a jihadist plot. The court case, which began in July 2015, is ongoing."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/mar/22/needs-based-funding-making-a-significant-difference-90-of-principals-say","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-03-21T19:12:03Z","webTitle":"Needs-based funding making a 'significant difference', 90% of principals say","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/mar/22/needs-based-funding-making-a-significant-difference-90-of-principals-say","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/mar/22/needs-based-funding-making-a-significant-difference-90-of-principals-say","fields":{"headline":"Needs-based funding making a 'significant difference', 90% of principals say","bodyText":"Nine out of 10 principals say needs-based education funding is making a “significant difference” to their schools, according to a survey by the education union. The Australian Education Union State of Our Schools report, released on Wednesday, finds that extra funding is being spent on student support staff and professional development for teachers but schools still struggle to fill vacancies. The survey of 9,741 AEU members, including 1,428 principals and 7,513 teachers, will fuel calls by the Labor opposition that higher funding levels are needed to improve school performance. Labor has promised to restore $30bn in funding growth cut in the 2014 budget from years five and six of needs-based funding agreements. The Coalition is still yet to announce how funding will be distributed from 2018 and argues extra funding is not required for improvement, and that total spending is still increasing to $20.1bn in 2020 from $16bn in 2016. The AEU survey found a big rise in principals reporting staff shortages, with 51% reporting shortages in 2017, up from 37% in 2016 and 28% in 2015. In 2017, 58% agreed it was getting harder to fill staff vacancies, up from 48% the year before. The three disciplines for which it is hardest to find teachers are maths, science and technology. Almost half (46%) of all principals say their school is under-resourced, although just 7% said they were “significantly” under-resourced. Some 42% say they have adequate resources and 12% say they are well-resourced, with little change in these measures since 2016. Victoria and Tasmania had the highest proportion of principals saying their schools are not adequately resourced, 57% and 56% respectively. The education minister, Simon Birmingham, has criticised Victoria for investing less per student than other states and for failing to guarantee its share of needs-based funding in years five and six of education agreements while calling on the commonwealth to do the same. The post-2018 funding model is set to be debated at the Council of Australian Governments in the first half of the year, although the states including Victoria have lobbied for the meeting of education ministers to examine proposed models first. The AEU survey found 67% of principals reported their schools had received Gonski funding. The union said that “virtually no” schools in Western Australia and the Northern Territory had received such funding, although the report on government services released in February showed both states received a boost in per student funding from the federal government. Of those who knew they had received Gonski funding 90% of principals reported it made a significant difference to their schools, up from 84% last year. Principals of schools receiving over $200,000 were particularly pleased, with 94% agreeing with the proposition. Only 19% of principals receiving Gonski funding believed the amount so far has been enough to cover the full level of need at their school, it found. Asked what schools were using extra funding for, the most common were additional support staff (54%), professional development for teachers (51%), additional specialist literary and numeracy teachers or coaches (47%), one-on-one support for students with learning difficulties (35%) and cutting class sizes (22%). When asked who would miss out if the final two years of needs-based funding agreements are not delivered, respondents nominated students falling behind in literary or numeracy (84%), those with disabilities or learning difficulties (62%), and disengaged students at risk of dropping out (43%). Birmingham told Guardian Australia the report was “filled with mistruths and ‘alternative facts’ and it is an embarrassment to all the hard-working and wonderful teachers [the union claims] to represent”, citing the fact schools funding has increased despite claims of under-resourcing. “Our funding growth means there’s no reason schools won’t be able to continue to support teachers and new or existing initiatives, such as specialist teachers or targeted intervention programs.” The shadow federal education minister, Tanya Plibersek, said the report shows “Labor’s extra investment was working to improve schools”. “Which is why it’s impossible to understand why the Liberals are cutting $30bn from schools,” she said. The Victorian education minister, James Merlino, said it would “take time” for its investment in Victorian education to undo cuts of the previous state Liberal government. “Simon Birmingham is treating our classrooms as political footballs,” he said. “He is trying to distract people from the fact that the Turnbull government is ripping almost $1bn from Victorian students by walking away from Gonski funding.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/mar/22/native-title-system-restricting-benefits-for-indigenous-australians-research-finds","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-03-21T19:02:32Z","webTitle":"Native title system restricting benefits for Indigenous Australians, research finds","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/mar/22/native-title-system-restricting-benefits-for-indigenous-australians-research-finds","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/mar/22/native-title-system-restricting-benefits-for-indigenous-australians-research-finds","fields":{"headline":"Native title system restricting benefits for Indigenous Australians, research finds","bodyText":"Inequalities in the native title system are limiting the flow of benefits to traditional owners from agreements with governments and industry, a new report suggests. The report, released by Curtin University and the University of Western Australia this week, found that, even after native title had been recognised, the weak bargaining position “inherent in the legislation” created significant barriers to positive outcomes for native title holders and left them at the mercy of their negotiating partners. In one case, it found, that led to native title holders feeling they had bargained away native title rights without receiving anything in return. About 85% of Western Australia’s land mass is either held under native title or currently subject to a native title application. The majority of applications are made in the Kimberley, where 70% of the region is held under a determined native title claim but native title also covers significant parts of the Pilbara, central desert, Goldfields and south-western districts. The largest of those claims, settled after years of negotiation through the $1.3bn Noongar Indigenous Land Use Agreement (ILUA), was ruled invalid in the federal court last month after some traditional custodians refused to approve the agreement. That prompted the Turnbull government to propose a hasty amendment to the Native Title Act (1993) to protect other agreements from appeal by restoring the presumption that agreements only needed majority support from native title holders to be valid. Labor has indicated on Tuesday that it will support the move. Curtin University associate professor Michael Dockery, who co-authored the report, said native title law was a “minefield” and the collapse of the Noongar deal “just highlights how complex it is and how much these people are at the whim of the legal system and changes of government and policy”. “Native title doesn’t really give you any sort of power,” he said. “You don’t really own the land, you just have a right to negotiate … That doesn’t necessarily offer you anything tangible. You are not sitting on a pot of gold.” The report contained a qualitative analysis of three post-determination native title agreements in WA: the 2013 ILUA between Yindjibarndi Aboriginal Corporation and Rio Tinto in the Pilbara; the 2005 ILUA between the Miriuwung-Gajerrong people, operating MG Corp, and the WA government in the Ord River valley, known as the Ord final agreement; and a series of right to negotiate or future acts agreements between the Gooiyandi Aboriginal Corporation and pastoral stations in the the Fitzroy Valley. It found that while the Yindjibarndi were generally happy with their agreement with Rio, and felt Rio had generally operated “in good faith”, the Miriuwung-Gajerrong had been strung along by a 10-year promise for agricultural land that had not eventuated because the WA government had delayed the roll out of the Ord River scheme, upon which all promises of economic development and job creation hinged. “It’s very clear the proponents that we spoke to from the Miriuwung-Gajerrong … were essentially let down by the state government,” Dockery said. “Everything was delayed by a unilateral decision from the state government and they essentially left the traditional owners hanging.” That agreement saw the WA government compulsorily acquire 65,000ha held under exclusive possession native title to develop the Ord River stage 2 agricultural scheme in return for a $57m package, which included $24m to establish and maintain MG Corp, $14m into a charitable community trust, $11m in compensation for damage done when the Ord River was dammed and flooded in the 1960s, and $15m in land transferred to the Miriuwung-Gajerrong community, including nine community sites. Eleven years on, the report found, there had been no improvement in the living conditions of Miriuwung-Gajerrong people. “All those benefits that came from the Ord agreement had conditions put to them, right, and the conditions were never favourable to what MG wanted to do, right, because we had to comply with them for the first 10 years,” one Aboriginal director of MG Corp, quoted in the report, said. He continued: “There were supposed to be certain lands which were to be released for economic developments. The Ord final agreement gave the Miriuwung-Gajerrong people or the MG Corporation 10 years to ‘make yourself self-sustaining’. Ten years have gone. The lands, which were economically viable, we still haven’t got, and the state keeps telling us ‘when it is convenient’ for them.” Dockery said native title holders were at a disadvantage in negotiations because they did not receive any formalised funding or support to operate as directors of a corporation, despite being required to establish a prescribed body corporate under the Native Title Act. “The prescribed bodies are created by law, by federal legislation,” he said. “To actually properly facilitate those orders, you really need to be an expert in law, in finance, in commercial law … it takes an enormous commitment in time. “The burden is such that it prohibited [directors of native title corporations] holding any other job. You can’t work when this is taking up all your time and all of it is completely unpaid. You couldn’t imagine a similar situation in a white fella world.” The report recommended the WA government petition the Council of Australian Governments to introduce a funding regime for native title corporations and investigate establishing a tertiary education course to give directors of those organisations the legal and financial knowledge to both negotiate with developers and manage a charitable trust."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/mar/21/tuesday-briefing-life-and-times-of-martin-mcguinness","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-03-21T06:58:11Z","webTitle":"Tuesday briefing: Northern Irish politics loses a major figure","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/mar/21/tuesday-briefing-life-and-times-of-martin-mcguinness","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/mar/21/tuesday-briefing-life-and-times-of-martin-mcguinness","fields":{"headline":"Tuesday briefing: Northern Irish politics loses a major figure","bodyText":"Top story: Tributes and reaction after death of Martin McGuinness Good morning, Warren Murray delivering your early news this morning. As the Briefing goes out, news is just breaking that Northern Ireland politics has lost a key figure. Martin McGuinness was the IRA chief of staff who went on to become the Sinn Féin deputy first minister in the devolved power-sharing assembly at Stormont. McGuinness quit politics ahead of the recent Northern Ireland elections, citing ill health. He was 66 and had a rare genetic disease that affects tissues and organs. We have commenced rolling coverage of tributes and reaction. His life and times are remembered in this Guardian obituary. * * * ‘Global Laundromat’ – Britain’s banking system has been identified as one of the channels through which billions of dollars in laundered criminal money flowed out of Vladimir Putin’s Russia, the Guardian can reveal after a special investigation. A scheme that has been dubbed the “Global Laundromat” entailed up to $80bn being moved out of Russia between 2010 and 2014. HSBC, the Royal Bank of Scotland, Lloyds, Barclays and Coutts are among financial institutions facing questions after $740m was funnelled through Britain’s high street banks. HSBC alone processed $545.3m. British-registered companies – whose owners are kept secret by offshore laws – were used as part of the process and then wound up. A coalition of media and investigators has been working with the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP) to unravel the complex web of transactions. * * * ‘Unusual circumstances’ – The FBI director, James Comey, has dismissed the wiretapping conspiracy story promulgated by the White House – while confirming that his agency has, as far back as July 2016, been investigating whether Donald Trump’s campaign colluded with Moscow to influence the election. Comey and the National Security Agency director, Admiral Michael Rogers, told the House intelligence committee that Russian intervention in the election had been “unusually loud” and Moscow did not seem to care about being caught. It was clear the Russians had been determined to intervene on Trump’s side in the election and damage Hillary Clinton’s campaign. Trump weighed in with some alternative facts during the hearing, putting out a tweet claiming the FBI and NSA had just told Congress there was “no Russian influence” on the election process. This was clearly false. When the tweet was put to NSA director Rogers, he made a puzzled double-take. Comey’s effective response was that he didn’t believe they had told the hearing anything of the sort. * * * ‘Uncharted territory’ – The extent of climate change is getting beyond what anyone expected and scientific modelling is struggling to cope, weather experts have warned. The World Meteorological Organisation says that after 2016 became the hottest year ever recorded, 2017 is continuing the trend with rising seas and the disappearance of ice at the poles. “Earth is a planet in upheaval due to human-caused changes in the atmosphere,” says glaciologist Jeffrey Kargel. * * * Cellphones only – Passengers on airlines from 13 countries including Saudi Arabia and Jordan are banned from having electronic devices larger than a mobile phone in the cabin under new US aviation rules. Confusion is swirling around the “confidential” edict from the Transportation Safety Administration, but airlines including Saudia and Royal Jordanian quickly warned their passengers of the new rule affecting flights to and from the US. Reuters cited a US official as saying the measure was in response to a “terrorism threat”. * * * Green’s pension payback – Sir Philip Green is being called on to make sure a £15m refund from the BHS pension scheme rescue doesn’t settle in his own pocket. The Labour MP Frank Field has said a loophole lets Green take the money back if 90% of eligible members cash out rather than continuing their pensions. Green struck a £363m deal to save the scheme after a huge public outcry. Field said: “I hope Sir Philip will recycle any refund back into the scheme as BHS pensioners will still be facing cuts in the benefits for which they paid.” * * * ‘It feels surreal’ – A British veteran of the second world war is facing deportation from Australia at the age of 92. James Bradley and his wife, Peggie, 91, emigrated in 2007 to be with their daughter and her family under Australia’s “aged parent” visa system. The visa is only available to people aged 65 or over, but perversely James was deemed no longer eligible after failing a medical in 2014. The family is appealing against the decision. Lunchtime read: One country, zero freedom Anyone who thought Hong Kong a haven from Communist party authorities was given cause to think again when they started spiriting booksellers away to the mainland, then dramatically snatched one of China’s richest businessmen from his swank hotel suite. Howard W French asks whether it is now too late to save the “one country, two systems” deal that was supposed to preserve independence and civil freedoms after British rule ended. Sport Jamie Vardy has claimed he received death threats because of his alleged involvement in the dressing-room mutiny that undermined Claudio Ranieri at Leicester City, while Olivier Giroud believes the Arsenal players are right behind Arsène Wenger and want him to stay on at the club despite mounting fan unrest and a poor run of form. A deal to stage Cricket World Cup matches at the London Stadium, potentially creating the biggest crowd in England in the modern history of the sport, is close to being secured. Tiger Woods has opened up over the racial slurs that drove his desire to dominate the golf world. And police are investigating after a brawl that broke out at a rugby match between the universities of Sussex and Brighton left several students arrested and one in hospital. Business Some Asian indexes have hit 15-month highs including Hong Kong’s Hang Seng. Japan’s Nikkei dropped 0.3% though. As Google apologises for allowing online adverts for major brands to appear on extremist sites, Nils Pratley says it isn’t taking the issue seriously enough or it would allocate more resources “which it can afford to do” and stop relying on viewers to report contraventions. The pound was buying US$1.24 and €1.15 overnight. The papers The Times leads on more companies – including VW, Toyota and Tesco – pulling adverts from Google, claiming it is not doing enough to keep them off extremist websites. It also features images from an American Vogue photoshoot with Theresa May. The Mail is in familiar territory with the headline “BBC’s Brexit Bias Storm”. The story says that up to 70 MPs have written to the head of BBC saying its coverage of Brexit is “too gloomy”. The Telegraph – as it often does – mirrors the Mail with “BBC warned over Brexit bias”. The Sun splashes on what it says is the case of a rapist who was moved to a women’s prison after gender reassignment. The Mirror, under the headline “Russia’s Ultra Yobs Infiltrated”, reports that hardline thugs are warning English football fans they will be “beaten to death” at next year’s football World Cup. The FT splashes on the story of FBI director James Comey confirming an investigation into links between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin during the presidential election.

The Coalition is unable to drop this particular hot potato, despite senior players like Barnaby Joyce and Scott Morrison saying very clearly that the issue really isn’t a priority down the back paddock, or in the cafe where you picked up your coffee this morning, because a significant bloc in the right faction of the Liberal party intended to keep on pushing until the Freedom™ lady sang. This is an internal crusade, a little passion play for the conservative base, pure and simple, and never mind the casualties – even if the casualties are your hard-working government colleagues, attempting to defend marginal seats with large ethnic populations. But let’s be clear the internal crusade to water down the RDA protections has also been encouraged by external cheerleaders. The Coalition is here, on Harmony Day of all days, talking about weakening the current RDA protections, because of an unremitting conservative media crusade. For months, the Australian has run a full-tilt campaign on 18C that looks, quite frankly, borderline unhinged to anyone outside Holt Street. Somewhat idiosyncratically for a news outlet, the Australian’s campaign elevates and champions one form of freedom while ignoring other curbs on free speech that are actually meaningful if you want to expose wrongdoing by powerful people, which is supposed to be the bread and butter of journalism. The Fox Lite crew on the Sky News night shift have also been rumbling away, in their little harshly lit cupboards, making gutting 18C a test of Malcolm Turnbull’s conservative bonafides. Andrew Bolt, wondering out loud whether or not he can find a reason to like Malcolm Turnbull, oh Malcolm, oh Malcolm – like a moody teenager contemplating the risks of a new courtship. This otherworldly sense of grievance and entitlement – the boutique preoccupation of an Australian elite whose shtick is feigning hostility about elites – is why the rest of us have been sucked into a circular conversation we really aren’t that fascinated by but can’t quite escape from. We are all hostages in this strange bubble of right-wingers talking to right-wingers, which has culminated in a government making a commitment to water down hate speech protections, while trying to pretend the changes represent a strengthening of the current system, which, on any measure, they do not. We have been conscripted, unwittingly, to an operatic outbreak of gesture politics. Because a gesture and a genuflection is all this can be until such time as the government assembles the requisite numbers in the Senate to translate the 18C gesture into legislative change. Perhaps that will happen. On current indications, it looks unlikely. I’m irritated about all of this not because I secretly hate freedom. I’ve written before that, as a journalist, I have a professional interest in allowing speech to be as uninhibited as possible. I don’t need to live in a world where the only opinions I can tolerate are the ones I agree with. I’d happily countenance changes to all restrictions on free speech, including the insult and offend restrictions in 18C – if we were even halfway serious about this being a conversation about freedom. If we were talking about freedom, I’d happily countenance a wide-ranging conversation about defamation law reform, or the impact of suppression orders, or whether free speech in Australia could benefit from something a little bit more robust in the way of protection than an implied freedom of political communication. To cut a long story short, a freedom debate, if that’s what we are having, should be about all restrictions on speech, not just the ones that a certain section of society find inconvenient. Let me put this a bit more bluntly, just so it’s very clear where I stand. I have a certain amount of moral discomfort as a privileged white woman standing up and endorsing taking away restrictions that work to protect the vulnerable – while conveniently ignoring a whole bunch of other restrictions that work to protect the powerful. I’ve never been offended or insulted on the basis of my race and feel it might be best to listen to and respect the lived experiences of people who have. Call that a gesture of puncturing the bubble."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/mar/21/guardian-essential-poll-finds-most-australians-support-a-gas-reservation-policy","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-03-20T22:49:28Z","webTitle":"Guardian Essential poll finds most Australians support a gas reservation policy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/mar/21/guardian-essential-poll-finds-most-australians-support-a-gas-reservation-policy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/mar/21/guardian-essential-poll-finds-most-australians-support-a-gas-reservation-policy","fields":{"headline":"Guardian Essential poll finds most Australians support a gas reservation policy","bodyText":"An overwhelming majority of voters would support the Turnbull government if it implemented a reservation policy where a percentage of Australian gas is held back from being exported and quarantined for domestic use. The latest Guardian Essential poll shows 75% of the survey supports a reservation policy, with the strongest support registered among Coalition voters. The federal resources and energy ministers have, until very recently, expressed public opposition to a reservation policy, but that opposition has softened in recent weeks as concerns have escalated about looming energy shortages because of insufficient supplies of gas. The prime minister met last week with senior executives from the gas industry in an effort to secure a guarantee that more gas would be made available for domestic use after the Australian Energy Market Operator (Aemo) warned the country would face energy shortages by next summer. The Turnbull government has now warned the gas industry it is prepared to use commonwealth export powers “in the national interest” if gas companies don’t increase supply to the domestic market. Two-thirds of Australia’s gas is currently exported. The chairman of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, Rod Sims, has warned manufacturers will go to the wall unless action is taken to boost the domestic supply of gas. The new Essential survey also indicates the South Australian premier Jay Weatherill’s plan to boost energy self-sufficiency in South Australia has gone down well with voters. Last week, Weatherill unveiled a $550m plan to address instability in the state electricity network over the last six months. The Weatherill plan includes a new $360m state-owned gas-fired power plant, a $150m renewable technology fund and $24m for gas exploration grants. The premier has also committed to providing 10% of gas royalties to landholders who allow access for conventional gas and fracking development. Canberra blasted Weatherill’s move, and the plan led to a swingeing public confrontation between the premier and the federal energy minister, Josh Frydenberg, in Adelaide last week. But the public has looked through the political controversy and given the South Australian plan the thumbs up. The Essential survey indicates 68% of people approve, with strong support for the plan across all voting groups. The new poll indicates Australian voters are very conscious about rising power bills. Seventy-seven per cent of those surveyed indicated their power costs had increased over the last few years, including 32% who said their costs had increased a lot (down from 45% in 2012). The new data also underscores the fact coal seam gas exploration divides the Australian community. Thirty-one per cent of those surveyed think coal seam gas mining on farming land should be restricted and 25% think coal seam gas mining should be banned completely. Only 14% of the sample think there is sufficient current regulation of coal seam gas mining. Coalition voters lean towards the proposition that CSG extraction on farming land should be restricted (39%) while more than half (53%) of Greens voters think it should be banned completely. The deputy prime minister, Barnaby Joyce, is attempting to work up a policy that would see other states following Weatherill’s plan to give landholders royalties if CSG extraction happened on their properties. Last week, Joyce called for the state governments to lift the current moratoria on gas development, and urged them to follow the Weatherill compensation model. “Landholders have a right to a greater annuity from their land. By paying a royalty it means the value of a farmer’s land increases as a result of gas extraction, rather than decreasing,” Joyce said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2017/mar/20/french-presidential-candidates-debate-key-election-issues-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-03-20T23:47:34Z","webTitle":"French presidential candidates debate key election issues – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2017/mar/20/french-presidential-candidates-debate-key-election-issues-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2017/mar/20/french-presidential-candidates-debate-key-election-issues-live","fields":{"headline":"French presidential candidates debate key election issues – as it happened","bodyText":"And that’s it; it’s over. Three hours and 20 minutes of debate. Very hard to say who came out on top. Here’s one succinct and trenchant view: Our Paris correspondent Angelique Chrisafis will be filing her report shortly and the pundits will have their say tomorrow. Le Pen came across as shouty and angry (and seriously flakey on the economy); Fillon mostly quiet but with a few strong moments, particularly on pensions and foreign policy; Macron enthusiastic, idealistic, passionate at times. Conservative commentator Christophe Barbier reckons Le Pen did herself no favours: not presidential, too pugnacious: And Barbier gave the candidates these marks out of 20, conceding they weren’t very scientific: Fillon: 12/20; Hamon: 11/20; Mélenchon : 14/20; Macron: 14/20; Le Pen: 9/20. But all will have pleased their own voters, I imagine. The next few rounds of polls will show whether this evening’s debate made any difference. That’s it from me: good night! Fillon: a real change of politics is needed and I’m the only candidate who can deliver it. I’m the only one who could have a stable majority to deliver it. I may have committed a few errors, who hasn’t. But I have experience, and the will to do this. Hamon: I’m offering you a vote that will be useful to you, your children, your grandchildren. You are used to voting against; I suggest you vote for: for the environment, for purchasing power for the poorest families; for a sixth republic; for a desirable future. Le Pen: Most of the promises you’ve heard tonight cannot be put into practice because the EU will prevent them. You, the French, have the right to decide. Uncontrolled globalisation has been a disaster for you. I will do nothing against your will. I will start negotiations with Europe, and I will organise a referendum. I call on you to vote for liberty. If you make the right political choices things will improve immediately. Mélenchon: We cannot affront the threats the world faces with hands tied by money. I want to give the republic back to France by relieving it of this presidential monarchy. I am ready for this responsibility ... to put in place a programme that will upset lots of vested interests. Macron: Thank you for this debate. I want to reconcile opinions. Our country is divided, by fear, and by the way some people play on fear. You are not the problem – the problem is that the established order is not the right one. I propose pragmatism, with zero tolerance. My project is one that will make France proud. Profound change, that’s our project. It’s a profound renewal of French politics. I want France, our country, to offer a chance – a chance for each and every one of you. The debate has now been going on for more than three hours. Le Pen says to avoid future terrorism attacks must be prevented by regaining control of France’s frontiers, expelling known militants, banning fundamentalist organisations, closing fundamentalist mosques ... “We must give ourselves the means to wage this necessary war against Islamic fundamentalism,” she says. Fillon says the world faces a longterm war that will take a decade at least. It will need alliances with Russia, the Middle East and others, and in the meantime France must secure itself: deporting anyone who has a “proven relationship with the enemy”, stripping French nationality from anyone who takes up arms against his country. Macron says no one can guarantee no new attacks. “It needs responsibility, maturity.” A diplomatic solution in the Middle East; punishment for those who have fought against France; improving intelligence cooperation. Macron says he is the only candidate who has pledged to fulfil France’s responsibilities to Europe. He says the French people will give him a mandate to defend France’s economic independence and its security. He says France’s place is at the heart of Europe, working with Europe. Le Pen snorts. “You have said nothing,” Le Pen says. “You have talked for seven minutes and said nothing.” The final stage of the debate: foreign policy. Hamon says France should always be capable and willing to intervene militarily abroad in defence of international law. He says Trump and Russia’s ambitions have changed everything: less America (on the world stage) should lead to more Europe, he says. Le Pen says no one should decide for France. “I don’t want to force our soldiers to fight in wars that we have not decided,” she says. The French army is in a parlous state, she says, and defence spending must be raised to 3% of GDP by the end of the next presidency. Fillon says that’s ridiculous: completely unaffordable. Mélenchon says the world has become a dangerous place. He wants to be a president of peace, he says. No war, but negotiations ... Le Pen has spoken longer and louder than everyone else ... Another lengthy and detailed discussion. Mélenchon says everyone should be reimbursed in full for all their healthcare expenses: “We know how to fund that, it’s not complicated.” Fillon says the system has to be “debureaucratised” and GPs need to be at the heart of the system. They need to be paid properly, to be able to work in teams. Hospitals need to be more independent. Macron also wants healthcare professionals to have more autonomy. Le Pen says France has to cut waste in its healthcare system. As a mother of three, she says, she could have started a pharmacy ... There is a lengthy debate on the age of retirement ... Fillon proposes raising the retirement age to 65. Macron says he will reform the pension system from top to bottom. It is unclear and confusing and unfair, he says. One euro paid into the system should be worth one euro at retirement age, he says. Tweet of the night so far: “As president of the Republic, I would shorten presidential debates.” Le Pen says Brexit is a huge success and the UK’s results are “formidable”. Everyone knows what I think of Europe and the euro, she says. The other candidates laugh ... Le Pen’s ideas on the economy are not entirely coherent, according to some: Fillon accuses Le Pen of leading France “towards social and economic chaos”. Hamon says the only new idea in the campaign is his: a universal basic income. Fillon says France’s neighbours have not cut the working week and are doing better than France. Investment is key, he says. He is determined to raise purchasing power. Macron says investment has to be increased and the social security charges companies pay have to be reduced. He says he will abolish property tax, paid by 85% of French citizens. Fillon accuses him of being “a little bit left, a little bit right” – Macron replies that his policies are “effective, and fair”. Le Pen says she does not want to enter into “a debate among ultra-liberals”. That model has shown its shortcomings, she says, it has “ruined our agriculture, ruined our industry”. France needs “economic patriotism” she says; the state must encourage French businesses, not foreign businesses. The EU encourages unfair competition and French industry pays the price. Quite a few observers agreeing that Fillon does not seem to be able to make his mark on this debate. “He’s trying, but it’s not getting through”: A trace of irony: Unemployment is a major and stubborn problem in France. What’s the solution? Fillon says countries around France have managed full employment. So why haven’t we? Employees must be able to negotiate hours with employers on a company-by-company basis, he says: “Give companies the freedom ... to organise themselves.” Macron says he is not suggesting abolishing France’s 35-hour week. He says the law should set the framework and principles, but companies and industrial sectors should be able to decide. And he wants a cut in corporation tax. Hamon says we need to take account now of the impact of automation. “I will be the candidate of a decent wage,” he says, and in an increase in the minimum wage. Mélenchon says he is interesting in creating jobs by filling company order books; he will invest €100bn in future technologies. Xavier Frison from Marianne magazine says Fillon is effectively absent from the debate, “inaudible, the big loser of the evening so far”: We’ve taken a break, I presume a commercial one ... A few instant reactions: Le Figaro’s London correspondent reckons it isn’t everyone against Macron but everyone against Le Pen. Hamon and Le Pen are gunning for Macron, Fillon is reserved and Mélenchon is almost “acting as referee”: Hamon says France should close its old nuclear reactors and invest more in wind power. Fillon says France’s nuclear industry must be safe. Macron says he wants a 50-50 split between nuclear and renewable by 20150. He says clean air is critical: diesel cars should no longer get tax breaks; one million homes should be made more energy-efficient. Le Pen says the freetrade, “ultra-liberal model” is intrinsically bad for the environment because it encourages production on the other side of the globe. She defends diesel, says French drivers who were encouraged to buy them should not be penalised. Asked how to restore a sense of morality in public life – with several of the participants embroiled in assorted judicial and other inquiries: Fillon says he will set up a commission should be set up to improve transparency and guarantee good conduct. Macron says conflicts of interests must be abolished as far as humanly possible; all relations with lobbyists must be disclosed; MPs’ pay must be made completely transparent; the rules must be clear. Mélenchon says MPs should not be able to do consultancy work, and hiring family members – common practice in France – should be banned. Le Pen says the campaign has helped French voters realise that some candidates are defending the interests of major groups rather than of the French people. She has a dig at Macron here, a former banker: “Private interests have invited themselves into this campaign.” Macron comes close to accusing her of defamation, saying she has accused him of a conflict of interest – if she believes that, she should file a formal complaint, he says, or keep her silence. A first few thoughts from the Guardian’s Paris correspondent, Angelique Chrisafis: Macron began the debate at a certain disadvantage: this is his first ever election and he is more used to being on stage alone, delivering speeches than taking part in debates. When he was economy minister, one of his biggest, televised verbal shoot-outs was with Le Pen’s strategy mastermind and media pit-bull, Florian Philippot, who is tonight sitting, nodding, behind Le Pen in the studio. Angelique adds: So far tonight, Macron has aimed his fire at his right-wing rival Fillon, attacking him for using the term “civil war” and “wanting to sow the seeds of fear.” Macron, who has risen in the polls since Fillon’s legal woes of the past five weeks, also rubbished Fillon’s policy plan to lower the criminal age of responsibility to 16. But having let Hamon and Mélenchon lead most charges against Le Pen, Macron suddenly lashed out at the Front National candidate when she accused him of being in favour of the burkini. He accused her of deliberately wanted to “divide French society”. This promises to be pretty dry ... Mélenchon says there should be a sixth Republic. Le Pen says 500,000 voters should be able to call a referendum. The people are sovereign, she says; the number of MPs and senators should be cut; and France’s regions should be scrapped. Hamon also calls for a sixth Republic, to “allow democracy to breathe”. Macron says he has started a new political movement, without public subsidy – this is a real exercise in democratic renewal, he says. He addresses the question of his campaign funding, the subject of some debate: it is funded by individuals giving between one and 7,500 euros, he says. Asked specifically whether he is funded by wealthy individuals form the pharmaceutical or oil industry, Macron says he pledges not to be influenced by anyone. Secularism is respect at every moment for the laws of the Republic, says Macron. It is a shield. Mélenchon says secularism is the separation of church and state and the absolute respect of liberty of conscience and freedom of belief. People are fed up with being hit over the head with secularism, he says. Hamon, essentially, agrees. Le Pen says secularism in France is threatened by rising Muslim fundamentalism: demands around dress, around food, around all sorts of issues. Nobody is looking the problem in the face, she says. Macron, Mélenchon and Hamon all react strongly to this. Macron accuses Le Pen, when she asked him what she thought of the burkini, at the centre of a major debate in France last summer, of trying to “divide French society”. Hamon says the proportion of immigrants living in France is fundamentally unchanged for decades. Of 100 people who leave their home country around the world, he says, only four come to Europe. Le Pen says she wants to “stop immigration. And I will not make any excuses for that”. She says national frontiers must be restored, “we can’t count on Greece”. France has seven million unemployed people and nine million living in poverty, she says: We have to put in place a policy to discourage immigration ... I understand why they want to come, but I am there to look after the interests of the French people. And she says at least four terrorists have entered France as refugees or migrants. This is a key theme of the campaign. Macron is first up: the real problem is illegal immigration, he says, and the first priority is an effective policy of sending back to their country of origin those who do not qualify for asylum. That requires a genuine pan-European immigration and asylum policy, he says. And never forget: someone asking for asylum is someone who has fled a brutal regime. France’s policy must be firm but fair. Fillon these are often not refugees – the immense majority are men and women fleeing poverty, not a brutal regime. He is in favour of quotas, “a very democratic system”, not for genuine asylum seekers but for economic migrants. “It is a fundamental question of control,” he says. Hamon says neighbourhood policing needs to be boosted, and police operating in sensitive areas should get a bonus. Hostility to the police must stop, he says. On the other hand, ID controls must stop discriminating against non-whites. Mélenchon says that in 10 years, parliament has passed 15 new security laws and none have ever been evaluated. Police are deeply unhappy, he says – but at the same time, “a certain part of the population is afraid of the police”. The “logic of confrontation” must stop. Macron says it’s important not to exaggerate. But security is a priority, he says. He will create a new form of neighbourhood policing for petty crime and delinquency, with officers able to hand out on-the-spot fines and judges able to order expulsions. Pragmatism, not grand principles, he says. On a follow-up question, Fillon says the age of criminal responsibility should be lowered to 16 from 18. Macron says that’s not necessary: France already has a functioning justice system for juveniles. Le Pen says 12,500 police and gendarmerie posts were cut under the presidency of Nicolas Sarkozy. The security forces must be strengthened, she says. She wants to create an extra 40,000 prison places, and stiffer penalties. Victims don’t understand why sentences are so short, she says. Fillon says France has the biggest debt of any major country, so Le Pen’s promises are not affordable. But crime and delinquency have increased, he says, so something has to be done. He suggests relieving police of their administrative burden and bringing in new staff to help. He says 16,000 new prison places will be sufficient – but above all, more respect for the police. Le Pen says 50% of primary school time must be devoted to learning French and lessons in children’s mother tongues should be scrapped. She too says professional training must be improved, and accuses the education ministry of neglecting this. Schools are not safe places, she says: teaches are insulted and abused. And secularism must be preserved. Hamon says French schoolchildren have the most demanding days of all pupils in Europe, and proposes limiting primary classes to 25. He says it is essential to hire 20,000 more teachers, and he promises more mixed intakes in secondary school, with larger catchment areas. The first question from the two journalists: what social model for France? Starting with education. Fillon says 150,000 French school pupils leave school without knowing the fundamentals. He says discipline is important, and school uniforms – almost unknown in France – would underline equality. Teachers should be better paid and better viewed. Emmanuel Macron says many 10- and 11 year-olds cannot properly read or write. In priority education areas, he says, he wants extra teaching hours and radically reduced class sizes, and far better vocational training. Mélenchon says he wants to hire far more teachers, and also laments the closure of 170 technical colleges across France in recent years. Vocational training from age 16 is vital, he says. Benoit Hamon asks whether the French want to be “warlike” or “fraternal” – what message do we want to send the world, he asks. I will be an honest, open and fair president, he says; I will turn the page on the old promises. Marine Le Pen says she does not want to be a president running a “vague region of the European Union”, submissive to Angela Merkel. The president must be the guarantor of national independence, she says, for which millions of French people have fought and died. That means the right for the French to choose their own path, she says. “The French must defend their interests.” I will be the president who gives the French back their voice. Emmanuel Macron says he has been a civil servant, a banker, and a minister. He has done “useful” things he says, but has also seen what blocks France and stops it advancing. The country is in a situation in which it has never found itself, he says. It faces new challenges, and the traditional politics cannot face up to the challenge. Jean-Luc Mélenchon says he will be the last president of the Fifth Republic. He says he will be a president for ecology and for peace. Kicking off is Francois Fillon. He regrets that the six other candidates in the first round are not participating. He says he would be the president who relieves the French of too much bureaucracy, who protects them, who allows France to become once more a major world power. I have a project for that, a project I have worked on for many years. The candidates have entered the studio and final preparations for the debate are underway – all smiles and handshakes for the ‘family photo’. “It’s going to be tough, it’s going to be physical,” says one of the TF1 presenters. “Nearly three hours of debate.” Observers have said Macron, the independent centrist who classifies himself as “neither left nor right”, could become a target for the other four who may unite to attack him from all sides. How well he stands up to the threat could be key to his success. Jerome Fourquet, director of polling at leading French pollster Ifop, said the stakes were “incredibly high” for Macron: He’s the front-runner and his centrist positioning means he will be attacked from both sides. Most French don’t know him well at this stage and they’ll be looking closely at his ability to take punches. According to the news magazine Marianne, each candidate will have two minutes to respond to the journalists’ questions, with their rivals able to interrupt after a minute and a half. Before the debate proper, they will each have 90 seconds to respond to the question “What kind of president would you be?” – with a similar amount of time at the end of debate to sum up. Answering political journalists Gilles Bouleau and Anne-Claire Coudray from France’s main commercial channel, TF1, the candidates will address three main themes: – What social model should France adopt (likely to cover the key campaign questions such as security, immigration and national identity) – Which economic model should France adopt (likely to address labour laws and France’s stubborn unemployment, social protection, tax and trade) – What place should France occupy in the world? (the European Union, control of France’s borders, terrorism) So after months of scandal, corruption allegations and infighting, voters will finally get to assess the different policy positions of the leading candidates. One of the many things that make this campaign intriguing is that neither of the two leading candidates, Le Pen and Macron, both on around 26% in the polls heading into the first round, represent the traditional parties of the centre-right (Les Républicains) and centre left (Parti Socialiste) that have dominated French politics since the war. Le Pen is standing on a populist, anti-immigration, anti-EU platform but her economic proposals look left wing. Macron is on the left as far as social issues are concerned, but a pro-business liberal economically. Fillon, who is polling around 17%, and Hamon (13%) are firmly on the right and left wings of their respective parties. Hit by allegations he paid his family to do fake parliamentary jobs, Fillon is a conservative Catholic who believes France needs a Thatcherite economic revolution; Hamon’s anti-austerity, pro-Europe programme includes the introduction of a minimum universal income. Jean-Luc Mélenchon, the far-left candidate, is on about 10%. Hello and welcome to the Guardian’s live coverage of the first televised debate between the leading candidates in France’s presidential election – one of the most keenly watched, and unpredictable, in recent memory. The event is unprecedented: in past elections, the two candidates who make it through to the second-round run-off have faced off against each other in TV debates that have sometimes proved critical to the poll’s outcome. This is the first time the campaign’s frontrunners have debated before the first round of the elections, due this year on 23 April (the second round follows a fortnight later on 7 May). Over the next two and a half hours, Marine Le Pen of the far-right Front National, independent centrist Emmanuel Macron, François Fillon of the centre-right Les Républicains, the Socialist party’s Benoît Hamon and hard-left firebrand Jean-Luc Mélenchon will outline their platforms for a studio audience of 420 and a TV audience of several million. I’ll be covering the event as it happens.

The Last Week Tonight host discussed the ex-reality TV star’s first budget proposal, referring to it as “a presidential moodboard. The moodboard of a president who can always be described as impatient, vain and horny for malice.” While we already know the key members in Trump’s cabinet, including Steve Bannon, who “constantly looks like he just woke up on a park bench after losing custody of his children”, this week gave us closer access to Mick Mulvaney, who took charge of the budget. In a television interview, he claimed that the key elements were assembled by rewatching Trump’s speeches and then using those promises to dictate where to either add or take away funds. “Basically Mulvaney treated Trump’s past statements the way Trump treats women: randomly singling out a few of them and then reducing them down to numbers,” Oliver said. He then replayed footage of Trump garbling incoherently about military spending, adding: “It sounds like the audiobook of A Farewell to Arms broadcast by an iPhone submerged in hot coffee.” He described his style as “fluent toddler psychopath”. In a previous statement, the secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, claimed that the US would be involved in less conflict with Trump as president. Oliver disputed this, saying: “He just needs one person to tell him that World War I was called the great war and he’s going to want to have a better one out of sheer pettiness.” Oliver went on to detail how many of the agencies being cut or eliminated barely cost anything. “You don’t cut those agencies as a cost measure, you do it as a fuck you,” he said. “It’s the budgetary equivalent of inviting Mitt Romney out to dinner at Jean-Georges before not offering him a cabinet position,” he said. “Trump is so consistently monstrous, sometimes out of sheer coincidence he happens to do something amazing. Trump is truly the stopped clock of assholes.” He finished by explaining that “some of the cuts in Trump’s budget heavily impact groups that voted for him”. He added: “Trump’s defenders will say that this is just him being a businessman. It’s a first offer, a negotiation, the sort of thing you could learn all about in his book The Art of the Wait, I Seem to be Betraying Everyone Who Supported Me, Ah Well, Forget It. Anyway, Let’s Talk About All The Trim I Got in the 80s, Right Fellas?

Robbie Power has the impaired vision when looking through the top of his left eye, a condition which would hardly affect most people but which is a fundamental problem for jockeys as a result of the bent-forward posture they are obliged to adopt in races. In Friday’s post-race photographs, Power could be seen with one eye wide open and the other almost closed, prompting social media comparisons with Arnold Schwarzenegger in The Terminator. Counterintuitively, Power reports that it is the more open eye, the left one, which is damaged. Power, who also won the 2007 Grand National on Silver Birch, was injured at the Galway Festival in July when he was an early faller in a 20-runner race over hurdles and was kicked as a horse passed above him. The blow broke a cheekbone and caused a complex fracture of his left eye-socket, with additional damage to the muscle on the floor of his eye-bed. While the other symptoms passed, Power’s vision did not recover and it appeared that his career in the saddle might be over. The 35-year-old credits the Dublin-based ophthalmologist Ian Flitcroft for the fact that he was eventually able to return to the saddle in October. Two months later, he was given the ride on Sizing John, who carried him to Cheltenham glory on Friday. “I wear specially treated goggles to correct the double vision,” Power said on Monday. “It doesn’t affect me in everyday life. I can still drive and everything else is fine. It’s only a problem when you’re on a horse, looking out of the top of your eyeball. “Ian Flitcroft came up with the idea. He said I was the first jockey he’s worked with but he’s worked with swimmers and snooker players before. “I’d say the muscles on the floor of the eye-bed have gone. It would probably take surgery to fix them and I’ve been told that surgery is an option.” But Power added that he was not tempted by surgery, given how well the corrective goggles have worked for him. Power could arguably be at a disadvantage relative to other jump jockeys when the mud is flying, circumstances in which some jockeys wear several pairs of goggles and pull down the outermost set if they become muck-spattered. When that happens, Power’s only option is to try wiping away the mud with his fingers, but it didn’t stop him riding winners through a typically wet Irish winter. Nor was the Galway fall his only recent injury, as he ruptured a disc in his back in January, requiring an epidural injection as part of his treatment. It was an unpromising buildup to last week’s Cheltenham Festival, where he then rode three winners, his first successes in Britain since 2011. Of Sizing John, he said: “I rode him for the first time at Christmas and made the suggestion he should go up in distance. I’ve always had great faith in the horse, I believed he’d stay the trip. We had the homecoming last night in Moone [the horse’s home village in Kildare], which was very exciting. “It was an unbelievable feeling. I’d say I appreciated it more than winning the National because I’m 35 now, not 25. But they’re the two biggest races in jump racing. I’m very lucky to have won both.” Exeter 2.00 Taurian 2.30 Alfie’s Choice 3.05 Galactic Power 3.40 Clan Des Obeaux 4.15 Kap Jazz 4.50 Kapgarde King (nb) 5.25 Canford Chimes Southwell 2.10 Brigadoon

为了实现“陆上行舟”的梦想，中国政府尝试了各种各样的方法。为建设甘肃省兰州新区，从2012年起相关部门累计拆除和搬迁了数千座高山和村庄。 在这里，政府兴建了自贸区，干旱的土地上挖出了人工湖，而后还陆续修建了640多公里的道路，诸多高楼大厦也是拔地而起。英语的广告牌用大号的彩色字符描绘着这座中国新建城市的美好愿景：“与众不凡！充满活力！全新天地！” 然而，城市规划专家们并没有就此停下脚步。为了吸引外来人口来到这个偏远又人口稀少的地区，当地官员下令在这里复制修建了一系列中外名胜古迹，比如埃及的狮身人面像、希腊的帕特农神庙、北京的颐和园和紫禁城，甚至还有一小段的万里长城。 不仅如此，当地政府还修建了一个恐龙王国。不久的将来，中国游客就可以在这个三叠纪主题公园里看到各种超大规模的肉食恐龙模型了。 不少人都看中了这里的商机，徐海克 便是其中一员。他刚刚来到兰州新区开了一家宾馆，他认为这个恐龙王国“就像是一个迷你的迪斯尼乐园”。 ‘西部大开发’ 兰州新区被认为是本世纪初中国政府大规模西部大开发的其中一环。 兰州是甘肃省的省会，黄河从这个烟雾笼罩的工业中心城市蜿蜒流过。新建的兰州新区就位于兰州市区以北60多公里之外。兰州老城区人口总数约为360万，其中有近16万人是回族。多年以来，兰州的空气、水质和土壤污染都是“远近闻名”。直到近些年来，当地政府才开始采取措施治理污染，并且已经取得了一些成就。 “西部大开发”计划号召将中国东部的富裕省份资源向欠发达的内陆地区倾斜，让像青海、四川和甘肃这样的落后省份也能有机会实现翻天覆地的变化。 除了展开数万公里的公路铁路交通建设外，西部大开发计划还宣布将在中国南部和西南地区新建一系列城市枢纽。 韦德·谢帕德是一位美国作家。过去十年，他一直在记录着这些新城区的发展变化。他表示，自2008年危机以来，为提振整体经济发展，中国政府斥巨资进行基础设施建设，由此也掀起了内陆地区的建设狂潮。 他表示：“全国各地都是一样的。政府官员被告知要积极走出去，大力提振国内生产总值，以满足中国整体城市化行动要求。基本上所有层级的政府部门都有权利建设新城，所以他们就开始不断地扩张、建设、再建设。” 然而，这也存在着一个问题。 多数情况下，民众并不会立即就搬到这些新城去，声名狼藉的中国“鬼城”也就此产生；这些空荡荡的城市外壳更像是起重机的库房，而不是居住的场所。 谢帕德在《中国鬼城》一书中记录了这类城市的崛起过程。他表示：“这些超级新城有的规模甚至比曼哈顿还要大，刚刚建好的时候古怪极了，你简直不敢相信眼前的一切。” “这些城市里到处都是高大的建筑物，在这里你可以找到包括商场、银行和政府大楼等一切一般城市所应具备的功能。但就是没有人。这让人感觉仿佛置身梦境之中，好像黎明破晓你突然醒来，发现周围所有人都不见了，你是这世界上唯一的一个人。” 兰州新区是2012年习近平主席上任之前最后一个获批建设的国家级新城。鉴于地方债务影响日渐明显，习主席叫停了这类超大规模项目建设，转而寻求一种更具可持续性的城市化模式。 兰州新区建设项目是在习主席上任之前的几个月得到中央批复的。项目刚一立项，当地政府就为这个尚未破土动工的新城树立了一系列的宏伟目标。 例如，到2020年，兰州新区将拥有5座医院、75座学校和幼儿园，国内生产总值要达到1000亿元人民币。到2030年，兰州新区常住居民总数将达到100万人，国内生产总值将增长两倍，最终达到2700亿元人民币。 这次的新城建设项目将会移除上百座荒山，被称成为“全球规模最大的移山项目”，也好比一个好莱坞风格的大片，令人激动的背景音乐，闪烁的霓虹灯，勾画着生机勃勃的未来城市——这里经济强盛，娱乐产业和高新技术汇聚，满心欢喜的城市居民在绿化完善的公园中散步，或者是在城市湖区上驾着快艇四处畅游。 兰州新区的英文官方网站向投资者许诺，这里将实现“大规模的经济财富积累”。 人们花了好长时间才从这样的梦境中回到现实里。2013年，我第一次来到兰州新区。村民们与开放商就征地拆迁达成了一致，新建的城区空空荡荡的，散发着一种诡异的安静气氛。完全见不到一般中国城市车水马龙、熙熙攘攘的样子。还有不少高楼处于建设之中，但是除了工地工人， 街上似乎很难再看到其他人。来到这里的中外记者都认为，兰州新区建设是失败的。 四年后我再次回到这里，随着商品楼中的住户不断增加，外来人口不断涌入，我发现这座沉睡的“西部巨人”似乎正慢慢苏醒。 谢帕德曾先后两次来到兰州新城，他坚持说：“现在人们开始不断在新区购房置业，陆搬了进来。这听起来似乎有些不可能，但是兰州新区的确是在逐渐苏醒。它就好像沙漠中的幻影一般，在遥远的地平线边闪闪发着光。你看到了它，但还不大确定它是不是真实的存在——突然之间，你就发现自己已经置身于新城之中了。” 当地官员没有接受《卫报》关于吸引居住人口进程的相关采访。但是兰州新区党委书记徐大武在一次政府宣传中表示，目前兰州新区已经成功吸引了15万常住居民，临时居住在这里的还有近4万建筑工人。 这些数据有被夸大的成分，兰州新区的街道和楼盘依旧空荡荡。 李振江 是当地的房产中介，他略为不好意思地跟我们说：“这个开发项目还在继续”。说话的功夫他走入了这个已经基本被荒废的商场里——四周满是灰尘，看起来荒废了有阵子了，说不上几年，但是至少也有几个月了。 中央电视台去年的一次专题报道指出，这里实际的居民总数大约为4万人，其中很大一部分是回迁的当地农民，还有一些是被强制迁入的国企员工。目前官网的最新数字显示，兰州新区现有8万常住居民。 不管真实的数字到底是多少，随着越来越多的人来到打拼，兰州新区已经开始有了小范围的生活气息。 小店店主张永帅去年8月带着两个年幼的儿子从兰州市区来到了这里。他表示，低廉的租金和对新生活的期望是吸引他来到这个城市化前沿地区的主要原因。他在名为绿地智慧金融城的小区租了一个门面。这个小区里既有高层住宅，也有豪华别墅，占地面积虽广，但是入住的居民却寥寥无几。 这位23岁的店主告诉我们：“这里的基础设施都是最好的，比如道路和广场。这里的居住环境要比兰州市区好。” 不过他也承认，新区的发展并不是完全符合他的预想。他笑着说：“最大的问题就是没什么人。但是我认为总有一天大家都会来到这儿的。要是没人来，那这么大的地方不就浪费了嘛，对吧？” 周飞 一家就住在附近，他们算是张家为数不多的邻居。周飞也很看好新区的发展，他认为这里会越来越繁华的。周飞来自东水塘，那里的农村土地因为新区开发都被征用了。他用政府给的拆迁补偿款在这里买了一套房子。 但周飞的妻子包珊 却对这里一成不变的萧条生活没什么好印象。在这个被他们称作“家”的高层小区里仅仅住了20户人家。她说：“我不喜欢这种清静，而且生意也不好做。” 但是周飞还是对这个正在有所起色的“鬼城”充满了希望，毕竟他们也没有什么退路了，原来的村子不剩下什么了，所有的东西都被拆了。 徐海科 是另一个对兰州新区的腾飞充满希望的外来移民 。他去年5月来到这里，帮助管理新区唯一的一家豪华酒店——滨湖国际花园酒店。 徐海科表示，兰州新区是鬼城的说法到目前为止还有一半的准确性。但是他坚称，他所在的这家拥有76间客房的酒店正在稳步向前发展。他在空荡荡的大堂里接受了《卫报》的采访时表示，酒店日常的入住率可以达到70%，而事实上采访当天的入住率仅有3成。 这座新城正在逐渐被填满。不过夜幕降临时街道两边零星的灯光告诉我们，实现真正的宜居，兰州新城还有很长的路要走。徐海科笑着说：“就好像我们已经把房子建好了，但是家具还没运到。” 兰州新区里最具人气的是有着2万住户的彩虹城。这个高层住宅小区是专门为回迁的村民和新区建设移民民工而建的。 几天前的一个下午，一群孩子从粉刷得色彩斑斓的幼儿园里跑向一个热闹的中心广场。 32岁的刘玉凤 是一个孩子的母亲，家里因为拆迁搬到了新区，她认为新区建设改变了他们的生活轨迹。“应该说是好坏参半吧。居住条件是改善了不少，但是我们在这里找不到谋生的机会。” 刘玉凤说，她庆幸女儿再也不用像以前在村里那样去户外上厕所了。“冬天去那样的厕所对孩子来说太危险了。但是现在的关键问题在于：我们到哪儿去赚钱？这对我们来说才是最重要的。” 许多人仍对中国鬼城出现生机的说法表示怀疑。去年，一家政府智库机构指出，目前中国新区建设速度过快，累计可容纳居民总数大约为34亿，是中国全国人口总数的两倍之多。 但谢帕德表示，兰州新区等地的初步发展证明，外界对中国新城的定论还为时过早， 只关注了轰动一时的鬼城效应，而非全面的评估。 谢帕德在对鬼城的描述中开玩笑说：“这是一次前所未有的‘疯狂的’中国故事。” “新城都是按照20年的时间线来规划建设的。所以他们会说，‘现在是2003年。到2030年，这里就会有30万甚至是100万居民了’。” “现在许多项目还处于建设中，我们不能指望哪个国家在短短6年时间里就建好一个新城，并且让里面住满人，对吧？ 那太荒谬了。” “中国政府并不在乎西方世界如何看待他们的新城建设，因为他们了解自己的规划，他们知道这些地方未来应该怎么开发，他们明白压根就没有鬼城这种东西。这充其量就是一个发展阶段——从城市核心区域建好，到15年后新城与旧城、城市与国家连接起来，这就是一个必经阶段。” 兰州新区的开拓者们寄希望于这样的预测在未来能够实现。 习近平主席的第一个任期内提出了丝绸之路经济带，兰州恰好在这个主要经济发展推动计划之中。这也让当地政府和民众相信，兰州的经济一定会实现腾飞。 谢帕德表示：“这是一个国家级的项目，这意味着肯定会取得成功。没有别的可能，这么大的项目是承受不起失败的结果的。” 小店店主周飞相信兰州新区总有一天能与兰州旧城匹敌。他预计“再过个5到8年，兰州新区会变得更发达。到时候就会跟兰州市区一样了。”

Lenin’s love of literature shaped the Russian Revolution","bodyText":"Literature shaped the political culture of the Russia in which Vladimir Ilyich Lenin grew up. Explicitly political texts were difficult to publish under the tsarist regime. The rasher essayists were holed up in asylums until they “recovered”: in other words, until they publicly recanted their views. Novels and poetry, meanwhile, were treated more leniently – though not in every instance. The chief censor was, of course, the tsar. In the case of Pushkin, the “father of the people”, Nicholas I, insisted on reading many of his verses before they went to the printer. Some, as a result, were forbidden, others delayed, and the most subversive were destroyed by the frightened poet himself, fearful that his house might be raided. We will never know what the burnt verses of Eugene Onegin contained. Nonetheless, politics by other means and in a variety of different registers permeated Russian fiction in a manner without parallel in any other European country. As far as politicised literature and literary criticism went, the Russian intelligentsia were spoilt for choice. They devoured the acrimonious conflict between the powerful critic Vissarion Belinsky and the dramatist and novelist Nikolai Gogol, whose cutting 1842 satire Dead Souls had invigorated the country and been read aloud to the illiterate. Success, however, proved to be Gogol’s undoing. In a subsequent work, he recanted, writing of stench-ridden peasants and defending illiteracy. In the preface to the second edition of Dead Souls, he wrote: “Much in this book has been written wrongly, not as things are really happening in the land of Russia. I ask you, dear reader, to correct me. Do not spurn this matter. I ask you to do it.” Angered, Belinsky broke publicly with him in 1847. Belinsky’s widely circulated “Letter to Gogol” gave the recipient a long, sleepless night: I know the Russian public a little. Your book alarmed me by the possibility of its exercising a bad influence on the government and the censorship, but not on the public. When it was rumoured in St Petersburg that the government intended to publish your book [Selected Passages from Correspondence With Friends] in many thousands of copies and to sell it at an extremely low price, my friends grew despondent; but I told them then and there that the book, despite everything, would have no success and that it would soon be forgotten. In fact it is now better remembered for the articles that have been written about it than for the book itself. Yes, the Russian has a deep, though still undeveloped, instinct for truth. In later years, critics became much more vicious, lambasting novelists and playwrights whose work they considered to be insufficiently empowering. This, then, was the intellectual atmosphere in which Lenin came of age. His father, a highly cultured conservative, was the chief inspector of schools in his region and much respected as an educationalist. At home, Shakespeare, Goethe and Pushkin, among others, were read aloud on Sunday afternoons. It was impossible for the Ulyanov family – “Lenin” was a pseudonym adopted to outwit the tsarist secret police – to escape high culture. At high school, Lenin fell in love with Latin. His headteacher had high hopes that he might become a philologist and Latin scholar. History willed otherwise, but Lenin’s passion for Latin, and taste for the classics, never left him. He read Virgil, Ovid, Horace and Juvenal in the original, as well as Roman senatorial orations. He devoured Goethe during his two decades in exile, reading and rereading Faust many times. Lenin put his knowledge of the classics to good use in the time leading up to the October revolution of 1917. In April of that year, he broke with Russian social-democratic orthodoxy and, in a set of radical theses, called for a socialist revolution in Russia. A number of his own close comrades denounced him. In a sharp riposte, Lenin quoted Mephistopheles from Goethe’s masterwork: “Theory, my friend, is grey, but green is the eternal tree of life.” Lenin knew better than most that classical Russian literature had always been infused with politics. Even the most “apolitical” of writers had found it difficult to conceal their contempt for the state of the country. Ivan Goncharov’s novel Oblomov was a case in point. Lenin loved this work. It depicted the inertia, indolence and emptiness of the landed gentry. The book’s success was celebrated by the entry of a new word into the Russian lexicon: oblomovism, which became a term of abuse for the class that helped the autocracy survive for so long. Lenin would later argue that this disease was not confined to the upper classes alone, but had infected large sections of the tsarist bureaucracy and filtered downwards. Even Bolshevik apparatchiks were not immune. This was a case where the mirror held up by Goncharov really did reflect society at large. In his polemics, Lenin often attacked his opponents by comparing them to almost always unpleasant and sometimes minor characters drawn from Russian fiction. Where the country’s writers differed (and they were not alone in this, of course) was on the means necessary to topple the regime. Pushkin supported the 1825 Decembrist uprising that challenged the succession of Nicholas I. Gogol satirised the oppressions of serfdom before rapidly retreating. Turgenev was critical of tsarism but disliked intensely the nihilists who preached terror. Dostoevsky’s flirtation with anarcho-terrorism was transformed into its stunted opposite after a terrible murder in St Petersburg. Tolstoy’s assault on Russian absolutism delighted Lenin, but the count’s mystical Christianity and pacifism left him cold. How, Lenin asked, could such a gifted writer be a revolutionary and a reactionary at the same time? Over the course of half a dozen articles, Lenin unpicked the deep contradictions at play in Tolstoy’s work. Lenin’s Tolstoy was capable of providing a lucid diagnosis – his novels recognised and expressed the economic exploitation and collective anger of the peasants – but not of formulating a cure. Instead of imagining a properly revolutionary future, Tolstoy had sought consolation in the utopian image of a simpler, Christian past. In “Leo Tolstoy as the Mirror of the Russian Revolution”, Lenin wrote that “the contradictions in Tolstoy’s views and doctrines are not accidental; they express the contradictory conditions of Russian life in the last third of the 19th century”. Tolstoy’s contradictions thus served as a useful guide for Lenin’s political analysis. Meanwhile, Lenin was repelled by Dostoevsky’s “cult of suffering”, though the power of his writing was undeniable. Lenin’s views on literature did not, however, become state policy. Just under a year after the revolution, on 2 August 1918, the newspaper Izvestia published a list of people, nominated by readers, to whom monuments were proposed. Dostoevsky was second, after Tolstoy. The monument was unveiled in Moscow in November of that year by the representative of the Moscow Soviet, with a tribute by the symbolist poet Vyacheslav Ivanov. The writer who had perhaps the strongest impact on Lenin – on, indeed, an entire generation of radicals and revolutionaries – was Nikolay Chernyshevsky. Chernyshevsky was the son of a priest, as well as a materialist philosopher and socialist. His utopian novel What Is to Be Done? was written in the Peter and Paul Fortress in St Petersburg, where he had been incarcerated because of his political beliefs. What Is to Be Done? became the bible of a new generation. The fact that it had been smuggled out of prison gave it an added aura. This was the book that radicalised Lenin, long before he encountered Marx (with whom Chernyshevsky had exchanged letters). As a homage to the old radical populist, Lenin titled his first major political work, written and published in 1902, What Is to Be Done? The enormous success of Chernyshevsky’s novel greatly irritated the established novelists, Turgenev in particular, who attacked the book viciously. This bile was countered with a burning lash of nettles from the radical critics Dobrolyubov (regarded by students as “our Diderot”) and Pisarev. Turgenev was livid. Encountering Chernyshevsky at a public event, he shouted: “You’re a snake and that Dobrolyubov is a rattlesnake.” What of the novel that was the subject of so much controversy? Over the last 50 years I have made three attempts to read every single page, and all three attempts have failed. It is not a classic of Russian literature. It was of its time and played a crucial role in the post-terrorist phase of the Russian intelligentsia. It is undoubtedly very radical on every front, especially gender equality and relations between men and women, but also on how to struggle, how to delineate the enemy and how to live by certain rules. Vladimir Nabokov loathed Chernyshevsky but found it impossible to ignore him. In his last Russian novel, The Gift, he devoted 50 pages to belittling and mocking the writer and his circle, but admitted that there “was quite definitively a smack of class arrogance about the attitudes of contemporary well-born writers towards the plebeian Chernyshevsky” and, in private, that “Tolstoy and Turgenev called him the ‘bed-bug stinking gentleman’ … and jeered at him in all kinds of ways”. Their jeers were partly born of jealousy, since the subject of their snobbery was extremely popular with the young, and born also, in the case of Turgenev, of a deep and ingrained political hostility to a writer who wanted a revolution to destroy the landed estates and distribute the land to the peasants. Lenin used to get cross with young Bolsheviks visiting him in exile, during the inter-revolutionary years between 1905 and 1917, when they teased him about Chernyshevsky’s book and told him it was unreadable. They were too young to appreciate its depth and vision, he retorted. They should wait till they were 40. Then they would understand that Chernyshevsky’s philosophy was based on simple facts: we were descended from the apes and not Adam and Eve; life was a short-lived biological process, hence the need to bring happiness to every individual. This was not possible in a world dominated by greed, hatred, war, egoism and class. That was why a social revolution was necessary. By the time the young Bolsheviks climbing Swiss mountains with Lenin were approaching 40, however, the revolution had already taken place. Chernyshevsky would now be read largely by historians studying the evolution of Lenin’s thought. Erudite party progressives happily moved on to Mayakovsky. Not Lenin. The classicism that was so deeply rooted in Lenin acted as a bulwark to seal him from the exciting new developments in art and literature that had both preceded and accompanied the revolution. Lenin found it difficult to make any accommodations to modernism in Russia or elsewhere. The work of the artistic avant garde – Mayakovsky and the constructivists – was not to his taste. In vain did the poets and artists tell him that they, too, loved Pushkin and Lermontov, but that they were also revolutionaries, challenging old art forms and producing something very different and new that was more in keeping with Bolshevism and the age of revolution. He simply would not budge. They could write and paint whatever they wanted, but why should he be forced to appreciate it? Many of Lenin’s colleagues were more sympathetic to the new movements. Bukharin, Lunacharsky, Krupskaya, Kollontai and, to a certain degree, Trotsky understood how the revolutionary spark had opened up new vistas. There were conflicts, hesitations and contradictions within the avant garde as well, and their supporter in the government was Anatoly Lunacharsky at the People’s Commissariat for Education, where Lenin’s wife, Nadya Krupskaya, worked as well. Shortages of paper during the civil war led to fierce arguments. Should they publish propaganda leaflets or a new poem by Mayakovsky? Lenin insisted on the first option. Lunacharsky was convinced that Mayakovsky’s poem would be far more effective and, on this occasion, he won. Lenin was also hostile to any notion of a “proletarian literature and art”, insisting that the peaks of bourgeois culture (and its more ancient predecessors) could not be transcended by mechanical and dead formulae advanced in a country where the level of culture, in the broadest sense, was far too low. Shortcuts in this field would never work, something that was proved conclusively by the excremental “socialist realism” introduced in the bad years that followed Lenin’s death. Creativity was numbed. The leap from the kingdom of necessity to the kingdom of freedom, where the lives of all would be shaped by reason, was never made in the Soviet Union – or, for that matter, anywhere else. • Tariq Ali’s The Dilemmas of Lenin: Terrorism, War, Empire, Love, Rebellion is published next month by Verso.

The Smart Set wasn’t doing so well – but Mencken had an idea. He had noticed that a periodical called Detective Story Magazine, was flying off newsstands, so he started his own crime pulp: Black Mask, the first issue of which landed in October 1920, complete with a woman being menaced with a burning branding iron on the cover. Mencken had no illusions about Black Mask, writing to a friend that it was “a lousy magazine” but “it has kept us alive during a very bad year”. After just eight issues, Mencken and Nathan sold it on to a Madison Avenue publishing company – but there it pioneered a brand new genre: the hardboiled detective story. Hardboiled is all about cynical, complex detectives; think of Humphrey Bogart’s turns as Raymond Chandler’s Philip Marlowe or Dashiell Hammett’s private eye, Sam Spade. What’s now considered the first hardboiled story was published by Black Mask in 1922: The False Burton Combs, written by Carroll John Daly (“I ain’t a crook; just a gentleman adventurer and make my living working against the law breakers. Not that work I with the police – no, not me. I’m no knight errant either.” The archetype was born: men out for justice and/or revenge, pounding perpetually rainy streets in a dark American city. But isn’t he an anachronism today? “I suspect he always was,” says author Lawrence Block, who has been writing noir for 60 years. “Which is not to say that there aren’t a fair number of such lads walking around at present. I suppose the character owes much of his appeal to being the sort of person the reader would be if he could.” Amid an explosion of pulp crime magazines – Dime Detective, Detective Tales, Strange Detective, Ace G-Man Stories – in the 20s and 30s, Black Mask would publish some of the greats: Hammett’s The Maltese Falcon, early stories by Chandler, and Erle Stanley Gardner. As postwar paperbacks took off in the 50s, the market began to decline, but some periodicals endured – including Manhunt, on which a teenage Block got his big break in 1957, with You Can’t Lose. Now 78, Block is the writer behind creations including alcoholic ex-cop turned private eye Matthew Scudder and gentleman burglar Bernie Rhodenbarr. Isn’t it tough to make readers embrace heroes with ambiguous morality? “Is it?” says Block. “I wonder. I guess I assume that if I can sympathise with a character, so can a reader. And if I can’t connect with the essential humanity of any of my characters, then I’m doing something wrong.” Block’s early books are still published today – by Hard Case Crime, an imprint set up by Charles Ardai and Max Phillips to both bring lost noir classics back into print and to find new voices working the beat today. “We both grew up loving old paperback crime novels, but we were born too late to write books like those ourselves,” Ardai says. “Fifty years later, when we started writing novels, there were no more publishers left.” Is the form still relevant? Ardai thinks so. “Some of it is nostalgia, sure – the appeal of the period trappings: the men in trenchcoats and fedoras, the femme fatale in her negligee, gun in hand. But nostalgia only gets you so far. It might make you pick up one book once, but it won’t make you buy another every month.” “I think crime fiction is one of the most resilient and flexible means to tell a story,” says Alex Segura, author of a series of hardboiled detective stories starring PI Pete Fernandez. “It allows you to touch on social issues, on the inner quests and struggles we all face, and spin a compelling yarn at the same time. Especially now, with all the uncertainty we’re facing politically, the hardboiled PI – whose primary function is to ask the tough questions and press forward against stronger forces that don’t want their secrets uncovered – and the crime genre are all the more essential,” Segura says. “The PI will always be struggling to find answers to questions that people want to bury. That’s always interesting, and sadly, very relevant now.” The best noir stories, Ardai says, could have been written today, even if they’re 50, 60, 70 years old. “Corruption and violence are hardly things of the past. Men in power taking advantage of the weak and getting away with murder – that’s the stuff of headlines today,” he says. “People turning to crime in desperation or out of frustration and anger. Frightened men on the run, or vengeful ones on the hunt – when did that ever go out of date?” The only thing to go out of date is the idea that dames can’t write. Christa Faust sold her first story when she moved to Los Angeles in the early 90s and writes for Hard Case Crime. Her books have titles such as Choke Hold and Money Shot. Faust likes the form, despite how women are treated in them – slapped at the nearest sign of emotion and usually the murder victim. “They’re like a form of time travel,” she says. “But I also like living in an era when I can be taken seriously, don’t need to have children to be considered a ‘real’ woman and can legally marry anyone I love.” What bothers her is when modern writers use the excuse “that’s just how things were then” to write what she calls “fan fiction that indulges all their own sexist fantasies and juvenile wish fulfilment”. The ol’ broad-slapping archetype is less crucial to the genre than, say, the complexities of a gumshoe’s moral code. “Way too many modern writers and film-makers get hung up on the fedora and forget that real noir is about what’s going on underneath the hats,” says Faust. “Those original novels and movies already exist. Why copy them exactly if you aren’t bringing anything fresh to the table?” The essence of the hardboiled character is as vital today as it was then, says Faust. “If you mean a complex, conflicted loner with a generally cynical worldview who gets mixed up in criminal endeavours but maintains a strong, though often unconventional, moral code. A wise-cracking, ruggedly handsome middle-aged white guy in a fedora and trenchcoat who slaps women and then kisses them? Maybe not so much.” Charles Ardai needs a lot of convincing if he’s going to take on your hardboiled novel for Hard Case Crime. “You have to bring something new either way, or else the reader will be bored. It’s no fun at all to read cliches or stories that feel like you’ve read them a hundred times before,” he says. “Yes, we all love Chandler, but we already have one of him. We already have Elmore Leonard. We don’t need more imitations of those great men. But a new voice, one that makes the pages race by and your heart race as you turn them? That we always need. And happily, that’s what we keep discovering, year after year.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"film/2017/mar/20/power-rangers-first-gay-superhero-becky-g","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2017-03-20T14:55:00Z","webTitle":"Power Rangers features first gay screen superhero","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/mar/20/power-rangers-first-gay-superhero-becky-g","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2017/mar/20/power-rangers-first-gay-superhero-becky-g","fields":{"headline":"Power Rangers features first gay screen superhero","bodyText":"Power Rangers is set to become the first major superhero film to feature an out gay protagonist. According to early reviews of the film, the character of Trini the Yellow Ranger, played by the pop star and actor Becky G, is revealed in one scene to be having “girlfriend problems”, a moment that the film’s director has described as “pivotal” in the film. “For Trini, really she’s questioning a lot about who she is,” Power Rangers director Dean Israelite told the Hollywood Reporter. “She hasn’t fully figured it out yet. I think what’s great about that scene and what that scene propels for the rest of the movie is, ‘That’s OK.’ The movie is saying, ‘That’s OK,’ and all of the kids have to own who they are and find their tribe.” LGBT superheroes have been a mainstay in comic books in recent years, with Wonder Woman, Batwoman and Iceman each appearing as gay or bisexual at some point during their runs. But depictions of LGBT superheroes have been largely absent from film. Marvel’s antihero Deadpool, who identifies as pansexual, was one recent prominent big-screen exception – although he wasn’t shown having a non-heterosexual experience in the film. The news about the Yellow Ranger comes shortly after Disney revealed that the character of LeFou in the live-action version of Beauty and the Beast is gay. The “exclusively gay moment”, as Beauty and the Beast director Bill Condon described it, received much attention in the build-up to the film’s release. Russian cinemas handed it an adults-only rating, and censors in Malaysia requested the scene be cut. Disney has refused to remove the scene and postponed the film’s Malaysian release date. The controversy has done little harm to Beauty and the Beast’s standing at the box office, where it enjoyed a record-breaking weekend across the globe.

Actually, the book, composed in a hurry to forestall his rivals, after 20 years of research, and aimed at that mythical beast “the educated general reader”, is extraordinarily accessible, sometimes even moving, in its lucid simplicity. That’s all the more remarkable for a revolutionary work of scientific theory, arguably the most important book published in the English language during the 19th century. From a 21st-century perspective, Darwin’s Origin has two roles in this list. First, it is a profoundly influential work of biology, argued in astonishing, and compelling detail. For example, one famous passage (too long to quote in full) describes the ecological benefits to “a large and extremely barren heath” derived from the planting of Scotch fir: “I went to several points of view, whence I could examine hundreds of acres of the unenclosed heath, and literally I could not see a single Scotch fir, except the old planted clumps. But on looking closely between the stems of the heath, I found a multitude of seedlings and little trees, which had been perpetually browsed down by the cattle. In one square yard … I counted 32 little trees; and one of them, judging from the rings of growth, had during 26 years tried to raise its head above the stems of the heath, and had failed. No wonder that, as soon as the land was enclosed, it became thickly clothed with vigorously growing young firs.” [pp 123-24] Second, The Origin of Species was also a controversial and popular title that caught the imagination of the mid-Victorian public, transformed attitudes to Christianity and the human race, and would become a source book for generations of capitalists, communists and, ultimately, the Nazis. As the author of radical thought, grounded in profound observation, Darwin was described as “the most dangerous man in England”, whose account of natural selection challenged the “truth” of the Bible, the automatic authority of God in nature, and the privileged position of the human animal at the centre of creation. Darwin’s plan had always been to write a much longer book about the vulnerability of the species. When his friend and colleague Alfred Russel Wallace sent him a paper setting out the theory of natural selection, an idea inspired by a reading of Thomas Malthus on population growth, Darwin was immediately provoked into getting a lifetime of work and speculation into print before any rival established a competitive version. As it turned out, Darwin had no need to worry. Although John Murray, his publisher, was unsure about the market, and initially printed just 1,250 copies, this edition (now incredibly rare) sold out on the first day. The question of survival in Victorian society was highly topical, and Darwin’s account of natural selection caught the public mood. He himself was quite tentative about his new theory, and always stressed the length of time involved in the process of species adaptation: “Its action depends on there being places in the polity of nature, which can be better occupied by some of the inhabitants of the country undergoing modification of some kind … The action of natural selection will probably still oftener depend on some of the inhabitants becoming slowly modified; the mutual relations of many of the other habitants being thus disturbed.” Darwin goes on: “Owing to this struggle for life, any variation, however slight and from whatever cause proceeding, if it be in any degree profitable to an individual of any species, in its infinitely complex relations to other organic beings and to external nature, will tend to the preservation of that individual, and will generally be inherited by its offspring … I have called this principle, by which each slight variation, if useful, is preserved, by the term of Natural Selection, in order to mark its relation to man’s power of selection.” As many critics have noted, The Origin is a polemical book written in a mild, sometimes defensive, and uncontentious way by a passionate, lifelong naturalist with a deep reverence for nature. Darwin’s dithyrambic conclusion is celebrated: “It is interesting to contemplate an entangled bank, clothed with many plants of many kinds, with birds singing on the bushes, with various insects flitting about, and with worms crawling through the damp earth, and to reflect that these elaborately constructed forms, so different from each other, and dependent on each other in so complex a manner, have all been produced by laws acting around us … Thus, from the war of nature, from famine and death, the most exalted object which we are capable of conceiving, namely, the production of the higher animals, directly follows. There is grandeur in this view of life, with its several powers, having been originally breathed into a few forms or into one; and that, whilst this planet has gone cycling on according to the fixed law of gravity, from so simple a beginning endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been, and are being, evolved.” This is a side of The Origin rooted in Darwin’s love of the English countryside. In Victorian society, there were many harsher aspects. For Marx and Engels, Darwinism was the biological equivalent of class war. For some Americans, such as Andrew Carnegie and Teddy Roosevelt, his ideas explained the dynamics of capitalism. To the imperial powers who were drifting towards war in the 1900s, war – some said – was a “biological necessity”. Many of Darwin’s apologists have given his ideas a bad name. But, at its humane and deeply reflective heart, this pioneering book is a secular hymn to the countryside, the place in which Darwin himself was always happiest. A signature sentence “What a struggle between the several kinds of trees must here have gone on during long centuries, each annually scattering its seeds by the thousand; what war between insect and insect – between insects, snails, and other animals with birds and beasts of prey – all striving to increase, and all feeding on each other or on the trees or their seeds and seedlings, or on the other plants which first clothed the ground and thus checked the growth of the trees!” Three to compare Gilbert White: The Natural History and Antiquities of Selborne (1789) Thomas Malthus: An Essay on the Principle of Population (1798) Charles Darwin: The Voyage of the Beagle (1839) • On the Origin of Species by Charles Darwin is available in Penguin Classics (£8.99).

As you travel along the Red Sea coast from Hurghada, through Safaga, and El Quseir, the litter-strewn landscape of low hills and desert occasionally gives way to tourism developments and scattered international hotels. Their gardens are still maintained and the palm trees watered, but call in for a drink and the bars and pools are emptier than their designers expected. Equally, many hotels were never completed and desert-worn signs featuring smiling couples who will never visit, lend a post-apocalyptic air. The figures speak for themselves. From a high point in October 2010 of almost one and a half million, tourist arrivals in Egypt were a little under 500, 000 in September 2016; a continuation of a slow decline, (punctuated with significant dips in numbers following acts of terrorism). Egypt’s’ tourism minister, Yehia Rashed, has his work cut out and is on record as stating the country is now safe for tourists. As a regular visitor, I personally feel safe. The request for a bribe though, from the police officer at the gates of Hurghada’s new airport, when a fellow traveller didn’t have their printed flight coupon handy, suggests not all is not quite as it should be. Think of tourism in Egypt, and you’ll be forgiven for thinking of crowded markets in Cairo, the splendours of Giza and Abu Simbel, but this would be missing a major contribution to the tourism economy. The Red Sea and its treasures are less well known internationally than King Tut’s mask or the sphinx, yet staff at dive centres in Sharm El Sheikh on the Sinai Peninsula will tell you that one famous shipwreck – the SS Thistlegorm – brings in more foreign income than the pyramids at Giza. In these troubled years, the European-based dive tourism companies have looked to destinations further afield, but the lure of history-rich wrecks, spectacular corals, sunshine and warm water just five hours away keeps the Red Sea firmly in the minds of individual divers. If flights from European airports are returned to previous levels, divers will flock back, perhaps ahead of more mainstream tourists. I can forget much of that for a short while at least. As an underwater photographer and diving journalist I’m here for the sharks. As our boat heads out of port the captain is confident of good weather and a quicker than average crossing to our isolated destination. I’m leaving the dusty streets, the taxi drivers and the tourist shops, and we are heading out, into the blue. The next morning, the water is around twenty-six degrees and we’ve finned back towards the boat from the coral-covered reef wall. We’ve used most of our gas and the plan is to spend the last few minutes of the dive hanging a few metres below the surface, hoping for shark activity. A fellow diver points towards a two-metre shark, cruising past at a leisurely pace, a few pilot fish ahead of its sleek snout, and as I take a series of photos I rise a few metres closer to the surface, much to the understandable annoyance of the dive guide, before correcting my buoyancy. The long, lobed pectoral fins, each tipped with bright white identify it as the ocean-wandering oceanic whitetip, a supreme and graceful predator that was once perhaps the most widespread large animal on the planet, before sharks became so threatened. The fish are deeply curious and use a combination of senses, from their chemosensory ability (not entirely smell, but sort of) to an electrosensory ability, that has no analogue in mammals, used in close encounters. Oceanics (as they’re often referred to) will come very close, making them a favourite with divers. Just as we realise there are several fish in the water, ranging from small males to a large pregnant female, one young male passes exceptionally close and might have just “bumped” me a little to check out the large camera I’m holding. If I’m honest, despite my rational brain telling me it’s not needed, the camera serves as a buffer between me and a fish I know will not attack. As I climb back onto the boat, a fin breaks the surface a few metres away, and while I’m mindful of the shark’s abilities, I realise that beyond mild caution, I have not felt real fear at all. I’ve felt something akin to reverence. These fish that cruise the tropical oceans have shown interest in me; they were curious, aware, and individuals showed unique behaviour, exhibiting preferences in how they chose to interact. Back on the boat in the lee of the largest of the two El Ikhwa islands (known more commonly as the Brothers) about forty miles from shore, the sharks continue to cruise from boat to boat. I had expected they would shun the noise and commotion of the dive boats and the little rigid-hulled inflatable boats with their noisy outboards, that shuttle divers to and from their entry and exit points. On the contrary, oceanics are attracted to the boats, their noise and chemical signatures and trails in the water. Unlike deeper dwelling sharks like hammerheads, oceanics will scout for food close to the surface and may take mammalian carrion as well as injured fish floundering on the surface, which brings me to the controversial subject of shark attacks. Sharks are wary, shy animals that in nearly every case will stay away from humans. We are not on their menu, nor do sharks consider us food, but on rare occasions our behaviour and exceptional environmental circumstances can combine and lead to tragedy. In December 2010, a group of tourists were attacked near Sharm el-Sheikh, and a few days later, a woman was killed. The authorities responded by locating and culling several sharks and suspending all water sports activities. Several shark experts commented on just how unusual this event was, not only are sharks rarely seen near beaches, but shark attacks on humans are exceptionally rare. Globally, unprovoked attacks from all sharks, number in the single digits, year on year. It has been suggested that unusually high water temperatures, local overfishing and even the illegal dumping of animal carcasses at sea all contributed to the attack, disrupting behaviour in one lone individual. On the other hand, images have surfaced of snorkelers and swimmers reaching out towards a passing oceanic, almost touching it. Although these fish are not mindless predators, they are not pets to be approached without caution, where they may feel threatened. Dive guides and operators at the Brothers and other shark hotspots, aware of the damage that could be done to the industry, – not to mention the sharks themselves – if a cull was advocated following an incident, do not allow swimming and snorkelling and are keen to encourage divers to leave the water swiftly and with minimum fuss. Hence my frustration at unnecessarily breaking the water’s surface earlier. No one wants to see another negative encounter; the Egyptian economy cannot afford to have beaches or dive sites closed and researchers and conservationists would strongly argue against a knee-jerk cull. Many argue the response in 2010 was, at best, pointless. In recent months, in fact just before I swam with the sharks at the Brothers, some disturbing images were circulated online and posted on the Facebook page of the Hurghada Environmental Protection and Conservation Association (HEPCA). These images showed oceanics that had been killed and dumped on the reef adjacent to Big Brother island, with their fins intact. Shark-fishing for any purpose including finning, is banned in these waters, and HEPCA, a non-profit organisation, has stated it will work to identify the culprits who illegally killed the fish. Clearly self-defeating for a country desperate for tourist income, the loss of sharks is indicative of a nation that has yet to come to terms with the competing demands of mass low-budget tourism and a tourism sector dependent upon a thriving ecosystem. Oceanics, once common, are now classed as vulnerable by the IUCN. Recently, for example, footage has emerged of lorries dumping sand on top of reefs to create beaches for hotel development. Research from HEPCA suggests that a single shark can be worth $200,000 (USD) to the economy annually. A staggering sum, given that oceanics can live up to forty years. Whilst this might be unpleasant to many, including myself, who regard sharks as intrinsically valuable and important players in the reef ecosystem, we seem to be locked into a situation where the only way to preserve sharks is to see them as demonstrably more valuable alive than dead. If that value comes with a dollar sign, then with sadness I say: so be it."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2017/mar/20/andy-murray-rouen-davis-cup-tennis","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-03-20T12:55:25Z","webTitle":"Andy Murray on road to Rouen as he considers Davis Cup return from injury","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/mar/20/andy-murray-rouen-davis-cup-tennis","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/mar/20/andy-murray-rouen-davis-cup-tennis","fields":{"headline":"Andy Murray on road to Rouen as he considers Davis Cup return from injury","bodyText":"Andy Murray’s commitment to playing in Great Britain’s Davis Cup quarter-final against France in Rouen, which starts on 7 April, has been strengthened, oddly, by the injury that has forced his withdrawal from this week’s Miami Open. Murray’s plans for 2017 were always focused on remaining at the top of the rankings and a key part of his strategy depended on building momentum on the hard courts of Indian Wells and Miami, where he had the opportunity to put distance between him and his nearest rival, Novak Djokovic, after his own poor showing in the desert the previous season. However, his shock opening loss to Vasek Pospisil, the world No119, in Indian Wells, compounded by aggravation to a minor problem with his right elbow – coupled with Djokovic’s marginally less surprising defeat there by Nick Kyrgios – has forced a rethink. If Murray’s rehab goes well over the next two weeks, he will play in Rouen to test his elbow before the European clay court swing. As the rankings stand on Monday, Roger Federer has jumped four places to No6 on the back of his rousing victory over Stan Wawrinka in the Indian Wells final on Sunday. Murray has 12,005 points at the top of the table, followed by Djokovic on 8,915 and Wawrinka (5,705). Rounding out the top 10 are Kei Nishikori (4th: 4,730pts), Milos Raonic (5th: 4,480), Federer (6th: 4,305), Rafael Nadal (7th: 4,145), Dominic Thiem (8th: 3,465), Marin Cilic (9th: 3,420) and Jo-Wilfried Tsonga (10: 3,310). While Murray is naturally concerned about his dip in fortunes, the greater worry is with Djokovic. The Serb also withdrew from Miami – curiously, with an almost identical injury – giving up the 1,000 points he needed to defend as champion and gifting Murray further breathing space at the top of the rankings. Murray’s injury is recent, spotted during a warm-up in Indian Wells; Djokovic revealed via Facebook on Sunday that his problem reaches back to last summer, which will be of major concern to him going into the clay court season, where he has plenty of points to defend. The urgency to stay ahead of Djokovic has therefore eased slightly, but Murray, who is obsessive about his preparation, needs to finetune his clay court game before the Monte Carlo Open, which starts on 15 April. Djokovic is no certainty to play in Monte Carlo, where he lives. So, while Murray begins intensive rehabilitation on his elbow this week, he will think hard about testing it out in the clay of Rouen first. The world No1 missed the opening away tie against Canada, which Great Britain won 3-2, but is keen to be part of another campaign after the triumph over Belgium in the final in Ghent two years ago. The team captain, Leon Smith, will announce his lineup 10 days before the start of the tie, but will be anxious that his best player is fit to play. The player they are all watching most closely again, however, is Federer, whose revival at 35 after career-threatening knee surgery last year was crowned with his victory at the Australian Open and confirmed in Indian Wells. “It’s been just a fairytale week once again,” 35-year-old Federer said after winning his fifth title at a tournament he first visited 17 years ago. “I’m still on the comeback. I hope my body is going to allow me to keep on playing.” Wawrinka, who had a good tournament and played well in the final, said: “He always had an answer. I had a few little opportunities that I could have maybe done better, but it wasn’t enough.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/shortcuts/2017/mar/20/easter-new-christmas-crackers","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2017-03-20T14:24:21Z","webTitle":"How Easter became the new Christmas – crackers and all","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/shortcuts/2017/mar/20/easter-new-christmas-crackers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/shortcuts/2017/mar/20/easter-new-christmas-crackers","fields":{"headline":"How Easter became the new Christmas – crackers and all","bodyText":"Name: Easter Age: 2,000 years old, give or take. Appearance: it’s a moveable feast, so it varies – this year, it turns up on 16 April. Current status: the new Christmas. What happened to the old Christmas? It’s still there. Easter is now a second Christmas. But Christmas is when baby Jesus gets born. Yes, technically. Whereas Easter is when dead Jesus comes back to life. Exactly – Christmas II. Christmas: the Sequel. What evidence can you cite for this controversial and unsettling assertion? Carolyn Bailey of Good Housekeeping saying: “Now Easter is becoming like a second Christmas.” And what evidence does she cite? The fact that people are buying crackers. Christmas crackers at Easter? No, they’re Easter crackers. They’ve got chicks on them. This will never catch on. House of Crackers has been selling them for seven years. Waitrose says demand for Easter crackers is up 63% on last year. That doesn’t make it right! It’s not just crackers, either. People are giving more expensive presents at Easter, buying more elaborate decorations, and having grander gatherings. You’re just supposed to hunt for eggs in the rain for half an hour, and then eat too much chocolate. If anything, Easter is a more polite Halloween. Don’t worry, chocolate egg sales are still buoyant, up 12% between 2015 and 2016. I think we’re in serious danger of forgetting the true spirit of Easter, whatever it was. It was always the more significant holiday in the Christian calendar. Why not make Easter an equally important time to celebrate with family, and overspend wildly? I’m just not sure I can handle another Christmas right now, and I know I can’t afford it. Who knows, you might feel like splashing out after all the privations of Lent. Are you kidding? I’ve been eating 12 Creme Eggs a day since the start of March. I’m Eastered out. You’ll feel better once you’ve hung up your Easter stocking. Oh God. Does this mean my kids will be expecting more expensive eggs? I hear Fabergé do nice ones. Do say: “So here it is, Happy Easter, everybody’s having fun.” Don’t say: “Have you heard?

The House of Lords will debate an amendment to the digital economy bill on Monday that would extend rules that give the UK’s public service broadcasters top billing on electronic programme guides. As more viewers turn to streaming and on-demand services, the broadcasters are concerned their programmes may not be as easy to find and that commercial rivals such as Sky could prioritise their own shows instead. Channel 4’s chief marketing and communications officer, Dan Brooke, said it was important that regulation kept pace with changing habits. “This proposed update is vital to ensure that audiences can continue to easily find the high-quality programmes that they love most from Channel 4 and the other public service broadcasters,” he said. Though neither ITV nor Channel 5 has publicly backed the amendment, both support it. An ITV source said the company wanted the prominence of PSB channels preserved in a changing environment, adding: “People are watching television differently and viewers need to be able to continue to easily find PSB channels.” A Channel 5 source said the broadcaster broadly supports the principle of PSB prominence. Though they are run commercially, Channel 4, ITV and Channel 5 are designated as public service broadcasters and operate on tighter licences than rivals overseen by regulator Ofcom. The BBC has led the push for legislation to preserve their prominence online, with its head of strategy, James Purnell, writing in the Telegraph on Monday that public service broadcasters risked dropping out of view as viewers move online. “If we don’t update the rules, we’re at serious risk of losing something very special about our British culture,” he said. The amendment, tabled by Labour peer Lord Wood, would be especially galling for Sky, which argues that its new personalised services, such as Sky Q, are simply giving consumers what they want. The main page of Sky Q promotes “Top Picks” chosen by the broadcaster – the majority of which are Sky’s own programming – and personalised recommendations based on previous viewing. In a statement, Sky called the BBC’s arguments “disingenuous” and bemoaned its refusal to allow Sky customers to see BBC shows individually within Sky’s on-demand platform rather than requiring viewers to use the iPlayer app. It went on: “The BBC needs to get with the times and allow consumers to view content they have already paid for alongside the content of other PSB’s and commercial broadcasters.” If successful, the Lords amendment would have to be agreed by the House of Commons. However, the Department for Culture, Media and Sport is opposed to the legislation, saying it would be anti-competitive. In a statement, a spokesman said: “With users increasingly able to personalise their own homepage for on-demand services, it would not be in their interests to legislate against this progress.” The proposed amendment would also give children’s programming from PSBs greater prominence. Purnell has said that BBC channels such as CBBC and CBeebies, which account for the bulk of UK-made children’s shows, should be further up the programme guide than commercial channels aimed at children, most of which show US programming."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2017/mar/20/google-ads-extremist-content-matt-brittin","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2017-03-20T12:23:08Z","webTitle":"Head of Google Europe apologises over ads on extremist content","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/mar/20/google-ads-extremist-content-matt-brittin","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2017/mar/20/google-ads-extremist-content-matt-brittin","fields":{"headline":"Head of Google Europe apologises over ads on extremist content","bodyText":"Google’s European chief has publicly apologised after online adverts for major brands appeared next to extremist material, but declined to say whether the company would begin actively seeking out such content and taking action against it. Matt Brittin, Google’s head of Europe, the Middle East and Africa, told the Advertising Week Europe conference in London on Monday: “I want to start by saying sorry to the brands affected by this. I take the issue very seriously and I apologise in the instances where that may have happened.” But his response was deemed inadequate by Yvette Cooper, Labour MP and home affairs select committee chair, who said the company was “failing to do enough” to weed out extremist content. Brittin told an audience of advertising industry figures that the company would improve its ad placement system, which has seen ads attached to videos by extremists, including hate preachers and the former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke. The ads help fund payments to the people who post the videos, with every 1,000 clicks worth about £6. Brittin insisted the sums involved had been “pennies not pounds” but admitted “clearly we need to do more on that”. He declined three times to say whether Google would start actively seeking out extremist content, rather than investigating only after users flag up inappropriate material, such as videos on YouTube, which it owns. “Of course we’re looking again at how we improve what we’re doing on enforcement. That’s a question of resources and technology and community,” he said. Cooper, who last week accused the company of “profiting from hatred” said she was not satisfied with Brittin’s response to the issue. “This apology from Google doesn’t go far enough,” she said. “They need to say whether they will be paying back any of that advertising revenue and to answer our questions on what more they are doing to root out extremism or illegal activity on YouTube because they are still failing to do enough to remove illegal or hate-filled content from YouTube. “They still don’t seem to have woken up to the seriousness and toxicity of some of the videos they are still hosting and their own responsibility to deal with that. And they still haven’t agreed to use any of their much-feted search engines to identify illegal content such as National Action videos and remove them. “It isn’t enough for Google to respond only when their advertising revenues take a hit. They are one of the biggest and most powerful companies on the planet. They can afford to do far more, far faster to deal with illegal and hate-filled content online.” Brittin admitted that the company “need[s] to do better” but also appeared to blame advertisers for failing to deploy tools designed to ensure their ads do not appear next to extremist content. “What we found is that there are many controls available but they’re not always being used so we need to make sure they’re simpler and easier to use,” said Brittin. Google executives have been summoned to the Cabinet Office later this week to explain to ministers what they plan to do about extremist content and ads attached to it on YouTube and Google’s wider network. But a date for the meeting has yet to be arranged, according to Whitehall sources, while Brittin was unable to say what measures the company will promise to take. “You’ll have more detail from us very soon on that. We’re working to get it right and if we need some improvement we will do,” he said. The government and several high-profile companies have suspended adverts, or are reviewing whether to do so, after it emerged that extremists including Duke were able to profit from adverts on Google’s network. Marks &amp; Spencer became the latest company to pull advertising from Google on Monday, adding its name to a growing list that includes government departments, major advertising agencies and well-known companies. McDonald’s, the BBC, L’Oréal, HSBC, Royal Bank of Scotland, Lloyds, the Guardian, Audi and Channel 4 are among the firms to suspend advertising. BT and Sky said they were reviewing their relationship with Google. Unilever’s chief marketing officer, Keith Weed, who was speaking alongside Brittin at the Advertising Week Europe seminar, said the consumer goods company has not pulled its adverts from Google and had not yet been affected. Brittin’s public apology comes after he was urged to do so by Rob Norman, chief digital officer at GroupM, part of the world’s largest advertising group WPP. While Brittin admitted that Google had work to do to mend fences with advertisers, he also pointed out that it handles a huge volume of content, including 400 hours of YouTube video uploaded every minute."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2017/mar/20/mps-slam-funding-crisis-and-postcode-lottery-of-childrens-services","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2017-03-20T22:00:48Z","webTitle":"MPs slam funding crisis and 'postcode lottery' of children's services","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/mar/20/mps-slam-funding-crisis-and-postcode-lottery-of-childrens-services","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2017/mar/20/mps-slam-funding-crisis-and-postcode-lottery-of-childrens-services","fields":{"headline":"MPs slam funding crisis and 'postcode lottery' of children's services","bodyText":"Children’s social services are being engulfed by a funding crisis in which nine out of 10 local authorities are struggling to meet their legal duties and families face a postcode lottery, a damning report has concluded. The inquiry by MPs, led by a former Conservative children’s minister, Tim Loughton, has found “wildly different approaches” in the ways that councils intervene and how likely they are to take children into care. The report – shared exclusively with the Guardian – found that in one part of the country (Blackpool) more than seven times as many children were being taken into care than in another (Richmond in London). It also cited a tenfold difference in the numbers being referred to services in the first place: from 187 per 10,000 children in one area to a massive 1,753 in another. The report, by the all-party parliamentary group for children, also suggested that councils were coping with a spending squeeze by tightening up the criteria by which they classify a child as being in need – cutting thousands out of the system altogether. One council told MPs that the numbers of children in need was being “grossly under-reported” because of “the reality of rapidly rising thresholds that arise from reducing resource”. Loughton said the inquiry had revealed that children’s services were stretched to the limit “and in many cases on the brink” and called on the government to urgently investigate the “extraordinary differentials”. “Any vulnerable child deserves the same protections and interventions wherever he or she lives in the country – but clearly, from such a huge divergence in outcomes, this is not happening,” he said. Anna Feuchtwang, the chief executive of the National Children’s Bureau, which supported the inquiry, suggested that the result could be children unnecessarily separated from their families. “If the government doesn’t adequately fund children’s social care, more children and families will be left to fend for themselves as their problems escalate to crisis point. A system that only steps in once a child is in dire need is both costly and cruel. It means, for example, that children could end up in care or experience abuse when providing support earlier could have kept them with their family,” she said. The report found that differences in demography or resource did not come close to explaining the massive variations. Instead it concluded: “Crucially, local policy decisions are leading directly to stark contrasts in children’s outcomes, including the likelihood that they are taken into care.” One worrying finding was that early intervention was being cut, meaning families were ending up in crises before receiving help. Moreover, councils faced a recruitment nightmare, with one revealing a 57% vacancy rate, forcing heavy reliance on temporary agency staff. The situation has become so acute that a survey carried out by the MPs found that overall 89% of directors of children’s services were finding it increasingly difficult to fulfil their statutory duties towards vulnerable children. Loughton warned that the area had become a “Cinderella service” because vulnerable children were not seen as “everybody’s business” while the idea of growing old and needing adult social care was. Asked if he feared a repeat of the death of 17-month-old Peter Connelly, initially known as Baby P, Loughton argued that cases were happening all the time but not being reported. “When I was children’s minister every Monday we went through a list of children who had been attacked or killed and there were terrible cases that didn’t make the headlines. It was two kids a week being killed at the hands of carers,” he said. He said that £1 was being spent on preventative help compared with £4 spent on reactive services, arguing the opposite should be true. The Local Government Association responded by warning that councils faced a £1.9bn funding gap for children’s services by 2020, and said that time was running out to find savings without a “lasting impact” on critical services. “Councils have been warning government for some time that the pressures facing children’s services are rapidly becoming unsustainable, with a combination of government funding cuts and huge increases in demand leaving many areas struggling to cope,” said Cllr Richard Watts, chair of the LGA’s children and young people board. Whatever the pressures, he said, it was important to recognise that social workers continued to provide “heroic levels of support” – taking tough decisions to save children’s lives. Labour’s shadow children’s minister Emma Lewell-Buck, herself a former social worker, said: “This report is alarming but sadly not surprising, given how hard the council cuts have hit children’s social care... “Instead of learning the lessons, addressing those failures and protecting services from cuts, the department has focused on a few short-term projects in a few local authorities through the so-called innovation fund. So it is no surprise that this piecemeal approach has led to an even more fragmented and inconsistent service for our most vulnerable children and families.” A Department for Education spokesperson said: “We want every single child, no matter where they live, to receive the same high quality care and support – and this is exactly what our reforms are set up to deliver. We are clear that providing help as early as possible is the most effective way of keeping children safe, and our new What Works Centre for children’s social care will ensure social workers across the country are able to learn from best practice.” The DfE argued that the department had taken “tough action” where councils were failing children, and was supporting the recruitment and training of social workers."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2017/mar/20/palermo-maurizio-zamparini-chaos-serie-a","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-03-20T13:37:13Z","webTitle":"Palermo chaos continues despite Zamparini supposedly stepping back | Paolo Bandini","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/mar/20/palermo-maurizio-zamparini-chaos-serie-a","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/mar/20/palermo-maurizio-zamparini-chaos-serie-a","fields":{"headline":"Palermo chaos continues despite Zamparini supposedly stepping back","bodyText":"A year ago this month, Maurizio Zamparini was accosted by an angry stranger. Nothing unusual here: he had grown used to such interactions during his decade-and-a-half as owner of Palermo. But this interaction was caught on camera, and finished up making national headlines. It was a perfectly-timed snapshot of supporters’ frustrations at his erratic leadership of their club. Palermo’s manager, Beppe Iachini, had just resigned following a public spat in which Zamparini accused him of “not giving a shit about anything”. This was the Sicilians’ eighth coaching change of the season, and at least their 35th (the exact count is hard to pin down, since it includes both caretakers and coaches who were dismissed and then reinstated in a matter of days) since 2002. Zamparini has done much good for Palermo, his investments propelling them into the top-flight and on multiple forays into Europe. Under his stewardship, the club has nurtured such talents as Edinson Cavani, Paulo Dybala and Andrea Belotti. But his mood swings and outbursts - he once threatened to slice off his players’ testicles and eat them in his salad - have also made the club a laughing stock. So that fan spoke for many others, last March, when he told Zamparini he would prefer to see Palermo plummet all the way to the third tier under a new owner, “than to stay in Serie A like this.” One year later, his wish might be coming to fruition. Following a 4-1 defeat at Udinese this weekend, Palermo are certainly on course for relegation - seven points adrift of safety with nine games left to play. They also have a new president. On 6 March, Palermo put out a press release to announce Zamparini was selling the club. Any hopes that the future might look a little more calm and predictable, however, were dashed in the very first sentence. Palermo’s prospective buyer was not some billionaire or business consortium, but a former TV comedian. Stranger still, he was to be installed as club president immediately - even though the same statement suggested that his takeover would not be completed until late April. What on earth was happening? Even as Paul Baccaglini sat before reporters at a chaotic press conference the following day, it was hard to escape the feeling that this must be some kind of prank. American-born and heavily tattooed, he is best known in Italy for his past work on Le Iene, an irreverent show on Italia1 which is well-known for deploying its hosts to dupe public figures for comic effect. Among Baccaglini’s more famous skits were those in which he sought to launch his own political movement - the Lemon Party. That name was a riff on the Italian word ‘limonare’, which translates literally as ‘to lemon’, but which is the colloquial equivalent to ‘necking on’. He posed naked under a pile of the fruit for good measure. None of which precludes him from running a football team. In interviews over the past two weeks, Baccaglini has insisted that he only ever viewed show business as a short-term career. He says that he put aside money and studied financial trading, before getting involved with an asset-management fund, Integritas Capital. All of which might be true, but remains tricky to verify. Multiple funds exist by that same name, and Baccaglini has declined to offer any further details, or to discuss the extent of his own wealth. He has stated often that he will own 100% of shares in Palermo after the takeover, and yet at other times his comments have seemed to imply ongoing participation from Zamparini. “Maurizio wanted to completely reorganise his assets, which included Palermo,” Baccaglini told Gazzetta dello Sport. “This is a collaboration between him and me. I am now the president. You cannot say I have paid a particular sum for Palermo, because the investments will be made when there is a need.” Such ambiguity has given rise to conspiracy theories. In the same interview, Baccaglini forcefully denied the suggestion that he was simply being used as a distraction by Zamparini - a temporary lightning rod for all the criticisms that will accompany the club’s likely relegation. But who can supporters trust in this scenario? Baccaglini’s girlfriend, Thais Wiggers, was likely thinking in a different context when she told the gossip magazine Oggi that his biggest weakness is “telling too many lies”. Even so, his biggest promises for Palermo’s future - a new stadium and training ground, plus a side project in which the club helps to launch local business start-ups - would be easier to believe if they came with evidence of funding. If nothing else, Baccaglini does now have skin in the game - in the most literal sense. In the small hours of the morning before his introductory press conference, his old friends at Le Iene came knocking on his hotel door. They had booked a tattoo artist into a room nearby and challenged him to add a Palermo badge to the more than 60 pieces that adorn his body. He agreed, having it placed close to his heart. Since then, Palermo have played twice and lost twice, shipping seven goals. This weekend’s defeat was all the more galling for the fact that they took a first-half lead, Roland Sallai sliding the ball home after an enterprising run by Haitam Aleesami. Against an Udinese team gliding towards a comfy midtable finish, this ought to have been cause to hope. But the Rosanero lack too much in too many areas, a painful truth for fans who have seen the likes of Dybala, Belotti and Franco Vázquez depart over these past couple of years. They failed to press their advantage on Sunday, and Udinese adjusted - switching from an initial 4-3-3 into a 4-4-2 and equalising through Cyril Théréau just before half-time. Duván Zapata, Rodrigo de Paul and Jakub Jankto then completed the turnaround, whilst Palermo had Alessandro Diamanti sent off. Baccaglini has stressed his belief that the Rosanero can still save themselves - pointing to a crucial run of fixtures against bottom-half sides in May. But it is hard to have much hope for a team that has shipped 60 goals in 29 games. Not since 1952-53 have they conceded more at an equivalent point of the season. Already on Monday, Baccaglini has been forced to deny suggestions that he intends to fire the manager, Diego López. Initial reports claimed that the decision had in fact been taken by Zamparini - an assertion which the outgoing owner denied, reaffirming that his role with the club was now strictly an advisory one. Many fans would be happy to see him relinquish even those duties as soon as possible. But none can pretend to really know what is coming next. Talking points • One week after I write a column about how the race for Champions League berths is alive and well, both Lazio and Inter drop points, allowing Roma and Napoli to tighten their grips on second and third respectively. Yeah, sorry about that, folks! But let’s not forget that Napoli’s next two games are at home to Juventus and then away to Lazio… • Napoli did almost contrive to blow a three-goal lead away to Empoli on Sunday, but this was, improbably, the first time they have ever won away to the Tuscan side in the league. They had previously visited 10 times, losing six and drawing four. • Not a great weekend for Joe Hart, who was at fault on both of Inter’s goals - first allowing Geoffrey Kondogbia’s shot to squirm through his grasp, and then making a poor decision to come for a cross that sailed over him to Antonio Candreva at the back post. He did make a couple of good saves, too, but it must be acknowledged that, for all he has done well in Turin, the glaring error remains a frustratingly regular feature of his game. • Sampdoria had won five and drawn two of their past seven games, and had only lost at home twice all season, but inevitably they too came unstuck against this relentless Juventus. The Bianconeri scored early through Juan Cuadrado and rarely sparkled thereafter (indeed, they failed to register a single shot on target in the second half - the first time this has happened in three years) but rarely did they look likely to let their lead slip either. • Atalanta’s 55 points are a new club record in the era of three points for a win. And they still have nine games left to go.

Female author in French school exams for first time since 1990s","bodyText":"A female author has been included in the list of compulsory study books for France’s prestigious literature baccalauréat for the first time since the modern-day exam was introduced more than 20 years ago. The move follows petitions protesting about sexism and an “excess of testosterone” in the exam syllabus. From September, final year lycée students taking their exams in 2018 will be required to have studied La Princesse de Montpensier, a 17th-century court romance written by Madame de Lafayette, as well as a 2010 film of the book by director Bertrand Tavernier. Lafayette is included in the list of obligatory study under the category literature and the language of images. The French baccalauréat has taught in various forms since the Middle Ages, when the Université de Paris – whose most famous college was the Sorbonne – was set up in the 13th century. The modern exam was introduced in the 1990s; the literature option (bac L) was established in 1995 but has ignored female writers until now. Lafayette’s inclusion is the result of a 2016 petition set up by Prof Françoise Cahen, who teaches at a lycée in Alfortville, south-east Paris. “We’re not asking for parity between male and female artists, we would just like the great female writers such as Marguerite Duras, Mme de Lafayette, Annie Ernaux, Marguerite Yourcenar, Nathalie Sarraute, Simone de Beauvoir, George Sand, Louise Labé … are also regularly the subject of study for our students. “In classes where there is often a majority of girls and the professors are mostly women, what subliminal message are we sending?” Cahen asked. She pointed out that two years ago a lycée student had set up her own petition to protest against the “latent sexism” in the school study programmes, and that the writers she proposed to study instead were not “especially interesting just because they are women, but because they are worth studying for the importance they have brought to literature and society”. Cahen’s petition raised 20,000 signatures and reached the education minister, Najat Vallaud-Belkacem, who took a personal interest in including female authors in the bac L programme. Lafayette, whose full name was Marie-Madeleine Pioche de La Vergne, comtesse de Lafayette, was born into a minor noble family that mixed with the Roman Catholic clergyman Cardinal Richelieu, a minister in the court of Louis XIII. La Princesse de Montpensier was Lafayette’s first book and was published anonymously. The French education ministry says it was one of the very first French novels to be published. The story was based on events in the court of Charles IX in 1562 while the French religious wars were raging. The novel’s heroine, Marie de Mézières, who is in love with one man but betrothed to another, is at the heart of a violent and passionate battle for her hand."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2017/mar/20/has-your-immigration-status-affected-your-care-from-the-nhs","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2017-03-20T15:33:59Z","webTitle":"Has your immigration status affected your care from the NHS?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/mar/20/has-your-immigration-status-affected-your-care-from-the-nhs","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2017/mar/20/has-your-immigration-status-affected-your-care-from-the-nhs","fields":{"headline":"Has your immigration status affected your care from the NHS?","bodyText":"Hundreds of pregnant women without legal status are avoiding seeking NHS antenatal care because of growing fears that they will be reported to the Home Office or face high medical bills, according to charities that work with vulnerable migrant women.

The 24 cinemas in the Picturehouse chain, which are in cities including Liverpool, Bradford, Oxford and London, sell an upmarket boutique experience to its clientele, who pay up to £16 for tickets while some staff are on zero-hour contracts without sick pay and other benefits such as parental leave. The letter backing a campaign by workers demanding better rights and pay, part of a series of strike action started by staff at the Ritzy in south London, was sent to Cineworld’s millionaire chief executive Moshe (Mooky) Greidinger on Monday. The letter, signed by members of the film and TV industry as well as politicians and writers including Richard Curtis, Ken Loach, Sir Patrick Stewart, Indira Varma, Caitlin Moran and the shadow chancellor John McDonnell, reads: “We find it disappointing that you fail to pay your lowest paid staff the living wage. We therefore support your workers in their call for a public boycott of Picturehouse and Cineworld. “Cineworld is a very successful company that made a substantial profit of £83.8m in 2015, and it is vitally important to share your success with your workforce. “Workers should not have to live below the real living wage when your company has the means to set a great example by adhering to the ethical pay structures proposed in the Living Staff Living Wage pay claim.” Pippa Sa, a union representative and member of the front-of-house team at Duke of Yorks cinema in Brighton, said the letter had motivated her and her colleagues to continue their fight for better rights. She said: “The cinema industry doesn’t just stop at our cinema screens, as obviously it’s also part of the film industry. It’s really great to see so many people care about where their work gets shown and the staff that work there, so it’s really encouraging.” The staff, who held their first strike on Saturday, are not just asking for the real living wage (as calculated by the Living Wage Foundation), but also for their union, the Bectu sector of Prospect, to be recognised and for their concerns about the cinema’s booking system to be heard. “We are asking our customers to boycott the cinema until our employer agrees to sit down with us,” Sa said. The Duke claims to be the oldest cinema in continuous use in the UK. “I know what this cinema means to the community here. It’s beautiful. People really care about it, but a lot aren’t aware that we are not independent and that it is part of a chain,” she said. “Raising awareness is really important because our customers, especially in Brighton, care about about workers’ rights.” The campaign, which is also asking for sick pay and parental leave, has spread to four other cinemas in the chain, with another expected to join next week after a ballot of staff. Kelly Rogers, a bartender at the Ritzy and one of the union organisers, said: “On a weekend in Brixton, people pay £13 for tickets. Picturehouse are pitched as the nicer cinema. You wouldn’t get a ticket machine in a Picturehouse cinema, it’s all about having good staff and fancy craft beers and popcorn that tastes like gin and tonic. “It’s great that the celebrities in the letter are backing our boycott, but it’s not just about individual customers, we’re hoping film festivals will boycott too.” Picturehouse defended its pay structure in a statement on its website: “For many years, Picturehouse Cinemas has paid its front-of-house customer service staff well above minimum wage. “Our pay rates are among the highest in the industry and have enabled us to attract and retain staff who are knowledgeable about film, skilled in many areas and able to offer high levels of service.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2017/mar/26/accusation-bandi-review-unflinching-tales-of-north-korea","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2017-03-26T06:30:23Z","webTitle":"The Accusation by Bandi – review: unflinching tales from North Korea","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/mar/26/accusation-bandi-review-unflinching-tales-of-north-korea","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2017/mar/26/accusation-bandi-review-unflinching-tales-of-north-korea","fields":{"headline":"The Accusation by Bandi – review: unflinching tales from North Korea","bodyText":"When the founding strongman Kim Il-sung died in 1994, displays of public grief in North Korea reached extraordinary levels. Sobbing television presenters segued into distraught citizens tearing at their hair and family members collapsing in paroxysms of despair. In Pyongyang’s vast eponymous square, rows of kneeling, white-clad men and women set up a keening cacophony. The scenes were repeated 17 years later on the decease of the son and successor, Kim Jong-il. When he died, North Korea’s news agency solemnly reported, ice cracked, magpies mourned and a family of bears was found weeping on a road. Both had presided over an exceptionally totalising and brutal regime. Even as Kim Il-sung died, a devastating famine was beginning that would last for four years and reduce the population beneath destitution in what had once been one of north Asia’s most prosperous countries. What, the puzzled outsider had to ask, were they all crying about? The Accusation, a collection of seven short stories published under the pseudonym Bandi – which means Firefly – is enlightening on this and many other aspects of North Korean life. The author, we are told, is a senior North Korean writer, a member of the official Chosun Writers League Central Committee, and still lives in the people’s paradise. The stories, written in pencil on 750 sheets of paper and dated between 1989 and 1997, were smuggled out of North Korea, hidden inside works by Kim Il-sung. They were first published in South Korea in 2014. Now translated, they are set for an international launch. Such tales of origin cannot, of course, be verified. Even such details as are published, if authentic, put the pseudonymous writer at risk. If discovered, his prospects are poor. Both fictional and factual accounts of life in North Korea characteristically come from defectors, whose interest lies in telling a dark story that may or may not be wholly accurate. In some cases, such as Barbara Demick’s, Nothing to Envy: Real Lives in North Korea, the defectors’ accounts were meticulously cross-checked. In others, the reader is left to judge. In the case of The Accusation, US support for its publication will make this an easy target for North Korean propaganda, but that should not, in itself, detract from what is a compelling collection. The stories are spare, direct, unflinching and bitterly angry. They detail the misery that the cruel absurdities of the regime inflicted on everyday lives in the closing years of Kim Il-sung’s reign. One of them, On Stage, is set three months after his death and addresses directly the puzzling displays of excessive public grief. As one of Bandi’s characters explains, to cope with the regime’s demand for total submission to the leader cult, Koreans have developed a remarkable capacity for performance. Their lives, literally, can depend on it. In On Stage, the country has been stripped of flowers as the mourning rituals drag on; people are hungry because the distribution of rations has been disrupted, but still they engage in competitive displays of grief at the many altars to the departed leader that have been set up around town. The security services watch for any slackening of emotion. Acting, the character explains, has become so ubiquitous and so convincing “that we even trick ourselves … Isn’t it frightening, this society which teaches us all to be great actors, able to turn on the waterworks at the drop of a hat?” In this, as in several of the stories, the illusion crumbles under its own absurdity. Bandi’s characters struggle to live with love, humour and humanity while conforming to the demands of the regime, but are undone by the impossibility of the proposition, by the routine injustice, corruption and cruelties endemic in the system. In several stories, the characters reach breaking point: the old revolutionary who invested all his hopes in a tree he planted at the dawn of what he thought would be a golden era; the desperate son, trying to obtain a travel permit in order to get to his mother’s death bed; the policeman destroyed by the moment in which he understands that everything in the system he has devoted himself to defending is false. In others, a chance development destroys lives: the mother who closes the blinds in her apartment because her toddler is terrified by the giant image of Karl Marx that he sees from the windows. When she is obliged to explain why she has drawn her blinds on a national celebration, the family is instantly disgraced and exiled. In other stories, characters struggle – and fail – to overcome the taint of a father of grandfather’s political mistake, a taint that is passed down through families like a bad gene, blighting the lives of successor generations. This is tyranny less as a grand project than in the granular detail of life, inescapable and unredeemed, written, as the author puts it in a closing poem, after 50 years of “living as a machine that speaks. Living as a human under a yoke.” • The Accusation by Bandi is published by Serpent’s Tail (£12.99). To order a copy for £9.74, go to bookshop.theguardian.com or call 0330 333 6846.

The visiting teacher tells them that, among other things, they should take shorter showers, buy less clothes, eat less meat and drink tea rather than coffee, to help alleviate China’s water scarcity problems. The students, aged between 12 and 15, lap up the messages. “I wasn’t aware that there are so many ways to waste water,” says Zhou Kuiru, 15. He’ll happily take shorter showers, but “eating less meat might be more difficult”. The students are the latest to hear a talk from Thirst, an NGO that educates 12- to 24-year-olds in China about the country’s water crisis. The NGO says it has given presentations to around 500,000 students since 2013, mainly in and around Beijing, Shanghai and Chongqing. It aims to reach the 1 million mark by the end of 2017. Trouble up north Despite having a population of 1.35 billion – 21% of the world’s population – China only has 7% of the world’s freshwater supplies, according to the United Nations. The north of the country is more water scarce than the south. In 2015, just 100 cubic metres of water was available to each Beijing resident per year. The UN considers a region “water stressed” if this figure is below 1,700 cubic metres. One large factor contributing is China’s rapid economic growth, fuelled by heavy industry using water for production processes. The country’s pollution problems also contribute; nearly 60% of the country’s underground water is polluted. Meanwhile, so-called “virtual water exports” – goods that require a large amount of water to make or cultivate – are often moved from water scarce Chinese regions to those with more water supplies. In 2011, the crisis moved President Xi Jinping to give a quote that adorns Thirst’s promotional literature: “Water conservation is the fundamental way to solve our water problems. Education of citizens about China’s water crisis combined with strong environmental governance is conducive to a society focused on water conservation.” A unique culture Thirst aims to encourage young Chinese people to reduce their water usage and to keep tackling water scarcity a priority if they become business leaders later in life. “Because of the one-child policy [scrapped in 2015, but in place when Thirst’s students were born] it’s a unique culture,” says founder Mina Guli. “Young people have a great ability to influence their parents and companies, because all the companies are now looking to China. It’s a unique group of people.” At the crux of Thirst’s presentations are the concepts of “virtual water” and “water footprint”. The former is the amount of water used to create a product, beyond the literal amount of water it contains. For example, Thirst says it takes 15,400 litres of water to make 1kg of edible beef. A water footprint is a person’s water consumption when their use of virtual water is totted up with direct water use, such as drinking and showering. Students are taught that eating pork instead of beef reduces your water footprint. So does buying fewer cotton T-shirts – each one supposedly uses 3,690 litres of virtual water to produce. Dabo Guan, professor in climate change economics at the University of East Anglia, says it’s important to outline these messages to the public. “Ten years ago, nobody talked about air pollution,” he says. “But then people started to talk about it and they recognise it: they see the smog. But it’s rare to see water pollution or the drying of a river. People just aren’t exposed to it.” Onus on industry Thirst claims that its lectures have had largely fantastic responses from students, and this is backed up by the enthusiasm of those in the Beijing classroom. However, even if every person in China took 20-second showers and never wasted a drop of drinking water, the country’s water scarcity wouldn’t be solved, according to China Water Risk, an NGO that raises awareness of water resource problems. In 2015, just 13% of water used in China was due to personal consumption, according to the NGO. “While it’s important to have public outreach, the majority of water use is in agriculture and industry,” says Debra Tan, the director of China Water Risk. “If you’re really going to make any difference, these sectors must move [to lower water consumption]. It’s down to corporate responsibility and the government.” The government’s measures to tackle the problem include projects such as a proposed 1,000km pipeline from Siberia’s Lake Baikal to parched north-west China. In 2014 another project was inaugurated; the £48bn South-North Water Diversion, a network of reservoirs and canals that moves trillions of gallons of water annually from the south-east to the north. The government has also focused on reducing industrial water use. Authorities have, for example, worked with Apple on its waste diversion programme, in which the firm has save 3.8bn gallons of water since 2013 in its Chinese suppliers’ factories. Despite these measures, China’s water scarcity is “the most important environmental crisis in China,” says Guan. As such, Guli believes that although the onus is on industry and the government to make changes, Thirst’s role is also important – and could give China a PR bump. “There is a perception that China is a polluter, that China doesn’t care ... But the reality is far from that,” says Guli. “Young people do care about the environment. By talking about it we can create a whole consumer economy that values water sustainability.” Liu Bailin, one of the students at Beijing’s Tongzhou Number Six school, is already ahead of the curve. “Shorter showers could work,” he says. “And as for drinking less coffee than tea … I don’t actually drink either.” Join our community of development professionals and humanitarians.

It follows the life of little Mason (played by the extraordinary Ellar Coltrane) as he ages from five to 18, Linklater returning each year to shoot scenes that chart his growth from young boy to young man, a collection of small moments that feels entirely like real life. A similarly committed cast, including Ethan Hawke as the lovable dad, help make this an utterly absorbing and moving film.

In the case of The Warrior (4.30), it was probably at least four runs ago, but Amanda Perrett’s gelding gets one more, very final chance to show that he has another victory in him when he goes to post for an eight-furlong handicap at Kempton Park on Monday. The Warrior’s 19 starts to date have yielded just a single success, back in March 2015 on his three-year-old debut when he was still trained by Aidan O’Brien. With only a few exceptions, O’Brien’s cast-offs tend to spend the rest of the racing careers underlining their former trainer’s good judgement, but The Warrior threatened to be an exception in his first three runs for Perrett last spring. His most eye-catching run was at Goodwood last May, when he was caught in a hopeless position in the final stages with nowhere to go at all. He kept on to finish a close sixth with running left. He was left at the gates on his next start, however, and his season deteriorated rapidly from there. There are a few reasons to retain some faith this time, however. His mark has dropped steadily, to 84 from 94 in 10 months, and The Warrior also returned from a seven-month break with a very promising run at Lingfield last time out. He attracted some money before that run, and possibly saves his best form for the early months of the campaign. If so, a drop back to Class Four company this afternoon could finally do the trick. Athassel (5.30) should also go well at a fair price on the Kempton card. He is on the brink of a rapid four-timer, having completed a hat-trick under a double penalty at Chelmsford four days ago and his winning time suggests that a further 4lb rise in the weights is not beyond him. The jumps cards at Taunton and Southwell have something of a between-the-Festivals feel about them, but Hint Of Mint (3.50) has a very solid chance at around 100-30 in a decent handicap hurdle down in the west country while Camron De Chaillac (3.40), at around 13-2, should go well in the most competitive race of the day at Southwell.

The prime minister’s decision to name the date on which the two-year Brexit clock will start ticking down came as her official spokesman also quashed speculation about an early general election. Instead he made clear that the government’s focus was set to turn solidly towards the country’s EU exit, which is now guaranteed to be complete by the end of March 2019. The president of the European council, Donald Tusk, responded quickly to say that he would distribute his draft response to May’s letter among the leaders of the EU27 within 48 hours of next Wednesday. But sources made clear that it would take “four to six weeks” for the other 27 countries in the EU to reach consensus and start the more formal process. May’s decision to spell out the starting date came after Jean-Claude Juncker claimed that “Britain’s example will make everyone else realise that it’s not worth leaving”. And lead negotiator, Michel Barnier, hinted on Twitter that the EU27 were preparing to impose customs controls, despite May’s determination to secure “frictionless trade”. The warnings underlined the rocky path that the prime minister will have to tread as she begins one of the most complicated negotiations of political history. “I am very clear that I want to ensure we get the best possible deal for the United Kingdom that works for everyone across the United Kingdom and all parts of the UK when we enter these negotiation,” said the prime minister in Wales, at the start of a whirlwind UK tour aimed at drumming up last-minute support from the devolved administrations. “I have set out my objectives. These include getting a good free trade deal. They include putting issues like continuing working together on issues like security at the core of what we are doing. We are going to be out there, negotiating hard, delivering on what the British people voted for.” The prime minister – who also made clear that there would be no early general election – asked the UK ambassador to the EU, Sir Tim Barrow, to inform the European council president of the date. However, EU sources claimed that May’s choice of next Wednesday meant she would miss the chance of a swift start to the negotiations, and instead have to wait up to six weeks for a formal response. The prime minister’s chosen date shortens an already tight timeframe in which the British government hopes to both agree on the terms of withdrawal, including its financial liabilities, and successfully negotiate a “comprehensive free trade deal” with the EU. The EU had hoped to offer a substantive political response to Britain at a summit pencilled in for the 6-7 April, but the notification date announced by Downing Street does not now make that possible, EU sources said. Formal EU-UK negotiations are unlikely to start until mid-May at the very earliest, while some diplomats representing member states in Brussels believe it is more likely that talks will start in earnest in June. Speaking to the Guardian, Gianni Pittella, the president of the socialist bloc in the European parliament, mocked the British prime minister’s slow progress in triggering talks, and warned that the EU would also be demanding agreement on Britain’s estimated £57bn divorce bill before trade talks could start. He said: “Congratulations, Theresa May. Nine months to give birth to a date for article 50 notification. We will make sure that Brexit won’t affect EU and UK acquired citizens’ rights. “Before negotiating the new relationship with UK, first and foremost we want substantial progresses on the withdrawal agreement to be ensured.” Michel Barnier, who will lead negotiations for the EU, has also said the talks must proceed in that way, with experts lining up to warn that the two-year period will not be long enough for Britain to secure a future trading relationship. However, a Tory peer who was involved in the drafting of article 50 told the Guardian that it was designed to allow the exit and trade talks to take place simultaneously. Lord Kirkhope, who was a full member of the Convention on the Future of Europe that drew up the text that led to the Lisbon treaty, said: “As one of those involved in the drafting of article 50, I know that – whatever Michel Barnier says – it does allow for a parallel debate on both the terms of exiting the EU and the deal to be negotiated for after Brexit.” Nevertheless, the two-year timetable is widely seen as extremely tight if May is to achieve her desire of securing a future deal before March 2019, especially given the need for around six months in which to ratify any deal. Even with Tusk’s swift action, there will be around “four to six weeks” as EU states agree to the proposed response by consensus, according to a senior source. Once the EU27 have formally adopted the guidelines, the European commission is expected to quickly present more detailed draft directives and recommend the opening of talks, which will then agreement by qualified majority at a meeting of ministers of the EU27, known as the general affairs council. A date has yet been set for that ministerial meeting but it is only then that the talks with the UK will be formally opened. Earlier rumours that the move would be made last week had to be quashed by sources close to the prime minister after Nicola Sturgeon declared her desire for a second Scottish independence referendum, leading to speculation that May had prevaricated because she did not wish to appear cavalier about the future of the union. However, a Downing Street spokesman said the warning given on Monday morning was merely a matter of courtesy rather than a formal procedure designed to speed up the start of talks. “It’s simply a case of providing advance notice to help people on all sides,” he said. “We have always said we would trigger article 50 by the end of March and we thought it would be helpful to give advance notice.” The prime minister’s spokesman said Barrow had a conversation with the office of the European council president, Donald Tusk, earlier on Monday to offer the EU notice of the date. “There will be a letter, [May] will notify President Tusk in writing, and the prime minister has already confirmed she will give a statement to parliament as well,” he said. “More details will be given in due course. “We want negotiations to start promptly, but it’s obviously right that the 27 have the opportunity to agree their position,” the spokesman said. “We fully expect they will want to do that in advance. The Brexit secretary, David Davis, called the process “the most important negotiation for this country in a generation”. “The government is clear in its aims: a deal that works for every nation and region of the UK and indeed for all of Europe – a new, positive partnership between the UK and our friends and allies in the European Union”, he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2017/mar/22/what-is-the-current-mood-among-labour-supporters","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-03-22T12:35:05Z","webTitle":"What is the current mood among Labour supporters?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/mar/22/what-is-the-current-mood-among-labour-supporters","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/mar/22/what-is-the-current-mood-among-labour-supporters","fields":{"headline":"What is the current mood among Labour supporters?","bodyText":"Membership of the Labour party is expected to fall below half a million for the first time since its peak under Jeremy Corbyn.

The poll by Gransnet, the over-50s social networking site, also found that about seven in 10 (71%) respondents – average age 63 – said their close friends and family would be surprised or astonished to hear that they felt lonely. Gransnet is one of nine organisations – including Age UK, the Alzheimer’s Society and the Silver Line helpline for older people – working to address the issue of loneliness in older people, which is the current focus of the commission, set up by Cox before her murder last June. They are urging individuals and businesses to look for signs of loneliness and refer people to organisations that can help. But they also want people to take time to speak to neighbours, family, old friends or those they encounter randomly. The chairs of the cross-party commission, the Labour MP Rachel Reeves and Conservative MP Seema Kennedy, said there was a stigma around loneliness that must be tackled. “We all need to act and encourage older people to freely talk about their loneliness,” they said. “Everyone can play a part in ending loneliness among older people in their communities by simply starting a conversation with those around you. “How we care and act for those around us could mean the difference between an older person just coping, to them loving and enjoying later life.” Almost half (49%) of the 73% who described themselves as lonely in the online poll said they had been so for years, 11% said they had always felt lonely and 56% said they had never spoken about their loneliness to anyone. Laura Alcock-Ferguson, the executive director of the Campaign to End Loneliness – another organisation working with the commission – said the percentage of lonely older people had stayed the same for five decades, but an ageing population meant the number was increasing in absolute terms. “Loneliness is a serious public health issue and dealing with it will take the strain off the NHS and social care services,” she said. Common trigger events said to have contributed to feelings of loneliness were bereavement, retirement and children leaving home. Being shy, living alone or far from family and low income were other commonly cited contributory factors. The rise of social networking to the detriment of face-to-face interaction has been blamed for contributing to an “epidemic” of loneliness, but the survey of just over 1,000 people found it could also offer solace. Almost three in five respondents (59%) said social media helped people feel less lonely and about eight in 10 (82%) said talking about loneliness was much easier when anonymous and online. While the results indicate the potential benefits of online interaction, the older people are the less likely they are to have access to the internet, particularly women. The commission is encouraging supporters and followers to post #happytochat on social media to create discussion around loneliness and for people to wear badges with the same slogan. Ultimately, they hope some customer-facing organisations will encourage their staff to wear the badges. Respondents highlighted greater public awareness - a key goal of the commission – as the best way to combat loneliness. Caroline Abrahams, charity director at Age UK, said: “There are reasons to believe that we can all do something to change things for the better: a simple thing like saying hello and having a chat can brighten up an older person’s day and do more good than most of us would ever guess.” In coming months the commission will focus on loneliness in other groups, including men, people with disabilities, carers, refugees, children and parents."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/blog/2017/mar/23/vvs-laxman-lording-it-tenpin-trickshots-and-nanis-unappreciated-japery","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-03-23T10:00:01Z","webTitle":"VVS Laxman lording it, tenpin trickshots and Nani's unappreciated japery | Classic YouTube","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2017/mar/23/vvs-laxman-lording-it-tenpin-trickshots-and-nanis-unappreciated-japery","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/blog/2017/mar/23/vvs-laxman-lording-it-tenpin-trickshots-and-nanis-unappreciated-japery","fields":{"headline":"VVS Laxman lording it, tenpin trickshots and Nani's unappreciated japery","bodyText":"1) The final and deciding Test between India and Australia begins on Saturday; at the end of yet another belting series, the sides are level at 1-1.

The city’s tumble down the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) world rankings is almost entirely due to the Brexit-inspired 15% fall in the value of sterling since the EU referendum last year. The pound’s fall has made prices in London much cheaper for foreign visitors, although not for local residents who earn their incomes in sterling. The EIU said London is cheaper than New York for the first time in 15 years, and that relative prices in Manchester have fallen so far that the cost of living in the city is now on a par with Bangkok. “While the declines mean that British cities are cheaper compared to their international peers, the rise in import prices caused by the weak pound will mean that locals won’t see their own shopping baskets falling in price. In fact the opposite is likely to be true and, while UK cities fell down the ranking local prices for the basket of goods surveyed have begun to creep back up,” said the EIU. The world’s most expensive city is Singapore, where average prices are 20% higher than in New York and one-third more than in London. The city-state has long been the most expensive place in the world to buy and run a car, but the EIU said it is also the second-priciest destination in which to buy clothes. Australia and New Zealand are also pricing themselves out of the price bracket of budget-conscious travellers. Sydney (14th), Melbourne (15th), Auckland and Wellington (both joint 16th) all now feature in the world’s top 20 most expensive cities and each of them are pricier than London. Almaty in Kazakhstan takes the prize as the cheapest city in the world, although local citizens won’t feel that way. They are suffering from galloping inflation – approaching 20% in 2016 – but as it is has also sent the local currency, the tenge, down 50%, to foreigners the city is now very cheap. A large loaf of bread is around 70p, petrol is 40p a litre and cigarettes are 80p. The EIU compares more than 400 individual prices across 160 products and services, including food, drink, clothing, rents, transport and utility bills. Prices are converted into US dollars, with each city ranked above or below New York. So, in the survey, Singapore scored 120 (20% higher than New York) while London scored 89, or 11% less than New York. London’s new-found bargain-basement status has encouraged a flood of international shoppers to the city. Even low-cost clothing store Primark has reported strong sales to foreign tourists, joining luxury brands such as Burberry in enjoying a boost in sales from visitors drawn by the cheap pound. But the EIU figures are also a warning to City of London firms considering a post-Brexit transfer to a Paris base. The cost of living in the French capital is now 20% higher than London, although Frankfurt and Dublin are roughly equal in prices to London. The ten most expensive cities in the world Rank City World Cost of Living index (New York=100) 1 Singapore 120 2 Hong Kong 114 3 Zurich 113 4 Tokyo 110 5 Osaka 109 6 Seoul 108 7 Geneva 107 8 Paris 107 9 New York 100 10 Copenhagen 100 24 London 89 51 Manchester 77 Source: EIU.

Conversely, John Harle has tended to explore a non-jazz canon of music for the instrument, from Debussy to Michael Nyman, via Marc Almond, Elvis Costello and countless soundtracks. Tonight’s concert at the Guildhall School of Music &amp; Drama – where he is visiting professor – launches Harle’s new Faber book (a heavily illustrated technical tome called The Saxophone). It also belatedly celebrates his 60th birthday, for which he’s invited several modern composers to write something for him. “I think some of them thought they were writing for a youthful 16 year old,” he said, referring to the fast, spiky, mischievous and, frankly, ugly pieces by Graham Fitkin and Sally Beamish. Harle is better suited to pieces where we can relish his long, bel canto lines – like a cathedral chorister on the soprano sax, like Maria Callas on the alto. Pianist Steve Lodder (Harle’s accompanist for the evening) pens a soulful, Sketches of Spain-tinged modal melody called Cranbourne Close; Gavin Bryars provides Harlesden, a bucolic study that mixes fluttery circular breathing passages with sustained lines. Sax players can’t really avoid jazz, and Harle provides a genteel, oboe-like job on two Duke Ellington songs and a delightful sonata by Phil Woods. For an encore, however, Harle performs his arrangement of an Albinoni concerto – played in tight harmonies as a duet with Guildhall student Tom Gimson on soprano. He jokes about it “sounding like Alan Hawkshaw’s theme to Ski Sunday”, but it is a perfect example of how Harle can contextualise ancient music for this mongrel instrument. • This article was amended on 21 March 2017.
