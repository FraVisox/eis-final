I never liked what she stood for: from the moment I saw her 1978 World In Action TV interview in which she talked of Britain being “swamped by people with a different culture” – and in so doing dog-whistled to the racism of the National Front – I knew I would never vote Conservative. Not only that – she put millions on the dole without a care, and crushed those who defended workers’ rights. Her reputation as evil incarnate was sealed for all time. Or so I thought. I remember the first time I felt an ounce of sympathy for her. It was some time in the 90s, when I heard that she’d said anyone over 26 who ever travels by bus was a failure in life. Immediately I suspected “fake news” (as we didn’t say back then). Nothing she had said or done up to that point had shown contempt for public transport – and certainly not for those who used it (given the crossover with council home dwellers, whose votes she’d sought so strongly). There wasn’t Google in those days, but it’s since become clear that the “bus” quote came from Loelia Ponsonby, a former duchess of Westminster. Yet the bogus story still gets widely circulated. Those who fall for it completely misunderstand Thatcher. Yes, she was ruthless; yes, she had a view of the world that believed poorer people would fare better if their safety nets were removed, despite the harsh initial consequences. But she didn’t hate people. She just thought they should take responsibility for themselves, and not look to the state for help. In her notorious “there’s no such thing as society” interview, she spelled this out. “It is our duty to look after ourselves and then also to help look after our neighbour, and life is a reciprocal business, and people have got the entitlements too much in mind without the obligations, because there is no such thing as an entitlement unless someone has first met an obligation.” She was absolutely wrong to take this to extremes, and the mass unemployment her policies caused has led to social problems that have passed down the generations. But in many ways she was not the hardline ideologue that even her most rabid Tory supporters believed her to be. Her upbringing in the family shop marked her out as different to most politicians, realising at an early age that spending more than you have is not sustainable in the long term. Her scientific brain (she studied chemistry) also gave her a strong sense of how things worked. To understand her fully, just look at what she didn’t do. She refused to privatise the Royal Mail, saying she was “not prepared to have the Queen’s head privatised”. When the Tory-Liberal Democrat government pushed this through in 2013, shortly after her death, it was judged by a parliamentary committee to be a botched operation that undervalued the state asset by £1bn. She never wanted to sell off British Rail, saying it would be “a privatisation too far”. This unpopular policy was carried out under John Major, and has been a disaster – for passengers, for the public purse – in fact for just about everyone except the shareholders of the massively subsidised private rail companies. No wonder one of Labour’s most popular policies at the last election was rail renationalisation. She never “slashed the state”: in fact, public spending rose under Thatcher (though mainly as a result of unemployment benefits). She argued that cutting taxes would actually increase the tax take, by creating more wealth. She never wanted to join the euro. She held out for years against joining the currency’s forerunner, the exchange rate mechanism. After losing her long-term chancellor Nigel Lawson over this, and with her authority ebbing away in her final months, she was effectively forced into joining by his successor, Major. Just two years later – as she had warned him, we now know – Britain humiliatingly crashed out of the ERM on Black Wednesday, proving her right all along. And look at what she did do. She guided Britain into the single market because she realised that, no matter how frustrating other European nations may be, close cooperation with them brings jobs and economic growth. Those Tories who believe they’re building on Thatcher’s legacy by taking us out are simply delusional. She stood up to the US. She was no poodle, nor did she hold hands with the US president. Even though she and Ronald Reagan had an excellent working relationship, she ripped into him when his US troops invaded the Commonwealth island of Grenada in 1983, forcing him into a grovelling apology. When she went to war, she planned for the aftermath. Many people, myself included, opposed the Falkland Islands war, given the huge loss of life relative to the number of islanders. But given Britain’s military disasters since, this has to go down as an example of excellent long-term planning. The troops didn’t just leave and say “job done” when the conflict was over. They stayed to give the islanders a secure future. Contrast this with the short-termism of Tony Blair and David Cameron, exposed so bloodily in Iraq, Afghanistan and Libya. And all this she achieved having fought against the unadulterated sexism of Britain in the 50s, 60s and 70s on her way to the top. In fact, Thatcher singlehandedly changed the way Britain, and much of the world, viewed women as professionals and leaders. Other prime ministers since have had her ability (Gordon Brown) or her charisma (Blair) or her communications skills (Cameron). But none have had her courage and determination to bring about a radical change to society, and embed it for generations. In fact, the more one sees the puny, second-rate Thatcher-wannabes in the modern Conservative party (Theresa May, Boris Johnson, Michael Gove etc), the more she stands out as a thoughtful and grounded leader. And would she have been duped by the City before the financial crash, as New Labour (and George Osborne) were? There is, though, one leader who may match her for courage and revolutionary zeal, and who may yet bring about another major shift in society. His name is Jeremy Corbyn."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"voluntary-sector-network/2018/jan/12/charities-stop-poverty-porn-fundraising-ed-sheeran-comic-relief","type":"article","sectionId":"voluntary-sector-network","sectionName":"Voluntary Sector Network","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-12T11:32:17Z","webTitle":"Charities want to make an impact.

But poverty porn is not the way to do it","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Pity, guilt and shame are easy emotional levers to pull, and ones that have become tempting to indulge in as funding is squeezed. We have seen how one well-crafted message can raise awareness of a problem and increase donations in the blink of an eye – from the Kony 2012 film, which became a viral video sensation for Invisible Children, to the Ice Bucket Challenge, which raised more than £75m for motor neuron disease research. But at the other end of the scale, Comic Relief’s fundraising video featuring pop singer Ed Sheeran and the street children of Liberia won the Radi-Aid “most offensive” campaign award in 2017. Run by the Norwegian Students and Academics International Assistance Fund, ( the contest aims to expose and discourage “poverty porn”. Since Band Aid in 1984, non-profit organisations have faced scrutiny about approaches that raise awareness and money, but do not invite the public to question why poverty exists in the first place. The challenge for our sector is not just to get as many £5 texts as possible, but to transform goodwill into well-thought-out and sustained action. It means finding a balance between telling compelling stories, without trivialising people’s lives, or the long term prospects for social change. Trust the public with nuance Poverty, disease, injustice, and conflict are all heartbreaking. But sometimes the work needed to tackle them is not new, innovative, or sexy. It might be citizens demanding fundamental services like improved healthcare or better roads; or governments better managing their budgets; or pressing local agencies to be more responsive to public concerns. Donating is a way to immediately banish the discomfort of encountering people in need. But organisations can invite their supporters to learn more and dig a little deeper. They can also help to challenge preconceived notions that donations will automatically bring relief to people in poverty – or that charity itself is the only way to address it. Like Sheeran, no one wants to see children on the street in Liberia or anywhere else. The reasons why children are left without care are varied and, whether due to domestic, economic or social disruption, they are unique to each child’s situation. Comic Relief should have acknowledged that we must also support the local leaders who work to ensure a better future for these children. We must highlight the grey area between our interventions and the reality of how social change occurs. Trust the public with a little more nuance – they can handle it. Deemphasise the role of our own organisations The second step in striking this balance is to deemphasise the role of our own organisations. Charities can only do their work through partnerships. But non-profit organisations rarely highlight that they have a supportive role rather than a leading one. Instead, the equation too often presented to the public is that the organisation plus your money will equal the end of poverty. This is not a full picture. Often our partners’ work is absolutely vital to our success. And even where we fund a project, campaign or initiative, we mustn’t take credit for other people’s hard work. For example, Oxfam America supported Ghana’s successful Oil 4 Food campaign in 2014, but its staff did not go door to door to collect 20,000 signatures across Ghana. They were part of a coalition of local partners who influenced the Ghanaian government to invest oil revenues into smallholder farmers. Improve transparency Many different things determine whether a particular campaign is successful, including good planning, sufficient budgets and realistic timescales. Unfortunately, transparency about what does not go well is still uncommon in our sector. Making the link between poor results and the subsequent lessons learned can, perhaps paradoxically, inspire confidence in a charity. Every year for the past nine years, for example, the Canadian organisation Engineers Without Borders, which leads infrastructure development in Africa, has produced a failure report. Portray people with dignity and respect Nobody likes to feel helpless, incapable, or desperate, and they certainly don’t want to be portrayed in that way in charities’ reports or advertising campaigns. Charities have a responsibility to root out damaging stereotypes that are antithetical to our missions or that contribute to white saviour syndrome. As Theo Sowa, chief executive of the African Women’s Development Fund has said: “When people portray us as victims, they don’t want to ask about solutions. Because people don’t ask victims for solutions.” Solomé Lemma, co-founder of Africans in the Diaspora, urges people to consider who is speaking, for whom, about what and for what purpose, and to think about what might be missing. We want everyone to see themselves as part of a future they can help build. My own organisation, Thousand Currents, is trying to do this by shifting our approach from creating content to producing it. Changing the world is no easy undertaking. But the best stories lie with the courage, knowledge, skills, and determination of all citizens trying to better their lives, demand their rights, and hold those in power accountable. • Jennifer Lentfer is the director of communications at Thousand Currents and the creator of the blog how-matters.org.

Such was the case of Heather Menzies, who has died of brain cancer aged 68. The blond, blue-eyed 16-year-old played 13-year-old Louisa, the third oldest of the seven cute Von Trapp children taught to sing catchy Rodgers and Hammerstein songs by Maria, the fresh-faced singing nun-turned-governess played by Julie Andrews. With Andrews and the other six children, Menzies sang Do-Re-Mi, The Lonely Goatherd, So Long, Farewell, My Favourite Things, Edelweiss and the title song against spectacular Tyrolean scenery. In the film Louisa is slightly mischievous, introducing herself to her new governess as Brigitta, the name of another of the children. When Maria asks her charges for help in how to be a governess, Louisa replies: “The first thing is to tell Father [Captain Von Trapp, played by Christopher Plummer] to mind his own business!” Maria is also warned that Louisa had hidden spiders in the previous governess’s bed. Needless to say, no spiders are hidden to frighten Maria, who wins the children, and eventually the captain, over. As an adult, Menzies made a name for herself among movie geeks by starring in two cultish, tongue-in-cheek low-budget horror pics, Sssssss (1973) and Piranha (1978), about killer snakes and carnivorous fish respectively, as far away from The Sound of Music as one could get. She added the surname of her actor husband teh surname of her actor husband, Robert Urich, to her own after their marriage in 1975. (She was previously married to John Cluett from 1969 to 1973.) Born in Toronto to strict Presbyterian Scottish parents, who had emigrated to Canada after the second world war, Heather moved with her family to Los Angeles in 1960. She graduated from Hollywood high school and subsequently attended Falcon Studio’s University of the Arts in Hollywood. Before making her feature film debut in The Sound of Music, she launched her TV career with a juvenile role in an episode of My Three Sons (1964). She then appeared regularly as a guest in series such as The Farmer’s Daughter, Dragnet, Bonanza, The High Chaparral and The Love Boat throughout the 1960s and 70s, usually as an innocent girl. But this goody-goody persona was erased by a nude photoshoot for the August 1973 issue of Playboy, entitled The Tender Trapp. This was followed by Sssssss, in which she does a lot of screaming as the bespectacled daughter of a mad scientist who has turned her boyfriend into a snake. She is a slightly goofy private eye in Piranha, a satirical spin-off of Jaws (1975) in which bathers are the prey of flesh-eating fish. On television, she had a featured role as a revolutionary in all 14 episodes of Logan’s Run (1978), a spin-off from the 1976 sci-fi movie. Menzies gradually cut down on work when she was busy bringing up her three children, whom Urich and she had adopted. After he died of cancer in 2002, she established the Robert Urich Foundation, devoting much of her time to raising money for cancer research and support for cancer patients. She also attended regular Sound of Music reunions, including one at the 50th anniversary screening in LA in 2015. Charmian Carr, who played her elder sister, Liesl, in the film, died in 2016. She is survived by her three children, Ryan, Emily and Allison. • Heather Menzies (Heather Menzies-Urich), actor; born 3 December 1949; died 24 December 2017"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"football/2017/dec/29/alexis-sanchez-frustration-dressing-room-bust-up","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-29T16:22:56Z","webTitle":"Arsenal players’ frustrations with Alexis Sánchez led to dressing room bust-up","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/dec/29/alexis-sanchez-frustration-dressing-room-bust-up","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/dec/29/alexis-sanchez-frustration-dressing-room-bust-up","fields":{"headline":"Arsenal players’ frustrations with Alexis Sánchez led to dressing room bust-up","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Alexis Sánchez was at the heart of a dressing room bust-up after Arsenal’s away win against Burnley last month and the tensions between the forward and some of his team-mates – which have simmered for some time – were laid bare during the club’s victory at Crystal Palace on Thursday night. Sánchez was involved in a well-documented confrontation with Laurent Koscielny at Arsenal’s training ground last March, on the eve of the visit to Liverpool – a game for which Sánchez would be dropped – and the divisions in the team were there for all to see in the 3-2 win against Palace. Sánchez scored twice but five of his outfield team-mates did not celebrate his first goal with him. The refuseniks were Koscielny, Héctor Bellerín, Sead Kolasinac, Calum Chambers and Jack Wilshere. Sánchez appeared to gesture in surprise at the lack of celebrations around him. When Sánchez scored his second, Koscielny did not move from his spot inside his own half. The rest of the team did follow Wilshere – who had made the goal – over to the away enclosure where Sánchez was celebrating. The Burnley flare-up on 26 November was not physical but it involved Arsenal players calling out Sánchez over what they have come to consider as his bad attitude. He was told in no uncertain terms that the team were tired of his on-field histrionics; the way he sometimes whirls his arms in frustration when things go wrong. Sánchez, who had scored the only goal of the game at Turf Moor from the penalty spot, argued he was merely trying to help his team-mates but it was put to him that the best way to do so was through encouragement. It is fair to say Sánchez took issue with that. The 29-year-old, whose contract expires in June 2018, was desperate to leave the club last summer and he was on the brink of a £60m move to Manchester City on transfer deadline day. But Arsenal failed to close a deal for Monaco’s Thomas Lemar and they pulled the plug on Sánchez’s switch because they would not sell him without having a player to replace him in the lineup. Arsène Wenger believed Sánchez would re-focus for the final year of his contract; that his ferocious will to win would overtake his other concerns when he stepped on to the field. The manager also hoped that the prospect of a World Cup with Chile at the end of the season would serve as additional motivation. Sánchez was heartbroken in October when his country failed to qualify. Sánchez has scored eight times for Arsenal this season and he was excellent at Palace in a game that his team had to win. But his form has been up and down and it has been a constant topic of discussion at Wenger press conferences. Some of his team-mates have grown weary of him and, as it has become obvious to them that he will not re-sign at Arsenal, they feel it would be better for all parties if he was sold. City still want him and the question is whether they will move in January or wait until the summer, when he will be available for nothing. Paris Saint-Germain have also been credited with an interest in him. Wenger’s position is he expects Sánchez to honour the remainder of his contract, although that could change if City, PSG or anybody else made an offer for him in January. Thierry Henry, the former Arsenal striker, said on Sky Sports after the Palace game that it was clear to him there was a rift among the players. “There is a division in the team,” Henry said. “He [Sánchez] is asking them to come and celebrate. ‘Why are they not coming? Don’t you want to celebrate?’ “I don’t know what the situation is there but usually when your team scores, you don’t look at who scores. If you start to think: ‘Shall I go, shall I not go?’ – there’s something we don’t know exactly what’s happening. What I’m trying to say is you’re not here for Alexis Sánchez, you’re here for Arsenal. Arsenal scored, go and celebrate. I noticed it [Sánchez’s gesture]. Sanchez made me notice it. It was like he thought he was alone.” Henry’s fellow Sky Sports pundit Graeme Souness said: “It’s a divided dressing room. Some of them are not having Sánchez and his situation. I think it’s clear. I think it tells you there’s a dynamic going on in that dressing room that would suggest it’s not well.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"uk-news/2017/dec/29/new-year-honours-from-the-beatles-to-the-94-year-old-charity-shop-founder","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-29T22:30:09Z","webTitle":"New Year honours: Bussell, a Bee Gee and a Beatle among gong gang","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/dec/29/new-year-honours-from-the-beatles-to-the-94-year-old-charity-shop-founder","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2017/dec/29/new-year-honours-from-the-beatles-to-the-94-year-old-charity-shop-founder","fields":{"headline":"New Year honours: Bussell, a Bee Gee and a Beatle among gong gang","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Arts He may have received the knighthood two decades after his former bandmate Paul McCartney, but Ringo Starr did not seem to mind. Starr, who was among those recognised in the New Years honours list, was exuberant in reaction to the news of his title, which he described as “an honour and a pleasure”. The knighthood comes 52 years after he was given an MBE for his global success as the drummer for the Beatles. Starr has often joked that McCartney, who was knighted in 1997, considers himself to be the only living Beatle, but McCartney has long spoken of how he feels Starr is deserving of the honour. “It’s great! It’s an honour and a pleasure to be considered and acknowledged for my music and my charity work, both of which I love,” Starr said in a brief statement, before signing off with “peace and love”. Others in the arts world honoured included Darcey Bussell, the former principal dancer at the Royal Ballet and now a judge on Strictly Come Dancing. Bussell said she was “truly humbled” to become a dame for services to dance. She is being honoured more than 10 years after she was given a CBE in the Queen’s birthday honours and more than 20 years after her first accolade, an OBE in 1995. The last survivor of the Bee Gees, Barry Gibb, was also given a knighthood, and Wiley – dubbed the “godfather of grime”– was honoured with an MBE. Gibb, 71, said he was “deeply honoured, humbled and very proud” to be recognised, adding: “This is a moment in life to be treasured and never forgotten. I want to acknowledge how responsible my brothers are for this honour. It is as much theirs as it is mine.” Wiley, 38, who was among the early pioneers of grime, said: “It feels like the school grade I wanted and didn’t get but now I’m finally there.”Also facing up to the fact he was now “part of the establishment” was Soft Cell singer Marc Almond, 60, who was given an OBE for services to arts and culture. The Tainted Love singer said he was “totally excited” to be receiving the honour, adding: “I can’t really be a rebel any more. I think it’s time to leave it to younger people.” The former child laureate Michael Morpurgo was honoured with a knighthood, an accolade he immediately passed on to his most popular character, Joey from his 1982 children’s book War Horse, to whom he said the honour really belonged. Morpurgo said: “Probably if I’m honest with myself, it is about one book. And it’s about one story and one play, the great good fortune of my writing life in terms of, I suppose, circumstance and bringing the kind of success you can’t dream of in terms of rewards and awards - it’s the play of War Horse. “There was never a knight that has owed so much to his horse as this one – and in fact, we will give the knighthood to Joey and call him Sir Joey.” Broadcaster and writer Melvyn Bragg and author and historian Lady Antonia Fraser were both given the high distinction of Companion of Honour. HEP Science, medicine and education The British artificial intelligence company Deep Mind this year unveiled a computer program that took just three days to become expert in the complex Chinese board game Go. It was an achievement that some believe could pave the way for machines that can perform any human intellectual task. Its co-founder and chief executive officer, Demis Hassabis, received a CBE for services to science and technology. Helen Sharman, a chemist who became the first British astronaut when she travelled to the Russian Mir space station in 1991, became a companion of the Order of St Michael and St George, for services to science and technology educational outreach. Our ability to see chemical reactions happening at an atomic scale is down to Professor Pratibha Gai, who received a damehood. The York-based scientist drilled a hole in an microscope to create a new kind of device allowing scientists to look at reactions in the conditions they would normally happen in, rather than in the specific temperatures and vacuum required by electron microscopes. https://www.theguardian.com/voluntary-sector-network/2017/dec/29/voluntary-sector-professionals-2018-new-year-honours In a choice example of nominative determinism, there was a knighthood for Bristol University volcanologist Prof Robert Sparks, known to colleagues as Steve Sparks. Karen Holford, the deputy vice-chancellor of Cardiff University, who started her career at Rolls Royce working on the Pegasus engine used on the Harrier jump jet, received an OBE for services to engineering and the advancement of women in science and engineering. In medicine, there was a Knight Grand Cross for Sir Keith Peters, an expert in the immunology of renal and vascular disease. There were damehoods for Jackie Daniel, the chief executive of the University Hospitals of Morecambe Bay NHS Foundation Trust, and Clare Marx, an orthopaedic surgeon and the outgoing president of the Royal College of Surgeons. Janet Beer, the vice-chancellor of the University of Liverpool, who this autumn defended university leaders’ soaring pay against “hysterical” media reaction, received a damehood. RB Sport Three members of England’s World Cup winning women’s cricket squad, as well as their coach, were named on the New Year’s honours list. The captain, Heather Knight, and the coach, Mark Robinson, are both awarded OBEs, while Knight’s teammates, Anya Shrubsole and Tammy Beaumont, receive MBEs. The England and Wales cricket board director of women’s cricket, Clare Connor, becomes a CBE, having previously been awarded an OBE. Knight receives her OBE for services to cricket following England’s triumph in the summer, which was delivered with victory over India at Lord’s. They were among a string of sports stars to be named on the list. The British and Irish Lions captain, Sam Warburton, and the former Scotland rugby union captain Ian McLauchlan, are both given OBEs. Warburton, the Cardiff Blues flanker, has won 74 international caps for Wales and also led the Lions in Australia in 2013. Ed Morrison, who was England’s first full-time professional rugby union referee and took charge of the 1995 World Cup final between South Africa and New Zealand, gets an OBE. Stef Reid, the Paralympian who won silver in the F44 long jump at the London 2012 Games and in Rio four years later, collects an MBE. MBEs were also awarded to Eric Harrison, the former Manchester United youth team coach who helped develop the “Class of 92”, Alan Davies, the Welsh cycling coach who worked with numerous Olympic gold medallists as youngsters, and the Scotland and Lions team doctor, James Robson. The secretary general of the International Ski Federation, Sarah Lewis, receives an OBE for services to sport, while Nicky Henderson, the trainer of the Queen’s racehorses, is made a Royal Victorian Order Lieutenant (LVO). KR Business Ken Olisa, the first black Briton to join the board of a FTSE 100 company, has been named a Knight Bachelor for services to business and philanthropy. Nottingham-born Olisa said he grew up hearing that a young black man from a single-parent family such as him could not succeed. The corporate ethics expert and former parliamentary standards watchdog derided this suggestion as “bunkum” as he was recognised for a 40-year career in technology and banking, as well as his charity work. “I feel ecstatic followed by being humbled,” said Olisa, adding that the honour was “such an important statement about the country we live in, the way the country works and accessibility for everyone in the country”. “I landed in a place where people said those of single parentage, black people are disadvantaged, can’t get along, and people who are poor can’t get opportunities. I think it’s bunkum. I’ve devoted a lot of my life ... to what I call social inclusion, trying to help people who believe that kind of bunkum to realise it isn’t true.” The Cambridge graduate became the first British-born black man to serve as a director of a major UK company when he joined the board of Thomson Reuters in 2004. He is joined on the honours list by husband and wife power couple Chrissie Rucker and Nick Wheeler, both of whom were awarded OBEs. Rucker started upmarket homewares firm The White Company, while husband Wheeler founded the Charles Tyrwhitt shirt-maker. The pair jointly own their retail empire via holding company Bectin Limited, which reported a pre-tax profit of £19m in the year to March 2016 on revenues of nearly £300m. Businesswoman Vivian Hunt, a managing partner for UK and Ireland at management consultant McKinsey, received a damehood for services to the economy and women in business. Raja Adil, whose Adil Group owns a sprawling network of Kentucky Fried Chicken, Costa Coffee and Burger King franchises, was awarded an OBE for services to business, job creation and charity. RD General public Not everyone on the new year honours list is a household name. Alongside rock stars, prima ballerinas and Tory powerbrokers are hardworking individuals across the length and breadth of the UK who have dedicated themselves to serving their communities – in some cases for several decades. The reach of the honours list stretches as far north as Kirkwall, Orkney, where Margaret Jamieson, 94, received a British Empire medal (BEM) for supporting community projects through the Blue Door charity shop. The shop – founded by Jamieson in 2003 – is offered rent free to a different Orkney-based organisation each week and has raised more than £1.7m for different groups. At the other end of the country, Geoffrey Evans, the Conservative councillor for Falmouth Arwenack in Cornwall, received an MBE for more than 40 years’ service as a councillor. Helena Jones, 101, received a BEM for her services to young people and the community in Brecon, Powys, while 18-year-old Lucia Mee was the youngest person on the list. She received a BEM for services to promoting public awareness about organ donation. Mee has had three liver transplants, the first when she was eight. Afrasiab Anwar, 38, was honoured with an MBE for services to community cohesion in Burnley. His work was previously recognised through the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee Awards and includes working with Building Bridges, an interfaith organisation.

They played Chelsea, Cardiff City, Arsenal and Rangers, the last two matches so rancorous they inspired George Orwell to write his famous essay The Sporting Spirit. The tour, Orwell wrote, had only created fresh animosity on both sides. “And how could it be otherwise?” he asked. “I’m always amazed when I hear people saying that sport creates goodwill between nations.” Sport, Orwell thought, had become “bound up with the rise of nationalism – that is, with the lunatic modern habit of identifying oneself with large power units and seeing everything in terms of competitive prestige”. All international sport is political, it’s just that we are so often swept up in the great gusts of excitement about who won and lost we do not often stop to look at the currents that carry it all along. Next year, though, promises to be as much about the games politicians play as it does the sports the athletes do. In February the Winter Olympics start in Pyeongchang, 50 miles from the border between North and South Korea. They are being pitched as the Games of Peace, an opportunity to promote understanding through the medium of salchows and frontside 720s. The International Olympic Committee will be busy “blah-blahing”, as Orwell called it, about “the great part played by the Olympic Games in bringing nations together”. It has been doing everything it can to encourage North Korea to take part. It has provided funding for equipment, travel and accommodation for the North Korea speed skating and Nordic skiing teams, and has promised to keep wild card slots open for athletes who fail to qualify. The IOC hopes Kim Jong-un will not do anything egregiously provocative during the fortnight if his athletes are competing too. The only North Koreans who have qualified, the figure skaters Ryom Tae-Ok and Kim Ju-sik, are still waiting for permission to compete. The situation is so unstable the US ambassador to the UN, Nikki Haley, said recently it was an “open question” whether or not the US would compete, though the White House’s press secretary quickly insisted they would. In 2014, after all, Donald Trump described the fact the USA finished behind Russia in the medal table as “another Obama embarrassment!” and asked “isn’t it time we turned things around and started kicking ass?” Which will be a little easier to do this time around given that Russia have been banned from competing. This is punishment for their state‑sponsored doping programme. Vladimir Putin has described the decision as “absolutely staged and politically motivated”. Which is certainly a fitting description of the IOC’s subsequent decision to allow athletes who can prove themselves to be clean to identify as “Olympic athletes from Russia”, instead of “independent Olympic athletes”, which is the title it used in the summer Games in Rio. There is talk, too, that the IOC’s ban may be lifted before the Olympics are over, just so Russia’s flag can fly at the closing ceremony. The Russians will console themselves with the World Cup, which they host in June and July. If the IOC seems soft on Russia, who systematically corrupted the Sochi Games, Fifa has been entirely spineless. The Russia sports minister Vitaly Mutko has been banned for life by the IOC but remained the president of the Russian Football Union until stepping down this week. He also stood down as the chief organiser for a World Cup that will be played, like Dynamo’s 1945 tour, for propaganda. Fifa is apparently satisfied that, as its secretary general Fatma Samoura told the BBC, “there is no widespread doping in Russian football”, although Wada’s McLaren report listed 33 cases between 2011 and 2015. In between the Winter Olympics and the World Cup, there is the Commonwealth Games on the Gold Coast, a competition memorably lampooned by John Oliver as “the historic display of a once mighty nation gathering together the countries it lost and finding a way to lose to them once more”. But ahead of Brexit, the village fete of international sports tournaments suddenly seems more relevant than it has in a long while. It’s no coincidence the government was so keen for British cities to bid for the Games in 2022 after Durban dropped out, or that it has agreed to meet the large part of the cost of hosting them. If the government’s enthusiasm for the bid is one of the more tangible effects of Brexit on sport, there is a more nebulous connection, too, which touches on the ideas Orwell explained all those years ago. Much as he decried it, these sports tournaments are among the many ways in which we shape our national narrative. They can influence the mood of the country. Charles Grant, the director of the Centre for European Reform, recently told the New York Times the 2012 Olympics was the last moment in which Britain agreed on its own national story. “Global Britain, open Britain, generous Britain” was how he described it. In the last year the sporting culture that underpinned Britain’s success in those Olympics and Paralympics has been scrutinised and dismantled. To be blunt, there has been a lot of bad news. Amid the ebb and flow of the annual events, then, the Six Nations, the summer Tests, the F1 season, the cycling tours, golf and tennis majors, let’s hope these three major tournaments might just provide some measure of good feeling too. And if it does all go wrong in Russia, we can claim, at least, to have been heeding Orwell’s advice. If Britain must send a side back to Russia for a return tour, he wrote in 1945, “then let us send a second-rate team which is sure to be beaten”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/dec/31/why-the-lynx-efffect-would-be-a-boon-for-scotland","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-31T00:03:15Z","webTitle":"Why the lynx effect would be a boon for Scotland | Kevin McKenna","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/31/why-the-lynx-efffect-would-be-a-boon-for-scotland","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/31/why-the-lynx-efffect-would-be-a-boon-for-scotland","fields":{"headline":"Why the lynx effect would be a boon for Scotland","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"During a difficult year, the lynx provided a welcome fragment of good cheer. It seems the big cat could be making a return to the wilds of Scotland after an absence of several hundred years. There are many things to like about the reintroduction of a Champions League predator to the Scottish countryside, not least of which is that it would greatly inconvenience and outrage farming and agricultural types. Indeed, Scotland’s farmers were so perturbed by reports of the lynx’s return that several of them undertook a study trip to Norway for the purpose of building a case against the lynx. Unsurprisingly, the Norwegian harvesters warned their Scottish brethren that reintroduction of the lynx would be an “absolute catastrophe” for Scotland’s sheep population. The Norwegians claimed that 20,000 sheep were lost last year to the predations of the lynx and unnamed others. Curiously, they couldn’t produce a specific number of deceased sheep that were the sole responsibility of the lynx. Any study produced after a farmers’ jolly to Scandinavia ought to be treated with extreme caution. These eternal European subsidy junkies have always represented a compelling reason to dislike the European Union. Yet having lived off the fat of farming subsidies for decades, many of them voted to bring us out of Europe. In the case of foot-and-mouth disease, an epidemic that made many farmers rich with swollen payouts, animal hygiene issues were a factor. There was an official investigation into reports that some farmers had deliberately infected their livestock once they discovered the compensation levels. Reintroduction of the lynx, as well as other big beasties, would be a boon for Scotland. The Lynx UK Trust believes there are many ecological benefits springing from the cat’s return to the Scottish wild. Among these are helping to control deer populations and protecting the capercaillie, one of Scotland’s most cherished big birds, the welfare of which causes many to fret. The trust also points out that overpopulation of deer in Scotland is damaging forest habitats and restricting woodland regeneration. There are significant ancillary benefits. Scotland’s mountains contribute greatly to the country being consistently voted the world’s most beautiful. Hardly a year passes without Scotland receiving another garland for the beauty and grandeur of its rural landscapes. These jaggy wildernesses are made for top predators, yet apart from a few golden eagles, some osprey and a few wee peregrines, our big spaces have little else but sheep, cows and goats. Even the few decent raptors we’ve got left are at risk of extinction because landowners want to eradicate them to leave plenty of grouse for Prince Harry and his indolent chums to exterminate. You can’t get within yards of a decent mountain without a moving sea of blue, yellow and green tramping all over our hills and glens morning, noon and night. Scotland’s national emblem shouldn’t be a thistle – it should be a rucksack. It would be grand to replace some of this seething, sweating river of humanity disfiguring our beautiful places with a few species of serious hunters and biters. The potential benefits are eye-watering. First, you’d get David Attenborough and his team up here when he gets round to doing a Green Planet or Jaggy Planet series. That would bring in more proper tourism than a few thousand Munro-botherers. And there’s always the joyous possibility of bear or wolves preying on hill walkers and keeping their numbers down to manageable levels. Yes, yes, yes – I know tourism and “outdoor activities” bring a “much-needed boost” to our economy. Isn’t it curious how that phrase “much-needed boost to the economy” is deployed when the middle classes want to have a party or stretch their legs? Thus Edinburgh’s Hogmanay gives a “much-needed boost” to the economy; hunting and shooting deliver one, too, as do the writhing and perspiring rucksack and cagoule army. Little scrutiny of the phrase “much-needed boost” ever occurs. I doubt whether Edinburgh’s edgier neighbourhoods, such as Pilton and Wester Hailes, share greatly in the “much-needed boost”. The same siren voices were raised when the beaver was reintroduced to Scotland in Argyll’s Knapdale Forest. Last month, three more beavers were introduced to the forest seven years after the first ones. The success of their reintroduction has exceeded all expectations. Their construction skills make them expert at habitat management to the benefit of Scotland. Their dam-building can stabilise important wetlands during dry months and create still-water pools that become perfect environments for diverse types of insects, such as dragonflies. They can improve biodiversity by ensuring a variety of native tree species flourish. Unsurprisingly, as with the lynx, the narrow interests of similar opposition groups coalesced in a familiar pattern around the beaver’s reintroduction. Landowners, rich residents, farmers and anglers all opposed the beasts for the flimsiest reasons: houses and business premises could be at risk of flooding. There could be crop damage and an adverse impact on fish stocks. None of this has happened, nor was it ever likely to. As usual, the over-protected interests of privileged groups were being advanced before the interests of the nation. And as usual, their claims went untested. Some of these landowners are descended from families who participated in an illegal land grab over several hundred years. Having driven people off their lands to make way for sheep, they now try to justify their continued stewardship of these places by saying they are not fit for human communities and that only they possess the skills and experience to manage them properly. So we won’t treat seriously anything they have to say about land conservation and the mix of species that we permit to thrive on them. Scotland was a home for many of these species well before greedy humans arrived. Our country was designed principally for them. So let’s bring them all back – the lynxes, wolves and bears. This land is their land."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/dec/30/our-patience-is-wearing-thin-commerce-needs-clarity-on-rexit","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-30T22:00:12Z","webTitle":"Our patience is wearing thin.

Commerce needs clarity on Brexit","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"As we enter 2018, the UK has some enduring business bright spots. Yet despite the optimism that drives many of our best firms, we start the new year with below-par economic growth, stubborn inflation, low rates of investment and far too few potential recruits for the many jobs on offer. Some very big decisions lie ahead. Getting the twin challenges of Brexit and the economic fundamentals right will require leadership, consistency and clarity – after a year in which business has been dismayed by what it sees as division and disorganisation across Westminster. Yet if our leaders make the right decisions they will turbo-charge business confidence and open the door to risk-taking, investment and export growth. Get those decisions wrong or, even worse, duck them entirely and we will ring in 2019 wondering why we are performing well below our potential at a crucial time. Unleashing the animal spirits of British business in 2018 requires clarity on Brexit, an ambitious and visible domestic growth strategy and consistent, coherent leadership, with a focus on the national interest, not the electoral interest. Businesses have been very patient in waiting for clarity on Brexit in the 18 months since the referendum. That patience is now wearing thin. Businesses want answers, they want clarity and they want results. Chambers of Commerce members – as well as their EU trading partners – want a swift “standstill” transition agreement as soon as possible in 2018. This would give certainty on short-term trading conditions and ensure that businesses face only one set of adjustment costs when the final UK-EU settlement kicks in. The transition must be agreed quickly; a failure to do so would see contingency plans activated, investment flows delayed and a battening down of the hatches in far too many of our firms. In 2018, businesses also want clarity on the future terms of UK-EU trade and decisive action to secure the benefits of the trade agreements the UK has been part of as a member of the EU. Clear answers on regulation, standards, customs, tariffs and more must be found. Businesses don’t want to hear about “Canada plus plus plus” or “Norway minus”: they want results, not descriptions of the bureaucratic process. Yet Brexit is not the only priority for the business community. For many firms, a clear and comprehensive agenda to support growth at home matters just as much – if not more. Next year, Britain must build a far more comprehensive economic plan, backed up by radical budgets and sustained investment. Westminster and Whitehall must realise that the best possible Brexit deal will be worthless if future conditions for growth aren’t right here at home. A speedy boost to productivity could be achieved if ministers, regulators and suppliers joined forces to ensure fast broadband reaches the businesses that need it, that housebuilding targets are met and mobile phone signals improved. High-speed broadband often stops a mile from key business centres; firms can’t hire staff because there is not enough of the right sort of housing and employees on the move find themselves losing time and work due to mobile “not-spots”. Speeding up often-announced, often-delayed infrastructure projects would give a real boost to 2018. Work must continue on HS2, and progress at Heathrow, but long-promised local road and rail improvements must also materialise. Yet the biggest potential brake on business growth in 2018 will be the lack of available skilled workers. Ministers must stabilise the apprenticeship and training system and recognise that simpler, less costly immigration rules are needed so that firms can get the people they need to grow. These are the basic issues that most firms care about. The fundamentals matter: the UK will not hold on to Forbes’s recent “best place to do business” accolade in the future if poor infrastructure, sclerotic labour markets and high costs hold our economy back. The government needs to pull out all the stops and demonstrate that it has a radical and comprehensive programme to ensure that we are ready to compete in the post-Brexit world. In this most pivotal of years, our leaders must be radical and do everything in their power to nurture entrepreneurial energy and confidence across Britain. I have every confidence that businesses, large and small, would repay such leadership many times over.

Scenes of overflowing bins and bags spilling out their contents have been shared on social media as collections by the public services firm, Ama, were disrupted by holidays and heavy downpours. “The situation right now is chronic,” said Massimiliano Tonelli, the founder of Roma Fa Schifo (Rome is Disgusting). “During this period, Ama never manages to organise collections well but things have got worse over the last couple of years.” Rome has been managed by the Five Star Movement, which is leading in opinion polls ahead of general elections on 4 March, since Virginia Raggi was elected mayor in June 2016. Solving the rubbish crisis was one of her campaign pledges, but an ambitious plan launched in April has so far proved futile. Neighbourhoods beyond the city centre, which is usually better maintained due to the number of visitors it attracts, have been the worst affected in recent days. “The rubbish pile-up here gets bad during holidays and when Ama goes on strike,” said Shelly Ruelle, an American who lives in EUR, an area south of the centre. “It’s not any worse this year. The decline has been going on for at least the past four or five years. The problem is endemic to Rome bureaucracy and there are major mismanagement issues within the individual entities [that manage public services].” Meanwhile in Ostia, a seaside suburb, residents have been setting bins alight. Four incidents were reported on Boxing Day. Despite reports of some areas being cleaned up on Friday morning, the situation is expected to continue through the New Year holiday period. About 70,000 tonnes a year of the city’s household rubbish is sent to a waste-to-energy plant in Austria. Tuscany also shares some of the burden, while a potential deal with the Emilia-Romagna region is in jeopardy due to fraught relations with Rome’s administration. “Even if collections were super-efficient, there is nowhere to take the rubbish,” said Tonelli. Still, Rome’s problems are unlikely to dent the popularity of the Five Star Movement before general elections. “They make no impact on the polls,” said Tonelli. “But one thing is certain – this new political class is worse than the previous one.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/jan/01/guardian-footballer-of-the-year-2017-juan-mata","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-01T10:00:07Z","webTitle":"The Guardian footballer of the year 2017: Juan Mata","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jan/01/guardian-footballer-of-the-year-2017-juan-mata","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/jan/01/guardian-footballer-of-the-year-2017-juan-mata","fields":{"headline":"The Guardian footballer of the year 2017: Juan Mata","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The Guardian Footballer of the Year is an award given to a player who has done something truly remarkable, whether by overcoming adversity, helping others or setting a sporting example by acting with exceptional honesty. The inaugural winner was Fabio Pisacane in 2016 Each time you meet Juan Mata it’s a surprise how small he appears in person. You never expect a giant of a man to be only 5ft 7in tall, and to cut such a slight figure or to flash a warm smile, but the Guardian’s Footballer of the Year for 2017 has always made a habit of confounding expectations about himself and the game he loves. This year Mata has done more than anyone to give fresh belief that professional football is not only built on greed and staggering wages for its strutting prima donnas. The Manchester United and Spain midfielder, instead, has broken new ground and begun to use football’s power and wealth to help ordinary people around the world. “It’s a very simple idea,” Mata says with typical understatement as he describes the remarkable Common Goal initiative he helped to launch in August, so that he and a growing number of his colleagues can donate 1% of their salaries to global charities. “But some of the best ideas are simple ones and, when it comes to football, the power of the game is incredible. Anyone who understands football will know why we are so hopeful and ambitious with Common Goal.” In less than five months Mata has been joined by 35 other football people from 17 countries in donating 1% of their salaries to Common Goal. All the money raised will be given to football charities where it is needed most – and the project now includes, beyond the players, its first manager, administrator and startup initiative. The players, of course, are the real drivers of Common Goal and Mata has been joined by high-profile internationals such as Mats Hummels, Giorgio Chiellini, Shinji Kagawa and Kasper Schmeichel – as well as leading women footballers in Alex Morgan and Megan Rapinoe. Julian Nagelsmann, the 30-year-old who has forged a dynamic reputation at Hoffenheim, became the first head coach to join Common Goal in October while Aleksander Ceferin, the Uefa president, also pledged 1% of his salary to the cause. When announcing his backing last month, Ceferin said: “I call upon everyone in the international football community – players, coaches, clubs and leagues – to show they care about social initiatives and donate to causes they believe in.” Common Goal’s grand ambition is to reach a position where 1% of football’s entire multibillion dollar industry is donated to charity. It might seem an impossible dream – just as a young boy’s fantasy of becoming a top footballer almost always seems unobtainable. But Mata was one of those who fulfilled his footballing dream. We have met twice this year and, during our first interview, Mata spoke evocatively when remembering how, having joined Real Oviedo aged 10 in 1998, he was given a previously unimaginable opportunity. Mata sat in a car park in 2003, when he was 14, and watched his father talking to a Real Madrid scout. “My first thought was: ‘Wow, my dad is speaking with a guy from Real Madrid Academy! Is this happening?’ Until that moment I saw myself very far from that. I was in my home town doing good for Real Oviedo and playing with older people but you never realise your level until some of these big clubs speak to your dad. “You are full of excitement but doubt, too. ‘Am I good enough to play there?’ That was my first thought. I know I’m doing good in Oviedo but if I played against Real Madrid and Barcelona in tournaments I see them with the famous shirts. They look bigger, taller, quicker and stronger – because of the shirt. “I can’t hear what my dad and the Madrid academy guy are saying but my next thought was: ‘Whoa, let’s see what happens. If they give me a chance let’s try my best.’ But it was still a big surprise when my dad told me the news. Real Madrid wanted me to join their academy. It was a big decision to move when I was 15. It’s a key age for a youngster and you’re close to your friends and family. But I moved to Madrid and my family stayed at home. It made me mature earlier than normal. That was a very big decision and it changed me in a positive way.” Life is predicated by the decisions and choices we make – and, earlier this year, the personal fused with the professional again as Mata reached the landmark moment when he knew he had to try to harness football’s power for the benefit of people less fortunate than him and his contemporaries. The death of his grandfather, who had done so much to nurture his love of football, moved him profoundly. Mata wanted to turn his feeling of loss into one of hope. “I had been thinking about doing my own foundation to help others,” Mata says. “But I then met Jürgen Griesbeck [the founder of streetfootballworld, which now runs Common Goal]. He’s been working in football for 15 years and he started in Colombia after the death of Andrés Escobar because he scored an own goal in the [1994] World Cup. We came up with the idea of bringing football together to help others. The idea is that it doesn’t have to be voluntary. We aim to have the 1% donation [embedded] within the structure of football.” When Common Goal was launched Mata found the right words to explain the pure belief that would drive the project. He began by recalling a lonely moment in the 2012 Champions League final in Munich. Bayern Munich, playing at home, had taken the lead in the 83rd minute when Thomas Müller’s looping header bounced into the Chelsea net. “A few seconds later,” Mata recalled, “I was standing in the centre circle of the Allianz Arena, waiting for the Bayern players to stop celebrating the goal they thought had just won the match. Didier Drogba, my Chelsea team-mate, walked up to me to restart play. Didier never had his head down – never looked discouraged – but now he did. I couldn’t understand why. We had gone through so much to get to the final. Our manager had been sacked a few months before, then we had come from behind to beat Napoli in the round of 16, then we had survived with 10 men at Camp Nou in the semi-finals. And now … it was over? “I put my hand on Didier’s shoulder and said: ‘Look around, Didier. Look where we are. Keep believing … just believe.’ For some reason I kept thinking: ‘We are destined to win this thing.’ I’m a pretty quiet person and when Didier saw me encouraging him to keep going, he couldn’t help but smile. He said: ‘OK, Juan. Let’s go.’” Mata would soon whip in the cross that allowed Drogba to equalise – and Chelsea went on to win the Champions League, beating the German club on penalties, with their talisman from the Ivory Coast making history with the final spot-kick. “As we were celebrating, I looked around at my team-mates and saw the beauty of football. A keeper from the Czech Republic. A defender from Serbia and another from Brazil. Midfielders from Ghana, Nigeria, Portugal, Spain and England. And, of course, one incredible striker from Côte d’Ivoire. “We came from all over the world, from different circumstances and spoke many different languages. Some had grown up during wartime. Some had grown up in poverty. But there we were, all standing together in Germany as champions of Europe. The way we had come together from all around the world to work for a common goal was more meaningful to me than the trophy. To me, that is something that can change the world for the better.” The 29-year-old has also won the World Cup and Euro 2012, and played for Valencia, Chelsea and Manchester United. Yet if you spend any sustained time with Mata it is obvious how much he regards football as a game that touches him in the same way that moves billions of people with its capacity for joy and pain. It also generates enduring hope and pleasure, and so, amid the familiar disappointment whenever your team loses, football pulses with more life than any other sport. “For me,” Mata says, “football is what I love to do most. It is also the thing I’m better doing than anything else. But football is more than a game. Common Goal brings together these two levels of how football is understood. We have professional football but we also have a beautiful game, which, wherever you go, can be used as a social tool for change. Football has an unmatchable power. “I have such strong memories from South Africa when we won the World Cup with Spain in 2010. We saw the passion for the game among kids there and it was the same when I went to Mumbai this year. Everywhere you go kids are playing football. Even if there is not much grass you have four sweaters which make the two goals. The kids just play.” I went to the opening of the photographic exhibition Mata and his girlfriend held at the National Football Museum – and surrounded by photographs they had taken in Mumbai it was heartening to see a young Indian football team Mata had invited to Manchester. His face was a picture when he listened to the little footballers sing a team song for him. “It was a great experience to be in Mumbai. A lot of the kids didn’t know who I was but I loved seeing them play football. I was also emotional when I saw they were trying to teach the kids English in the classrooms – and seeing people trying to feed their children in a proper way. It was a great visit but it was a big shock of reality in terms of how some people around the world do struggle.” Footballers are often dismissed as arrogant or ignorant but Common Goal provides an alternative view. “Sometimes you look at footballers and think they’re selfish or they don’t bring a good image to society,” Mata admits. “But sometimes people underestimate footballers and their capacity to have a strong opinion and sympathy for others. I believe being a professional footballer means you have some responsibility to think of others who don’t have the same opportunities. It’s a matter of education – but I am positive the more we talk the more young players will have a perception of how lucky we are.” Football is a game of tumult and glory, of small disappointments and lingering dreams, and Mata has played long enough at the highest level to appreciate these truths. He was player of the year in successive seasons at Chelsea before being sidelined by the returning manager, José Mourinho, and sold to Manchester United in 2014. In 2016 Mata was tested again when Mourinho was appointed United’s manager. Yet there has been no ill-feeling and Mata has become an integral member of Mourinho’s squad – to the extent that, earlier this season, the manager said: “I need Mata’s brain.” It is a sentiment most of us understand and appreciate. We need Mata’s intelligence and compassion, his wider vision and social conscience in a fractured world. In his own small and noble way he is making a profound difference – which explains why he was such an obvious winner of the Guardian’s Footballer of the Year award in 2017. He looks down at the trophy and murmurs his thanks. But then Mata stresses his typical belief. “I am proud to accept this award on behalf of everyone at Common Goal. This was never going to be about me.

I’m being flippant of course. Two of the above five things didn’t happen. But what I observed over the past couple of months has been curious to say the least. It started with Tesco’s Christmas advert, which featured briefly (for literally two seconds) a Muslim family. What followed was a campaign to boycott Tesco by those who claimed the ad disrespected their Christian faith. I can understand that; I think the last thing a working-class, anti-capitalist, brown Palestinian Jew would want is inclusion. “Love thy neighbour … as long as they’re not different to you” is how I believe the full saying goes, after all. Never mind that Jesus is mentioned over six more times than the prophet Muhammad in the Qur’an. I must say, I did enjoy the plot twist to this year’s annual Muslim conspiracy. Usually it’s that we are trying to ban Christmas. Yes, probably the majority of Muslims don’t partake in Christmas celebrations, but none of us are trying to ban it lads! Just like no one is trying to ban period dramas (though they should, haven’t we had enough?) The latest complaints were occasioned by a Muslim actually trying to get in the spirit of the season. What? It’s true: somehow the news of Mo Farah wishing everyone a Merry Christmas got turned into a story about how a smattering of idiots from among his 667,000 followers decided to abuse him for it on religious grounds. After years of hearing from the rightwing press, hate groups and even members of Parliament that Muslims aren’t British enough, that we don’t belong, you’d think that Muslims partaking in Christmas celebrations would result in the sort of enthusiasm usually reserved for shaming sporting personalities who commit gaffes on social media. Between having to put up with false rumours that we are trying to ban Christmas and now being shamed for celebrating it, it’s like we can’t win. We can’t simultaneously be doing both those things, surely? We’re not Schrödinger’s Muslim! Personally, unlike most people reading this, I don’t celebrate Christmas, but I do watch the Doctor Who special. I’m not an animal. I still love this time of year. I’m British, and Christmas is an important British tradition. And so, if non-Christians celebrate Christmas, even if by only adopting its more cultural side, then isn’t that to be welcomed? Isn’t the most important thing about Christmas spending time with family, looking after your community and arguing about which is the best Christmas film of all time? The answer is Die Hard, don’t comment. And to those people like Nadine Dorries, who think there’s an aggressive PC campaign that is “dumbing down panto” and “removing Christ from Christmas”, I make three points: first, how in the flying fox does one dumb down the dumbest thing invented since we started measuring dumb things? Second, it’s up to Christians to remember Christ and celebrate him. Muslims, “leftwing snowflakes” and corporate entities (who let’s face it, control 99% of the narrative at Christmas) are not obliged to do any such thing. Third, no one is stopping anyone from saying anything (within the law). An individual disagreeing with something you’ve said is them using their free speech to debate yours. If you don’t like their tone, maybe you should stop being such a snowflake? How can the right be so offended by “leftwing snowflakes” exercising their free speech and simultaneously harass those not toeing the Brexit line as traitors and saboteurs? And anyway, I thought everyone welcomed snowflakes at this time of year? Or is Bing Crosby just a leftist libtard too? I’m off to eat the remnants of my family’s halal masala turkey. Enjoy what remains of the Christmas spirit before culture war commences again in 2018. • Tez Ilyas is a standup comedian"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"books/2017/dec/29/marvel-create-you-own-tool-guns-drugs-alternative-lifestyles","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-29T15:42:09Z","webTitle":"Marvel criticised for comic-making tool that bans guns, drugs and bare midriffs","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/dec/29/marvel-create-you-own-tool-guns-drugs-alternative-lifestyles","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2017/dec/29/marvel-create-you-own-tool-guns-drugs-alternative-lifestyles","fields":{"headline":"Marvel criticised for comic-making tool that bans guns, drugs and bare midriffs","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The dream of creating comics for Marvel is one held by many writers and artists, but the company has always been a notoriously tough nut to crack … until now. But, although a forthcoming tool will allow amateurs to create their own Marvel comics, it has been widely criticised after the company released restrictive terms and conditions that ban comics from including content it deems controversial, including midriffs, contraception, guns and “alternative lifestyle advocacies”. Marvel Create Your Own, which was announced on Thursday, will allow fans to create comics featuring the studio’s huge cast of characters, from Captain America to the Guardians of the Galaxy. The online platform will allow fans to combine various backgrounds and character images with editable speech bubbles. However, any stories made using the tool will immediately belong to Marvel, with no payment or credit due to the creator, with the studio able to adapt, exhibit or redistribute the work “in all languages, anywhere in the world”. The terms and conditions of the tool also stipulate what cannot be included in the comics. Death and guns are not allowed. Swearing is also banned, as is the time-honoured comic book device of substituting symbols for swear words. “Suggestive or revealing images,” including “bare midriffs”, are not allowed, nor are double entendres and “noises related to bodily functions”. “Prescription drugs or over-the-counter medication, vitamins and dietary supplements” are also forbidden, as is contraception. More abstractly, “sensationalism” is banned, for which a few examples are offered: killer bees, aliens, gossip and scandal. The list caused a stir online, with several artists and writers responding by posting images flouting the rules. Others were concerned by other topics deemed to be “controversial”, such as politics – defined as including “lobbyists, PAC sites, political campaigns and alternative lifestyle advocacies” – and “social issues”. Some feel this is directed at users hoping to make LGBTQ storylines, and that Marvel is not committed to addressing the lack of diversity in their comics. In April, a Marvel executive blamed declining comic book sales on the increased presence of women and non-white characters, saying: “That’s what we saw in sales … Any character that was diverse, any character that was new, our female characters, anything that was not a core Marvel character, people were turning their nose up.” Marvel has yet to respond to questions from press."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"society/2017/dec/29/housing-and-mental-health-needs-a-rethink","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-29T17:03:31Z","webTitle":"Housing and mental health needs a rethink | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/dec/29/housing-and-mental-health-needs-a-rethink","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2017/dec/29/housing-and-mental-health-needs-a-rethink","fields":{"headline":"Housing and mental health needs a rethink","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"In October, the government finally listened and dropped potentially disastrous plans to limit funding for supported housing. However, this victory was short-lived. The decision that local councils should fund short-term supported housing instead risks being just as damaging. Ministers say the new fund will be ringfenced, but we’ve been here before. Ringfences only last so long. When a similar ringfence was lifted back in 2009, cash-strapped councils cut funding by 45%. Tenants need the security of knowing that their rent will be covered and providers need security to invest long-term. This proposal provides neither. Supported housing can mean someone is able to live independently in their community without having to face unnecessary stays in hospital. Stays in supported housing are also far cheaper, so they save vital NHS resources and provide a more suitable environment for people who need it. Already, the need for supported housing far outstrips supply. The new funding model could make this shortage worse and put further pressure on our health services. Supported housing saves lives. We urge the government to rethink its plans and make sure that people with mental health problems don’t spend another year worrying about the future of their home.

She was not dressed for the cold weather, officers said, and they now believe her disappearance was planned. Searches by the police and local community have been launched in recent days but they have been hampered by the weather. Norfolk police said they were continuing to search the coastline on Friday. The University of East Anglia student had been experiencing severe anxiety and depression, officers said. She left home with no mobile phone and wearing only a vest and shorts. Insp Will Drummond, who is leading the search, said Sophie had been receiving treatment for the illnesses. “Our inquiries have revealed there’s been a degree of pre-planning to her disappearance and this, combined with her mental state and comments made the previous day, suggest the most likely scenario is that she has gone into the sea. “The coastguard will be assisting in shoreline searches while the police helicopter has also been deployed to conduct coastline searches.” Smith’s mother, Lynn Shaw, previously said her daughter meant the world to her and asked her to “come home, please just walk through the door”. CCTV footage from shortly after Smith left her home showed her heading towards the seafront. There have been no other confirmed sightings since then, police said.

Overall, private firms scooped 267 – almost 70% – of the 386 clinical contracts that were put out to tender in England during 2016-17, according to a new report. They included the seven highest value contracts, worth £2.43bn between them, and 13 of the 20 most lucrative tenders. The £3.1bn in contracts, a big rise on the previous year’s £2.4bn, prompted concern that profit-driven companies are increasingly involved in delivering care, in a development that undermines repeated assurances by the health secretary, Jeremy Hunt, that they play only a marginal role. “These figures clearly show that privatisation has a strong momentum within the NHS,” said Paul Evans, the director of the NHS Support Federation, a campaign group which monitors the privatisation of NHS services and which produced the report. “The doors to private sector involvement in the NHS remain open despite promises to move away from market-based approaches by NHS leaders and politicians. Privateers continue to win huge new NHS contracts.” Virgin’s £1bn haul means it now has over 400 separate NHS contracts. Its growing role has prompted particular anger among anti-privatisation groups. It pays no tax in the UK and its ultimate parent company, Virgin Group Holdings Ltd, is based in the British Virgin Islands, a tax haven. In addition, it came under fire for suing six clinical commissioning groups (CCGs) in Surrey, NHS England and Surrey county council last year after losing an £82m contract for children’s services to a rival bid involving a local NHS trust and two social enterprises. A settlement of the action appears to have involved the six CCGs paying Virgin an undisclosed sum. Virgin said it had been so concerned over “serious flaws in the procurement process” that it had no choice but to launch the proceedings. The private sector’s £3.1bn of wins last year represented more than two-fifths (43%) of the £7.2bn of contracts tendered by the NHS for services including babies’ health and out of hours GP care. That dwarfed the £2.55bn (35%) of tenders won by NHS trusts and £1.53bn (21%) by not-for-profit organisations, including charities. The expanding role of for-profit firms comes despite a pledge by the NHS England chief executive, Simon Stevens – backed by Hunt – to abolish the purchaser/provider split in the health service introduced by Margaret Thatcher’s government in 1990, which helped facilitate competition in healthcare and the outsourcing of services, and promote greater integration of health and social care services. “Private health providers now have a strong foothold,” said Evans. “Billions of pounds-worth of opportunities to bid for NHS business are still being advertised, despite numerous failures and widespread criticism.” Critics say that the sector’s continued success stands in sharp contrast to a long history of winning contracts, often by undercutting rival bids from NHS trusts, only to then hand back those that do not yield a profit or have them taken away because they have provided inadequate care. The report details “a catalogue of failures” – dozens of examples of private firms taking over NHS services since 2012 but then abandoning them, either because they cost them too much to provide, or could not recruit enough staff, or went into administration – or, often, because of serious complaints about the quality of their service. For example, in 2014 Circle pulled out of its 10-year contract to run Hinchingbrooke hospital in Cambridgeshire – the first NHS hospital to be run by a private firm – two years early after encountering financial problems and heavy criticism from the Care Quality Commission (CQC), which regulates NHS care standards. In 2013, Serco ended its contract to provide out of hours GP care in Cornwall after staff falsified data about its performance. And in 2015, Coperforma’s £63.5m takeover of non-urgent patient transport to hospital in southern England was branded an “absolute shambles” by health unions after kidney patients awaiting dialysis and cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy missed vital appointments. It finally lost the contract in late 2016. “The NHS is currently going through the biggest financial squeeze in its history, which has translated into service closures and greater rationing. Now on top of that this report reveals more evidence of increasing NHS privatisation accelerating at an alarming rate, and yet this toxic outsourcing agenda is failing both patients and staff alike,” said Jonathan Ashworth, Labour’s shadow health secretary. Care UK, which has links to the Conservative party, gained the second biggest share of NHS contracts last year – worth £596.3m. It won a contract worth £169.5m in partnership with an NHS trust, and three others for £135.6m, £120.9m and £115m in its own right. Both it and Virgin Care have benefited by changing tactics to target often high-value contracts for community-based health services as the NHS in England increasingly moves care out of hospitals, the report says. Care UK already runs the NHS 111 telephone advice service and walk-in centres in some areas. In 2009, its chairman, Sir John Nash, donated £21,000 to Andrew Lansley, who as the Conservative health secretary in the coalition a year later forced NHS bodies to tender out far more services through the controversial Health and Social Care Act. “Dysfunctional” NHS procurement rules mean that private firms could land another £10bn of contracts in the next three years, said Evans. The NHS Support Federation, which is funded by individuals, charitable trusts and trade unions including the TUC, tracks publicly available information about NHS tenders. Virgin Care and Care UK defended their role in delivering NHS-funded healthcare. A Virgin Care spokesman said:“We have a strong track record of delivering high quality, free NHS services over the last 11 years. More than 93% of people rating the services we run would recommend them, while the CQC have said in their recent report we can evidence the improvements we have made to community services.” A spokesperson for Care UK said: “We have a very strong track record in partnering with the NHS to deliver high-quality and patient-focused care. This includes three services rated outstanding by the CQC and consistently high patient feedback scores.” A Department of Health spokesperson said: “Spend on private healthcare by the NHS accounts for just eight pence of every pound and this government is fully committed to a world-class NHS owned and funded by the British taxpayer and free at the point of use, now and in the future.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/blog/2018/jan/04/dawdling-darts-george-best-brilliance-and-knockerball-soccer-rodeo","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-04T10:00:11Z","webTitle":"Dawdling darts, George Best brilliance and Knockerball Soccer Rodeo | Classic YouTube","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2018/jan/04/dawdling-darts-george-best-brilliance-and-knockerball-soccer-rodeo","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/blog/2018/jan/04/dawdling-darts-george-best-brilliance-and-knockerball-soccer-rodeo","fields":{"headline":"Dawdling darts, George Best brilliance and Knockerball Soccer Rodeo","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"1) The BDO World Darts Championship starts this weekend.

The 1.4 mile (2.3km) Queensbury line, which runs 377ft (115 metres) below a hill between Halifax and Keighley in West Yorkshire, was closed in 1956 as rail travel declined and private car ownership increased. The Department for Transport (DfT) wants to shut it permanently this year, filling in critical sections with concrete in a project campaigners say will cost about £3m – the same amount they claim it would cost to patch the tunnel and turn it into a subterranean cycling route. The campaigners want the tunnel to be the centrepiece of a new cycle network connecting Halifax with Bradford, decreasing obesity, reducing pollution and easing traffic flows. Currently hardly anyone cycles in the area, put off by intimidating roads and brutal hills. The village of Queensbury, which gives the tunnel its name, is one of the highest parishes in England, sitting at 330 metres (1,100ft) above sea level. Sustrans, the environmental charity, has produced a report suggesting the Queensbury cycle route could deliver £37.6m worth of economic, health and tourism benefits over 30 years. A similar project in Bath proved popular when it opened in 2013. The mile-long Combe Down tunnel features an interactive light and sound installation and is now a tourist attraction in its own right. The Monsal trail on the old Midland Railway line in the Derbyshire Peak District is now one of the national park’s most popular attractions. In 2016 more than 120,000 cycle movements were recorded by an automatic counter on the route, which opened in 2011 and runs for 8.5 miles between Blackwell Mill and Bakewell. As things stand, Highways England’s Historical Railways Estate (HRE) – which acts as custodian of the disused railway tunnel on behalf of the DfT – could begin work to seal off the tunnel this June, according to Graeme Bickerdike, who coordinates the Queensbury Tunnel Society’s engineering activities. A report commissioned by HRE in 2016 said it would cost £35m to upgrade the tunnel and five ventilation shafts to turn it into a bike route, leading the DfT to accelerate plans to shut it for good, Bickerdike said. This would involve filling critical parts of it with concrete, making it all but impossible for the tunnel to ever be reopened, said Bickerdike, who writes about tunnels for a railway magazine. However last year the Queensbury Tunnel Society commissioned specialist engineers who put together a plan to spend just £4.3m repairing the tunnel and laying an asphalt cycle path. The society wants Bradford council to take ownership of the tunnel, with the £3m abandonment budget transferred as a dowry to cover future maintenance work. A number of Bradford councillors support the plans but the council has yet to agree to take responsibility for the tunnel. Bickerdike said constructing safe, pleasant, off-road cycle routes was the best way of getting people to cycle: “If we genuinely want to people to get out of their cars and on to bikes … the only thing that will encourage a lot of people to do that is to ensure there is infrastructure that means you are separated from lorries and buses and cars.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"money/2018/jan/02/rail-unions-and-labour-condemn-staggering-annual-fare-increase","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-02T07:03:53Z","webTitle":"Rail fares: unions and Labour condemn 'staggering' increase","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2018/jan/02/rail-unions-and-labour-condemn-staggering-annual-fare-increase","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2018/jan/02/rail-unions-and-labour-condemn-staggering-annual-fare-increase","fields":{"headline":"Rail fares: unions and Labour condemn 'staggering' increase","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Labour and trade unions have condemned “staggering” annual increases to rail fares, which come into force on Tuesday, triggering protests at dozens of stations in England. Fares will increase by 3.4% on average, with season tickets up by 3.6%, more than the consumer price index inflation rate and well above average increases in annual earnings. While the government and rail operators said the rises would lead to more investment in services, analysis by the Labour party said the average season ticket would cost £2,888 – £694 more than in 2010 – a rise of more than 30%. Andy McDonald, the shadow transport secretary, said fares had increased at a “truly staggering” rate, and had risen three times more quickly than wages since the start of the first David Cameron government. Separate analysis by the TUC said rail commuters in Britain were spending a considerably higher proportion of their salaries on season tickets than equivalent travellers in other European countries. The TUC’s figures used the example of a season ticket to London from Chelmsford in Essex, which had risen to £381 a month – 13% of average London salaries. In contrast, it said, a comparable commute of about 30 miles in France would cost 2% of an average salary, 3% in Italy, 4% in Germany and 5% in Belgium and Spain. The RMT rail union has organised protests against the fare rises at 40 stations in England on Tuesday, the day most people return to work after the Christmas holidays. There will be equivalent events at some Scottish stations on Wednesday, after the extra bank holiday there. Protest sites include Euston, King’s Cross, Paddington and Waterloo in London, as well as Birmingham New Street, Manchester Piccadilly, Cardiff Central, Newcastle and Leeds. Since 2004, government regulations stipulate that while rail companies can raise some fares as they see fit, season tickets and so-called protected fares, including saver returns, are limited to an amount set by ministers and linked to inflation, sometimes with a small amount of leeway. The current method caps fare rises at the retail price index, generally the higher of the two most common measures for inflation, which is currently at 3.9%. The Labour analysis of the cumulative impact of season ticket increases since 2010 found that the highest absolute rise was for an annual season ticket for Virgin Trains between Birmingham and London, which as of Tuesday will cost £10,567, £2,539 more than in 2010. The highest proportional rise was for annual season tickets between Tame Bridge Parkway near Walsall and Nuneaton, which costs 50% more now than in 2010. McDonald said: “Commuters have repeatedly been told that higher fares are necessary to fund investment, but promised investment has been cancelled and essential works have been delayed by years. “The truth is that our fragmented, privatised railway drives up costs and leaves passengers paying more for less. The railways need serious reform that could be achieved if the Tories matched Labour’s manifesto policy to extend public ownership to passenger services.” Frances O’Grady, general secretary of the TUC, said many commuters in the UK “will look with envy to their continental cousins who enjoy reasonably priced journeys to work”. While employers could help with season ticket loans or flexible working, “ultimately the government need to take our railways back into public hands”, she added. Criticism of the fare rises was echoed by Which?, the consumer group. “This price rise is yet more bad news for passengers, many of whom have just come to the end of yet another year of cancellations, delays, overcrowding and poor service from train companies,” Alex Hayman, its head of public markets, said. Paul Plummer, chief executive of the Rail Delivery Group, which brings together train operators and Network Rail, said 97% of fare revenues went directly into rail services, with major improvements planned. He said: “Over the next 18 months alone the country will see an unprecedented transformation in rail services, including dramatic improvements across the Thameslink network and through the Great North Rail Project.” A spokesman for the Department for Transport said the government was “investing in the biggest modernisation of our railways since the Victorian times”, and fare rises were kept under review."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"world/2018/jan/01/more-protesters-die-in-iran-as-rouhanis-plea-fails-to-quell-public-anger","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-01T14:13:54Z","webTitle":"More protesters killed in Iran as Rouhani's plea fails to dampen unrest","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jan/01/more-protesters-die-in-iran-as-rouhanis-plea-fails-to-quell-public-anger","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jan/01/more-protesters-die-in-iran-as-rouhanis-plea-fails-to-quell-public-anger","fields":{"headline":"More protesters killed in Iran as Rouhani's plea fails to dampen unrest","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"At least 12 people have died in clashes between protesters and security guards in Iran since protests erupted across the country last week, officials said on Monday, as an intervention by the president failed to quell public anger. Protesters defied warnings by the authorities to stay away or be confronted with an “iron fist” as demonstrations, in scenes that are increasingly becoming violent, continued on Sunday evening for the fourth day, hours after the Iranian president, Hassan Rouhani, acknowledged discontent. The demonstrations began on Thursday after opponents of the moderate president gathered in north-eastern Iran, but soon spread nationwide, escalating from initial demands over economic grievances and taking on a political dimension. At least two people were killed in the city of Izeh, in Khuzestan province, during protests on Sunday night, according to its member of parliament, who claimed it was not clear which side fired the shots. Two others were killed in Lorestan province. There were turbulent scenes in a number of cities across Iran, including the capital, Tehran, Karaj, Tuyserkan, Hamedan, Arak, Saveh, Amol, Sari and Qazvin. Officials said on Monday 10 people died during protests on Sunday night and at least 400 people had been arrested over the past five days. Videos posted on social networks appeared to show riot police becoming more confrontational. Similarly, protesters are seen attacking government buildings and shattering windows in an escalation of the unrest. Protests continued on Monday evening for a fifth day. Anti-riot police riding on motorbikes and wielding batons were unleashed on the streets of Tehran, observers said. Similar scenes were reported in other cities. The semi-official Tasnim news agency, close to the elite Revolutionary Guards, reported that one police officer was shot dead in the city of Najafabad, in Isfahan province on Monday night. The agency claimed he was killed by one of the protesters. Rouhani spoke with a number of parliamentarians on Monday in a meeting officials insisted was planned before the protests began. The president said: “Not all protesters are receiving orders from foreign powers, some are ordinary people who have come to streets because of their problems and sentiments.” The president said people wanted Iran’s political atmosphere to open up, but was adamant the Islamic republic would endure the turmoil without much difficulty. “People will confront a minority and a small group who are chanting slogans against the law and the will of people and insulting sanctities and revolutionary values, destroying public properties,” he said. A day earlier, in his first public comments on the protests, Rouhani acknowledged discontent in a video aired on state television, saying people had constitutional right to hold protests and criticise. But he also warned that criticism was “different from violence, destruction of public property”. The president added: “Based on the constitution and citizenship rights, people are completely free in expressing criticisms and even their protests, but at the same time, we must pay attention to the way in which criticism and protest should be made to lead to better conditions for the country and people’s lives.” Rouhani denounced comments made by the US president, Donald Trump, who tweeted on Sunday: “The people are finally getting wise as to how their money and wealth is being stolen and squandered on terrorism.” Rouhani said Trump had no right to express sympathy with Iranians because “a few months ago, he called the Iranian nation terrorist” and was “against the Iranian nation from head to toe”. Trump again tweeted on Monday, saying Iran was “failing at every level” as he reiterated his support for the protesters. “Iran is failing at every level despite the terrible deal made with them by the Obama Administration. The great Iranian people have been repressed for many years. They are hungry for food &amp; for freedom. Along with human rights, the wealth of Iran is being looted. TIME FOR CHANGE!” The British foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, said the UK was “watching events in Iran closely” and “people should be able to have freedom of expression and to demonstrate peacefully within the law”. He added : “We regret the loss of life that has occurred in the protests in Iran, and call on all concerned to refrain from violence and for international obligations on human rights to be observed.” The scale and the speed at which the protests have spread across Iran has puzzled many in the country, including reformists who are critical of the country’s political atmosphere, but are wary of any move towards regime change. Iran blocked access to social network sites including Telegram and Instagram on Sunday, but insisted the move was temporary. In contrast to their previous handling of such protests, Iranian officials appeared to be more conciliatory, at least towards some groups of protesters, acknowledging that they have legitimate economic grievances. The head of Iran’s judiciary, Ayatollah Sadeq Amoli Larijani, a hardline cleric, said: “Attacking mosques, public buildings, banks, is unacceptable.” He vowed the perpetrators would be prosecuted."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"stage/2018/jan/02/steven-berkoff-theatre-east-end-flesh-bone-london","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-02T08:00:22Z","webTitle":"Steven Berkoff's elegy for the East End returns to London pub that launched it","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/jan/02/steven-berkoff-theatre-east-end-flesh-bone-london","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2018/jan/02/steven-berkoff-theatre-east-end-flesh-bone-london","fields":{"headline":"Steven Berkoff's elegy for the East End returns to London pub that launched it","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Steven Berkoff described his 1975 play East as an “elegy for the East End and its energetic waste”. He was born and raised in Stepney, east London, and the streets of his youth had already passed into history, bulldozed by postwar planners and social change. But East is making a comeback. This month, Berkoff’s scabby razzle-dazzler about a family living on a council estate returns to the King’s Head in Islington, where it made its London debut 43 years ago. The test for director Jessica Lazar is whether she can make it seem more than a linguistically acrobatic period piece written by a man who is better known by many as a villain in Bond, Rambo and Beverly Hills Cop movies. “It’s one of those plays that everyone thinks they know,” says Lazar, “and it feels as if it’s staged a lot. But when you ask people if they’ve seen it, the answer is mostly no.” That doesn’t mean that they don’t have strong opinions on how it should be staged. “It can be a bit of a ball and chain,” Lazar admits. “The challenge is finding where to pay court to the past and where to aim for something original.” East was wildly audacious in its time for its depiction of working-class lives. Bad boys Mike and Les (Leslie is Berkoff’s birth name) strut across the stage in an explosion of poetry and violence. Their racist dad wallows in nostalgia for an England where Oswald Mosley and his blackshirts marched in the East End, while mum daydreams about a different life – in which Ernest Hemingway admires her poetry. Mike’s much-abused girlfriend, Sylv, considers how much better her life would be if she had been born a man. The vibrant, textured language, which makes it sound as if Shakespeare has collided with an unexpectedly rich and riotous contemporary argot, is invigorating. One critic described it as “filthy beyond the call of duty”, and with its liberal use of expletives it would never have satisfied pre-1968 theatre censorship. But for many of the UK’s younger theatre-makers, Berkoff’s play – in part because it continues to be taught on theatre studies courses – is very much a point of reference for the way that it melds text with explosive physicality. Berkoff trained at Jacques Lecoq’s L’École Internationale de Théâtre long before a generation of theatre-makers, including Complicite’s Simon McBurney, made their pilgrimage to Paris. As Soho theatre’s artistic director, Steve Marmion, says: “Berkoff and East were the precursors of companies such as RashDash, Frantic Assembly and Gecko.” Such companies may not be directly influenced by Berkoff’s distinctive and often grotesque mime style, but his physicality and total theatre approach paved the way for current contemporary theatre practice and has been as much a landmark for many as John Osborne and Harold Pinter were for an earlier generation. Berkoff’s works may have been overlooked in books about post-war British theatre by academics and critics over-schooled in the idea of theatre as a primarily text-based medium, but the influence of his sinewy language can be detected on practitioners including the In-Yer-Face generation of playwrights of the 1990s, most obviously Jez Butterworth. Now things come full circle. While Lazar is in rehearsals at the King’s Head, Elliot Warren and Olivia Brady of Unpolished Theatre are preparing to take their East homage, Flesh and Bone, to the Adelaide fringe in Australia before bringing it to London later in the year. Flesh and Bone was a big hit in Edinburgh last summer. For the first 10 minutes of the show I sat pretty much with mouth agape at what appeared to be a blatant Berkoff rip-off. Then I started to appreciate how cleverly this young company had taken inspiration from Berkoff’s original and made it their own – with a distinctively 21st-century spin. Lazar argues that part of East’s enduring appeal is the fact that the characters are “eternal archetypes” and is aiming to give Berkoff’s play a timeless quality by nudging it out of the mid-70s towards our own time. “It’s not clearly set in 2017, but if the cast were to walk down Upper Street in Islington in their costumes nobody would bat an eyelid,” she says. With Flesh and Bone, Warren and Brady reinvent those archetypes and relocate them to an East End tower block that the local council is trying to decant as part of gentrification. Marmion says that Flesh and Bone “sits very potently in the shadow of Grenfell Tower”. Originally, Warren and Brady had wanted to stage East, but the rights were prohibitively expensive, so Warren – raised, like Berkoff, in the East End – set out to write his own play about the area. In Flesh and Bone, put-upon Sylv is reincarnated as businesslike Kel, who runs a phone sex line, and the unspoken crisis of masculinity that goes with the appalling misogyny of Berkoff’s Mike and Les becomes intriguingly multilayered, with new characters whose sexuality and hard-man reputations are put under the microscope. “Yes, Berkoff was a strong influence, but so were Shakespeare, Guy Ritchie and Quentin Tarantino. Jez Butterworth’s Mojo and Jerusalem in particular,” says Warren. “We wanted to make something that moved at breakneck speed and that people couldn’t look away from. With lots of theatre, after 60 minutes people are losing the will to watch. We wanted to hook them.” They do, and in the process ensure that Berkoff’s influence endures. Warren and Brady are hoping that Berkoff will come and see the production at Soho theatre this summer. They invited him to see a tryout last year, but he couldn’t make it. “He said he was going to the Bahamas,” says Warren. That’s a very long way from Stepney. East is at the King’s Head, London, from 9 January to 3 February. Flesh and Bone will be at Soho theatre, London, this summer.

Four years ago Christie was persuaded to head for the country that seemed intent on destroying her. Only a few months had passed since her Sochi Olympics ended in disaster with three disqualifications being followed by hundreds of death threats from Koreans, who believed she had cost one of their speed skating stars a gold medal. “The way the Koreans responded had made me scared of living,” Christie says. “I couldn’t sleep. I was worried. I know it seems so dramatic. But I thought people actually did want to kill me. So my coach [Nicky Gooch] decided to hit it head on. He made me go out there to train but I didn’t want to go. I was dreading going especially because they were sending me to work with the Korean coach.” Christie is a warm and humorous 27-year-old, whose three golds at last year’s world championships suggest she will be an Olympic favourite in Pyeongchang. The irony is not lost on her that she will return to South Korea after all she endured in the traumatic wake of Sochi – but memories of her anxious first visit fill her with hope rather than dread. “It really helped me because everyone was really nice,” she says of training in Korea. “All their skaters really wanted to train with me and it was one of the best experiences of my life so far. “Before I arrived I was pretty low. And in the first two weeks in Korea I didn’t speak. It was military-style training and if you didn’t hit a lap time you’d be made to keep skating. You would do laps and laps – no one could do it because they were too tired. Then you’d get taken off the ice and made to run laps on the track. And in the morning you would see 12-year-olds doing skate squats with heavy bags on their back. They were doing a thousand every day. It was insane and they were crying. So it was an eye-opener and I could see why they have so many successful athletes. “But I made a lot of good friends out there – who I still see when I’m in Korea. They are among the nicest people I’ve met and so willing to help. But it was tough, too, and one day their coach was so angry we didn’t hit the lap time he threw his stopwatch at a skater.” Christie is able to laugh now and steel herself for the testing ordeal that awaits her as a lone GB skater against the Korean and Chinese teams in Pyeongchang. “With it being a home games for the Koreans they’re going to be feisty – and I’m definitely one of their main targets. I’m doing the 500m, 1,000m and 1500m. In the 500 China will have to be watched. But in the other two Korea will be my main threat. The Koreans are strong and work very fluently together. But the Chinese are scary because they’re aggressive. And they’re good. I’ve got to beat three people in the same team trying to outrace me and that’s mental. I have to be physically so much better than anyone because I’ve got to take them on as a team.” Adversity has long been the norm for Christie. She grew up in Livingston, near Edinburgh, and she talks openly about being bullied as a girl. “There were two separate times. I was very young the first time I was bullied and it was physical abuse. I actually left school and didn’t go back for six months. I was about eight. I then went back later that year. I was quite intelligent then so I knew how to escape it when I came back. “High school was more bearable but it started there later on because I didn’t wear makeup and was quite tomboyish. I was also really pale, skinny and so tiny that people called me ‘skeleton’. I was doing something different to most normal people, with my skating, and they took the mick out me. The bullying both scarred and shaped me. I still sometimes feel in a social situation that maybe I’m below a lot of people there. I also always judge my appearance. Everyone is like: ‘Why do you wear makeup for training?’ It’s partly because of what happened. But at the same time it made me fight for things. Maybe that part of my life helped me make it in sport.” Christie was then primarily a figure skater – who hated the fake smiles and frilly costumes she was compelled to wear. She preferred the much more intense world of speed skating. “Yeah, figure skating didn’t suit me and I didn’t get any brownie points for appearance. Even when I put the effort in I seemed scruffy.” She was 15 when she decided to switch to speed skating and had to leave home to train at the National Ice Centre in Nottingham. We sit in the café overlooking the ice rink and it seems hard to believe she has been based here for 12 years. “Yeah, and I wouldn’t even have passed for 15 because I was very shy and withdrawn. I hadn’t experienced life. “For the first two years I lived with a host family and I was homesick all the time. Then, when I was 17, I got my own tiny apartment. It was good but [she laughs] I owe my mum a lot of money. The first six months I didn’t even get paid and we have to buy our own equipment. And then I remember being on £120 a month. We’re much better off now but I didn’t get on to the top card of UK Sport until four years ago.” Sochi was Christie’s second Olympics but her belief she had won a silver medal was ruined when she was deemed responsible for a crash involving the Korean Park Seung-hi and was disqualified, before further catastrophe in the 1500m heats and 1000m semi-finals. Her distress was made far worse by the reaction on social media in the wake of the 500m and Christie stresses now that it took her years to recover. “I remember refusing help for a year and a half because I got through Sochi so I thought I was fine. But until six months ago I didn’t realise how bad it had been. I won world championship medals every year but I just wasn’t myself. I felt like a hideous human being. I didn’t like myself at all and I felt the world was out to get me.” Christie is very different today, and so cheerful and likeable, but she needed a sports psychologist to help her recover. “Even now I get abuse on Twitter but I focus on the people that have supported me. I was thrilled to make the Spoty shortlist and I’m thrilled UK Sport is funding me. The media has just been so positive about me as well. So I focus on that and it allowed me to open up. I also changed because I decided that failure was OK.” In a 1,000m world championship final in 2016, Christie should have overtaken her Korean opponent and won gold. But she hung back and settled for second. “It was the year my boyfriend got to be world champion,” she says with a muffled laugh, having already spoken about how she has been going out for two years with the Hungarian speed skater, Liu (Sandor) Shaolin. “We had three laps to go, and had dropped everyone, so I was safely in second. I almost went to move but something stopped me. I thought: ‘What if this doesn’t work?’ It was stupid because I already had a world championship medal from that weekend, a bronze in the 1500, which we needed for funding. “Shaolin shouted at me: ‘You didn’t even try to win.’ He was right and I was so disappointed. I sat down with my coach and said: ‘I didn’t come here to medal.’ Of course if I go to the Olympics and win a medal I will be bloody happy – but I will be trying to win gold. If I get a DQ then that’s better than just accepting the safe option.” Does her boyfriend understand how much she suffered after Sochi? “No. I obviously wasn’t dating him then and he struggles to understand it. But he’s a few years younger. He’s 22 and he’s got a bit to learn. I also had to learn. I remember reading about Beth Tweddle getting abused online and thinking: ‘She’s tougher than that. She won all those medals and must know she’s amazing, so ignore them.’ But it’s different when it happens to you. That’s why it’s important to talk about it. If I can help just one person that’s good enough for me.” Christie’s new confidence is rooted in her extraordinary performance at last year’s world championships in Rotterdam. She won gold in the 1,000m and 1500m and became overall world champion – breaking 23 years of Asian dominance in world short-track speed skating. Christie also overcame a concentrated Korean team-effort to block her in the 1500m. “I was leading and we had three laps to go. We’re skating fast, over 30mph. There were three Korean girls in the race, one had fallen and we came around to lap her. I heard the Korean coach shout and all of a sudden she’s come back on to the track and that’s against the rules. We were catching her with ridiculous speed. If I went inside and she blocked me they’d skate outside and I’d lose gold. If I went outside and she blocked me, one of her team-mates would win. They were trying to get a Korean win so I pushed her out of the way because she’s not in the race any more. When I actually crossed the line and still won I was like: ‘Thank fucking God. I would have blooming killed her if they DQ-ed me.’ She did apologise because we’re friends. She said: ‘It’s our culture to do what you’re told.’ I get that.” Will the threat of more disqualifications play on her mind in Pyeongchang? “Of course. I’d be lying if I said no. But if it happens again it can’t be worse. I just want to enjoy it because I was a miserable person after Sochi. I don’t want to be that person.” Christie breaks into a sunny smile again. It seems as if all the demons of her past, from being bullied as a girl to being abused after Sochi, have melted away. She explains the advantage she will take on her return to Korea. “I’m the world champion,” she says, shrugging off the kids who taunted her as ‘skeleton’ and the trolls who threatened to kill her. “If you ask most top skaters to identify the pinnacle of our careers they would say becoming world champion. It’s way more respected to be the overall world champion than an Olympic medallist. I’ve achieved my dream. Of course an Olympic medal will be amazing but I can’t describe how beautiful it felt to cross that line as overall world champion. It’s why I’m super-excited now. I know what I’m capable of and what could happen. I feel ready.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"music/2018/jan/01/candi-staton-review-the-sage-gateshead","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-01T14:08:36Z","webTitle":"Candi Staton review – stories, silver boots and smash hits from the great soul survivor","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/jan/01/candi-staton-review-the-sage-gateshead","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/jan/01/candi-staton-review-the-sage-gateshead","fields":{"headline":"Candi Staton review – stories, silver boots and smash hits from the great soul survivor","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Not many 77 year olds would consider working on New Year’s Eve, never mind doing a 75-minute shift on the other side of the world. Candi Staton however has jetted from her home in Atlanta, Georgia, to its twinned city of Newcastle for this one-off performance. After a year spent reflecting and recording, she is in the mood to ensure her first and last show of 2017 goes off with a bang. Introduced in showbiz style as “the fabulous Candi Staton”, she strides on stage in a spangly top, cropped wide-leg leather trousers and the kind of big silver boots that would fall foul of most workplace’s health and safety policies. She is every inch the disco diva. Then again, Staton has a beguiling gravitas, and puts on no discernible airs or graces. It’s sobering to think that this grinning, friendly lady shouting “Whoo, Newcastle!” and “I’m seeing out 2017, I’m not 17!” has been performing since the 1950s, was considered a peer by the great Ray Charles, pounded US stages during the racially segregated pre-civil rights era and toured across southern states with Sam Cooke and Lou Rawls when she was 12. She doesn’t milk such history but a seemingly off-the-cuff monologue about her days in the Chitlin’ Circuit – backwoods R&amp;B juke joints – is eye-watering, with tales of putting on ballgowns over overflowing toilets, being booed for singing the wrong songs and having to pull guns on promoters to get paid. Staton is best known, in the UK at least, for her copper-bottomed classics Young Hearts Run Free and You Got the Love (as covered by Florence + the Machine), but she’s had hits in several decades and dabbled in pretty much every major musical genre except heavy metal. This glorious, clever-paced show reflects all this, and, like an unfolding book, delivers a different chapter every 15 minutes. She starts as disco queen, as a clutch of shimmering dance numbers give the Sage a dusting of Studio 54. Honest, I Do Love You, from 1978, sees the front rows raise their arms as if worshipping a deity. By her 1977 smash-hit version of the Bee Gees’ Nights on Broadway people are abandoning their seats and dancing in the aisles. Backed by a fabulous band that includes former Style Councillor Mick Talbot on keyboards and Staton’s son Marcus Williams a powerhouse on drums, the first lady of southern soul dips into funk and momentarily turns comedian for I’d Rather Be an Old Man’s Sweetheart (Than a Young Man’s Fool) – yelling “Come on you old men!” at the audience. Another section showcases her as a blues singer, the heart-wrenching I Ain’t Easy to Love includes a cheeky rewrite of My Way: “Relationships, I’ve had a few – sometimes I think a few too many.” Her several abusive marriages, a spell of alcoholism and the rest all informed her inimitable voice, a mix of big-sounding honeyed chops and a huskier quality, rich in understated melancholy. She certainly draws on a deep well for In the Ghetto, her 1972 hit cover of Elvis Presley’s standard, which won the king of rock’s blessing. She sings the all-too-relevant story – poor boy steals to feed family, buys a gun, steals a car and is shot and killed while his own child is born, continuing the cycle – like a mourning mother. Her version of Stand By Your Man – a hit for Tammy Wynette in 1968 and Staton in 1970 – is another showstopper. Staton’s huskier, more nuanced, Grammy-nominated interpretation is quite different to Wynette’s big-lunged country version: the soulful sound of someone singing through bitter tears, trapped in a relationship she can’t escape. Her own desperate experience of an abusive relationship was channelled into her signature tune Young Hearts, Run Free, written for her by David Crawford in the mid 1970s. Four decades on, with such despair far behind her, this is a predominantly feelgood show, and she delivers the song as an extended and epic anthem to escape and survival. The party mood continues with her most unlikely incarnation yet: 90s rave queen, which she became when the Source turned a vocal she’d done for a documentary into You Got the Love, an international hit. Her stomping, gospel-dance version here sounds hard to follow, but back she comes for 2012’s Hallelujah Anyway and the transcendent spectacle of a septuagenarian singing deep Chicago house. “Happy New Year!” she yells, promising “great things” in 2018, including a new album. Appropriately enough, it’s called Unstoppable."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"culture/2018/jan/01/falls-festival-woman-allegedly-assaulted-in-mosh-pit-performed-citizens-arrest","type":"article","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-01T07:57:36Z","webTitle":"Falls festival: woman allegedly assaulted in mosh pit performed citizen's arrest","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2018/jan/01/falls-festival-woman-allegedly-assaulted-in-mosh-pit-performed-citizens-arrest","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/2018/jan/01/falls-festival-woman-allegedly-assaulted-in-mosh-pit-performed-citizens-arrest","fields":{"headline":"Falls festival: woman allegedly assaulted in mosh pit performed citizen's arrest","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"A woman allegedly sexually assaulted in the mosh pit at Falls festival in Tasmania performed a citizen’s arrest on her assailant, handing him over to security and police. At the conclusion of the three-day music festival in Tasmania’s Marion Bay, police said a 32-year-old man from Carlton had been arrested and charged over an alleged assault on Sunday night for reportedly groping a woman on the breast. The man has been bailed to appear in court on a charge of assault with indecent intent. Tasmania police senior sergeant Darren Latham said the woman and her friend apprehended the alleged assailant at the time of the incident. “The woman involved … and her friend actually apprehended the male and then handed them to security, who then handed them to police to be investigated.” Latham said police were encouraged that more victims of assault were willing to come forward to report incidents. “Whilst we would rather have no incidents at all … it is encouraging that people are taking positive action,” he said. “But we ... wish that this didn’t happen at all.” The arrest marks the third alleged assault at the festival this year. A 19-year-old woman reported being sexually assaulted in a mosh pit on Friday night, while another woman told police she had been assaulted at the festival’s camping area on Saturday evening. Falls festival co-producer Paul Piticco issued a statement welcoming the arrest and urging victims of assault to come forward. “These incidences have been happening at mass gatherings for years and we are encouraged by the fact that this unacceptable behaviour is being identified and people are coming forward,” he said. “It takes a lot of courage and we are happy to be seeing a cultural change where victims feel comfortable to report.” Piticco said there remained significant work for the festival and community to do in tackling the issue of sexual assault. “As a society we need to continue to educate people about consent to eradicate this dreadful behaviour and provide victims with a safe space.” Falls festival is an annual Australian music and arts festival held across the country around New Year’s Eve. This year, it is being held in Tasmania, Victoria, New South Wales and Western Australia. Sexual assault has been a consistent issue at the Tasmanian iteration of the Falls festival. At the 2016-17 event, five women reported being sexually assaulted, including one alleged rape. Music industry players launched the Your Choice campaign following the reported sexual assaults at Falls festival last year, encouraging bands and promoters to do more to stamp out sexual assault at their gigs. This month, leading Australian artists launched the #MeNoMore movement calling out sexual assault, harassment and rape in the Australian music industry. Falls festival’s Victorian event, at the seaside town of Lorne, suffered a crowd crush in 2016-17, in which more than 80 people suffered injuries, including broken bones and head wounds."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2018/jan/01/kim-jong-un-north-korea-nuclear-arsenal","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-01T03:05:43Z","webTitle":"Kim Jong-un: North Korea's nuclear arsenal is now complete","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jan/01/kim-jong-un-north-korea-nuclear-arsenal","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jan/01/kim-jong-un-north-korea-nuclear-arsenal","fields":{"headline":"Kim Jong-un: North Korea's nuclear arsenal is now complete","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un, has warned the United States his country’s nuclear forces are now “completed”, adding that the nuclear launch button was always within easy reach. While he remained defiant in his confrontation with Donald Trump, he struck a more conciliatory note on relations with South Korea, offering to start talks on sending a North Korean delegation to the upcoming Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang. After a year in which he ordered a string of missile launches – including three intercontinental ballistic missiles – and the regime’s sixth and most powerful nuclear test, Kim used his annual New Year’s Day address to declare the North’s nuclear weapons capability a reality. “We achieved the goal of completing our state nuclear force in 2017,” Kim said in a speech broadcast live by state TV. “We need to mass-produce nuclear warheads and ballistic missiles and accelerate their deployment. “The US should know that the button for nuclear weapons is on my desk. This is not blackmail but reality.” Dressed in a western-style grey suit and tie, Kim added, however, that the North’s nuclear arsenal played a purely deterrent role. “The entire area of the US mainland is within our nuclear strike range,” he said. “The US can never start a war against me and our country. These weapons will be used only if our security is threatened.” Asked about Kim’s claim that he has a nuclear button on his desk, and that the weapons can reach the US, Donald Trump said from his New Year’s Eve party at Mar-a-Lago: “We’ll see, we’ll see.” Kim said North Korean athletes could participate in the Winter Olympics, which open in the South Korean town of Pyeongchang next month. South Korea’s president, Moon Jae-in, has encouraged Pyongyang to send a delegation to the Games, hoping their presence would help ease tensions on the Korean peninsula. Kim said: “The Winter Olympic games that will be held soon in the South will be a good opportunity to display the status of the Korean nation, and we sincerely wish that the event will be held with good results. “We are prepared to take various steps, including the dispatch of a delegation.” The Winter Olympics will be held from 9-25 February, followed by the Paralympics from 9-18 March."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2017/dec/31/trump-president-video-2017-feats-new-year","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-31T21:03:00Z","webTitle":"'What a year it's been': Trump lauds major feats of 2017 in end-of-year video","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/dec/31/trump-president-video-2017-feats-new-year","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/dec/31/trump-president-video-2017-feats-new-year","fields":{"headline":"'What a year it's been': Trump lauds major feats of 2017 in end-of-year video","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Donald Trump has posted a video summarising his first year in office, which gives an insight into what the president sees as his biggest accomplishments as 2018 begins. Beginning with martial drums and numerous shots of the Marine One helicopter, and US soldiers keeping watch over the president, the three-and-a-half-minute clip focuses first on Trump’s nomination of Neil Gorsuch to the supreme court – one of his best decisions in the eyes of conservatives, but a move viewed much more nervously by liberals. The video then skips to footage of Trump speaking to victims of Hurricane Harvey in Texas and holding up a Puerto Rican flag – glossing over his lengthy dispute with authorities in the US territory over the perceived weakness of the federal response to Hurricane Maria there compared with the aid given after disasters on the mainland. A quick out-of-focus shot of Trump chatting to Theresa May at the G20 in Germany also airbrushes a tricky relationship – most recently when her criticism of his decision to retweet messages from a British far-right group led to Trump tetchily telling her she should focus on “Radical Islamic Terrorism” and not on him. As the controversial speech he made in Poland in which he said “our civilisation will triumph” plays, Trump is shown at the Western Wall in Jerusalem, the city he recognised as Israel’s capital this month in the face of almost unanimous opposition from foreign allies, who view its status as a key part of future negotiations with the Palestinians. Trump goes on to hail jobs figures (whose strength can be overstated), the rise in the stock market (which he has been accused of using as “a substitute metric for success given his anemic poll numbers”), and his recent tax cuts (which favour the rich and corporations), as well as his idiosyncratic campaign to politicise the phrase “Merry Christmas”, before ending with an excerpt from a speech he made to the US air force in which he told personnel, “For America, the sky is never the limit,” as the camera lingers ominously on a fighter jet. Trump’s social media team has made a habit of releasing short videos to mark what the administration considers key events. This new year one is perhaps less avant-garde than the recap of Trump’s trip to Asia in November, which featured backwards footage of local cyclists and slo-mo clips of the president striding along red carpets, all soundtracked by a tune that recalled Hans Zimmer’s Rain Man soundtrack. And it is slightly less jingoistic than his iMovie-style slideshow of his trip to the G20, which included a song based around his campaign slogan “make America great again”. But he returned to that theme with the message that accompanied his new year video, telling his 45.5 million followers: “What a year it’s been, and we’re just getting started. Together, we are MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! Happy New Year!!” Whether the thought that Trump is just getting started will delight or terrify you in 2018 may depend somewhat on your political persuasion. As midnight approached, the president followed up with a tweet that recalled last year’s infamous new year’s message focusing on his “many enemies”. The enemies, and indeed haters, still got a mention, but there was room this year for friends too – and even the “Fake News Media”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/blog/2018/jan/01/talking-horses-agrapart-can-score-at-cheltenham-for-in-form-stable","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-01T10:50:40Z","webTitle":"Talking Horses: Agrapart can score at Cheltenham for in-form stable","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2018/jan/01/talking-horses-agrapart-can-score-at-cheltenham-for-in-form-stable","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/blog/2018/jan/01/talking-horses-agrapart-can-score-at-cheltenham-for-in-form-stable","fields":{"headline":"Talking Horses: Agrapart can score at Cheltenham for in-form stable","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Today’s best bets, by Chris Cook Happy New Year! And a very happy, traditional New Year’s Day to those of you who like a bit of Strauss from Vienna and a bit of racing from Cheltenham, possibly accompanied by throbbing temples. I can also offer you a happy new ‘trainer form’ table, after a two-week break caused by Christmas Day falling on a Monday. And clearly a fine festive season has been enjoyed by Nick Williams, who has reached the giddy heights of a 45% strike-rate in the past fortnight. Admittedly, that includes two races in which Le Rocher beat two other finishers, and worked pretty hard to do that on the second occasion. Then again, Williams’s handful of defeats include a third place in the King George by Tea For Two. He can fairly be said to be flying. There is more merit, really, in Nicky Henderson’s 33% from 46 runners, an amazing rate of success for one of the more competitive stages of the season. Look at some of the big names at the other end, where the Tizzard and Hobbs yard languish without a winner in the past fortnight and where Ben Pauling, who topped this table in recent weeks, has dropped to 4%. Philip Hobbs admitted to us yesterday that all has not been entirely well with his string this past month, which may not have come as news to anyone who has been tracking this table since it started a month ago. Anyway, here’s the new table: Nick Williams 45% (11) Nicky Henderson 33% (46) Donald McCain 28% (29) Alan King 21% (28) Venetia Williams 21% (14) Harry Fry 20% (15) Rebecca Curtis 20% (5) Kim Bailey 20% (20) Warren Greatrex 19% (21) Tom George 19% (16) Nicky Richards 18% (17) Kerry Lee 18% (11) Gary Moore 17% (47) Paul Nicholls 17% (29) Fergal O’Brien 15% (20) Neil Mulholland 13% (31) Charlie Longsdon 12% (17) Dan Skelton 11% (36) Brian Ellison 10% (29) Tim Vaughan 10% (21) Ian Williams 10% (20) Nigel Twiston-Davies 9% (32) Evan Williams 9% (22) Peter Bowen 9% (11) David Pipe 8% (24) Malcolm Jefferson 7% (14) Sue Smith 4% (25) Ben Pauling 4% (23) Jonjo O’Neill 4% (23) Colin Tizzard 0% (29) Lucinda Russell 0% (22) Philip Hobbs 0% (18) Oliver Sherwood 0% (14) Emma Lavelle 0% (8) Dr Richard Newland 0% (7) Each Monday through the core jumps season, we’ll monitor the relative success of 35 major jumps stables. The percentage figure is their win strike-rate for the last fortnight, while their total number of runners in that time is in brackets. As I type, Hobbs has the favourite for the opener at Cheltenham in Springtown Lake and this is clearly a useful type, judged on his Grade Two second last time. But 9-2 could be big about Onefortheroadtom (12.15), a points winner who should relish this thorough test of stamina. The form of his Exeter success in October has worked out fairly well and Worcester was too sharp for him last time. Willoughby Court sets a fair standard in the Dipper and Yanworth will clearly be hard to beat if he brushes up his jumping. But I’ll take 9-2 about Ballyandy (1.25), who has apparently had a couple of hold-ups since his Perth win in September but is said to be fine now. He has been consistently excellent in bumpers and over hurdles and I think he could have the legs of his rivals here. Heavy going is no problem. Another winner of the Betfair Hurdle, Agrapart (3.10) is backable at 6-1 for the Relkeel, which he won last year on a similar surface. He didn’t fare very well in two autumn French races but he doesn’t have many peaks to each season and this might be the right time to catch him, bearing in mind the form of Nick Williams. I’m a bit surprised to get 6-1 about Weyburn (2.45) for a five-runner affair at Catterick, the grey having taken well to fences when scoring at Southwell a fortnight ago. He still looks very well treated to me on just a 5lb higher mark."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"stage/2018/jan/02/jon-richardson-review-the-old-man","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-02T06:00:20Z","webTitle":"Jon Richardson review – a wildly funny whinge of volcanic frustrations","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/jan/02/jon-richardson-review-the-old-man","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2018/jan/02/jon-richardson-review-the-old-man","fields":{"headline":"Jon Richardson review – a wildly funny whinge of volcanic frustrations","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"‘Let’s get ready to grumble!” Where comedy meets nit-picking, Jon Richardson has carved a niche – and he’s not budging from it. Why get out of his comfort zone when, in his view, there’s always something stopping him from getting wholly into it? His touring show, The Old Man, is a two-hour whinge – tongue always slightly in cheek – at all that’s bothersome about his peevish life, from the barber’s to the internet, from weddings to cohabiting with his new wife. And it’s constantly enjoyable, rising to occasional peaks of near-heroic comic fastidiousness. What it isn’t is novel: the 8 Out of 10 Cats man pitches his camp in the traditional, ever-relatable territory of who does the washing-up and why men don’t pee straight. But I was happy to meet him there. TV viewers may be familiar with some of his worries from the Channel 4 documentary How to Survive the End of the World. There, he dealt in the world’s macro anxieties: Trump, terrorism, air pollution. Here, recalling the earlier autobiographical broadcast A Little Bit OCD, he operates on the micro level – even if, through Richardson’s eyes, an unwashed tagine can feel like a matter of earth-shattering importance. Until relatively recently, the idea of spending two hours laughing at the symptoms of someone’s mental health problem might have seemed unattractive or outright offensive. But then came the new wave of comics using humour to weaken the stigmas surrounding mental health, and Richardson might, at a stretch, be counted among them. But whereas Felicity Ward on anxiety, Sofie Hagen on depression and Mark Watson on alcoholism, are explicit about their awareness-raising, solidarity-building agenda, Richardson takes the old-fashioned approach. Like Robin Williams and Lee Evans, he downplays (on stage, at least) the degree to which his eccentricities might be a disorder, and foregrounds how funny they are. This is mouse-that-roared comedy, in which a small man gets wildly exasperated in Evans’s case, and persistently irked in Richardson’s, about things most of us manage to keep in proportion. From the opening business with his cardigans onwards, it’s clear Richardson has this brand of neurotic but lighthearted fussiness just where he wants it – comedically, if not emotionally. It can’t be fun being this uptight, but it’s fun to watch, as our host frets about the groin-level “porthole” in the robe he’s given at the barbers, or depicts his worrisome après-gig life in roadside motels. The latter snapshot is offered to counter Twitter trolls who assume Richardson’s life is all celebrity glamour – and whose low opinions of him are quoted for self-abasing laughs. But Richardson turns social media back on his followers tonight, surprising selected members of the crowd with full-spectrum knowledge of their online lives. I was reminded of Sanderson Jones’s memorable 2011 show ComedySale.com, a stunt-comedy happening that demonstrated to aghast audiences how much of their lives they’d given away online. Richardson doesn’t go that far. But even the small treasures yielded by his online digging go a long way, tilting his whole audience giddily on to the back foot and sending up Richardson’s nerdiness. Act two engages with our host’s home life – with fellow standup Lucy Beaumont and their new baby. A hefty portion is dedicated to the time Richardson spent massaging his pregnant wife’s perineum, and you can’t blame him for dwelling on it. With its indignities, quaint terminology and touching-distance proximity to sex and smut, this lurid ritual would be a gift to comedy, even without the fact that the owner of the massage cream company is called Jan Bastard. But it’s not just a cheap gag about intimate body parts. As ever with Richardson, it’s a window into his turbulent emotional life, as pride in his exemplary husbanding becomes shame at his selfishness, and love for his wife and child becomes volcanic frustration at the things they do differently from him. His passive-aggressive way of addressing tiny domestic disharmonies is delightfully done, never more so than when – cue feigned puzzlement – “she talks to me when the telly’s on!” A closing dishwasher set piece revisits a favourite theme, but the gag – itemising his wife’s poor loading technique detail by excruciating detail – still feels fresh. It’s all deviously designed so that the joke is on Richardson. But only after he’s struck a liberating blow for anyone who’s ever winced at a dropped apostrophe or at a loved one who has an injudicious way with shutting car doors.

Responding to Paul Keating questioning whether his desire for a republic was “another chameleon act”, Turnbull said his predecessor was “completely wrong”. Keating told the Australian newspaper that those who succeeded him as prime minister had failed Australia by not making progress towards a republic, reserving a particular savaging for Turnbull, who led the failed republican push in 1999. Speaking in Sydney on New Year’s Day, Turnbull labelled Keating’s remarks “barely coherent”. “Look, this is the bottom line – we gave the republic a great shot in 99,” he said. “There was a referendum. Sadly, we lost. I voted yes, I campaigned for yes. “I don’t know what’s prompted Paul to come out swinging at everyone. He seems to be critical of every prime minister and former prime minister apart from himself and it must be good for Paul to feel he is without fault or blemish but, in the real world, we gave it a red hot go in 99. “I expect it will become an issue again after the end of the Queen’s reign but I don’t think it will become a frontline issue before then. That is my objective view, it’s one I’ve held for a long time, for well over a decade, well, since 99. That’s now nearly 20 years.” Reminded that the Queen, who turns 92 in April, could end her reign while he was prime minister, Turnbull suggested a survey similar to the controversial marriage equality postal survey, which LGBTI advocates said caused harm to the community, could solve the issue. “We all say ‘long live the Queen’ and we say that with great sincerity and with love,” he said. “But if you’re asking me how I would go about it in the issue becoming live again, I think the first thing you would need to do is have an honest, open discussion about how a president would be elected. “That’s what you need to have. Whether the president would be chosen by parliament, you know, in a bipartisan, two-thirds majority as proposed in 99 or directly elected. That is the rock on which the referendum floundered in 99. “You’ve got to have that discussion and it may be that a plebiscite, maybe even a postal survey, given the success of the marriage postal survey, could be one way to deal with that. “But that issue needs to be debated and resolved.” Turnbull said there was “no point pretending there is an appetite for change when there isn’t one at the moment”. The prime minister also did not mince his words when asked about Victoria’s reported crime problem, laying the blame squarely at the feet of the Labor premier, Daniel Andrews. News Corp papers have run a series of stories in past weeks about the “crisis” of crime caused by “African gangs” in the state. Cabinet ministers have reportedly called on Turnbull for commonwealth intervention. “The Australian federal police is a small and specialised police force that obviously deals with matters of particular federal responsibility, including terrorism,” Turnbull said. “We also provide a considerable amount of intelligence and technological support to state police forces in respect of gangs. “[But] this is a failure of the Andrews government. Victoria police is a huge organisation. Much larger than the federal police. It’s got the capacity to do the job. “But what it is lacking is the political leadership and the determination on the part of Premier Andrews to make sure the great policemen and women of Victoria have the leadership, the direction and the confidence of the government to get on with the job and tackle this gang problem on the streets of Melbourne and, indeed, throughout other parts of the state.” Last week, Victoria police superintendent Therese Fitzgerald said the issue stemmed from “youth crime in general”, adding there was “not a particular group of youths we are looking into”. The state government said it didn’t want to play political games about youth crime. “We will take our instructions and advice from Victoria Police,” acting road safety minister Phillip Dalidakis told reporters in Melbourne, AAP reported. “We certainly will not be taking suggestions or advice from a bloke who can’t even put on a life vest when he’s on a boat in Sydney Harbour.” The prime minister was fined $250 last week in December for not wearing a life jacket while moving his dinghy near his harbourside Sydney home. “If Malcolm Turnbull wants to play games instead of working in collaborative effort, then he can do so and talk to himself,” Dalidakis said. Victoria police also defended their efforts to address youth crime. “I’m very confident where we’re going and how we’re tackling youth crime in this state,” deputy commissioner Andrew Crisp told reporters in Melbourne."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/live/2018/jan/01/burnley-v-liverpool-stoke-v-newcastle-football-league-and-more-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-01T17:07:28Z","webTitle":"Burnley 1-2 Liverpool, Stoke 0-1 Newcastle and more – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2018/jan/01/burnley-v-liverpool-stoke-v-newcastle-football-league-and-more-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/live/2018/jan/01/burnley-v-liverpool-stoke-v-newcastle-football-league-and-more-live","fields":{"headline":"Burnley 1-2 Liverpool, Stoke 0-1 Newcastle and more – as it happened","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"That’s all from me.

Still playing at Leeds and Sunderland... It’s a managerial misery full house for Mark Hughes: he’s trudging off to a chorus of jeers and boos, soaked by the rain after a narrow home defeat – and the A5 banners are out. Ayoze Pérez got the winner for Newcastle, who just about deserved it. What a big result that could be for Liverpool, who looked to have thrown victory away only to snatch it back in stoppage time. They’re now just a point behind second-placed Chelsea. No idea how there were three goals in that game, mind you. After a dour first half the hosts take control to comfortably see off Huddersfield through goals from Riyad Mahrez, Marc Albrighton and Islam Slimani. Liverpool have grabbed all three points in the dying seconds, Ragnar Klavan heading in from half a yard after Dejan Lovren had sent Emre Can’s free kick back across goal. Cue scenes on the Turf Moor touchlines. Huddersfield’s long, long wait for a win at Leicester will continue, as Marc Albrighton makes certain of victory. Sheffield Wednesday 0-3 Burton, Tom Naylor finishing from close range. It’s also Luton 4-2 Lincoln, Stevenage 4-1 Cheltenham and Fylde 5-1 Tranmere as the goals fly in. Meanwhile, scenes at Yeovil where the hosts are down to nine men against Crawley – and play has just been stopped due to a drone flying overhead. Its 1-1 there. Darlow denies Diouf again as Newcastle hang on at Stoke. At Elland Road, Pierre-Michel Lasogga’s header back across goal lacks the required power, and Forest are hanging on. Late goals for promotion chasers Notts County and Scunthorpe, but David Ball has pegged Blackburn back at Rotherham. This one will sting for Liverpool – Burnley are level after more poor defending. Gudmundsson arrives unmarked at the far post to head home from Sam Vokes’ near-post flick on! Liverpool so close to adding a second, but Nick Pope denies Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain. Team news is in for Everton v Manchester United, which you can follow with Gregg Bakowski: Goals chalked off at Derby and QPR – David Nugent’s strike ruled out for a foul, and Junior Hoilett denied a Cardiff equaliser after he was flagged offside. It looked a marginal call. In League Two, goal machines Luton lead Lincoln 3-2 in a thriller at Kenilworth Road. Darlow denies Diouf’s acrobatic effort from 12 yards out, turning the ball behind for a corner. Mark Hughes could really use an equaliser here. Norwich lead Millwall, whose away drought is set to continue. James Maddison drills home to add to his earlier assist. Demarai Gray on for Riyad Mahrez, who looks to have orchestrated another hard-earned win. Leicester are looking good to finish best of the rest; the question is, why does nobody want to buy Mahrez? Middlesbrough lead at Preston, Daniel Ayala scoring with his second header of the day as the visitors turn it around. Another turnaround in the Championship – debutant Paul Smyth’s superb solo goal has made it QPR 2-1 Cardiff. Oh Sparky! Jacob Murphy picks up the ball in midfield and waits patiently before sliding a pass to Ayoze Pérez, who gets in behind the defence and puts the visitors ahead! Liverpool holding on to their lead with relative comfort at Burnley, where Jeff Hendrick is replaced by striker Sam Vokes. Goalscorer Sadio Mané is replaced by Roberto Firmino. This would be a big win for the visitors, who have so often struggled to win ugly. Newcastle appeal for a penalty, Dwight Gayle going down in the area under Kurt Zouma’s challenge. You’ve seen them given... “Manchester City are Bitcoin,” says Mark Turner. “Market valuation going parabolic, the world wondering if this is the brave new world or just another flash in the pan.” Jonny Howson has levelled for Middlesbrough at Preston with a fine curling finish from the edge of the box. In League One, Portsmouth and Blackburn have taken the lead at Bristol Rovers and Rotherham respectively, and Bradford also lead at Fleetwood. Phew. Still goalless at Stoke, where Choupo-Moting has tested Karl Darlow and Mame Biram Diouf is on for Xherdan Shaqiri, who took an earful from fans for a half-hearted display. For Newcastle, Dwight Gayle replaces the profligate Christian Atsu. Two big goals in the Championship: QPR equalise against Cardiff as Matt Smith heads home from a long throw, and Leon Clarke levels for Sheffield United at Derby. Leicester double their lead on the break, Mahrez picking out compatriot Islam Slimani who blasts the ball home! Liverpool lead at Turf Moor, as Sadio Mané collects Alexander-Arnold’s cross, turns on the edge of the area and fires a shot past Pope and into the roof of the net! Surprise scoreline of the day: Tranmere, sixth in the National League having won their last five games, are 4-0 down at AFC Fylde. In League One, goals for Blackpool – who lead at Rochdale – and Bradford, who are level at Fleetwood. Cardiff take the lead at QPR, Joe Ralls converting a penalty. At Carrow Road, Norwich have equalised against Millwall, Tom Trybull heading home James Maddison’s free kick. “The Emirates = a pair of Bose noise cancelling headphones,” says Giles Allison. We have a goal! And it’s Riyad Mahrez who gets it, finishing smartly from Marc Albrighton’s cross. Oh boy, Sunderland are behind – Ethan Pinnock heads home for Barnsley from a corner, with the marking not the best. More bad news for Chris Coleman as Lloyd Dyer fires Burton ahead. Jarrod Bowen hits the post for Hull, who are getting dragged right into the mire. We’re back under way in the three Premier League games. Goals please! Mourinho is Tesla, I think” offers Emily G, “incredibly expensive and hyped, impressive and cool in a lot of ways but painfully unreliable and temperamental, not to mention controversial.” David Flynn also goes for Guardiola as Steve Jobs: “idealistic, visionary, polo necks, a bit irritating.” Match off! Accrington v Morecambe has been abandoned with rain falling relentlessly for the last hour. Stanley were winning 1-0, not that it matters now. More of your techy teams: “Burnley are a Nokia 3310. Basic, durable, not very fancy, but what it does it does well,” says Ben Park. Charles Antaki makes it personal: “Pep Guardiola is obviously Steve Jobs – elegance, style, innovation, success and gazillions of dollars. Whereas José Mourinho is, erm — this is a family paper, right?” Championship Bolton 1-0 Hull; Derby 1-0 Sheffield United; Leeds 0-0 Nottingham Forest; Norwich 0-1 Millwall; Preston 2-1 Middlesbrough; QPR 0-0 Cardiff; Sheffield Wednesday 0-1 Burton; Sunderland 0-0 Barnsley.

It’s still 0-0 in a relegation battle at the Stadium of Light, where Sunderland and Barnsley have had a half-chance each. At Deepdale, Preston hit the bar. As it stands, they are edging into the top six. Luton are level against Lincoln – quite the first half there. Stoke have a penalty shout waved away by Chris Kavanagh as Joe Allen goes down. The home crowd getting restless there. Burnley are back on the front foot at Turf Moor, where it’s absolutely pouring. Liverpool threatening at Turf Moor, with last-ditch challenges required to deny Dominic Solanke and Fab Four soloist Sadio Mané. Preston lead Middlesbrough, Jordan Hugill nodding in his eighth league goal of the season. It’s all happening at Luton, where Lincoln have taken the lead but seen Harry Anderson sent off. Ten men each there, and Forest Green are also down to 10, Charlie Cooper – son of manager Mark – taking an early bath. His father protests too much, and is sent to the stand himself. Wilfried Ndidi fires wide after a half-hearted penalty shout at Leicester, where Huddersfield are wearing that red and black kit that looks like a Prodigy CD single cover, circa 1993. At Hillsborough, Burton lead through Tom Flanagan, who George Weahed his way through the Wednesday defence. “Liverpool are Windows,” says Michael Cosgrove. “They hum along nicely most times but as soon as they really get going, they freeze.” They’re still booting up at Burnley with half-time approaching. Gudmonsson puts in a testing cross at Turf Moor, where the rain is pelting down. Ashley Barnes can’t quite get a head to it but the hosts continue to look lively. Ten-man Luton have equalised against Lincoln, while Stevenage have turned it around and lead Cheltenham 2-1. Down at Loftus Road, Cardiff are looking to bounce back from three straight defeats and are having the better of a goalless first half against QPR. Gillingham lead 2-0 at Charlton, in takeover talks but rapidly shedding wheels from their League One promotion tilt. Newcastle should be ahead at Stoke, where Ciaran Clark has just hoiked an absolute sitter over the bar from two yards out. Elsewhere, advertising board of the day at Forest Green: Arfield tests Mignolet with a header as Burnley continue to pose Liverpool problems on the break. Unsurprisingly, it’s all a bit incoherent for Liverpool up front. In League One, it’s Oxford 1-1 MK Dons, and Wimbledon lead at home to Southend. “Leeds are Texas Instruments – no-one under the age of 40 has heard of them. Coventry are Sinclair Research – irrelevant for the last 20 years,” says Phil James, sticking it to those mid-90s Premier League mainstays. “Newcastle are an old flip-phone and Rafa is my eighty-year-old parents trying to figure it out in a world that has moved on,” says Colin Flint, who may not be happy to hear that Karl Darlow has nervously pawed at Charlie Adam’s long-range free-kick. Derby lead Sheffield United, Matej Vydra banging in a penalty after George Baldock fouled Johnny Russell. In League One, Shaun Whalley has fired Shrewsbury ahead against Oldham, and Fleetwood lead Bradford City through Jack Sowerby. The best goal of the year so far has come at Bolton, where Gary Madine has curled in a free kick to put the hosts ahead against Hull. Victory would lift Bolton above their opponents, and it’s possible that they and Sunderland will be in the bottom four tonight. Here’s Ben Fisher’s report from the early game at the Amex: Adam Lallana makes a decisive intervention at the back, getting back to deny Scott Arfield as he was threatening to break clear on goal. At Stoke, Christian Atsu has had three or four chances, but his radar is way off so far. “Everton are McAfee,” says Kenton Toner. “Great at blocking but not designed to create anything.” “Portsmouth are Tiny Computers – dodgy owners, briefly successful followed by bankruptcy,” adds Michael Hughes whose thoughts on Tiny Computers are his own. Leeds denied at Elland Road, as Kieran Dowell clears Pontus Jansson’s header off the line. At Turf Moor, there’s a low-tempo, Bank Holiday vibe with the ball floating around midfield. Middlesbrough lead at Preston, Daniel Ayala heading home as the Pulis effect takes hold. Oh, hang on – the hosts have equalised immediately through Callum Robinson. 1-1 at Deepdale. Plenty of possession for Liverpool but that new-look front three aren’t clicking just yet. At the King Power, Huddersfield right-back Tommy Smith whips a cross towards Rajiv van la Parra, but can’t quite pick him out. Penalty for Burton at Hillsborough – but Lucas Akins’ tame effort is saved! Lincoln have punished Sheehan, who was sent off for a punch, as Michael Bostwick fires the Imps ahead at Luton. Slimani forces a smart save from Lossl, but the flag goes up anyway. Mixed news for the leaders of League One and League Two; Nick Powell’s header has put Wigan ahead at Northampton, but Luton’s Alan Sheehan has been sent off in their match against third-placed Lincoln City. Ayoze Pérez picks out his strike partner for today, Christian Atsu, early on but his shot is blocked. Huddersfield have started brightly at Leicester, and the same goes for Sheffield United at Derby. Neil Warnock received a rousing reception from QPR fans on his return with Cardiff, but nothing much else of interest has happened so far. Stoke start off by pumping long balls towards Peter Crouch. Our first goal comes in League Two, where Cheltenham lead Stevenage. Teams as technology: your thoughts “Arsenal are surely Dell – great in the 90s and early noughties, and managed decline ever since” says Gavin Reddin. “Spurs are the latest hyped tech enterprise, inevitably bought by Microsoft or Google” sighs Diego Salinas. “Southampton are eBay” offers Andy Read. Jürgen Klopp on that team selection: “Phil and Mo are not available, both injured. Not too cool but that’s how it is. We wanted the right formation and tactics for this game today. It’s good to have Lallana back, we were without him for a long period but now he’s ready to start. It’s cool for us.” Cool. Some interesting Championship news: Sheffield Wednesday have appointed Katrien Meire as their new CEO. Meire left Charlton last week, where she was not exactly a fan favourite. Here’s a riff from Peter Edmunds: “If Man City are Apple (expensively assembled market leader), Liverpool are Samsung (exciting, high tech, prone to selling their best components) and Man United are IBM (former giant, but a little boring these days) - any thoughts on where other teams fit in. Are Everton Amstrad?” Ideas welcome, and if anyone has a good NYE yarn, send it this way too. Keep it clean.

The only other player from these six teams to score last time out (see Preamble), Jamie Vardy, is out with a groin injury. That gives Islam Slimani a chance to shine up front, while Adrien Silva is finally allowed on the Leicester bench after four months in limbo.

Referee: Chris Kavanagh In the south coast (sort of) derby, Bournemouth have just equalised against Brighton with the first great goal of 2018. Gregg Bakowski has more: Salah is unavailable for Liverpool – and Philippe Coutinho is left out of the squad, pouring petrol on those Barcelona rumours. Dominic Solanke starts up front with Adam Lallana making his first start of the season. James Tarkowski returns for Burnley after his three-game ban.

The relentless festive football schedule can be a comfort in that weird 10-day spell after Christmas. You may not be certain what day, or even what year it is but you can guarantee there’s football on. And plenty of it – 32 matches across the Football League and three top-flight 3pm kick-offs with a nostalgic feel to them. All six of the teams involved were in action two days ago, and managed three goals between them. Two of those were scored by Mo Salah, who is ruled out through injury as Liverpool take a trip to Burnley. The first meeting at Turf Moor was a 3-3 thriller in 1894; the last was a chastening defeat for Jürgen Klopp. Home wins have been few and far between – the last five before that came in 1967, ‘73, ‘75, ‘83 and 2005 (Oh, Djimi...) Stoke City and Newcastle United first played in a Test match back in 1898, but recent trips have been tough for the Magpies. A Demba Ba-inspired win in 2011 is their only away win since 1985. Another one today might consign Mark Hughes to the history books, too. Elsewhere, Huddersfield go to Leicester chasing a first away win there since 1954. David Wagner’s mob are used to taking out those kind of records, though. In the Championship, second-placed Derby County take on Sheffield United, whose own promotion bid has faltered. These two first duked it out way, way back in 1893 but the Blades have the edge in recent years – they’ve won on four of their last five visits. Tony Pulis takes Middlesbrough to Preston, where they haven’t lost since 1972. History is going to be made somewhere, so stay tuned. After all, it beats working."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/2018/jan/02/sport-calendar-2018-world-cup-winter-olympics-ryder-cup","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-02T00:01:12Z","webTitle":"Sport calendar 2018: your essential guide to the next 12 months","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/jan/02/sport-calendar-2018-world-cup-winter-olympics-ryder-cup","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/jan/02/sport-calendar-2018-world-cup-winter-olympics-ryder-cup","fields":{"headline":"Sport calendar 2018: your essential guide to the next 12 months","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"(All dates in brackets are ‘until’) All football fixtures are available here January 1 Cricket Second T20: New Zealand v WI, Mount Maunganui Tennis ASB Classic, Auckland (7 Jan);

The Ravens rallied from a 17-10 deficit to lead 27-24 with a minute to spare in the fourth quarter, but Bengals quarterback Andy Dalton found Tyler Boyd on fourth-and-12 for a late touchdown to stun the home crowd and end Buffalo’s long wait for a playoff spot. Buffalo held off a late Miami rally to win 22-16, with quarterback Tyrod Taylor running in a touchdown and defensive tackle Kyle Williams going over from a yard out in a stormy second half. The Dolphins cut the gap by 10 points in the fourth quarter but Buffalo hung on, and fans including Jack Nicklaus waited for news from Baltimore. Tennessee also ended a drought of their own, defeating AFC South rivals Jacksonville 15-10 in a nervous contest to secure the fifth seed. The Jaguars had already sealed their play-off place and will host Buffalo in the wildcard round, while the Titans take on AFC West winners Kansas City. In the NFC, Atlanta took a step towards redemption for their painful Super Bowl defeat in 2017 by clinching the final play-off spot. Matt Bryant kicked five second-half field goals as they held off Carolina 22-10. Ultimately, Seattle’s narrow defeat to Arizona meant the Falcons were in regardless, while defeat for the Panthers meant that New Orleans sealed the NFC South despite a late loss to Tampa Bay. In the early games on New Year’s Eve, Dion Lewis’ two touchdowns secured a 26-6 win and home-field advantage in the AFC for defending Super Bowl champions New England. Minnesota sealed a 13-3 record, and the No2 seed in the NFC, with a defense-led victory over the Bears. Pittsburgh rested several starters including Ben Roethlisberger but still edged out Cleveland by 28-24. The Browns were already assured of the No1 draft pick, but have become only the second team in NFL history to go 0-16. Jimmy Garoppolo continued to impress as the 49ers beat the LA Rams, who will face Atlanta in the NFC wild-card round.

The Arsenal manager ended up face-to-face with Mike Dean on the touchline, angry with the referee’s decision to award West Bromwich Albion a late penalty, and signed off 2017 with a furious attack on the standard of officiating in the Premier League and the manic festive fixture schedule. Happy New Year, Arsène. It was that sort of evening for Wenger, who was in no mood to celebrate the fact that he had just clocked up his 811th Premier League game as manager to surpass Sir Alex Ferguson’s record. The Arsenal manager looked and sounded totally exasperated, his patience stretched to breaking point by the sight of Dean pointing to the spot in the 88th minute. Arsenal had taken the lead only five minutes earlier, via a poorly taken free-kick from Alexis Sánchez that took a huge deflection off James McClean, and Wenger must have thought at that stage that his team were going to collect three points from a game where they had gone through the motions at times, never really playing with any conviction. Dean, however, intervened with the sort of decision that leaves managers apoplectic. Kieran Gibbs – a former Arsenal player, to rub salt into Wenger’s wounds – broke into the area and tried to lift the ball over Calum Chambers. It struck the central defender on the arm and although there was hardly any space between Chambers and Gibbs and the ball – in other words, the Arsenal player could barely get out of the way – Dean gave a penalty. Wenger was up in arms in his technical area and the Arsenal protests continued long after Jay Rodriguez had dispatched his kick to give Albion a precious point that lifts them off the bottom of the league, above Swansea on goal difference. Although Alan Pardew said that Albion deserved to come away from the game with something to show for their efforts, he admitted that he would have been “upset” if the penalty decision had been given against his team and he understood why Wenger was so angry. A spotlight will shine on Dean’s performance – not for the first time – while Wenger’s scathing comments about England’s referees showing no improvement since they turned professional are sure to ignite a fresh debate about the level of officiating in the Premier League. Yet there is no escaping the fact that Arsenal were their own worst enemies at The Hawthorns. They looked disjointed for long periods, there was no real tempo to their game and far too many passes went astray. Arsenal’s buildup play was slow, prosaic and predictable, and it was hard to see where a goal was coming from until Sánchez benefited from a slice of good fortune with his free-kick. Wenger suggested that his players’ lack of rest had contributed to a flat performance – Albion had an extra 48 hours to recover from their last fixture than Arsenal did – yet the travelling supporters were still entitled to expect their team to attack with much more pace and belief. The game had reached the hour mark when Arsenal finally put together one of their trademark slick one-touch moves, which culminated in Alexandre Lacazette seeing his left-foot shot repelled by Ben Foster’s outstretched boot. At the other end Albion threatened only sporadically, with Matty Phillips their most dangerous player by a distance. Phillips had the beating of Sead Kolasinac, who departed with a knee injury after 37 minutes, and the Albion winger delivered several dangerous crosses from the right that were crying out for a centre-forward to throw himself at the ball. Pardew appeared to be settling for a stalemate the longer the game went on but then came Sánchez’s free-kick. It was a desperately poor goal for Albion to concede and McClean, who had come off the bench minutes earlier, hardly covered himself in glory. Stationed on the end of the Albion wall, McClean turned his back as Sánchez ran up to take the free-kick and the ball deflected off the substitute, leaving Foster stranded. Just about every Arsenal player joined Sánchez to celebrate, in contrast to their muted response to the Chilean’s goals at Crystal Palace three days earlier, yet the visitors’ joy proved to be short-lived when Rodriguez converted that contentious penalty. Although Albion’s wait for a first win since August goes on – it is now 19 Premier League matches since they last picked up three points – in many respects this felt like a victory for Pardew and his players. “We deserved that,” Pardew said. “There was a lot of pressure on us today, we had to get something, so fair play to the players.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2017/dec/31/jo-johnson-is-right-about-the-national-union-of-students-thought-police","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-31T18:51:49Z","webTitle":"Jo Johnson is right about the National Union of Students thought police | Letter","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/dec/31/jo-johnson-is-right-about-the-national-union-of-students-thought-police","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/dec/31/jo-johnson-is-right-about-the-national-union-of-students-thought-police","fields":{"headline":"Jo Johnson is right about the National Union of Students thought police","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Free speech within the law should be fundamental to life in universities: challenging opinions should themselves be challengeable (Students attack no-platform threat, 27 December).

The 22-year-old American, who has 15 million subscribers on YouTube, was labelled “disrespectful” and “disgusting” after he joked with his friends about discovering the body in Aokigahara forest, a notorious suicide spot at the base of Mount Fuji. The video, which Paul posted on Sunday, received millions of views before it was removed. Paul and his friends, who are filming from various locations in Japan, reportedly came across the body moments after entering the forest. Their video showed the body of a man, whose identity is unknown, from several angles but blurs his face. A member of the group is heard remarking that he “doesn’t feel good”. Paul replies: “What, you never stand next to a dead guy?” and then laughs. The exchange, and the decision to upload images of the victim, prompted a wave of criticism online. The Breaking Bad actor Aaron Paul tweeted: “You disgust me. I can’t believe that so many young people look up to you. So sad. Hopefully, this latest video woke them up … Suicide is not a joke. Go rot in hell.” Fellow YouTube star Kandee Johnson said: “Dear @youtube, after the Logan Paul video where he shows a dead body of a suicide victim, uses that for the title, makes heartless jokes next to the body, there needs to b age restrictions for certain creators. How is this allowed on YT? His followers are children! Horrifying.” Paul later apologised to his 3.9 million followers on Twitter: “Where do I begin … Let’s start with this – I’m sorry,” he said. “This is a first for me. I’ve never faced criticism like this before, because I’ve never made a mistake like this before.” He added: “I didn’t do it for views. I get views. I did it because I thought I could make a positive ripple on the internet, not cause a monsoon of negativity. That’s never the intention. I intended to raise awareness for suicide and suicide prevention.” But the initial statement was criticised by many, including the Game Of Thrones actor Sophie Turner, who tweeted: “You’re not raising awareness. You’re mocking. I can’t believe how self-praising your ‘apology’ is. You don’t deserve the success (views) you have. I pray to God you never have to experience anything like that man did.” British Labour MP Melanie Onn, who had tweeted that she bought a Logan Paul hoodie as a Christmas present for her 10-year-old son, said the video was “dreadful”, adding: “I can’t believe he was able to put that up without any checks at all.” Paul later issued a second statement of apology. “I want to apologise to anyone who has seen the video. I want to apologise to anyone who has been affected or touched by mental illness or depression or suicide, but most importantly I want to apologise to the victim and his family,” he said. “For my fans who are defending my actions, please don’t – they do not deserve to be defended.” YouTube said Paul’s video violated its policies, but did not respond to calls to suspend him from the site. “Our hearts go out to the family of the person featured in the video,” a YouTube spokeswoman said. “YouTube prohibits violent or gory content posted in a shocking, sensational or disrespectful manner. If a video is graphic, it can only remain on the site when supported by appropriate educational or documentary information and in some cases it will be age-gated.” Aokigahara has gained worldwide notoriety as a suicide spot, with a record 105 bodies reportedly discovered there in 2003. Local police have stopped releasing the number of annual deaths in an attempt to reduce the area’s association with suicide. The forest’s hiking trails are dotted with signs urging those with suicidal thoughts to consider their families and contact a suicide prevention group. The number of Japanese who kill themselves has fallen in recent years, although the country still has the sixth highest suicide rate in the world. The number of people who took their own lives dropped to 21,897 in 2016 – the lowest level in 22 years – according to government figures. The number rose in the late 1990s and remained just above 30,000 for more than 10 years – a rate experts partly attributed to financial pressures caused by the collapse of the bubble economy in 1992 and the end of lifetime employment. The lack of services for people with mental health problems, as well as debt and serious illness – particularly among elderly people – have also been cited as common causes of suicide in Japan. The figure has remained below 30,000 a year since 2012. In the UK, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123. In the US, the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline is 1-800-273-8255. In Australia, the crisis support service Lifeline is 13 11 14.

Senior Labour politicians joined protests over average fare increases of 3.4% and season ticket increases of 3.6%. The rises, the biggest since 2013, are more than the consumer price index inflation rate and well above average increases in annual earnings. Chris Grayling, the transport secretary, declined broadcast interview requests to defend the rises, despite protests at about 40 stations. He left the task to Paul Plummer, the chief executive of the Rail Delivery Group, who said the increases would help improve services. “The next few years are going to see improvements right across the country,” he said. Speaking on the expanded concourse of London Bridge station, which reopened fully on Tuesday after years of rebuilding, he said he understood the frustration of commuters. He said: “As an industry we can make sure we take the best use of that money. We have had decades of underinvestment.” Figures from the rail regulator showed Britain’s trains were now older than they were since after privatisation, with 42-year-old trains still operating on some parts of the network. Plummer said they would be replaced soon, adding: “There will be 5,700 new trains by 2021.” Mark Carne, the chief executive of Network Rail, which manages Britain’s rail infrastructure, said passengers would see many of the benefits of investment this year, including London Bridge’s reopening followed by the upgraded Thameslink train service in May, and the start of Crossrail services by the end of the year. He added: “Obviously today we see a fare increase and I know passengers are not happy, nor with the reliability of the railway, and that’s why we are investing so heavily to improve it.” Commuters at London Bridge welcomed the improved station, which will have capacity for double the current 50 million passengers a year, and will see more and faster Thameslink services resume from May. Stephen Powell, who connects across via Waterloo East from Farncombe, Surrey, to work in HR in the City, said: “Hopefully things will improve. Since August, the train service has been abysmal: late, unpredictable, cancellations.” He said of the season ticket price rise: “I daren’t look, it’s like a mortgage. If it all worked, I’d put up with it – we get paid higher wages to work in the City – but it’s not working now.” Mat Biernat, from Catford, who works in retail, said of his Southeastern service now stopping at London Bridge: “It’s really positive. But there still needs to be some improvement.” He said services were more frequent in his native Poland. “And yes, definitely much cheaper.” At Manchester Piccadilly, one of the busiest stations in England, travellers were exasperated by the fare rises. “It’s not a public transport service if most people can’t afford it,” said Lynn Macdonald, a PA travelling home to Bristol. “It’s become way too expensive.” Anthony Paul Dodwell, a window cleaner travelling to Scunthorpe, said: “It’s beyond a joke really now. It wouldn’t be so bad if they put enough coaches on so you got a seat but to pay these prices and still have to stand is just not on.” The north of England has the worst-performing rail firms in the country. In the run-up to Christmas, 72.5% of services operated by First Rail Hull were late or cancelled. Virgin Trains, which charges £169 for a walk-up, peak-time single to travel from Manchester to London, operated only 31% of services on time between 19 November and 23 December, the Sunday Times reported. At Euston station in London, law student Jodell Jackson said the fare rises were unfair. “They have been increasing the fares for a while now. I have to buy my ticket two months in advance,” she said. Her grandmother, Mary Agbajoh, said: “When I heard that on the news, I thought every year it goes up but our salaries are not going up as well. So it is becoming unaffordable.” Andy McDonald, the shadow transport secretary, joined protesters at King’s Cross station in London to condemn what he said were “truly staggering” fare increases. Speaking to BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, he said: “This franchise system has completely and utterly failed. We have a fractured, expensive and complex system – it duplicates costs and there are dividends going out to subsidise railways on the continent. This is an absolute racket.” McDonald called for a switch to link rail increases to the consumer price index, which he claimed would save commuters £500 over the course of a parliament. He said fares had risen three times more quickly than wages since the start of the first David Cameron government, and added: “I think people have got to the end of their tether and quite understandably so.” Separate analysis by the TUC showed rail commuters in Britain were spending a considerably higher proportion of their salaries on season tickets than equivalent travellers in other European countries. The TUC’s figures used the example of a season ticket to London from Chelmsford in Essex, which had risen to £381 a month – 13% of average London salaries. Members of the Rail, Maritime and Transport (RMT) union handed out chocolates to commuters on Monday to “sweeten the bitter pill” of the price increase. The union’s general secretary, Mick Cash, said: “Passengers are paying more and more for less and less. “Our members are protesting today to say it is time to cut our fares, not our staff, and for a publicly owned railway where every penny of passenger revenue goes to improving services.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/jan/02/sydney-seaplane-crash-investigators-say-type-of-plane-considered-reliable","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-02T07:58:41Z","webTitle":"Sydney seaplane tragedy: same model involved in 2015 crash that killed second family","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/jan/02/sydney-seaplane-crash-investigators-say-type-of-plane-considered-reliable","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/jan/02/sydney-seaplane-crash-investigators-say-type-of-plane-considered-reliable","fields":{"headline":"Sydney seaplane tragedy: same model involved in 2015 crash that killed second family","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The model of seaplane that crashed on New Year’s Eve, killing five Britons and the plane’s pilot, is generally reliable, the Australian Transport Safety Bureau said on Tuesday. The plane crashed in the Hawkesbury river, north of Sydney, at 3.10pm local time on Sunday and has yet to be retrieved. The experienced pilot, Gareth Morgan, 44, died along with his passengers – the high-profile UK businessman Richard Cousins, 58, his sons, Edward and William Cousins, aged 23 and 25, his fiancee, Emma Bowden, 48, and her daughter, Heather Bowden-Page, 11. The 1964 DH C-2 Beaver seaplane is the same model of aircraft that crashed in Canada in 2015, killing another British family. Australian investigators were unable to say whether the plane that crashed on Sunday was fitted with a warning system recommended by Canadian authorities following the investigation into that crash. But they hope to piece together the final moments of the seaplane flight. Police divers worked until nightfall to recover the six bodies. The family was on holiday in Sydney and returning from lunch at the Cottage Point Inn when the crash happened. “The aircraft took off in a north-easterly direction, followed by a turn to the north-west, then a subsequent right turn before impacting the water,” the ATSB executive director of transport safety, Nat Nagy, said. One witness, Will McGovern, rushed with his friends to the downed plane after it hit the river. “The water was full of fuel, a massive slick across the top and the fumes actually burned your eyes,” he told the ABC. “The boys were in the water diving down, trying to help these people inside the plane.” But the plane quickly sank, nose down, and remains on the riverbed. Nagy and the other investigators, who have data retrieval and aviation expertise, worked with divers at the crash site on Tuesday to assess how best to recover the wreckage. A crane or airbags are being considered as options to refloat the plane, hopefully on Thursday. Nagy said it was too early to speculate on the cause of the crash but all aspects of the aircraft, from mechanics to its history, would be examined closely once the plane was recovered. Investigators are hopeful data can still be recovered from the plane’s avionic instruments and smartphones or cameras on board. “As well as that we will be looking at the maintenance records of the aircraft, talking to the operator, look at the pilot’s background and experience,” Nagy said. “We’ll also be talking to witnesses to try and piece together those final moments before the aircraft impacted the water.” Cousins was the chief executive of the world’s largest food catering company, Compass Group, and was a keen cricket fan. The former England cricket team captain Michael Vaughan, tweeted: “Saddened to hear of the passing away of Richard Cousins and some family members in Sydney ... Great man who loved the game of cricket ... Thoughts to all his family.” The English team’s supporters, the Barmy Army, plan to hold a minute’s silence at the start of the fifth Ashes test on Wednesday. It will take about 30 days for a preliminary report into the cause of the crash to be published but, if any urgent issues around the DH C-2 Beaver plane emerge, authorities will be quickly notified, Nagy said. “This is a tragic and sad end to 2017,” he said. “It’s the ATSB’s role to investigate transport and safety accidents and incidents such as this and to work out what happened with the key goal of trying to prevent accidents like this from happening into the future.” Sydney Seaplanes has suspended all flights indefinitely following the tragedy."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/live/2018/jan/02/stock-markets-set-to-extend-2017s-winning-streak-business-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-02T15:13:57Z","webTitle":"UK, US and eurozone manufacturing expands strongly at year-end – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2018/jan/02/stock-markets-set-to-extend-2017s-winning-streak-business-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/live/2018/jan/02/stock-markets-set-to-extend-2017s-winning-streak-business-live","fields":{"headline":"UK, US and eurozone manufacturing expands strongly at year-end – as it happened","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Wall Street has kicked off 2018 on a strong note, while stock markets in London and continental Europe are in the red on the first trading day of the year, dragged down by the strong pound and euro. Dow Jones up 0.4% at 24,820.65 S&amp;P 500 up 0.4% at 2684.95 Nasdaq 100 up 1% at 6458.65 UK’s FTSE 100 index down 0.6% at 6738.83 Germany’s Dax down 0.6% at 12,840.20 France’s CAC down 0.6% at 5280.24 Spain’s Ibex up 0.1% at 10,056.70 Italy’s FTSE MiB down 0.3% at 21,793.20 Manufacturing surveys for the UK, US and eurozone have been strong, with the eurozone putting in a record performance in December while the US showed the highest factory growth since 2015. Activity at Britain’s factories slowed but was described as “solid”. Crude oil and gold have also got off to a good start to 2018. Oil prices saw their strongest start to a year since 2014, amid unrest in Iran and ongoing supply cuts led by OPEC and Russia. Good-bye for today – we will be back tomorrow. The upturn at US factories was underpinned by faster increases in output and new orders, with manufacturers’ output growth reaching an 11-month high. Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit said the combination of strengthening growth, a solid labour market and rising prices will add to expectations that the Fed will hike interest rates again soon – as soon as March. With business optimism about the year ahead running at its highest for two years in the closing months of 2017, companies are clearly expecting to be busier in 2018. The upbeat mood is underscored by an increased appetite to hire new staff, with the survey indicating that factory payroll numbers are rising at a rate not seen for over three years. The last of today’s manufacturing surveys is out, for the US. The IHS Markit purchasing managers’ index strengthened to 55.1 in December from 53.9 in November, signalling the strongest manufacturing growth since March 2015. The highlight this week is the US non-farm payrolls report for December. It is expected to show a 189,000 increase in jobs, compared with 228,000 in November. The unemployment rate is set to have stayed at 4.1%. ING economist James Smith says: After the hurricanes in September, it’s been hard to make any real sense of the past few jobs reports. But three months later, we’re inclined to say December’s numbers should be close to ‘normal’. That probably means a return to the underlying trend - something in the region of 170,000 - although an over-correction after a couple of bumper readings can’t be ruled out. That said, mid-December appears to have been fairly warm and relatively dry, which may have allowed construction projects and other weather-dependent activities to continue for longer than usual. As December’s payrolls data is typically one of the most correlated months to weather patterns, this would be a tailwind for overall jobs growth - although admittedly the effect could be somewhat marginal. But whatever happens, with the economy essentially at full employment, the Fed is well aware jobs growth should be slowing - meaning a sub-consensus number shouldn’t bat too many eyelids. We are waiting for the US manufacturing survey for December, which will be out in less than 10 minutes. Wall Street has opened higher, as expected. The Dow Jones is up more than 120 points, or 0.5%, at 24,840; the S&amp;P 500 has opened some 11 points higher at 2682, a 0.4% gain; and the Nasdaq is 33 points ahead, or 0.5%, at 6937. We now have a full story on BP, which today admitted that Donald Trump’s sweeping changes to US taxes will knock about $1.5bn off its profits for the end of 2017. Barclays, Shell and Goldman Sachs have made similar statements in recent weeks. It’s a fairly quiet (and grey) day here in London. US stock futures are pointing to a higher opening for Wall Street. The euro is also higher against the yen, rising as high as 135.64 yen – levels last seen in late 2015. Against the dollar, it had its best year since 2003 last year as European economies strengthened and amid growing expectations that the European Central Bank would wind down its monetary stimulus programme. Today, the euro high a four-month high of $1.2081. A survey of manufacturing in the eurozone and individual country reports painted a strong picture of the industrial sector. The pound is trading around $1.355, its highest price for more than three months, as investors continue to spurn the dollar despite Trump’s recent tax reform success. Yet the pound wasn’t the star of 2018’s first day of trading, noted Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex. No, that honour went to the euro, which showed no sign of shedding the barnstorming form that defined the currency’s final fortnight of 2017. With the eurozone manufacturing PMI at a record high of 60.6 – prompted by country-specific all-time peaks for Austria, Germany and Ireland – the euro surged half a percent against the dollar, sending it above $1.206, while nabbing 0.2% off sterling to send its rival to a fresh 5 week nadir. The gains in the euro and sterling have put pressure on stock markets, most of which rose in early trading. Germany’s Dax is now down 0.5% while France’s CAC has lost more than 1%. The FTSE 100 index in London has slipped 0.45% to 7653.62. Looking at the markets, gold has extended its year-end rally (it gained 4.4% in the last three weeks of 2017). A further retreat in the dollar today drove gold prices above $1,310 an ounce. The dollar posted its biggest annual fall since 2003 last year, helped lift gold by more than 13% over 2017. This morning, spot gold traded 0.7% higher at $1311.30 an ounce. Back to the UK manufacturing survey. Analysts Fabrice Montagne and Sreekala Kochuvodindan at Barclays Capital pointed to the growing gap between the UK and the rest of Europe. Despite edging lower from November’s high, manufacturing PMIs remain on a solid footing, supported by the intermediate and investment sectors, while the consumer goods sectors remain in the doldrums. December easing was broad based, but new orders dropped the most and employment cooled to its lowest reading in six months. Price indicators eased somewhat but remain elevated. As long as global growth powers ahead, the UK manufacturing sector will be dragged along, but data point to a continued loss of market share as the economy increasingly feels the pinch of business uncertainty and capacity constraints. Particularly telling is the growing gap between manufacturing momentum in the UK and the European Area. Returning to cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin is apparently a bit passé. According to Bloomberg, the world’s best-known digital currency is losing ground to rivals such as monero – a new favourite with criminals. Bloomberg reported: The European Union’s law-enforcement agency, Europol, raised alarms three months ago, writing in a report that “other cryptocurrencies such as monero, ethereum and Zcash are gaining popularity within the digital underground.” Online extortionists, who use ransomware to lock victims’ computers until they fork over a payment, have begun demanding those currencies instead. On Dec. 18 hackers attacked up to 190,000 WordPress sites per hour to get them to produce monero, according to security company Wordfence. Bitcoin is trading slightly lower today at $13,445, close to a one-month low. Here is our full story on the manufacturing data. ING economist James Smith said this “buoyant activity” at Britain’s factories had taken some time to filter through to the official manufacturing data, although the latest readings had been more encouraging. The manufacturing sector continues to be a clear bright spot, but it’s worth remembering that it makes up a relatively small share of the overall economy. Elsewhere, there are few obvious catalysts for a pick-up in consumer spending, particularly with real wages set to be more or less flat this year. This will offset any further manufacturing gains and limit overall growth to around 1.4% in 2018. This will continue to make life difficult for the Bank of England, who we think have a relatively narrow window before the summer if they want to squeeze in another hike. Brexit noise could really ramp up in the autumn, ahead of October when some kind of deal realistically needs to be agreed to allow time for ratification. The question is what the survey data means for UK interest rates. Smith added: Policymakers have signalled they are inclined to increase rates again if the opportunity arises, particularly now that a transition period is likely to be agreed at some point in the first quarter. But a benign outlook for growth and inflation means a rate hike is still far from a done deal. Here’s more detail on the UK factory survey. Survey compiler IHS Markit said demand improved from clients in Europe, the US, China and the Middle East. Nearly 54% of companies were expecting production to rise over the coming year. Rob Dobson, director at IHS Markit, summed up the findings: UK manufacturing ended 2017 on a positive footing. Although growth of output and new orders moderated during December, rates of expansion remained comfortably above long-term trend rates. The sector has therefore broadly maintained its solid boost to broader economic expansion in the fourth quarter. The main growth engines were the intermediate and investment goods sectors during December, suggesting resilient business-to-business demand and capital spending trends, albeit in part due to rising exports. Growth in the consumer goods sector remained weak in comparison and was the only sub-industry to see output expand at a slower pace than November. JPMorgan economist Malcolm Barr noted that last month’s drop in the UK manufacturing PMI reversed the gain that had been recorded in November, but described the output and new orders balances as “healthy” at 58.9 and 57.2 respectively – “consistent with high frequency measures of growth in manufacturing output running near a 4% pace”. He added: While the easiest story to tell on manufacturing strength is that it is a by-product of exchange rate weakness and the strength of the expansion abroad, it remains the case that this is not obvious from the PMI data itself: the new export orders reading is running slightly below that for new orders as a whole. Here’s some reaction to the UK manufacturing PMI, a monthly snapshot of activity at the end of the year. Howard Archer, chief economic advisor to the EY ITEM Club, says: While weaker than November, the December PMI is still a pretty solid survey which indicates that manufacturing likely posted another strong performance in the fourth quarter of 2017 after being very much the UK economy’s brightest sector in the third quarter. Manufacturers will be hoping that the UK and EU make rapid progress in 2018 on a transition arrangement after agreeing to move to phase two of Brexit negotiations and that this encourages businesses to be more positive in their investment decisions and purchases of capital goods. European stock markets are now weaker. In London, the FTSE 100 index lost nearly 20 points, or 0.2%, to 7660.60, dragged down by mining stocks and a rising pound. There was also talk of profit taking, after mining stocks had a strong run last week. Dollar-earning exporters were the worst hit while smaller stocks, which are less exposed to the stronger pound, gained 0.1%. The pan-European Stoxx 60 index fell 0.4% while eurozone stocks lost 0.5%. David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: The DAX and the CAC 40 are in the red as the strength of the euro is holding back the eurozone indices. Shares in BP are down 0.5% after the company stated it’s expects to take a hit of $1.5bn due to the changes in US tax changes. The oil titan also stated it would benefit from the new tax regime in the long-run. BP’s share price has been pushing higher since August and the recent surge in the oil market has assisted it too. He is expecting the Dow Jones and S&amp;P 500 to open higher. The average reading over the final quarter of 2017 (57.0) was the best since the second quarter of 2014, according to IHS Markit, which compiled the survey. Britain’s manufacturing sector expanded strongly at the end of last year, although at a slower pace than before. The UK PMI from Markit/CIPS fell to 56.3 in December from November’s 51-month high of 58.2. It remained well above the 50 mark which separates expansion from contraction. Output, new orders and employment all rose at solid rates. It is the first data release of 2018. Meanwhile, Russia is looking at ways to create a “cryptorouble” that could help the country get around western sanctions. The Financial Times reported: Moscow officials say that President Vladimir Putin has commissioned work on establishing a cryptocurrency, as state-run Russian institutions rush to embrace blockchain, the shared ledger technology on which bitcoin and other digital currencies are based. Sergei Glazev, an economic adviser to Mr Putin, told a recent government meeting that a cryptorouble would be a useful tool to get around international sanctions. “This instrument suits us very well for sensitive activity on behalf of the state. We can settle accounts with our counterparties all over the world with no regard for sanctions,” Mr Glazev said. In the UK, average rail are rising by 3.4% on average from today – the biggest increase since 2013. Labour and trade unions condemned “staggering” annual increases to rail fares, which triggered protests at dozens of stations in England. Season tickets are up by 3.6%, more than the consumer price index inflation rate and well above average increases in people’s annual earnings. Analysis by the Labour party showed the average season ticket would cost £2,888 – £694 more than in 2010 – a rise of more than 30%. The government and rail operators defended the fare rises, saying they would lead to more investment in services. You can read more here.

Strong readings for output, new orders and employment pushed the final IHS Market eurozone manufacturing PMI to 60.6 in December, the highest level since the survey began in mid-1997. It compares with 60.1 in November. Readings for Germany, the Netherlands, Austria and Ireland were at or close to record highs. In Germany, the manufacturing PMI hit a record high at the end of 2017. The index cloimbed to 63.3 in December from 62.5 in November. Phil Smith, chief economist at IHS Markit, which compiled the survey, hailed a record-breaking year for the Germany manufacturing sector. The current 37-month sequence of improving business conditions surpassed the previous record set in the run up to the financial crisis. The goods-producing economy carries strong momentum into 2018, with new order growth at its highest for almost eight years and rising backlogs of work pointing to the need for further expansion in capacity. Business confidence rebounded back up to an elevated level by historical standards in December, further adding to the positive outlook. The French survey showed the strongest growth in manufacturing since September 2000. The country’s PMI rose to 58.8 in December from 57.7 in November, with new orders expanding at the fastest pace since November 2010 and business confidence hitting a 5 1/2 year high. The Italian manufacturing PMI also slipped, to 57.4 in December from November’s 58.3, but remained high. November’s reading was the best in over 6 1/2 years. Paul Smith, director at IHS Markit which compiles the survey, said: Growth of Italy’s manufacturing sector was sustained at an impressive pace as 2017 drew to a close, with the latest data confirming that industry remains a key driver of overall economic expansion. With strong demand from abroad – and widespread expectations amongst manufacturers that this will continue in the months ahead – the sector has momentum and is well placed to enjoy a strong start to 2018. Although the pipeline of new orders remains extremely positive, there are downside risks to sector expansion coming from the supply side. Vendors are struggling to keep up with surging demand, are running low on stocks and having to raise list prices, all factors that could place constraints on manufacturing growth in the months ahead. The Spanish manufacturing PMI is out, and shows another strong performance by Spain’s industrial sector in December. Production rose sharply and companies took on more workers after an increase in export orders. The headline index slipped to 55.8 from 56.1 in November but remained well above the 50 mark that separates expansion from contraction. The output sub-index hit a 31-month high. New business continued to increase, albeit at the slowest pace in three months, but export orders were up sharply. Andrew Harker, associate director at IHS Markit said: Spanish manufacturers ended 2017 on a high, the sector registering further strong improvements in December. Although new order growth eased, firms continued to ramp up production and took on extra staff at a near-record pace, reflecting the success they have had in securing new work over recent months. 2017 has been a strong year overall, with the average PMI reading the best since 2006. The sector therefore is in good shape heading into 2018. Turning to stock markets, the French, Spanish, Italian and Portuguese markets are all up while the UK and German markets have opened slightly lower. UK’s FTSE 100 down 0.1% at 7679.57 Germany’s Dax down 0.2% at 12,894.03 France’s CAC up 0.03% at 5314.20 Spain’s Ibex up 0.3% at 10,071.50 Italy’s FTSE MiB up 0.2% at 21,904.35 Portugal’s PSI 20 up 0.3% at 5405.83 Oil prices have got off to their strongest start to a year since 2014. Continued supply cuts by the oil cartel OPEC and Russia, along with anti-government protests in Iran, have lifted crude to the highest levels since mid-2015. Brent crude futures, the international benchmark, rose as high as $67.29 a barrel while US West Texas Intermediate crude futures hit a peak of $60.74, the highest since June 2015. It is the first time since January 2014 that both crude oil benchmarks started the year above $60 a barrel, according to Reuters. China’s Caixin manufacturing PMI jumped to 51.5 in December from 50.8 in November, and was stronger than expected. In Japan, the Nikkei manufacturing PMI fell to 49.9 in December from 51.2 in November, with almost all subindices weakening. Analysts at consultancy Pantheon Macroeconomics were cautious about the Chinese outlook. The input price index continued to fall, despite the rally in China related commodity price in Q4 last year. Industrial profits growth deteriorated sharply in November. Firms could have booked profits earlier in the year, so profits possibly are holding up better than the headline suggests. At this point, we can’t tell. At the same time, the output price index continues to show that businesses are having difficulty in passing on the pipeline pressures, despite buoyant consumer confidence. New orders picked up sharply, implying that officials could be lifting anti-pollution production and construction curbs earlier than planned. Some of the final demand likely is foreign, though, with the new export orders index also moving higher. The index generally isn’t useful as a leader of actual export growth, but external demand should hold up or even strengthen in the case of the US. The PMI should tick lower again in January, though, as the jump in December looks erratic. Copper is pushing higher on expectations that demand in China, the world’s biggest consumer of industrial metals, will rise this year. Three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange rose to $7,260 a tonne. The contract ended 2017 with a 31% gain, reaching prices last seen in January 2014, according to Reuters data. Good morning, and Happy New Year! Welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It’s the first day of the 2018 trading year, and futures are pointing to a higher open on European stock markets. Global stock markets ended 2017 on record highs: they gained $9tn (£6.7tn) in value over the year – supported by a strong worldwide economy, president Donald Trump’s tax cuts and central banks’ go-slow approach to easing financial support. The MSCI all-country world index rose 22% to close an all-time high of 514.53. The FTSE 100 in London hit a new peak, ending 2017 at 7687.77 – up 7.6% over the year. It lagged behind other stock markets, though – Japan’s Nikkei increased 19%; in the US the Nasdaq 100 posted a 32% rise while the Dow Jones gained nearly 26%, and Germany’s Dax rose almost 13%. Agenda We are expecting a raft of monthly manufacturing reports from the UK, the eurozone and the US today. The Spanish manufacturing PMI is due out at 8:15am GMT, followed by Italy at 8:45am, France at 8:50am, Germany at 8:55am and the eurozone at 9:00am. The UK manufacturing PMI will be released at 9:30am and the equivalent US survey at 2:45pm GMT."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/jan/02/german-far-right-mp-investigated-anti-muslim-social-media-posts","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-02T13:46:39Z","webTitle":"Two members of Germany's far-right party investigated by state prosecutor","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jan/02/german-far-right-mp-investigated-anti-muslim-social-media-posts","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jan/02/german-far-right-mp-investigated-anti-muslim-social-media-posts","fields":{"headline":"Two members of Germany's far-right party investigated by state prosecutor","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Two delegates of Germany’s far-right party are being investigated by Germany’s state prosecutor over possible incitement to hatred, after one of them accused Cologne police who had tweeted a new year message in Arabic of appeasing “barbaric, gang-raping Muslim hordes of men”. Beatrix von Storch, the deputy leader of Alternative for Germany (AfD), was also temporarily suspended from Twitter and Facebook as a new law forcing social media companies to remove hate speech came into force in Germany on 1 January. A tweet from AfD MP Alice Weidel, the party’s joint leader in the Bundestag, was also blocked by Twitter in Germany. In the message, Weidel criticised Von Storch’s ban, saying: “Our authorities submit to imported, marauding, groping, beating, knife-stabbing migrant mobs.” Cologne police tweeted their new year message in several languages including English, French and Arabic. It wished the people of Cologne and Leverkusen (and everywhere else) a happy new year. The authorities are considering whether Von Storch and Weidel should be charged with incitement to hatred.. Von Storch’s Twitter account was suspended for 12 hours over her post. Under the new law known as NetzDG, social media firms face fines of up to €50m (£44m) if they do not remove “obviously illegal” hate speech and other postings within 24 hours of receiving a notification. Critics of the law, which was conceived by the Social Democrat-run justice ministry, say it will place censorship decisions that require legal training at the whim of technology companies. Questions have been raised about whether sites such as Twitter will hire enough trained moderators to cope with the expected influx of deletion requests. Digital rights activists, technology companies and political groups including the pro-business Free Democratic party, the Left party and the far-right AfD have been vocal critics of the new law. Returning to Twitter after her ban, Von Storch – who posed with the former Ukip leader Nigel Farage when he endorsed AfD’s election campaign in September – posted in German: “Facebook has now also censored me. This is the end of the constitutional state.” Cologne’s state prosecutor said it had received “several hundred” criminal complaints against Von Storch. If she is charged and found guilty of incitement to hatred, she could face a fine or a prison sentence of up to three years. A spokesman for Cologne police told Der Spiegel that its investigation into the inflammatory tweets was normal procedure. “If there’s a suspicion that we are dealing with a crime, it is our legal responsibility to act,” he said. Von Storch previously provoked outrage for her social media activity when she answered “yes” in January 2016 to a question on Facebook asking whether firearms should be used against women and children trying to cross the German border. Von Storch, whose grandfather served as finance minister under Hitler, later claimed her computer mouse had slipped."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/jan/02/labor-open-to-republic-postal-survey-despite-attacking-turnbull-thought-bubble","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-02T03:05:35Z","webTitle":"Labor open to republic postal survey despite attacking Turnbull 'thought bubble'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/jan/02/labor-open-to-republic-postal-survey-despite-attacking-turnbull-thought-bubble","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/jan/02/labor-open-to-republic-postal-survey-despite-attacking-turnbull-thought-bubble","fields":{"headline":"Labor open to republic postal survey despite attacking Turnbull 'thought bubble'","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Labor has called Malcolm Turnbull’s proposal to use a postal survey to pick Australia’s preferred form of republic a “thought bubble” but said it would consider any proposition to advance the debate. After the former Labor prime minister Paul Keating questioned Turnbull’s commitment to a republic, the prime minister suggested a postal survey could be one way to determine whether Australians wanted to directly elect their head of state or for the parliament to appoint them if it abandoned the monarchy. On Tuesday the deputy Labor leader, Tanya Plibersek, criticised the idea as “another thought bubble” and called on the government to back Labor’s plan to first establish majority support for the constitutional change. “We think the threshold question is: do people support an Australian republic?” she told a press conference in Sydney. “Why have a debate that goes on for years about the best way to have a republic if there isn’t majority support for a republic? “If Malcolm Turnbull has a different proposition ... of course we’ll talk with him about that. Labor supports Australia becoming a republic and we’re happy to work with the government with whatever proposition they have for advancing this objective.” Plibersek said that Turnbull – who headed the unsuccessful 1999 push to become a republic – “used to be a guy who supported Australia becoming a republic” and suggested more could be done “if only someone with real power took an interest in this issue”. “We’re committed to putting a simple proposition to the Australian people: should Australia become a republic? Should Australia have an Australian head of state?” she said. “Once we’ve done that – and I believe the majority would say yes to an Australian republic – we can then have a discussion about what form that would take.” The shadow assistant minister for an Australian head of state, Labor’s Matt Thistlethwaite, told Guardian Australia the government’s “off the cuff” planning risked dooming the idea to failure. “We don’t want to repeat the mistakes of 1999,” he said, in reference to the fact many supporters of a republic with a directly elected head of state voted against the republic in a referendum offering only an appointed head of state. Thistlethwaite said the Liberal party was divided, noting that the home affairs minister, Peter Dutton, and the former prime minister Tony Abbott both oppose the republic. On Monday the Australian Republican Movement welcomed Turnbull’s statement that a postal survey could be used, with its chairman, Peter Fitzsimons, calling on him to commit to a national vote during the next term of parliament. “We are thrilled with the return of the prime minister – long the most passionate republican in the country – to moving forward the process of becoming a republic,” he said. “The leaders on both sides of politics clearly want this to happen. Now it’s not a question of if, but how.” The Australian Republic Movement proposes two votes in 2020 on separate questions for whether and how Australia could become a republic, and has stated the vote on both could occur at the same time."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/jan/01/everton-manchester-united-premier-league-match-report","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-01T19:42:25Z","webTitle":"Manchester United’s Martial and Lingard hit the high notes at Everton","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jan/01/everton-manchester-united-premier-league-match-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/jan/01/everton-manchester-united-premier-league-match-report","fields":{"headline":"Manchester United’s Martial and Lingard hit the high notes at Everton","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"José Mourinho’s dark mood was not transformed entirely – Paul Scholes and the so-called “kings of rock and roll” got it in the neck after the game – but the same could not be said of Manchester United’s second-half display at Everton. Clinical, classy and confident; Mourinho’s men welcomed in the new year in a manner that seemed beyond them during their festive slump. Superb finishes from Anthony Martial and Jesse Lingard brought United a first win in five matches and a return to second place in the Premier League. A 12-point gap remains between themselves and Manchester City but, after a slow-burning start and despite missing several key performers, they imposed their quality and superiority over Sam Allardyce’s ambitionless team. It needs to be a benchmark for the remainder of the campaign or those kings of rock and roll – presumably the “Class of 92” – will be playing the record that so irks the United manager. “From the first minute to the 70th we were improving, improving, improving,” said Mourinho. “We controlled the ball, we crossed a lot, the goals were phenomenal, Juan Mata’s shot hit the post and there was an amazing save by the kid [Everton’s Jordan Pickford]. We found a way to play without Romelu [Lukaku] and Zlatan [Ibrahimovic] and we played really well.” The first half lived down to expectations, reflecting the dour recent form that both teams brought into a contest played on a wet and windy Merseyside evening, but United gradually took command with Paul Pogba to the fore. Mourinho’s new captain almost fashioned a breakthrough when he broke into the Everton area but his low cross eluded several team-mates who were waiting to convert. The midfielder also tested Pickford with a 30-yard drive that the Everton goalkeeper tipped round his post while Martial forced a fine low save from the £30m summer signing. Allardyce once again deployed his team purely to contain. The end result was a second consecutive defeat and a second home game in succession without an Everton shot on target. Goodison’s patience is wearing thin and Allardyce’s attempts to sign Cenk Tosun from Besiktas have stalled with the Turkish club now demanding more than the £25m agreed in principle last week. “I presume we will know in the next 24 hours if we are successful or not,” said the Everton manager of the Tosun deal. “We need a bigger goalscoring threat than we have at the moment. Our attacking powers are limited. I knew that before I arrived and that’s why I’ve worked so hard on keeping clean sheets. That’s our main objective, to make sure we pick up more results by not conceding goals and hoping we can score one to win a game. Our ratio of chances created is very limited.” Mercifully from a United perspective there was improvement after the interval as they built momentum and forced the home side ever deeper. Better movement and distribution was key to their strong start to the second half and Mata twice went close to opening the scoring from distance. The Spain international’s first attempt from 25 yards was pushed over by Pickford. His second, a left-footed drive after cutting inside, flew beyond the goalkeeper but struck a post. Everton’s reprieve did not last long. The breakthrough had developed an air of inevitability, such was United’s dominance, and was executed with a touch of excellence. At the end of a sweeping counterattack Pogba picked out Martial in more space than he should have been allowed just outside the Everton penalty area. Central, and 20 yards out, the striker took aim for the top-left corner of Pickford’s goal and found his spot perfectly. Martial’s seventh goal of an inconsistent campaign was a fine way to end a barren run. Allardyce responded to falling behind by introducing Aaron Lennon and James McCarthy for Yannick Bolasie and Rooney respectively, the latter switch attracting audible derision from the Gwladys Street end. United responded by remaining on the front foot and Pogba twice almost doubled their lead, forcing another good stop from Pickford at close range and just failing to connect cleanly with Martial’s inviting cross moments later. Pogba was a persistent threat roaming in from the left and teed up Lingard for a low shot that Everton’s keeper, yet again, foiled. In fairness to the Everton manager his double substitution sparked a much-needed reaction from the hosts. Oumar Niasse headed wide when Mason Holgate’s cross found the striker unmarked in front of goal and Everton belatedly exerted pressure on the United defence, but the game was put out of their reach by another supreme finish. Pogba, inevitably, was involved, playing Lingard into space on the left before wheeling away in celebration as the winger cut across a weak challenge by Michael Keane and curled an unstoppable finish into the top corner. “Boys jump or they don’t jump,” said Mourinho when asked of Lingard’s increasing influence. “It is one thing to be a talent and another to be a very good player. Some players are not capable of that jump, they go from great potential to normal player, but I think Jesse is making that jump.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2018/jan/01/crystal-palace-fear-losing-scott-dann-and-jason-puncheon-for-rest-of-season-injuries","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-02T23:47:14Z","webTitle":"Crystal Palace's Scott Dann and Jason Puncheon ruled out for rest of season","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jan/01/crystal-palace-fear-losing-scott-dann-and-jason-puncheon-for-rest-of-season-injuries","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/jan/01/crystal-palace-fear-losing-scott-dann-and-jason-puncheon-for-rest-of-season-injuries","fields":{"headline":"Crystal Palace's Scott Dann and Jason Puncheon ruled out for rest of season","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Roy Hodgson has confirmed that Crystal Palace’s captain and vice-captain, Jason Puncheon and Scott Dann, will be out for the remainder of the season. Hodgson revealed the news after the victory at Southampton, with both players suffering cruciate knee ligament damage in the goalless draw with Manchester City. Both players sustained their injuries while bringing down Kevin de Bruyne –they were each booked for their indiscretions – in Sunday’s stalemate. Dann, who has been in impressive form over recent weeks and had been Palace’s regular captain under Roy Hodgson with Puncheon out of the team, brought down the Belgian just after the quarter-hour mark on the edge of the home side’s penalty area and fell awkwardly with the Belgian’s weight on his right knee. Puncheon, a late substitute at Selhurst Park, had attempted to stop De Bruyne countering in the immediate aftermath of Luka Milivojevic’s missed penalty in stoppage time, with his crude challenge leaving both players on the turf. Puncheon and De Bruyne both departed on stretchers, but the Manchester City midfielder was able to return for the victory over Watford. Palace had intended to pursue a goalkeeper, midfielder and centre-forward – their England Under-21s forward, Connor Wickham, has not played since November 2016 after suffering his own cruciate knee ligament injury and remains some way off full fitness – during the mid-winter transfer window but may now reassess their strategy in the wake of the injuries, particularly at the back. Mamadou Sakho and Joel Ward are both absent at present recovering from calf injuries, leaving Martin Kelly and James Tomkins at centre-half for Tuesday’s game at Southampton, with the veteran Damien Delaney in reserve. The young Manchester United loanee, Timothy Fosu-Mensah, and the former Ajax utility player, Jairo Riedewald, could provide cover at centre-half if required. Puncheon, 31, is due to appear before Guildford Magistrates’ court on 5 January after being charged with a Section 4 public order offence – causing fear or provocation of violence, possession of an offensive weapon and common assault – after an alleged incident in Reigate, Surrey, in the small hours of 17 December."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"law/2018/jan/01/trumps-clown-fascism-and-the-us-constitution","type":"article","sectionId":"law","sectionName":"Law","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-01T17:28:20Z","webTitle":"Trump’s ‘clown fascism’ and the US constitution | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2018/jan/01/trumps-clown-fascism-and-the-us-constitution","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/law/2018/jan/01/trumps-clown-fascism-and-the-us-constitution","fields":{"headline":"Trump’s ‘clown fascism’ and the US constitution","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"For transatlantic admirers of Jonathan Freedland’s Bring Home the Revolution (1999), the shaking of Freedland’s regard for the American constitutional system is disappointing but understandable (The year of Trump has laid bare the US constitution’s serious flaws, 30 December). The first year in “Trumplandia” has been a disheartening, infuriating slog for most Americans; nevertheless, there is reason to hope that the constitutional mechanism will right itself and vindicate Freedland’s original estimate of it. Freedland correctly diagnoses Donald Trump’s disregard for constitutional norms and the feckless lack of principle of today’s Grand Old Party, yet these very patterns of behaviour have engendered a renaissance in the assertion of first amendment rights by the American public, especially the exercise of free speech and free assembly, and the operation of a free press. Activism by individuals and by myriad groups has flowered; the “resistance” to Trump is real. The American media also have shaken off their torpor. The New York Times, the Washington Post and the Guardian, among others, are exposing the epic malfeasance and cynicism of Republican rule. The investigation by the special counsel Robert S Mueller promises, moreover, to reveal the irregularities of the 2016 election and to cast in sharper relief the sordid impulses that animate Trump’s “clown fascism”. Removal of Trump through the impeachment process, as Freedland notes, seems improbable; however, the electoral eclipse of the GOP in 2018 and of Trump in 2020, and a return to normative political practice, remain real possibilities. Trump’s conduct is singularly atrocious but the American constitutional system has weathered graver challenges – a bloody civil war, McCarthyism – and emerged strengthened. While legislative and constitutional reinforcement of heretofore unwritten norms may be necessary in the longer term, the ballot box can still be a potent corrective in the shorter term. David Routt Richmond, Virginia, USA • Jonathan Freedland claims that it was a fatal oversight of the framers of the US constitution, James Madison and Alexander Hamilton in particular, not to “reckon on a partisanship so intense it would blind elected representatives to the national interest – so that they would, repeatedly, put party ahead of country”. Yet in Federalist paper 10, The Utility of the Union as a Safeguard Against Domestic Faction and Insurrection, written before the constitution was ratified, and laying out some of the thinking behind its creation, Madison writes of factions, defined as “a number of citizens, whether amounting to a majority or a minority of the whole, who are united and actuated by some common impulse of passion, or of interest, adverse to the rights of other citizens or to the permanent and aggregate interests of the community”. Putting party ahead of country, as Freedland frames it, fits this definition fairly well. Further, it becomes increasingly clear, on any plausible and full reading of Madison’s paper, that the framers were well aware of the ways in which a powerful and united faction could corrupt both the republican ideal and its political practice. James Garfield Doyle Southampton • Having long been held up as one of the great blueprints of democracy, the US constitution appears to be seriously – and centrally – flawed in allowing, indeed requiring, the president to nominate candidates for the supreme court. This, and the ensuing process of approval by the Senate, renders the appointment process inherently political. Montesquieu’s theory of the separation of powers between legislature, executive and judiciary – recognised as the essential tenet of democracy, the merging of any two of such powers paving the way to totalitarianism – appears to have been overlooked by the wise and enlightened members of Congress who drafted the constitution. The comparison with the process for appointments to the UK supreme court is stark, the selection here being an object lesson not only in choosing the best candidates but in depoliticised objectivity, those responsible for drafting the appointment rules being truly worthy of Montesquieu’s plaudits. Trump’s appointment of the arch-conservative Neil Gorsuch to the supreme court brought into sharp focus the role of the president and the extension of his powers into all three facets of government, the electing of a president with scant regard for the value of civil society or the rule of law thus being a cause of great alarm. Martin Allen Shoreham, West Sussex • One thing that would make a great difference in the US system of government would be a fair electoral system. Not one that excludes anyone without big money, not one where large parts of the country appear as totally dominated by one of the big parties, and where minorities are unrepresented or, in the case of gerrymandering, where majorities are underrepresented. If the single transferable vote were adopted, those who support gun control and other sane measures would be much freer to say so and the power of malignant bodies such as the NRA diminished. Kevin Chaffey Enniskillen, Co Fermanagh • Jonathan Freedland says that “the US has an unwritten constitution that – just like ours – relies on the self-restraint of the key political players”. In the UK we have at least one very striking parallel. Before Margaret Thatcher’s time, certainly from the end of the second world war onwards, that self-restraint was generally practised and we experienced a relatively pluralist approach to governance. Thatcher and her people recognised that constitutionally the centre was in charge and that the self-restraint previously practised would only prevent them from reaching their objectives. In this sense Thatcher was a populist too, not entirely dissimilar from Trump, and we are still suffering from her legacy four decades later.

That doesn’t mean you know my son, Family, 30 December). However, despite the common feelings around having our verbal and non-verbal autistic kids, I feel that actually 2017 provided plenty of great autism-inspired TV. I gorged on Atypical on Netflix, was intrigued by Chris Packham’s Asperger’s and Me, consumed another series of The A Word and concurred with The Good Doctor. Even better, autistic characters entered kids’ TV too. Our non-verbal son connected with the first CBeebies autistic animated character, Pablo. And hot on the heels of Sesame Street’s first autistic Muppet came the Power Rangers movie, in which the Blue Ranger was autistic. But while I was keen to point out to our eldest son, Anthony, that this Ranger shared some of his difficulties, Anthony did the opposite. He said he was like the Blue Ranger because he was brave, strong, wanted to protect people and (most of all) was the best he could be by being himself, autism and all. Yes, these programmes describe different (autistic) stereotypes, but most characters anywhere else do too. Each glimpse of autism that TV provides is one less explanation I have to give. So well done to them, and to Anthony too. He saw far more than autism in the Blue Ranger, and maybe that’s the whole point. Ann Hickman London • Samantha Ellis’s piece on the problems she has with Little Women was excellent (Review, 23 December), but equally troubling is why the BBC chose to give us a dramatisation of an American children’s classic when so many great British children’s authors have written novels that cry out to be adapted for film and TV. Joan Aiken’s Dido Twite series, Eva Ibbotson’s Journey to the River Sea and Lucy M Boston’s Green Knowe novels all spring to mind as superior works whose popularity has stood the test of time. There are also numerous living British authors (besides JK Rowling and Philip Pullman) whose work would give delight. Children’s fiction is one of the cultural glories of this country, and in a time of library cuts desperately needs support. I fear that the motivation behind yet another version of Little Women is for the BBC to sell it back to an American audience, rather than serving and promoting our own British one.

Homes in Cheltenham, a former spa town on the edge of the Cotswolds, jumped by 13% during the year, up £36,033 to £313,150, nearly five times the average UK increase of 2.7%. The UK housing market has slowed considerably compared with last year, when the national average growth rate was 7.5%. Now forecasters are predicting increases could slow to a halt in 2018 amid uncertainty over Brexit. While 15 of the fastest 20 risers were recorded in London and the south-east, towns in Wales, Yorkshire and the East Midlands also made the top 20, unlike last year when the list was dominated by the capital and southern England. The seaside towns of Bournemouth and Brighton were in second and third place respectively, both experiencing price rises of more than 11%. Huddersfield in Yorkshire also made the top 10 with growth of 9.3%, while Swansea saw the biggest jump of any area in Wales, up 7.7% to £164,895. The largest increase in cash terms was felt in the London borough of Richmond upon Thames, where a 7.6% rise in house prices saw the average home rise by £45,463 to hit £646,112. The average in Richmond is now more than three times the price of a home in Perth the area that saw the largest fall in prices. According to Halifax, which based its data on successful mortgage applications in 119 towns and 24 London local authorities, homes in Perth declined in value by 5.3%, or £10,125 in cash terms, to an average of £190,813. That puts Perth at the top of a list of just 13 towns or city boroughs where house prices fell in 2017, eight of them in either Scotland or Yorkshire and the Humber. “Generally speaking, property prices in these areas have been constrained by lower employment levels or relatively weaker economic conditions when compared to those areas that have seen house price growth,” said Russell Galley, managing director of Halifax. Stoke-on-Trent saw the second biggest fall, down 4% to an average of £152,340, with Paisley in Scotland in third place, after a 3.6% fall to £123,665. Other towns where house prices fell include Wakefield, Rotherham and Barnsley in Yorkshire, as well as Dunfermline and Aberdeen in Scotland. While the vast majority of towns saw an increase in 2017, housing market commentators have predicted the steady increases seen in recent years could grind to a halt in 2018, particularly in London and the south-east, citing the twin spectres of Brexit and rising interest rates. Of the two big lenders that operate closely watched price indices, Nationwide has said it expects property values to be “broadly flat in 2018, with perhaps a marginal gain of around 1%”. Halifax allowed itself some room for manoeuvre by predicting UK growth in the range of 0% to 3%. However, the prognosis for London – which according to the estate agent Savills has recorded house price growth of 70% over the past decade – is more downbeat, with many economists forecasting that prices in the capital will slide into negative territory. According to a Reuters poll of 28 housing market specialists published last month, property prices will rise by 1.3% nationally, but fall by 0.3% in London. The former figure is less than half the current rate of consumer price inflation. Forecasters have pointed to economic and political uncertainty leading up to the UK’s exit from the European Union in 2019, as well as the rising cost of mortgages if the Bank of England raises the base rate again, having increased it for the first time in a decade from 0.25% to 0.5% in November. Such predictions are likely to be welcomed by the burgeoning numbers of aspiring first-time buyers who currently cannot afford to join the housing ladder. However, shortages of homes for sale and continued low levels of housebuilding are likely to support prices, while last month’s abolition of stamp duty for all homes up to £300,000 bought by first-time buyers could provide a boost to those looking to get on the ladder – provided it does not push up property values."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"football/2018/jan/01/west-brom-official-complaint-premier-league-fixture-schedule","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-01T22:30:10Z","webTitle":"West Brom make official complaint to Premier League over fixture schedule","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jan/01/west-brom-official-complaint-premier-league-fixture-schedule","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/jan/01/west-brom-official-complaint-premier-league-fixture-schedule","fields":{"headline":"West Brom make official complaint to Premier League over fixture schedule","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"West Bromwich Albion have made an official complaint to the Premier League about the fixture scheduling that gives West Ham United five days’ extra rest before Tuesday’s meeting between the two clubs and also submitted medical evidence to support their case that playing twice in the space of 48 hours severely increases the risk of players picking up injuries. It is a measure of how strongly Albion feel about the matter that on top of putting their grievances in writing on more than one occasion, John Williams, the club’s chairman, contacted Richard Scudamore, the executive chairman of the Premier League, to let it be known just how unhappy they are with the way the fixture list has been organised over the festive period. It is understood that Albion wanted the West Ham game postponed and rescheduled. Although plenty of managers have complained about the Premier League staggering so many matches across different days during the festive period, giving some clubs more time to prepare than others, Albion have a particularly strong argument when it comes to their fixture at the Olympic Stadium. West Ham have not played since Boxing Day because their game against Tottenham Hotspur, which was originally scheduled for New Year’s Eve, had to be moved to 4 January because of safety concerns. Albion, in contrast, hosted Arsenal on Sunday, putting them at a distinct disadvantage for a crucial relegation battle. Alan Pardew described the scheduling as “terrible” and the Albion manager added: “We all know there’s pressure on TV companies for ratings and everything else and games – I understand that. But the league’s got to be stronger and say two days is not right.” Pardew went on to say the club had made “strong” representations to the Premier League about the fixture list and insisted he would be forced into changes for the West Ham match. “Of course I am. There’s some players who won’t be able to cope with that [two games in 48 hours],” he said. “I’d be putting them at risk.” It appears that the Premier League have ended up upsetting just about everyone with the fixture schedule, with West Ham also far from impressed that they have to play Spurs only 48 hours after facing Albion. With that in mind, David Moyes warned the combination of relegation fears and a draining run of fixtures this week will damage their chances of winning their FA Cup tie at Shrewsbury Town on Sunday. West Ham dropped back into the bottom three thanks to Bournemouth’s victory against Everton on Saturday and Moyes said the fixture overload could have a negative impact on their third-round tie against Shrewsbury, who are second in League One. Moyes is unhappy with the balance and depth of his squad – the manager is desperate for reinforcements in defence and midfield this month – and his decision to play a weakened side in last month’s Carabao Cup quarter-final defeat by Arsenal demonstrated that he will not compromise West Ham’s survival hopes. He said: “It is going to have a big damage on the FA Cup for us, to have two games in three days and then have to play another three days later in the FA Cup. That’s where it’s taking its toll and the Premier League is eating into dates where the Cup games might be getting used. “I can imagine the questions when we get there [Shrewsbury] and I’m going to be coming in with my tongue hanging out, and the players as well. That will be difficult and we will be needing to use the group. Do I want to win the FA Cup? 100%. But I don’t think it can be where we can damage our league form.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2018/jan/02/football-transfer-rumours-manchester-united-faouzi-ghoulam-53m-chelsea-arturo-vidal","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-02T08:41:07Z","webTitle":"Football transfer rumours: Manchester United to buy Faouzi Ghoulam for £53m?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jan/02/football-transfer-rumours-manchester-united-faouzi-ghoulam-53m-chelsea-arturo-vidal","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/jan/02/football-transfer-rumours-manchester-united-faouzi-ghoulam-53m-chelsea-arturo-vidal","fields":{"headline":"Football transfer rumours: Manchester United to buy Faouzi Ghoulam for £53m?","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Having spent much of December harping on about not having enough money to spend, and how much he dislikes the January transfer window anyway, José Mourinho will use the January transfer window to spend a load of money. First on his shopping list is Antoine Griezman, who he’ll offer £300,000-a-week to in order to convince him that relentlessly tracking back at Old Trafford will be more rewarding than relentlessly banging in goals for Barcelona, who have also been sniffing about. Following his swipe at Pep Guardiola for spending “striker money” on full backs, Mourinho will offer Napoli £53m for left-back Faouzi Ghoulam (allowing them to buy Benfica’s Alejandro Grimaldo in his place) before commissioning a brass statue of his own neck to replace the one of Fergie outside the ground. Next on the Manchester United list is PSG’s Lucas Moura, who they have apparently “opened talks over”, before a £50m bid for Barcelona defender Samuel Umtiti. Antonio Conte is well aware of Chelsea’s (not terribly successful) attempts to promote players from their garlanded academy, and a policy of buying young players with a long future. So fair play to him for sticking two fingers up to that and upping his interest in Bayern’s 30-year-old midfielder Arturo Vidal and Juve’s 33-year-old Giorgio Chiellini. The latter, however, has been hinting that he’s likely to stay in Turin anyway. Besiktas have noted Everton’s interest in Cenk Tosun, have spotted the pictures the striker has posted of himself gadding about in London, and added another £2m to his price tag – taking it to £27m – just because they can. Sam Allardyce is not for being pushed around, however, so may simply sign Steven N’Zonzi from Sevilla instead. Brighton (and Hove Albion actually) have taken the sensible step of asking Moussa Dembélé if he is actually interested in signing for them before they dig out the fax machine, fire it up and ping off an offer to Celtic for him. But they’ll be perfectly happy to let Jamie Murphy head to Rangers given he’s been free to spend more time mooching about The Lanes than playing on the Amex pitch this season. In more Scottish news, Celtic and West Ham are girding their loins for a Benny Hill-style chase for Hibs’s 23-year-old midfielder John McGinn. West Ham have other business to attend to as well – chiefly flogging Diafra Sakho for as close to £20m as they can, and then persuading Swansea’s Alfie Mawson and Ki Sung-yeung to ditch one listing ship for another. Kortney Hause is working out which of the coy sideways glances he’s been getting from both Huddersfield and Watford are the most significant after getting limited playing time at Wolves. It may well turn out to be Watford, given Huddersfield manager David Wagner has also been giving the glad eye to Monaco defender Terence Kongolo, drooling: “We like him”. And Philippe Coutinho, Nike, Barcelona, Zzzzzzzz."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/jan/03/is-melbourne-in-the-grip-of-african-gangs-the-facts-behind-the-lurid-headlines","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-02T18:00:23Z","webTitle":"Is Melbourne in the grip of African crime gangs?

The facts behind the lurid headlines","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Victoria is having a debate about gangs. Specifically, it is debating whether it is appropriate to call groups of young people who are predominantly from African backgrounds a “gang” and, so named, what should be done about it. It’s also having a debate about race, which is being waged in the comment sections of front-page articles on gang violence, and on social media, where comments like “stop immigration until this mess is sorted” populate Victoria police’s official Facebook page. Both debates are linked to a perceived increase in large-scale violent offences committed by young people of African appearance, most of whom have been linked to Melbourne’s Sudanese migrant community. Media coverage of the issue, led by the News Corp tabloid the Herald Sun, has dubbed Victoria “a state of fear” and reported that it could undermine the incumbent Labor government’s chances in the November state election. On Monday the prime minister weighed in, saying at a press conference in Sydney that “growing gang violence and lawlessness in Victoria” was “a failure of the Andrews government”. However, police say that crime from African “street gangs” is an ongoing, not growing, problem, and also that calling these groups “gangs” might be overstating the issue. So, what’s really happening? Concern about crime gangs involving African youths in Melbourne can be traced to the outer eastern suburb of Dandenong in the mid-2000s. The most recent iteration has its origins in the Moomba festival in March 2016, when a group identified as the Apex gang was named the key culprit in a violent brawl that saw 53 people arrested and 800 people searched for weapons. It flared up again last month following three significant incidents: a brawl at the St Kilda McDonald’s on 13 December; the trashing of an Airbnb property after a wild party in Werribee on 18 December; and the assault of a police officer who was kicked and surrounded by a group of young people when questioning a suspected shoplifter at Highpoint shopping centre on Boxing Day. All three involved youths of African appearance and the Werribee house was tagged with “MTS”, a reference to “Menace to Society”, a loosely collected group of Sudanese and other teenagers that has been linked to a number of public order offences over the past six months. It has been described as a successor to the Apex gang. But, like the Apex gang, it doesn’t quite exist. It’s a graffiti tag, a call sign, a unifying symbol, an anti-social brand. But there’s no structure. That, the deputy police commissioner, Shane Patton says, is why police say it’s not a gang. In a press conference on Tuesday designed to reassure the public that police are taking the issue of youth crime seriously despite their earlier attempts to de-escalate sensationalist media coverage, Patton said police reluctance to label Menace to Society and other groups “gangs” was an issue of nomenclature. What makes a gang? Patton’s preferred term is “networked criminal offenders”. which is harder to work into a headline. A “gang,” he says, is something like an organised motorcycle gang. That’s the kind of body groups such as the gang crime unit were established to target. “From a Victoria police perspective we have been consistent all the way along that what we traditionally view as organised crime gangs are those high-level organised crime gangs,” he told reporters. “We don’t shy away from calling people gangs, it’s not an issue for us. “It’s about the offending … Let’s not elevate them to a status they should not be elevated to.” Patton’s comments followed an interview by fellow deputy commissioner Andrew Crisp last week, who urged the media not to label groups of “young thugs” as “gangs”, saying: “I don’t accept for one minute that we do have gangs.” He added: “I urge you [the media] not to play up to the ego of these young people by calling them a gang, because they’re not a gang.” Patton on Monday attempted to both maintain that argument and say that police did not shy away from the use of the term, saying: “They’re behaving like street gangs, so let’s call them that. That’s what they are.” Anthony Kelly, the executive officer of Flemington and Kensington Community Legal Centre, which covers areas with a significant migrant population, said calling these groups “gangs” was “ludicrous”. But he said that does not discount the fact that there is a problem of crime in African migrant communities, or discount the seriousness of those crimes. “It’s not at all helpful to telegraph this sort of juvenile male posturing and put it into a frame of terrorising the community and equating it with organised criminal activity,” he told Guardian Australia. “We saw that very clearly with the Apex gang. Young kids would scrawl ‘Apex’ on a car that they vandalised and then it becomes linked to the broader narrative when really it’s just young kids. There’s no membership. It’s just kids scrawling tags.” A South Sudanese youth worker, Nelly Yoa, disagrees. Writing in Fairfax Media, Yoa said he was “furious” to hear Crisp say there were no Sudanese gangs in Melbourne. “Nobody should ever try and cover up or defend this unacceptable behaviour – to do so is immoral and inexplicable,” he said. “It is upsetting and completely false.” Yoa, who was the victim of a machete attack in 2011, said that South Sudanese youths were over-represented in Victorian crime statistics and that the behaviour of some teenagers in recent weeks “made me ashamed and embarrassed to call myself a Sudanese”. What do the statistics say? Reading the crime statistics is difficult because there are a number of factors at play. On the face of it, Sudanese immigrants are over-represented in the crime statistics. About 1% of alleged criminal offenders in Victoria in the year ending September 2017 were Sudanese-born, the Victorian Crime Statistics Agency (CSA) says, while the Sudanese and South Sudanese communities together make up just 0.14% of the state’s total population. The majority of crimes in Victoria, unsurprisingly, are committed by people born in Australia. The second-highest cohort were New Zealanders, which are the fourth-largest migrant group in Victoria. However, by pulling out particular offences you can highlight certain groups. For example, in charges of riot and affray, people born in Sudan made up 6% of all recorded offenders, compared with 71.5% born in Australia and 5.2% born in New Zealand, a federal parliamentary inquiry reported, citing CSA statistics. Prepare to see these statistics manipulated in many ways, by both sides of politics, as the state election draws closer. The contributions of federal ministers, including the prime minister, in this debate are also likely to increase; Matthew Guy’s Liberal opposition in Victoria is building its case for election on law and order issues. Kelly said the fact that the Sudanese community has a much younger average age and a higher incidence of other factors that are associated with a high crime rate, such as poverty and a lack of engagement in work and school, meant that those figures should be treated with caution. “The over-representation is a misconception and a misconstruction,” he said. The overall crime rate in Victoria fell in 2017, according to the most recent CSA release. There were 391,153 recorded criminal incidents in the 12 months to September 2017, coming down from a peak in 2016. That’s a decrease of 4.8% over the past 12 months but an increase of 16.3% over the past five years. The proportion of crimes committed by young people – defined by CSA as people aged under 25 – has fallen in the past decade from 52% of all recorded offences in 2007-2008 to 40% in 2015-2016. However, the proportion of young people charged with three or more offences has grown from 17% to 22% in the same period. ‘A racialised moral panic’ Public commentary on African youth crime gangs is dependent not on statistics but on high-profile incidents, of which there have been many. But it is to some extent a self-fulfilling prophecy – incidents that can be linked to gang activity garner greater media attention, which feeds into the broader public narrative. That narrative is underpinned by race, Kelly says. And while he says it’s possible to have a debate about different ethnic groups without sliding into racism, in this case, in many areas, the debate has become “clearly racist.” “That to me is a far more dangerous issue,” he said. “When it becomes a racialised moral panic, then we start to see the things that lead toward Cronulla over 10 years ago. That was instigated by the a very similar array of panics.” Kelly said the racialised media commentary around African youth crime, combined with social media commentary and the overarching political debate, created “all the conditions for a race riot to occur.” Comments on Melbourne law and order Facebook groups such as Protect Victoria are similar to those seen in Kalgoorlie before the death of teenager Elijah Doughty in 2016. Even comments on Victoria police’s official Facebook page, beneath a livestream of Patton’s press conference on Tuesday, called for racist violence. “Stop running and start shooting,” suggested one. “Do your job send the charcoal children back to Africa,” said another. One warned police not to “start sooking up when people take matters into their own hands to protect their own!” while another said “vigilante gangs will happen to take back our communities”. Many recommended the police use their power to request a visa cancellation for a person involved in a crime punishable by more than 12 months in prison, which was instituted by the Abbott government in 2014, to send all alleged gang members, and their families, “back where they came from”. “Stop immigration until this mess is sorted,” one said. Twelve people, from Sudan, New Zealand and other countries, were recommended for deportation under those laws in Victoria in 2017. African migrants are an easily identified, and targeted, group. A 2015 report on racial bias in Victoria police by Daniel Haile Michael and Maki Issa, who won a landmark racial profiling case against Victoria police, found that young people from countries such as South Sudan and Somalia were routinely stopped by police. “A young African person who has committed no crime, who has done no wrong, is far more likely to be targeted and threatened and seen like a criminal by police and by shopkeepers,” Kelly said. It is similar to experiences of over-policing and targeted policing reported by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. Victoria police has since introduced policies against racial profiling and its senior leadership has been careful to steer away from racist rhetoric. Patton, while saying there was an issue of African youth offending, said that young people of all nationalities and ethnicities committed criminal offences, and that the majority of Melbourne’s African migrant population was law-abiding. “Let’s not say that all of the African community are criminals because they are not. The vast majority are good people,” he said. “This is a small group of youths. We will target them. We will hold them to account.” This story was amended on 5 January 2018 to correct the percentage of Sudanese- and South Sudanese-born people in Victoria. It was further amended on 22 January 2018 to reflect a correction to the percentage of Sudanese-born alleged offenders published by the Victorian Crime Statstics Authority."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/filmblog/2018/jan/03/the-post-hollywood-journalism-steven-spielberg","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-03T06:00:08Z","webTitle":"Breaking news: why does Hollywood gloss over the world of magazine journalism?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2018/jan/03/the-post-hollywood-journalism-steven-spielberg","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/filmblog/2018/jan/03/the-post-hollywood-journalism-steven-spielberg","fields":{"headline":"Breaking news: why does Hollywood gloss over the world of magazine journalism?","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"As a magazine journalist, it’s hard to escape the feeling that people consider feature-writing a lesser art than hard news. You only need to look at the comments section below any lifestyle article (be it on travel, fashion, beauty or family) for confirmation (“How is this news?”) And it seems that film-makers tend to feel the same. Steven Spielberg’s The Post is the latest in a long line of heavyweight films that pay homage to the noble art of news reporting. The BFI compiled a list of 10 great films about journalism that encompasses news writers, TV anchors and even a crash-site photographer – but no magazines, unless you count La Dolce Vita’s celebrity gossip. In general, films about magazine journalists tend to be relegated to the chick-flick spike pile. Take The Devil Wears Prada. A woman accidentally falls into a job at Vogue (I mean, we’ve all been there, right?) despite a clear disdain for fashion and anyone who cares about it. She’s scornful, sloppy and just, well, Anne Hathaway-ey. Eventually the title corrupts her, and she replaces her boyfriend and friends with Dolce &amp; Gabbana chain-belts and a 10lb weight loss. Then there’s Kate Hudson in How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days. The plot hinges on her job as a magazine writer – she longs, poor dear, to write about politics and war. It’s like whining because you want the pet shop where you work to be a hedge fund. Instead of handing in her notice and finding a job on a news team, she strikes an unlikely deal: if she writes one more agonising article about dating (not hiding her contempt from her editor) she’ll finally be allowed to write about what matters. While news writers in films aren’t always likable, at least there’s a spectrum, running from screwball joker to heroic investigator to peddler of false headlines. Magazines tend to simply be a symbol of all that is shallow and shameful. And it’s hard not to feel there’s a gender bias, with women in vapid magazine roles and men taking the positions of power in papers. In reality, there’s far more crossover: celebrity gossip is often reported as news, while it was a magazine – the New Yorker – that played a major role in outing Harvey Weinstein. There are other films that nod to the wider world of feature journalism – Almost Famous, The Secret Life of Walter Mitty, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas – but it’s rare to see someone working in a magazine office. When you consider how the industry is struggling, with big brands closing and sales figures on the wane, you’d think it would be rife with stories. There have been interesting documentaries about magazine journalism, most notably The September Issue. Filmed at American Vogue it contained all the usual tropes seen in chick flicks (bitchy editor, ridiculous scrutiny of models) but was also able to turn up a gem, in the form of Grace Coddington, the charmingly dishevelled creative director who was shown standing up to editor Anna Wintour and designing some truly beautiful photoshoots. The truth is that magazine journalism is not a career you fall into. If you don’t want to do it, Meryl Streep won’t insist you accompany her to Paris fashion week. There’s no job security, little money, even less glamour and most of what you do will be ripped apart by the “not-news” people (despite them having chosen to read it). To imply that everyone in the industry got there by accident and/or is desperate to leave as soon as possible to become a war reporter is insulting as well as unimaginative. Of course, it’s not cinema’s job to make magazine writing seem a nuanced career. Films aren’t designed to be an accurate reflection of life – that’s the job of journalism – but it would be refreshing to see a drama in which magazines mean more than a token job for women. You could guarantee a good write-up."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"sport/live/2018/jan/01/rob-cross-v-phil-taylor-pdc-world-darts-championship-final-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-01T22:19:20Z","webTitle":"Rob Cross beats Phil Taylor 7-2 to win PDC World Darts Championship – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2018/jan/01/rob-cross-v-phil-taylor-pdc-world-darts-championship-final-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/live/2018/jan/01/rob-cross-v-phil-taylor-pdc-world-darts-championship-final-live","fields":{"headline":"Rob Cross beats Phil Taylor 7-2 to win PDC World Darts Championship – as it happened","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Phil Taylor walks off the stage for the final time to the soundtrack of Coldplay’s Viva la Vida – a song, as the band put it, about “a king who has lost his kingdom”. Meanwhile Rob Cross, a Sussex pub player the last time Taylor won this title and a virtual unknown even a year ago, is the new leader of the darting world. That he took the crown in such ruthless, relentless fashion only adds to the seismic nature of the night. The Power is out, and Rob ‘Voltage’ Cross is king. That’s all from me; thanks for reading and emailing. Goodnight. A final word from Rob Cross. “It was a dream to play Phil in the final. You won’t see another sportsman like him.” Or will we? Phil Taylor speaks, barely audible over the crowd: “Rob was relentless, like I was 25 years ago. He’s a lot like myself, he’s dedicated. The players have got a big problem now. It’s not about the money for him, it’s about the winning, he’s like me in that way.” “The way he started, I thought I would lose 7-0. I tried to push him, make him think, but it didn’t happen. It was an old man and a young man, and it was a mismatch really.” Rob Cross speaks: “I’ve won my first world title, but tonight is all about Phil Taylor. Everything he’s done for the game, I hope he enjoys his retirement.” Taylor has written ‘Thank you. Thank you. Loved it’ on a piece of paper. What an odd moment this is. Phil Taylor receives his runner-up prize and is given a long, hearty send-off by the crowd. Now it’s Rob Cross’s moment, as he receives the trophy. He lets Taylor lift it up too, which is a very nice gesture. I don’t think Van Gerwen would have done that. A strange moment after Cross sealed this most incredible victory, as the debutant made sure to let the departing Taylor have his moment. We’ll hear from both players shortly. Treble 18. Hit. A second treble 18. Hit. Double 16 for the title. He’s taken it. Phil Taylor has been thrashed. Absolutely incredible. Rob Cross is throwing for the title – but his first throw is poor, and Taylor rattles in a maximum! He’s not done yet, but Cross rallies brilliantly with three, count ‘em, treble 18s. He’s on a 140 finish, Taylor waiting on 50... Ninth set: Cross 2-0 Taylor (Cross leads 6-2 in sets) Taylor’s attempted mind games have only distracted himself – he quickly falls behind on his own throw, and Cross is closing in. He misses two darts at double 16, but Taylor is adrift on 204 – but a 180 puts the pressure on. Big moment now – and he takes it on his first dart. I think that’s game over. Ninth set: Cross 1-0 Taylor (Cross leads 6-2 in sets and throws first) Is it time for the former electrician to put The Power out? He starts strong with 134, but Taylor sticks with him. Cross has 135 to finish, and after hitting treble five, tidies up to leave tops. Taylor loses ground, and Cross takes it in one. Taylor may have wound Rob Cross up with the latest bout of chat; he looked a little miffed as he headed off the stage. He’ll now have a chance on his own throw; if he doesn’t take it, things might get interesting. Taylor is serenaded by the crowd after that break – can he close out the set? Cross is first to a finish and Taylor’s inconsistency is hurting him again. Cross is a long way off bullseye, and Taylor is chatting to him again. Cross has three darts at 30, splits and misses double six. Taylor takes out double 16, and wins the set. Eighth set: Cross 0-2 Taylor (Cross leads 6-1 in sets) Is Cross starting to see the finish line? A Taylor maximum puts him under pressure on his own throw, but Cross digs himself out with a 140. Taylor will have a shot at 63 – and takes double 16 with his last dart! Eighth set: Cross 0-1 Taylor (Cross leads 6-1 in sets, Taylor throws first) This is the Brazil 1-7 Germany of darts. If Germany had never qualified before. Taylor has 141 to hold throw but can’t take it – and Cross misses double four! Taylor holds, but it’s a long way back. “Evening Niall, and Happy New Year to you, says Simon McMahon. “Great to see the Guardian giving the darts its rightful place with a LBL on New Years Day. Feels like a changing of the guard tonight. Cross is like a young Phil Taylor. As the legendary Sid Waddell once said of the equally legendary Jocky Wilson – what an athlete.” Speaking of Wilson, I recently watched a Bullseye where he took on the Bronze Bully challenge with a lit snout on the go. They don’t make them like Jocky any more. Savage darts is right. Phil Taylor’s reputation alone has taken care of many of his opponents, and an entire generation of darts talent was suffocated by the Power at his best. Rob Cross, who was watching the tournament at home last year, has come here for Taylor’s final match, and is wiping the floor with him. A chance for Cross to twist the knife, as he hits 140 on Taylor’s throw. The Power is starting to look defeated but takes out 180 to leave 161. He misses bull – it’s not exactly bad, is it? – but Cross is lurking on 93. He takes it. In two darts. Is he human? Seventh set: Cross 2-1 Taylor (Cross leads 5-1 in sets) A scrappy start to this leg, but Cross’ 66th maximum of the tournament (he’s five off the all-time record) edges him ahead. Taylor carelessly leaves 169, allowing Cross to set up double 16. This time he misses the first dart, but not the second. Nerveless. Seventh set: Cross 1-1 Taylor (Cross leads 5-1 in sets) Taylor races away on his own throw and has some breathing space to take out double top. He gets it, and gives the crowd an intentionally over-the-top celebration. Just a bit of fun? No chance. Seventh set: Cross 1-0 Taylor (Cross leads 5-1 in sets and throws first) Cross could go to the next break in play just one set away. He cleans up this opening leg with embarrassing ease. What is going on here? Big test for Cross here – it’ll either be 5-1, or Taylor will have a chance to make it 4-2. Taylor can’t put pressure on, loose darts costing him, and Cross has six darts from 179. He gets down to 84, and Taylor leaves 58. Pressure? What pressure? Cross takes it with two darts. He’s hit 70% of his doubles, and it feels like more. Sixth set: Cross 2-1 Taylor (Cross leads 4-1 in sets) A very tidy 123 checkout from Taylor, with Cross easing off the gas momentarily. The newcomer will throw for a 5-1 lead, though. Sixth set: Cross 2-0 Taylor (Cross leads 4-1 in sets) If he can keep this up, this will be a performance for the record books from Cross – another maximum and Taylor, averaging 102, cannot get near him. Cross takes out tops, and Taylor’s 110 benchmark from 2009 is within reach. Sixth set: Cross 1-0 Taylor (Cross leads 4-1 in sets, Taylor to throw first) This is a big old set – if Cross can claim it, he’d be two from home, and on his own throw. Another 180 puts him ahead – he’s averaging 109+ now – and checks out in 11 darts. Easy! After that missed shot at a nine-darter, Cross offered Taylor some consoling words. Taylor appeared to use the moment to try and psyche his opponent out again. It’s all a little unseemly on his big night. Cross has a shot at bull for the set, but hits 25 – and Taylor has to take out 153. Treble 20, treble 19... but double 18 is missed, and Cross moves three sets clear. Fifth set: Cross 2-0 Taylor (Cross leads 3-1 in sets) That moment would have swung the momentum entirely in Taylor’s favour – a nine-darter in his last match! – but the way Cross bounced back was telling. He’s just as ruthless here, nailing a double 16 to break Taylor again! Fifth set: Cross 1-0 Taylor (Cross leads 3-1 in sets and throws first) Destiny was calling there, as Taylor struck eight perfect darts in a row. He’s never hit a nine-darter at the Ally Pally... and misses double 12 by a hair’s breadth. He has three darts to check out, but is all over the place - and Cross punishes him! What a big moment that might be... “These high checkouts are fabulous from Cross,” says Adam Hirst. “Big numbers hit so cleanly every time, never looks in doubt. Like watching Harry Kane go through one-on-one. 20s, 19s, 18s, lovely stuff.” It was notable in the semi-finals how many times Cross rescued a poor start with a treble on his final dart. It kept him in the game at crucial moments. Rod Studd has been bringing up the parallels with Taylor’s first world title, when he thrashed his mentor, Eric Bristow in 1990. “Blond streaks and moustaches were in fashion back then,” Studd adds. He’s clearly not been to Dalston lately. Fourth set: Cross 0-3 Taylor That break was another boost for Taylor, but this set started on his throw, so Cross need not worry unduly. Taylor takes out 80 in two darts to cut the gap. Fourth set: Cross 0-2 Taylor (Cross leads 3-0 in sets) That big checkout has put a spring back in Taylor’s step, and he edges ahead on Cross’s throw. The challenger is half an inch away from taking out 102, but leaves a chance for Taylor – and he breaks! Fourth set: Cross 0-1 Taylor (Cross leads 3-0 in sets, Taylor throws first) Taylor is in danger of losing his throw again as Cross races to leave double 14. He has to take out 151 the way Cross is finishing – and does! The crowd erupts. Maybe Taylor isn’t finished after all... Third set: Cross 3-0 Taylor Taylor digs out a chance on Cross’s throw, but makes a meal of it from 150, and Cross takes out 153! Oh my word – he is trouncing Phil Taylor here. Third set: Cross 2-0 Taylor (Cross leads 2-0 in sets) Taylor’s decision to put Cross in first hasn’t worked; he looks the more nervous of the two, and Cross bangs in another maximum on Taylor’s throw. Four more treble 20s and he’s pulling away – on 52 with Taylor on 233. He takes it out in two darts. Taylor tries to give Cross the eyes afterwards, and is sensibly ignored. Third set: Cross 1-0 Taylor (Cross leads 2-0 in sets and throws first) The debutant has dominated the first two sets, and has a chance to go 3-0 up here. He’s averaging 107-plus, with Taylor a shade under a ton. Double 18, first dart, no problem. Oof! Where’s the love, guys? The Deller option is looking the more likely scenario in these early stages. Long way to go though... Second set: Cross 3-1 Taylor Cross starts with a 60 but recovers well with Taylor below his best. A 140 puts him on a 167 finish, but Taylor applies the pressure with a maximum. Never mind – Cross takes out the 167! If he keeps this up, even The Power won’t be able to stop him. 2nd set: Cross 2-1 Taylor (Cross leads 1-0 in sets) Taylor could use a straightforward hold to stop Cross’s momentum, and a 180 sets him on his way. He leaves tops with Cross not on a finish. Job done, but Cross will throw for a two-set lead. 2nd set: Cross 2-0 Taylor (Cross leads 1-0 in sets) Cross gets back to business on his own throw, not letting Taylor get a sniff at a double as he finishes on double two with the last dart in hand. What a start! That awkward moment involved Cross knocking something off the table accidentally, and the crowd’s cheers disrupting Taylor’s rhythm. He apologised and Taylor seemed fine about it, but Taylor is sometimes, y’know, not fine about things like that. 2nd set: Cross 1-0 Taylor (Cross leads 1-0 in sets, Taylor throws first) Mixed start for Taylor, who starts with a 177 and follows it up with a 67. Cross hits a maximum to pile pressure on Taylor, who’s on 132. A curious moment distracts Taylor and Cross, who misses two shots at double 16. Taylor can’t punish him, and Cross doesn’t miss again. “One thing’s for sure, if Phil Taylor wins, no matter who he name-drops in his victory speech, it won’t be as excruciating as this one” says Adam Hirst. 1st set: Cross 3-1 Taylor It’s Taylor’s turn to start a leg with a maximum, and he’s millimetres away from taking out 147. Cross is a long way back, but puts pressure on with his next throw and Taylor makes a hash of double 18. Cross has a shot at double 16 for the set... and takes it! 1st set: Cross 2-1 Taylor Two 180s in this leg for Cross – he’s on 57 for the tournament – and double 10 seals a 12-dart leg. Composed start. 1st set: Cross 1-1 Taylor The Power edges ahead to give himself six darts from 186, and after Cross sees two straight darts bounce out, he nails double 16. One 14-dart leg apiece. 1st set: Cross 1-0 Taylor (Cross throws first) The crowd absolutely bellow their appreciation to Phil Taylor. Walking in a Taylor wonderland, indeed. Cross just has to focus on his game, and a ton-140 start does the job. He’s down to a finish in nine darts, and takes out double 18 with Taylor nowhere near. Here we go, then. The legend against the debutant, Voltage v The Power, and the atmosphere is electric... One more time, with feeling... Ladies and gentlemen... Here we go, then. John McDonald introduces Rob Cross first, whose walk-on music is, er, ‘Hot Hot Hot’. Surely it should be this: Walk-ons coming any minute now, so here’s 90 seconds of Wayne Mardle, unaware he’s on live TV: Taylor has won the pre-match bull, but given the first throw to his opponent. Classic mind games from the Power. The build-up has been all about Taylor, and fair enough really, but what of Rob Cross? He was born in 1990, six months after Taylor’s first world title, and in darting terms, that was about it until last year, when a run of impressive results earned him his first PDC Tour card. He earned his first £250 as a pro in February, then picked up two Players’ Championship titles and reached the European Championship final in October, losing 11-7 to Van Gerwen. Suddenly, he has become one of the sport’s rising stars, but this fortnight, he’s taken things to another level. Your first prediction is in: Predictions? The bookies have it almost too close to call, with Taylor the narrow favourite. I’m not prepared to bet against Taylor, tonight of all nights. Taylor 7-5 Cross. The Power There are plenty out there who think the emerging Rob Cross, rather than Van Gerwen, will take up Taylor’s mantle as the world’s pre-eminent player. Winning the world championship at his first attempt would be a start – Taylor did just that in 1990. He won the BDO title again in 1992, before joining the breakaway PDC in 1994. He lost the first PDC final to Dennis Priestley, but made up for it soon enough. Taylor has won the PDC world title 14 times: in (deep breath) 1995, 96, 97, 98, 99, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2009, 2010 and 2013. He’s also picked up the World Matchplay title 16 (SIXTEEN) times, the World Grand Prix 11 times, and the Premier League six times. There’s an argument that over the last 25 years, he has dominated his particular sport like nobody else on the planet. If you’re a newcomer to the wonderful world of darts, here are a couple of excellent pieces to get you in the zone. Andy Bull on a night at the Ally Pally, and Rob Smyth on the Power’s last stand: While we’re waiting, here’s a nice read from Steven Pye, Sports Network member and 80s sports doyen, on the history of the world championships in that halcyon decade. In those pre-PDC days, the BDO title was the one to win, just ahead of Bullseye’s coveted Bronze Bully. Taylor began against up-and-comer Chris Dobey, winning three sets to one, and then took care of pantomime villain Justin Pipe and another pretender in Keegan Brown, winning both matches without dropping a set. Gary Anderson, who beat Taylor in his last final appearance, was next but was beaten 5-3. That left Jamie Lewis waiting in the semi-finals, and while the qualifier almost matched Taylor’s average, the veteran took him to finishing school, winning 6-1. Cross began the tournament as a dark horse despite his inexperience, and after an easy win over Seigo Asada he won an almighty scrap with Michael Smith by the odd set in seven. The No20 seed saw off John Henderson and held off a comeback from world youth champion Dimitri van den Bergh in the quarters. Then came that instant classic against Michael van Gerwen, won in a sudden-death leg after midnight. Cross has won three matches in the final set, and each time with a lower average than his opponent. When Phil Taylor announced early in 2017 that this world championship would be his last, many ventured that fate would lead him to his 17th world title. What nobody expected was that his final opponent would be a man who was yet to win a penny as a professional. Taylor’s curtain call has loomed throughout a thrilling tournament, with the 57-year-old only really tested by Gary Anderson in a serene run to the final. After learning to share the spotlight as his darting dominance waned, he has the chance to take centre stage one more time. Taylor will have expected, perhaps hoped, to bow out against Michael van Gerwen, the new dominant force in darts and a man he has clashed with on and off the oche. Instead, Van Gerwen was beaten in an extraordinary semi-final by Rob Cross, whose already remarkable debut season has taken another leap forward here. If a 16-time winner against a rookie sounds like a recipe for a mismatch, think again – Cross, 30 years Taylor’s junior, matched Van Gerwen blow for blow across 11 legs and held his nerve when his opponent couldn’t. This is one of those all-too-rare occasions where a thoroughbred and an underdog meet on equal footing. Taylor is seven sets away from going out at the very top, and it’s down to a former electrician to shut down The Power. Whoever wins, it’s going to be quite the story.

In 1988 he helped to found Memorial, one of the first independent human rights organisations allowed to be established after Mikhail Gorbachev started to liberalise Soviet politics. A soft-spoken scholar of great intellectual courage, Roginsky argued that remembering the past with empathy and accuracy was crucial to the construction of a civilised society. It was not enough to build monuments. Every persecuted individual’s fate had to be discovered and made known. The impetus for his life’s work came partly from his own family history. Roginsky’s father, Boris, an electrical engineer and Talmudic scholar from Leningrad, was twice arrested and sent to labour camps. On his first release he was confined to internal exile in the remote northern village of Velsk in the Archangel region, where his son Arseny was born. Re-arrested, Boris Roginsky died in detention in 1951 but it was not until 1955, when Arseny was nine, that his mother was informed her husband was dead, allegedly of a heart attack. For four years she had continued to send him food parcels without being told it was a waste of time and resources. Arseny studied at the University of Tartu in what was then the Soviet republic of Estonia. He graduated from the history and philology faculty in 1968, the year in which Soviet tanks and troops invaded Czechoslovakia to crush a movement trying to reform communism. It was a formative experience which also radicalised several intellectuals who later became Gorbachev’s leading advisers. One of Roginsky’s classmates was the poet Natalya Gorbanevskaya, who was arrested for demonstrating in Red Square against the invasion. Roginsky described himself later as a child of 1968. Less provocatively than Gorbanevskaya, but equally bravely, he moved to Leningrad and started interviewing survivors of the labour camps and creating an archive on the pattern of what the writer Alexander Solzhenitsyn was doing separately for his book The Gulag Archipelago. Roginsky’s official jobs were as a bibliographer at Leningrad’s main public library and a teacher of Russian language and literature in evening schools. In his spare time he founded an underground group called Memory (Pamyat), and from 1975 to 1981 edited its collections of historical works. They were circulated privately and illegally in what was known as samizdat (self-publishing), and from 1978 they were smuggled out of the Soviet Union and published abroad. The KGB searched Roginsky’s flat in February 1977 and again in March 1979. Although they found nothing, he was fired from the evening school where he taught. Two years later he was offered the choice of forced emigration or detention. He chose the latter and was sentenced to four years in camps for “the production and sale of forged documents”, and “for transferring materials abroad to anti-Soviet publications”. On release he found himself swept up in the liberalisation of the media and the lifting of censorship – glasnost – ordered by Gorbachev. A longtime admirer of Russian radicals from the 19th and early 20th century, such as the People’s Will movement and the largely rural Socialist Revolutionaries, Roginsky compiled a book in 1989 called Memories of Peasant Tolstoyans, the 1910s-1930s. As glasnost accelerated, his academic work soon took a back seat to public organising. Roginsky joined with friends, including the physicist Andrei Sakharov, in creating Memorial, known officially as the Historical and Educational, Human Rights and Humanitarian Society, Memorial. From 1998 he was chairman of its board. Memorial had many achievements. Apart from getting a monument to repressed Soviet citizens erected near the KGB’s headquarters in Lubyanka square in 1991 (a massive piece of stone from the Solovetsky islands, where several camps used to be located), Memorial helped to discover numerous sites of mass graves of repressed citizens in and around Moscow and other cities. But its wish for the state to create a publicly funded library and archive of repression and government-sponsored crimes has never been fulfilled. Under Vladimir Putin’s more authoritarian leadership, several Memorial branches in different Russian cities were raided and the organisation was forced to register as a “foreign agent” in 2014 because it received funds from abroad – a step described by Roginsky as a “huge blow”. But, in a sign of the complexity of current Russian politics, Roginsky took a seat on the presidential commission overseeing the building of the Wall of Sorrow, a massive monument to victims of Soviet repression. Putin unveiled it in October. Although some human rights activists called Putin hypocritical and sneered at the project, Roginsky welcomed it. “A monument on behalf of the state is necessary because the state must clearly say terror is a crime,” he told a Russian news website. Taken ill a year ago, Roginsky moved to Tel Aviv for cancer treatment, and retreated from public activity. He is survived by his second wife, Yekaterina, and their son, Aleksandr, and two children, Boris and Asya, from his first marriage, which ended in divorce. • Arseny Borisovich Roginsky, historian and human rights campaigner, born 30 March 1946; died 18 December 2017"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2018/jan/01/homelessness-study-us-youth-1-in-10","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-01T19:10:44Z","webTitle":"US study finds 1 in 10 youth experience some form of homelessness","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jan/01/homelessness-study-us-youth-1-in-10","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/jan/01/homelessness-study-us-youth-1-in-10","fields":{"headline":"US study finds 1 in 10 youth experience some form of homelessness","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"One in 10 young adults aged 18 to 25 in the US have slept on the streets, in shelters, run away, been kicked out of home, or couch-surfed in the past year, according to a national survey. The study, Missed Opportunities: Youth Homelessness in America, published in the Journal of Adolescent Health, also found that at least one in 30 adolescents aged 13-17 experienced some form of homelessness unaccompanied by a parent or guardian over the same period. Researchers with Chapin Hall, a youth policy center at the University of Chicago, polled more than 26,000 young people and their families over the past two years. Extrapolated nationally, the findings suggest nearly 3.5 million young adults and 660,000 adolescents had been homeless within the previous year. The report aimed to challenge the notion that homelessness afflicts mostly older men. Key to understanding the statistics, the authors wrote, is that spot or “point in time” surveys had underestimated the issue because “young people often shift among temporary circumstances such as living on the streets and couch surfing in unstable locations”. The survey identified college students, graduates and employed young people who struggled to find a permanent place to stay. It also found that homelessness was no less prevalent in rural areas than in urban locations, and that certain groups, including black and Hispanic, lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender, as well as those who do not complete high school or are young parents, are at greater risk. Many, of course, experience some conditions simultaneously. Young people with less than a high school diploma or GED were found to be 346% more likely to be homeless; LGBT youth had a 120% greater risk; black or African American people had an 83% greater risk; non-white Hispanics had a 33% higher risk; and unmarried parenting young people a 200% greater risk. Young people reporting annual household income of less than $24,000 had a 162% higher risk. “Every day of housing instability and the associated stress represents a missed opportunity to support healthy development and transitions to productive adulthood,” Chapin Hall researchers concluded. “Our findings probably challenge the images of homelessness. Homelessness is young,” Matthew Morton, a research fellow with the policy center, told the Washington Post. “It’s more common than people expect and it’s largely hidden.” He added: “Many young people are getting hammered in this economy … and far too many youth have experienced trauma and lack stable family situations. You have a major affordable housing crisis.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2018/jan/02/co-op-launches-160m-expansion-plan-for-2018","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-02T06:01:20Z","webTitle":"Co-op launches £160m expansion plan for 2018","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jan/02/co-op-launches-160m-expansion-plan-for-2018","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/jan/02/co-op-launches-160m-expansion-plan-for-2018","fields":{"headline":"Co-op launches £160m expansion plan for 2018","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The Co-op is intensifying its battle to win more shoppers with a £160m investment on 100 new food stores during 2018, creating 1,600 jobs. The business, which is owned by its members, will also give major makeovers to a further 150 outlets in a bid to counter fierce competition from the budget grocers. Last year the Co-op dropped to sixth position among the UK’s leading supermarket chains after being overtaken by discounter Aldi. The German newcomer, which opened its first UK store in 1990, increased its share of the grocery market to 6.2% from 5.6%, over the same 12-week period the previous year, trumping the 6% share controlled by the Co-op, according to market research firm Kantar Worldpanel. The Co-op plans to open more than 20 new stores in London, up to 18 in Scotland, 10 in Wales and others in towns and cities including York, Plymouth and Bristol. Smaller convenience stores, and online sales, are the two big growth areas for the supermarket chains. Shopping habits have changed in recent years as customers replace their weekly shop with more frequent visits in an attempt to prevent waste and save money. This has meant larger, more expensive-to-run supermarkets, are being replaced by smaller convenience stores. The Co-op has been busy shrinking its store estate. It sold 300 shops to retailer McColl’s in 2016, and has also refocused on its own smaller convenience stores rather than bigger outlets. The food retailers have also been busy consolidating in a bid to cut costs. Tesco’s £3.7bn Booker takeover was waved through by the competition regulator towards the end of last year. The Co-op itself has reached an agreement to become the exclusive wholesale supplier to the 2,200 Costcutter Group stores, and its deal to buy Nisa Retail is conditional on Competition and Markets Authority approval. Jo Whitfield, chief executive of Co-op Food, said: “The Co-op is positively responding to the changes occurring within this dynamic sector. Our food business is going from strength to strength in what is clearly a challenging retail market. “We have the ambition for our stores to be at the heart of local life, bringing communities together and offering our members and customers great quality products when and where they need them.” The expansion comes after a torrid time for the group after a crisis at the Co-op Bank, which was saved from collapse in 2013 by a hedge fund rescue that reduced the former owner’s stake to 20%. The Co-op group sold its final 1% stake in the bank last year for £5m. It has also sold off its farms, pharmacies and travel agencies. Allan Leighton, the Cop-op chairman, said at the time of the group’s half year results in September that the remaining businesses were “now in pretty good shape, growing sales and delivering profits and delivering for customers”. Co-op also operates funeral care, legal services and insurance businesses. The group made underlying pre-tax profits of £14m in the six months to 1 July, down 48% on the same period a year before. However, the decline was largely the result of a £29m payout in discounts to member shoppers and nearly £6m to local communities under its revived membership rewards scheme. Excluding the member payouts, underlying pretax profits rose 59% to £43m."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/jan/01/man-arrested-over-of-woman-in-finsbury-park","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-02T07:34:32Z","webTitle":"Man arrested over murder of Iuliana Tudos in Finsbury Park","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jan/01/man-arrested-over-of-woman-in-finsbury-park","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/jan/01/man-arrested-over-of-woman-in-finsbury-park","fields":{"headline":"Man arrested over murder of Iuliana Tudos in Finsbury Park","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"A man has been arrested in connection with the murder of Iuliana Tudos, whose body was found in a park in north London after she failed to turn up at her friend’s house on Christmas Day. The 31-year-old man was detained at 1.30pm on New Year’s Day in east London, Scotland Yard said. Officers believe Tudos, 22, was attacked on Christmas Eve. She had been stabbed and sustained a head injury, and was found by her friends in a disused outhouse in Finsbury Park three days later. The man was taken to a police station in south-west London. The Haringey borough police commander, DCS Des Fahy, said extra officers had been deployed for reassurance. “We understand that the local community might have concerns, but I want to reassure people that incidents of this nature are incredibly rare. “We have police out and about on patrol and local neighbourhood policing teams have been out speaking to members of the community. By all accounts, Iuliana was a bubbly lively girl enjoying a fun life in London when she was tragically taken from her loved ones. Our hearts go out to them.” A postmortem took place at Haringey mortuary on 28 December and gave the cause of death as a stab wound to the abdomen and a head injury. Police said further tests were ongoing. Tudos, who police said was of Russian and Greek origin, was last seen by friends at about 8pm on Christmas Eve as she headed for a bus home from Camden, north London.

They will marvel at how eight teams made the playoffs who had not done so last year. They will chuckle at Cleveland’s 0-16 record and wonder how the New York Giants could have tumbled to 3-13. But these recollections will be footnotes in a record book. The 2017 NFL season had little to do with what happened on the field. It wasn’t about the quarterbacks who defied age but rather the quarterback who wasn’t there, the one who once nearly won a Super Bowl and then became too toxic to touch – all for the crime of making us think. If we are being honest about 2017’s most impactful player then we have to say it was not Brady or Brees or Carson Wentz or Todd Gurley or Aaron Donald for the touchdowns they scored and the quarterbacks they sacked. It was Colin Kaepernick for the contract he never got. Kaepernick had already changed football in the summer of 2016 when he refused to stand for the national anthem. His plea for the nation to start a conversation about race moved other players to speak out as well, breaking through an unwritten edict that football players should be seen but not heard. By sitting he freed others to take stands they wouldn’t have dared to make. He paid for this with his career. It wasn’t hard to see the sacrifice he was making. When the 49ers didn’t re-sign him last winter, the rest of the NFL soon followed. No team seemed willing to take a chance on a quarterback who awakened so many players and outraged fans who couldn’t understand how an athlete refused to stand for the anthem. Seattle considered him for a backup quarterback job, Baltimore’s coaches seemed interested in signing him only to be refused by the team’s owner who polled fans and decided he was too radioactive to add to the roster. When US president Donald Trump tried to stir a nation’s anger against Kaepernick and the African American players who carried the unsigned quarterback’s protest into this season, he ensured the 2017 season wouldn’t be about the games. Owners turned against owners. Racial lines were drawn in locker rooms. Prominent league sponsors like Papa John’s threatened to pull their advertising. Games started with tallies of who stood and who didn’t for the national anthem. Players wondered why Kaepernick was being kept from the league. Many fans asked this, too. In the end, the NFL will not be the same. The league has been forced to listen to the concerns of Kaepernick and other players. Social issues far from football are being discussed. While many of these conversations might be empty public relations stunts designed to get players to stand for the anthem again, the fact the league is having any talks at all is still progress. This is the season many players discovered they had voices on important matters and they learned to use them. The longer Kaepernick goes unsigned the less likely it seems he will play again in the NFL, this despite the fact he is probably better than two-thirds of the quarterbacks in the league. Few around the NFL believe he should be sitting out. But even if he never throws another pass he will have impacted the league in ways that many of the other stars can’t. He made a football season about things other than football. He started a conversation and then kept it going. In the end, that will be the enduring memory of 2017 – not a tackle or a touchdown. A sport that needed awakening is a little more socially conscious heading into 2018. Maybe someday we will look back at the four months that made up the 2017 season and say this was the year that football finally found a soul. Fantasy player of the week Matthew Stafford. Talk about too little too late. The Detroit Lions, playing for pride, playing for a winning season and perhaps even playing for coach Jim Caldwell’s job, got a game they desperately needed on Sunday in beating Green Bay, 35-11. Stafford, who was underwhelming in the previous Sunday’s 26-17 loss to Cincinnati that knocked Detroit from the postseason, was fantastic against the Packers. He completed 20 of 29 passes for 323 yards and three touchdowns. Of course, these are not the same Packers whose Super Bowl dreams died when quarterback Aaron Rodgers went down with a broken collarbone. And Sunday’s win might not have done anything for Caldwell whose job security has been in constant question despite being the only Lions permanent coach with a winning record in six decades. Before Sunday’s game, the NFL Network reported that the Lions will fire Caldwell and hope to replace him with New England’s defensive coordinator Matt Patricia. Stat of the week 586, 754. These are the rushing totals for Seattle quarterback Russell Wilson and Carolina quarterback Cam Newton, both of whom led their teams in rushing this season. It is the first time in the modern NFL era that two quarterbacks were the top rushers on their teams and raises the question of will this become more of a trend. NFL teams prefer their quarterbacks to remain in the pocket out of fear they will get hurt running around, but with the rise of players like Wilson and Newton whose elusiveness makes them better throwers, it’s likely more coaches let their quarterbacks run. Neither Wilson nor Newton intended to lead their teams in rushing the way Philadelphia’s Randall Cunningham did four times in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Seattle went through six running backs this year, losing most to injury while the Panthers mix of Christian McCaffrey and Jonathan Stewart diluted their numbers, allowing Newton to out-rush them. Ultimately, only Newton was able to run his team to the playoffs, though the Panthers lost the NFC South to New Orleans and will have to face the Saints on the road next weekend. The Seahawks, decimated by injuries, lost three of their last four games including a 26-24 defeat to Arizona on Sunday, finishing 9-7 and out of the postseason for the first time in six seasons. Video of the week And they complain that soccer players flop too much ... Maybe it says a lot about the Jets’ season that the only real shot they had to take down the Patriots was this spike from receiver Robby Anderson that bounced off the turf on the Gillette Field sideline and smacked Johnson Badamosi in the helmet. After a surprising 3-2 start, New York quickly plummeted to the bottom the AFC East. Sunday’s 26-6 loss to New England was the final dreary blow in a 5-11 season too wretched to savor and yet too successful to land them the first overall draft pick. As for the Patriots, Badamosi might be one of New England’s few flops in a season that took off in October. In the end, this has been one of the Pats’ most efficient seasons with equally as effective offenses and defenses. Somewhere in the playoffs someone will give them a game, but with home field through the AFC championship game, it’s hard to imagine which team that will be. Quote of the week “Paul Stark passed away December 27, 2017 of complications from a brief illness, exacerbated by the hopeless condition of the Cleveland Browns” – from an obituary in the Sandusky (Ohio) Register Fittingly for the Browns their season ended the only way it should: with receiver Corey Coleman dropping a fourth-down pass at the 11-yard line that would have given Cleveland a last chance at winning their first game of the year. As far as drops go this was as comical and head-smacking as any should be in a 0-16 season. The ball simply rolled through his hands before clunking off his helmet. skittering away and securing a 28-14 loss to Pittsburgh. No one should blame Coleman, however. This season was a collective effort. Few Browns players escape blame for the disaster that unfolded. Cleveland is the second team in NFL history to go winless since the 16-season was introduced in 1978. The other, the 2008 Detroit Lions, recovered to go 10-6 three years after their 0-16 year. For the Browns, though, the losing has been established as last season’s team went 1-15 and 2015’s was 3-13. The good news is they can’t go 0-17 next season. The even better news is they have two picks among the first five in April’s draft, including No1. Sooner or later, they are bound to be much better than this. Elsewhere around the league • Oakland fired coach Jack Del Rio after a disappointing 6-10 season that included a 30-10 loss to the Chargers on Sunday.

Marcus Mariota threw and ran for touchdowns in the victory for the Titans, who finished 9-7. • Baltimore looked certain to have wrapped up a wild card spot until Cincinnati’s Andy Dalton threw a 49-yard touchdown pass to Tyler Boyd with 44 seconds left to give the Bengals a 31-27 victory and put Buffalo (who beat Miami, 22-16) into the playoffs. • Kirk Cousins was intercepted three times in what may well be his final game in the nation’s capital as Washington lost 18-10 to the Giants."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/2018/jan/01/eddie-jones-england-training-camp-five-injuries","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-01T16:12:25Z","webTitle":"Eddie Jones turns to 6ft 3in, 18st Cokanasiga to bolster injury-hit England","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/jan/01/eddie-jones-england-training-camp-five-injuries","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/jan/01/eddie-jones-england-training-camp-five-injuries","fields":{"headline":"Eddie Jones turns to 6ft 3in, 18st Cokanasiga to bolster injury-hit England","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The London Irish wing Joe Cokanasiga joined England’s training squad in Brighton on Monday with Exeter’s Jack Nowell among five players who pulled out of the camp with injuries sustained during the weekend Premiership matches. The 20-year-old Cokanasiga, who was born in Fiji but moved to England with his family when he was three, was called up by Eddie Jones for last summer’s tour to Argentina and has made 10 appearances for Irish this season but is yet to score a try in the campaign for the club that is adrift at the bottom of the table. He touched the ball only twice during his side’s defeat against Newcastle on Saturday before being replaced 11 minutes from the end, but at more than 6ft 3in and nearly 18st, his rawness is outweighed by speed and power. The elevation of Cokanasiga means that Gloucester, who ended 2017 fourth in the Premiership table, are the only top-flight team not called on by Jones to provide players for his training squad Nowell suffered an ankle injury during Exeter’s bonus-point victory over Leicester on Sunday that sent the Premiership champions into the new year with a 10-point lead over second-placed Saracens, but played on until the 75th-minute. The Chiefs’ prop Harry Williams pulled out of the Brighton camp having left the field with concussion on the hour. The Northampton outside-half Piers Francis also withdrew with concussion, while the Bath second row Charlie Ewels suffered a hamstring strain during his club’s Friday night defeat to Wasps at the Recreation Ground. The Bath prop Henry Thomas, who returned to action last month after more than a year out with ligament damage in his left knee which required two operations to sort out and left him seeking the help of a mind coach, is the other player called up by Jones, who originally picked 34 players for the camp. That number will be cut on 18 January when Jones names his squad for the Six Nations, a tournament England are looking to win for what would be a record third successive season."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2018/jan/01/brighton-bournemouth-premier-league-match-report","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-01T14:31:04Z","webTitle":"Callum Wilson’s scrambled goal rescues point for Bournemouth at Brighton","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jan/01/brighton-bournemouth-premier-league-match-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/jan/01/brighton-bournemouth-premier-league-match-report","fields":{"headline":"Callum Wilson’s scrambled goal rescues point for Bournemouth at Brighton","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"This was the harshest of lessons for Brighton &amp; Hove Albion, who twice surrendered the lead as Bournemouth garnered a point from what proved thoroughly entertaining fare on a dank Sussex afternoon. Eddie Howe’s side have taken flak for playing themselves into trouble – and they did so again here – but it was Brighton who imploded late on, making a mess of a late corner to allow Callum Wilson to swipe home an ugly equaliser. “It was not one for the purists but we will take that,” Howe said with a wry smile. “I’m happy with how we came back and fought back. But I’m disappointed with the goals we have conceded.” Glenn Murray, deemed an unwanted commodity at Bournemouth last summer, had put Brighton back in front against his former club before Wilson took advantage of some slapstick defending 11 minutes from time. For the Brighton manager this was a case of two priceless points dropped. “I am hugely disappointed,” Chris Hughton said after his 150th game in charge of the team. “I am more disappointed with the first goal because set pieces are an area that we have tried to work on. The second one can happen. Players have attempted to clear the ball. It is one of those that every now and then happens.” Brighton had begun the year in style with Anthony Knockaert rounding off a slick team move inside five minutes. Shane Duffy’s cross-field ball found José Izquierdo, who played a neat give-and-go with the again impressive Pascal Gross before sliding the ball across goal for Knockaert to rattle home with his right foot for only his second goal of the season. After another one-two, this time between Murray and the – on this form – irresistible Izquierdo, the former forced a strong right-hand save from Asmir Begovic in the Bournemouth goal. “The threat that he gave us, I thought he was very good,” Hughton said of Izquierdo, a £13m club-record signing from Club Brugge last summer. “He is a worker also, if you look at the way that he plays it is not just about making forward runs. He defends well for the team and he wants to do well.” Murray had toyed with Steve Cook, dummying for Knockaert, who was dashing down the right until being tugged back by Lewis Cook. Bournemouth then woke with Markus Suttner having to hack clear Steve Cook’s goal-bound header. From the resulting corner Cook again rose above Duffy to head home the equaliser off the underside of the bar. That goal developed some belief within the visiting side and Lewis Cook’s nimble footwork freed an onrushing Marc Pugh but Mathew Ryan comfortably saved the winger’s effort. Three minutes before half-time Izquierdo started and very nearly finished another fine Brighton move but was superbly denied by Begovic. Bournemouth survived but swiftly came unstuck after the interval and this time it was of their own doing. Simon Francis, their captain, ran the ball out of defence but straight into Izquierdo who prompted a ruthless Brighton attack, bearing down on Begovic before unselfishly squaring for Murray, who had time to steady himself before slamming the ball home. The Colombian should also have scored himself after galloping 40 yards upfield but shot straight at Begovic. In an end-to-end affair, Wilson and Jordon Ibe combined before the latter tested Ryan, and then struck a post after jinking away from Gross. But Bournemouth eventually prospered in unconventional fashion. Wilson juggled the ball in the box – with Dunk appearing to handle – before Brighton tried and failed to clear Ibe’s in-swinging corner on five occasions. It cost them dearly, as Wilson’s scruffy miskick trickled into the net."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jan/02/free-hospital-parking-daily-mirror-jeremy-corbyn","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-02T08:00:22Z","webTitle":"Why free hospital parking isn't as good as it sounds | Peter Walker","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jan/02/free-hospital-parking-daily-mirror-jeremy-corbyn","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/jan/02/free-hospital-parking-daily-mirror-jeremy-corbyn","fields":{"headline":"Why free hospital parking isn't as good as it sounds","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The Daily Mirror has an illustrious history of campaigning, most recently helping to persuade ministers to enact an opt-out system for organ donation in England, as already existed in Scotland and Wales. But I’m afraid their latest crusade is a mistake. Backed by, among others, trade unions and Jeremy Corbyn – for whom it is official Labour policy – the paper seeks the abolition of all parking charges at NHS hospitals in England, for patients, visitors and staff. It is generally popular, and billed as an obvious and fair reform, which would benefit those most in need. Unfortunately, it’s a lot more complicated than that. The first point to stress is that I’m not arguing against reforms to the way hospital parking is currently administered and charged. As is regularly documented, too many systems are unwieldy and over-complex, with many only permitting cash payments, or forcing visitors to pay in advance when they might have little idea how long they will stay. Charges can sometimes also seem unreasonably high, and there could be an argument for imposing a cap, or perhaps systems whereby regular visitors such as relatives of long-term patients could avoid the fees racking up. But opening up all NHS hospital car parks to free parking at any time, for any duration, to anyone who works there or has reason to visit? That’s a different matter altogether. The first error is that it won’t necessarily make parking any easier, just hard in a different way. There are something close to 600,000 staff at hospitals in England, and about 40,000 inpatient admissions a day. That’s a lot of people seeking a free resource. In Scotland, patients’ associations have complained that car parks at many hospitals, made free in 2008, are so permanently full that some people have had to leave their vehicle a 15-minute walk away – thus missing appointments. In Wales, which also has free parking, one hospital had to build a new multistorey car park and employ an external contractor to enforce rules. Without fees to cover the costs, this is money that could otherwise be spent on patient care. This is a vital point. Parking is never free – parking without a charge is merely a subsidy to the motorist, and it can be a significant one. Donald Shoup, a US economist with a long-standing fascination with parking, has calculated that in 12 US cities the average construction cost for an above-ground parking space is about £18,000, several times the average net worth of an African-American family. This is the other key point – free parking is fundamentally regressive, a subsidy to people who tend to be richer than average. Many politicians, and newspapers, see the car as the default travel choice for everyone, and of course if you’re outside a town or city, often dreadful public transport means a motor vehicle might be your only means of getting to the nearest hospital. But this ignores the fact that the poorer you are, the less likely you are to drive. Government statistics show that in the lowest income quintile, 44% of English households have no access to a car, with about a third of the second-lowest band facing the same situation. In the top income quintile, just 12% are car-less, with about half owning two or more. It is therefore better-off patients and visitors who are more likely to take advantage of free hospital parking, rather than use public transport, or walk, cycle or take an expensive cab. It’s the same for staff: the Mirror’s campaign is statistically far more likely to benefit a consultant than a porter. It thus seems odd for the paper to argue so vehemently in favour of such a subsidy rather than, for example, campaigning for better public transport to hospitals, or safe cycling and walking routes, changes which would bring benefits, however poor you are. The final reason this is a misplaced crusade is ever more simple still. A very large number of people are in hospital in the first place, thus requiring people to treat and visit them, because they lead inactive lives – a problem linked very closely to over-reliance on the car. It’s hard to over-stress the significance of this public health catastrophe, which many experts predict will eventually bankrupt the NHS. An estimated 85,000 people in England and Wales die early every year because of sedentary living, with hundreds of thousands more needing treatment for ailments associated with such lifestyles, such as type-2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease and many cancers. The statistics for inactivity can shock. One study from August found that 41% of middle-aged English people fail to walk for 10 minutes or more continuously every month. This isn’t to argue that nurses on a night shift at a rural hospital, let alone ill patients, should be forced to walk or cycle to the wards. But it does seem perverse to specifically incentivise inactive travel when other options might be there, not to mention placing even more demands on the NHS through factors connected to driving such as smog and crashes. Parking is a strange subject, at once arousing hugely passionate feelings in many people, and yet rarely understood properly. Andrew Gilligan, the journalist who was formerly London’s commissioner for cycling, once described it as “the third rail of politics – if you touch it, you die”. I understand why people believe England’s hospitals should all have universal free parking. I also see why the Mirror and Corbyn would see it as a good cause. But the more you look into it, the worse an idea it seems.

Chamber after chamber of brick and concrete, corrugated metal and snaking pipes. Though damp and dark, there’s something seductive about them. The entrance can be found on Leake Street, with its elaborate graffiti and heady tang of spray paint. London is a city of layers, and as trains rumble above and commuters go about their business, it is appealing to think there is art, music and magic taking place beneath our feet. A favourite location for immersive theatre-makers, the tunnels have been transformed into Wonderland for Alice’s Adventures Underground and the home of Roald Dahl’s most grotesque couple for Dinner With the Twits. For the last six years, they have also been home to the Vault festival. Since 2012 the festival has given emerging theatre-makers a showcase for their work during the cold weeks of February, a relatively quiet time in the theatre calendar. In this subterranean space, it’s possible to see a number of shows during a single night. This year, tickets start at £5 and go up to £28 for the biggest productions, such as Neverland, the Guild of Misrule’s immersive reworking of the Peter Pan story. The festival is now bigger than it’s ever been and runs for eight weeks. “This means a sixth of the year is now taken up by Vault festival,” explains Tim Wilson, its co-director, along with Mat Burt and Andy George. “That’s scary but means we can fit in lots more companies.” There were around 180 last year, but in 2018, if you count everyone presenting work, the number rises to more than 320. As with last year, the festival is seeping out into the surrounding streets. The nearby Waterloo East theatre joins forces with Vault for the first time. Comedians will be performing works-in-progress in the Travelling Through bookshop on Lower Marsh. There will be site-specific pieces, including a show called Wrecked performed in a car, and Void, a new work by Rift performed in two shipping containers. The 2018 lineup features more comedy than previous years, including performances by Bridget Christie and Richard Gadd, and there will be an increased focus on magic and circus, along with a surprisingly high number of new musicals, including The People’s Rock, which imagines the 2020 US presidential campaign of wrestler turned actor Dwayne Johnson. The Vault festival has quickly become a fixture for a generation of artists and many of them plan their year around it. “Some people use it to try out their Edinburgh material or workshop things,” says George. “For other people it’s a great place to do a London run of an Edinburgh show that’s gone well.” It’s hard not to compare Vault to the Edinburgh fringe. After all, you can see a bunch of new work, have a pint or two – there are several bars (including the obligatory cocktail bar) and places to grab a snack in the tunnels – and if you stand in the wrong place, something suspect might drip on your head. But Wilson, Burt and George have no wish to ape the Edinburgh model. On the contrary, they’d like to see it change. “One of our ambitions is to have a tangible impact on the Edinburgh fringe so that it gets better for artists,” says George. “Because there are a lot people who are getting tired of it.” “And rinsed,” Wilson adds, pointedly. Identifying the problems with the existing fringe model is not enough, they explain – they must find workable solutions. One of the main ways they are doing this is by minimising upfront costs. In doing so, they hope to level the playing field when it comes to who gets to present work, as the financial risk in putting on a show at Vault festival is much smaller. They’re also thinking about other ways to change the industry. “We’re actively aware of our own middle-class white male privilege,” says George. This year 52% of the programme will consist of female-led work. “We want to explore the representation gap between artists working at fringe level and at large venues.” The festival will also feature a higher number of BAME artists than before. Rafaella Marcus, director of Abi Zakarian’s I Have a Mouth and I Will Scream, is one of many young theatre-makers presenting work at this year’s festival. “Its tunnels are alive with audiences hanging out between shows – it’s not just a venue, but a hub.” The Vaults is where you’re most likely to see work made by women in response to the septic tank of 2017. “Over half of the shows will be written or directed by women, in stark contrast to the gender ratios of most theatres,” says Marcus. “It’s change happening at a grassroots level, which is incredibly exciting, and it needs support to carry through into the mainstream.” Five shows to see at Vault festival Becoming Shades Running throughout the festival, this returning hit from last year is an all-female immersive circus spectacle retelling the story of Persephone. Sparks The debut play by Jessica Butcher – who starred in Camilla Whitehill’s fringe hit Where Do Little Birds Go? – explores grief, loss and love. For a Black Girl Fusing spoken word and interviews, Nicole Acquah’s part-autobiographical show is a response to the claim by some people that racism doesn’t exist in the UK. Revelations James Rowland completes the storytelling trilogy that began with the moving Team Viking. On some days he’ll be performing all three parts. Neverland Co-created with Sheffield’s Theatre Deli this Peter Pan-inspired new, immersive musical is running throughout the festival in one of the venue’s most cavernous spaces.

But scant is often the partner of consolation and it was the appropriate companion on a flat, official introduction to Teesside for Pulis. The only goal of a poor game came from Aston Villa’s Robert Snodgrass and whether or not Terry Venables, Steve McClaren, Gareth Southgate, Gordon Strachan, Tony Mowbray, Aitor Karanka, Steve Agnew and Garry Monk failed to win on their debuts in the Boro dugout will not trouble Pulis as much as the here and now. He realised quickly that he has inherited a team that can look sluggish. “We were very, very slow at times,” Pulis said, accurately, before moving swiftly on to the bigger picture: “The squad is definitely too big. We definitely will cut it. “This squad is bigger than the one I left at West Brom. There’s a lot of numbers here, too many in my view. “The important thing is to remember that Steve [Gibson, the chairman] spent an absolute fortune here in the summer. Out of respect for him I’ve to be prudent and not make rash decisions. That is what I’ll do and if it takes a bit of time, it takes a bit of time. I want to be fair to the fella because he has spent a lot of money on this squad.” Boro invested around £40m following relegation from the Premier League but there was no surge under Monk and now Pulis has seen up close a blunt, square team that muddled through the majority of the 90 minutes. Their lethargy was punctuated in the second half by the arrival of Adama Traoré from the bench, the former Villa winger offering speed and much-needed urgency. “Adama carried the ball and he livened the crowd, which is important in home games,” Pulis said. “He was definitely a plus.” But Traoré could not conjure a goal. Instead it was a winger who went the other way, Albert Adomah, who created the chance that Snodgrass converted to win a poor game. Adomah was part of the Middlesbrough side promoted under Karanka but was then sold to Roberto Di Matteo. Adomah enjoyed his moment, which came in front of the 2,700 travelling Villa fans. It had been a bitter December until then for those supporters and mounting pressure on Steve Bruce escalated after the defeat at Brentford on Boxing Day. When Glenn Whelan, Neil Taylor and Keinan Davis were struck by a bug on Friday night, Bruce was looking at nine absentees and a fraught return to his native north-east. When he surveyed Boro’s XI, he saw “they must have had seven players who were 6ft 4in”. He said he expected a barrage. But while Ryan Shotton delivered the first of series of long throw-ins after 90 seconds, the physical onslaught Villa had prepared for never materialised. Pulis selected Britt Assombalonga and Rudy Gestede as a twin No9 strikeforce, but he may not do so again. It was 34 minutes before Sam Johnstone had to make a save – from Jonny Howson – and Pulis was an agitated figure on the touchline. Bruce, meanwhile, was delighted by the lack of direct action from Boro. He had dropped Jack Grealish to the bench but when Josh Onomah had to retire before half-time, Grealish went on and supplied some skill and tempo. Villa improved. Darren Randolph made a decent save from Grealish on 55 minutes as the game became slightly more interesting. Then Adomah twisted and lofted a cross to the far post. Steaming in was Snodgrass and, following his diving header, Villa had their first win since November. There have been five games since and though only two have been lost, three draws have also dragged. “Considering the [injury] problems that we’ve had, it’s a very satisfying win,” Bruce said. “We lurch along. We played badly against Brentford in the second half and all of a sudden we’re in crisis. We have to eradicate that as a club. Let us get on with the job in hand.” Wherever Pulis was then, he was nodding."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2017/dec/30/liverpool-leicester-premier-league-match-report","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-30T18:58:00Z","webTitle":"Mohamed Salah double inspires Liverpool fightback after Vardy opener","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/dec/30/liverpool-leicester-premier-league-match-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/dec/30/liverpool-leicester-premier-league-match-report","fields":{"headline":"Mohamed Salah double inspires Liverpool fightback after Vardy opener","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"By Jürgen Klopp’s admission the £75m that Liverpool are paying for Virgil van Dijk is unpleasant but Mohamed Salah represents “a catch” at £36.9m. His valuation of the Egypt international appeared sensible, even understated in the perverse world of football economics, after Salah inspired an outstanding Liverpool recovery against Leicester City. “The best reaction since I’ve been here,” said the Liverpool manager, who celebrated with characteristic abandon on the final whistle and with good reason. Salah struck two more superb goals to overturn Jamie Vardy’s opener at Anfield and take his season’s tally to 23 in all competitions. No Liverpool player has ever scored more before new year, the former Roma winger equalling Roger Hunt’s record from 1961-62 before departing with a limp that makes him a doubt for the New Year’s Day trip to Burnley. Salah encapsulated Liverpool’s quality throughout. Klopp’s team showed why Van Dijk has been bought at such expense when conceding cheaply and early but their comeback was hugely impressive in terms of performance and character. The result bodes well for a Liverpool team that can only improve with the defender on board and Claude Puel had no complaints over his first defeat in seven meetings with the Anfield club. “Liverpool played their best today,” said the Leicester manager. His Liverpool counterpart commented: “You don’t want to go 1-0 down but if you do you want to see a reaction and it was fantastic. Not one player reacted in a negative way. We kept on going, created, created, created, and played brilliant football. Everyone in the stadium thought ‘Wow, what a game’ and 100 per cent it was one of the best since I’ve been here so far.” The world’s most expensive defender had only just taken an executive seat in the main stand when Leicester took the lead thanks to another lapse in the rearguard that he has been bought to improve. Dejan Lovren may be the man with most to lose following the Holland international’s acquisition but it was Joël Matip’s mistake that demonstrated every Liverpool centre-half is threatened by the enhanced competition. Leicester punished the error superbly, in fairness. Matip was under no pressure when he took the ball from Loris Karius, back in the team as Klopp rotated his goalkeepers, and sold Emre Can short with a careless pass. Vicente Iborra won the midfield challenge and swept an exquisite ball behind Andrew Robertson into Riyad Mahrez. The winger squared first time and there was Vardy, so often Liverpool’s nemesis, arriving ahead of Matip to score from close range. It was Vardy’s seventh goal in eight appearances against Liverpool – becoming the first Leicester player to score in five successive meetings between the clubs in the process – and only the fourth league goal that Klopp’s team have conceded at Anfield this season. It was also the cue for Liverpool to deliver a rampant response, albeit one that was littered with missed chances and good saves from Kasper Schmeichel until Salah levelled in style. It was an achievement by Leicester to hold their advantage until the interval. The pressure was unrelenting from Liverpool and a refusal to be disheartened by wasted opportunities was as impressive as their performance. Merited reward finally came from the devastating feet of Salah with his 22nd and 23rd goals of a remarkable debut season in red. Liverpool’s equaliser reflected the confidence running through Klopp’s players. Roberto Firmino and Can were involved before Sadio Mané sent Salah darting into the area with a delightful back-heel. The summer signing evaded challenges from Christian Fuchs and Daniel Amartey and, with Schmeichel advancing, fired a low left-foot shot through the goalkeeper’s legs. Similarly to Liverpool, Leicester responded well to conceding and almost regained the lead when Wilfred Ndidi curled a shot a fraction wide of Karius’s goal. But with Philippe Coutinho causing mayhem with a series of impudent touchesover the visiting defence it was the hosts who continued to pose the greater threat. The winner also stemmed from a first-time flick into Salah, this time from James Milner, but there appeared no immediate danger with Harry Maguire towering at his back. In an instant, however, Salah was gone, rolling the big defender brilliantly before placing his latest precise finish into Schmeichel’s bottom corner. “I think Mo can keep this standard but I also think all the boys can keep this standard,” said Klopp. Anfield could be in for a treat when Manchester City arrive in a fortnight."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/blog/2017/dec/30/donald-trump-us-sport-nfl-basketball-winter-olympics-president","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-30T17:40:21Z","webTitle":"Donald Trump has just started on his aim to be the only game in town | Bryan Armen Graham","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2017/dec/30/donald-trump-us-sport-nfl-basketball-winter-olympics-president","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/blog/2017/dec/30/donald-trump-us-sport-nfl-basketball-winter-olympics-president","fields":{"headline":"Donald Trump has just started on his aim to be the only game in town","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Sports and politics have always existed at a very public intersection in the United States, but you would be hard-pressed to recall a time when the illusory firewall keeping them apart was more nakedly exposed. Over the past year Trump has co-opted American sports as not merely a proxy battle in the culture wars that reflect a country’s deep divides but the primary theatre. It is fair to say there was no more influential sports figure this year than the president, whose bellicose rhetoric and crisp volume counterpunching have had far-reaching effects on the industry (ask Papa John’s) and compelled sports people, in a sharp break from the “Republicans buy sneakers, too” indifference of a previous generation, to speak on social issues with a frequency and ardour not seen since the high water mark of athlete activism of the 1960s, when champions such as Muhammad Ali, Jim Brown and Kareem Abdul‑Jabbar risked their livelihoods to stand on the frontline of the civil rights movement. At a September rally Trump nearly derailed an entire NFL season when he called football players “sons of bitches” for participating in Colin Kaepernick’s protest against police killings of black and brown people, taking credit for the league’s television ratings decline and mocking hard-won strides toward player safety by claiming the referees were doing too much to protect players. Soon after he jousted with the NBA’s Stephen Curry and LeBron James over his decision to rescind the Golden State Warriors’ unaccepted invitation for the White House visit traditionally extended to championship-winning teams (eliciting perhaps the burn of the decade from James: “U bum”). When ESPN’s Jemele Hill tweeted that Trump was “a white supremacist who has largely surrounded himself w/ other white supremacists” and “the most ignorant, offensive president of my lifetime”, Trump clapped back first through the White House press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, who declared the comments “a fireable offense”, then doubled down with a name-check on Twitter pegged to Hill’s two-week suspension from the network. Sanders later backtracked, regretting “painting ESPN in an unfair light”. That further cast the Disney‑owned sports giant as an extreme liberal news source, a perception that continues to dog the network that is suffering from flagging subscription numbers. Trump twice called out LaVar Ball, the father of a UCLA basketball player detained for shoplifting in China, as “ungrateful” for the president’s help in resolving the imbroglio, then he singled out the Oakland Raiders running back Marshawn Lynch for refusing to stand for the anthem (“Great disrespect!”), claiming the NFL should ban him for the season if he did it again. Simply, it was the year the “stick to sports” myth was busted for good. But the issues facing those in the US marginalised by race and class were bound to bubble up and find expression in the mainstream channels of American life. It’s only a wonder it has not happened sooner. The uptick in athlete activism did not begin with the emergence of Trumpism. Five years ago, the Miami Heat, led by James and Dwyane Wade, wore hoodies in a photograph disseminated on social media to protest against the killing of Trayvon Martin and many other athletes have embraced the unfiltered channel of social media to espouse their views. But there’s no question the president – never more than at the infamous campaign stop in September for the Republican senator Luther Strange whose ripple effect months later is still being felt across the landscape – has poured gasoline on the fire. Trump has always recognised sports as a cultural institution and inextricable stripe of American life. He owned a team in the upstart United States Football League in the early 1980s and hosted a series of major fights at his casino in Atlantic City before it went bankrupt, most notably the 1988 summit meeting between Mike Tyson and Michael Spinks, for which he paid a then-record $11m site fee. The Trump Organization’s portfolio of golf courses around the world is well-documented. He actively courted athlete endorsements throughout his political rise, keenly aware of the power of sports people as influencers. It is only fitting his election has awakened that potential in ways not witnessed for years. So what comes next? In six weeks the Winter Olympics kick off in the sleepy resort town of Pyeongchang, South Korea, clustered in the Taebaek Mountains – 50 miles from the demilitarized zone that has divided the Korean peninsula for more than six decades – against the backdrop of sabre-rattling between mercurial nuclear-armed leaders trading apocalyptic threats and fiery broadsides in increasingly unnerving 280-character increments. No chance of politics bleeding over there. Lindsey Vonn, the most decorated female skier of all time and one of the faces of the US Olympic team, said she wants to “represent the people of the United States, not the president” and would turn down an invitation to the White House. “I take the Olympics very seriously and what they mean and what they represent, what walking under our flag means in the opening ceremony,” Vonn said. “I want to represent our country well. I don’t think that there are a lot of people currently in our government that do that.” In short, welcome to the new normal. It may be unpleasant news for those who turn to sports as an escape from the toxicity of what passes for public discourse today, but if it starts difficult conversations that have been a long time deferred – which for all the window dressing was Kaepernick’s original goal – then it’s a small price to pay."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"film/2017/dec/31/gary-oldman-will-churchill-prove-to-be-his-finest-hour","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-31T00:05:15Z","webTitle":"Gary Oldman: will Churchill prove to be his finest hour? | The Observer profile","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/dec/31/gary-oldman-will-churchill-prove-to-be-his-finest-hour","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2017/dec/31/gary-oldman-will-churchill-prove-to-be-his-finest-hour","fields":{"headline":"Gary Oldman: will Churchill prove to be his finest hour?","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"The 1980s was a dazzling era for young, explosive British actors and two of the brightest fireworks in the box were Gary Oldman and Daniel Day-Lewis. They followed parallel trajectories: a 1960s childhood in south-east London, acclaimed stage work in the 1970s and on in the next decade to screen performances that gave homegrown cinema its equivalents to Method heavyweights such as Robert De Niro and Al Pacino, as well as successors to angry young men such as Albert Finney and Malcolm McDowell. (McDowell’s confrontational performance in The Raging Moon inspired Oldman to become an actor.) They will compete next month in a Brit-off at the Golden Globes for the best actor prize, with the rivalry likely to continue at the Oscars in March. Day-Lewis, 60, has been nominated for his absorbing portrayal of a controlling, fastidious dressmaker in Paul Thomas Anderson’s brilliant Phantom Thread, in which he stars with Lesley Manville, Oldman’s first of five wives to date. (They were married from 1987 to 1990.) Meanwhile, Oldman, who is 59, is the favourite to win for his grand, but cartoonish Winston Churchill in Darkest Hour, where he fumes and puffs through a faceful of prosthetic padding, while the director, Joe Wright, over-eggs the pudding with pointlessly fussy effects and angles. Oldman recently declared himself “amazed, flattered and very proud” to be up for a Golden Globe, a departure from his view five years ago, when he observed that the voting was “bent”. (He had failed then to bag a nomination for his fine, studied turn as the ageing spook George Smiley in Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy.) It will be a pity if his Churchill comes to be seen as his late-career pinnacle when he has done so much else that is so much better. But time is marching on and Day-Lewis, who is retiring after Phantom Thread, already has three best actor Oscars; Darkest Hour is Oldman’s best chance of decorating his mantelpiece. He has been disarmingly honest about his career and its shortcomings: he once described his great 1980s performances as giving him “a push up to the middle, where I’ve been ever since”. With this in mind, those rooting for Oldman seem to be asking: if not now, then when? While Day-Lewis has picked his parts carefully over the last few decades, Oldman has often vacuumed up whatever was available, happy to pay the bills instead of guarding the reputation. It wasn’t always so. In 1984, the director Stephen Frears offered Oldman the part of an ex-National Front bully boy who falls in love with a Pakistani entrepreneur in My Beautiful Laundrette. “Well, to be really honest with you, it’s not how people talk, is it, in London?” Oldman said after reading Hanif Kureishi’s script. “So, not interested, really?” Frears asked. “No, not really.” The role went to Day-Lewis and put a rocket under his career; soon, he had won his first best actor Oscar, for My Left Foot. Not that Oldman was on his uppers. After arresting work as an aimless skinhead in Mike Leigh’s Meantime, he delivered two of the most humane, indelible performances of that decade, both as doomed real-life figures: Sex Pistols bassist Sid Vicious in Alex Cox’s Sid and Nancy, one of the most searching films in all of British cinema, and the impish playwright Joe Orton in Prick Up Your Ears (directed by Frears and written by Alan Bennett). With those pictures following one another straight out of the gate, audiences could marvel at his versatility as well as his talent. The pogoing, bull-in-a-china-shop Sid Vicious swagger, right next to Orton’s prowling, feline grace. How could it be the same man? He filled out that decade with more eccentricity and fearlessness: Nicolas Roeg and Dennis Potter’s Track 29, a kind of Oedipal Looney Tune, and Alan Clarke’s The Firm, in which he was chilling as an estate agent with a nasty moustache and a nastier sideline in hooliganism. The plum roles were his for the taking. He played Dracula for Coppola, Lee Harvey Oswald for Oliver Stone, Beethoven in Immortal Beloved. It can sometimes seem as if Gandhi and Virginia Woolf were the only major roles to have eluded him. During this golden period, which saw him convert the integrity and intensity of his British work into cold, hard dollars (and prompted a move to the US, where he has lived since), other forces intervened. He began to live hard and drink harder; he went in and out of rehab as though his braces were caught on the door. He was drawn to the edge of the cliff on screen as well as off, with demented showboating to rival Pacino at his hammiest in Léon and Air Force One. But these undistinguished movies served a purpose: they helped fund his searing directorial debut, Nil By Mouth. Based on his upbringing in New Cross, it picked over the lives of one family (a violent man, his black-and-blue partner, her smack-addicted brother) on an oppressive council estate, though Oldman corrected, belatedly, the misapprehension that the main character was based on his father: “[He] was never violent. He just used to come home and go to bed.” It remains his only film as a director: alert, tender, beautiful and horrifying, with not a single false note or superficial choice. ‘I went to drama school, did plays, lived in the States for a long time. But when I sat down to write it in New York, it all just came out. It’s that old thing: no matter where you go, you pack yourself in your suitcase with all your issues, all your baggage.” If one were forced to name Oldman’s greatest contribution to cinema, it would not be perverse to pick this film, in which he is vividly present without once showing his face. If most of his fiercest screen acting work predates Nil By Mouth, that can be perhaps attributed to the personal and professional uncertainty that set in in the early part of this century. When his third marriage, to photographer Donya Fiorentino, ended in 2001, leaving him with custody of his two youngest sons, he reassessed his life. “I woke up one day and was 43 years old and I was a single dad and had these two kids. It wasn’t exactly what I’d planned, but there it was, in front of me… So I just made a decision to be at home more. It was an opportunity to do it in the way I’d always imagined doing it, albeit doing it on my own.” Shortly before, he had also faced a difficult period in Hollywood, when perceptions surrounding his rightwing views, which arose in interviews when he played a Republican senator in The Contender, were rumoured to have cost him work in that liberal industry. Since then, he has concentrated on doing only movies that would pay handsomely and take him away from home as little as possible, which is how he came to feature in two of the biggest blockbuster franchises in cinema history: Harry Potter (where he was Harry’s godfather, Sirius Black, from the third instalment onwards) and the Dark Knight trilogy (in which he played Police Commissioner James Gordon). In 2012, he was crowned the highest-grossing screen actor in history, an accolade that must have been some consolation after toiling thanklessly on films such as the computer-animated A Christmas Carol and the forgotten cartoon, Planet 51. “Really good leading roles are few and far between,” he reasoned. “Alan Bennett isn’t writing Prick Up Your Ears every year, so there’s a quality of writing that doesn’t exist any more. I think the times are changing and you just have to cope and change with the times.” After all he has been through and the groundbreaking work that went unrewarded at the start of his career, it would be churlish to begrudge him the opportunity represented by Darkest Hour – no matter that his Churchill is the most naked appeal for attention at the Oscars since the ceremony was invaded by a streaker. Darkest Hour is released on 12 January THE OLDMAN FILE Born Gary Leonard Oldman, London, on 21 March 1958 to Leonard, a welder, who left when his son was seven, and Kathleen, who raised Oldman and his sister, Maureen, (who starred in Nil By Mouth and EastEnders under her screen name Laila Morse). Best of times An extraordinary early run of daring, intelligent performances in great films, among them Sid and Nancy and Prick Up Your Ears, guaranteed Oldman’s reputation remained intact when these peaks were followed inevitably by troughs. Nil By Mouth, his one film as director, proved he was just as compelling behind the camera. Worst of times Alcoholism in the early 1990s. He appeared to defend Mel Gibson’s antisemitism in a 2014 interview (“Gibson is in a town that’s run by Jews”) and was forced to apologise. What he says “I think what it comes down to is that acting is an antidote to self-hatred.” What they say “Whatever he’s done in his life, he’s brought to good service. At times, it might have been perceived as being bad for him, but it’s always benefited him and his personality and his acting. The bad times make him better.” Director Tony Scott."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/dec/31/it-may-be-good-fun-but-its-not-always-good-history-the-crown","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-31T00:02:15Z","webTitle":"It may be good fun, but it’s not always good history | Sonia Sodha","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/31/it-may-be-good-fun-but-its-not-always-good-history-the-crown","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/31/it-may-be-good-fun-but-its-not-always-good-history-the-crown","fields":{"headline":"It may be good fun, but it’s not always good history","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"It says much about how our patterns of media consumption have changed that my festive top pick wasn’t the BBC’s big-ticket Christmas Day offering, but the second series of the Netflix drama The Crown. It didn’t disappoint: its combination of emotional drama, sweeping history and exquisite acting made it one of the most entertaining things I’ve watched in 2017. I suspect I’m not alone in consuming most of my history through popular culture. I’d struggle to name a straight-up history book I’ve read this year. But I cheered the Dunkirk flotilla in its stunning cinematic depiction and shed a tear alongside Jackie Kennedy in this year’s biopic. I’m looking forward to the new Churchill film in January, while I was gutted to hear that the final instalment in Hilary Mantel’s trilogy of novels about Thomas Cromwell may be delayed until 2019. I remember my first A-level history essay: the red pen scoring the section where I naively wrote that Henry VII sacrificing his teenage daughter, Margaret, to an arranged marriage showed just how much he wanted the alliance with Scotland. “That’s why we’ve picked an early modern syllabus,” my history teacher drily remarked. “It forces you to act more like a real historian.” The academic study of history as an attempt to arrive at as full and accurate an account of what happened is critical to understanding our past, but I think it’s fine – indeed, for the best – to leave that to academic historians. It would be easy to be prissy about box sets. Most discussion about history for the masses centres on the school curriculum, as if that were a history fix-all. But I’d struggle to recall more than the broad outlines of what I studied then and there are periods of history that are neglected and overlooked by the curriculum, such as the postwar period that The Crown focuses on. Naturally, there are risks to taking in your history alongside your entertainment. There’s only one take on offer and popular historical depictions very much tend to play to the mores of the time. The dark side of Britain’s colonial past has long been papered over in our popular culture. The boundary between popular history and propaganda can sometimes be fuzzy. But to what extent is there ever such a thing as “pure” history, anyway? This is a theme eloquently explored by Mantel in this year’s Reith lectures. Confronting pupils with conflicting source material is one of the first lessons of grownup history: there is no one “true” interpretation of events. Historians may engage in an admirable search for the truth, but no historian can claim to present a neutral account: even if they stick to bone-dry facts corroborated by multiple sources, picking which ones to use is in itself interpretation. Mantel argues that historical novelists have a different responsibility to the truth than historians: readers understand that a novel based on real events featuring real people will deploy creative speculation to fill in the gaps. But she counsels that even novelists should pay heed to the truth in so far as it can be established. “Don’t lie, don’t go against known facts,” she warns. For Mantel, this is important because it improves the story. “The reason you must stick by the truth is that it is better, stranger, stronger, than anything you can make up.” But in depicting real events of the past, artists also have a responsibility to tell the truth because popular culture is how so many of us learn about history. And it’s here that The Crown overstepped the mark. I was comfortable with creator Peter Morgan’s speculation about the inner workings of the Queen’s mind given the dearth of source material. But I felt a bit cheated that he chose to fabricate quite so much about historical events. The series is flush with examples, but two periods in particular stood out. In an episode about a 1961 presidential visit to Buckingham Palace, The Crown depicts Jackie Kennedy making disparaging comments about the Queen that quickly get back to her. It is this that spurs the Queen to fly to Ghana to convince President Nkrumah to stay in the Commonwealth, pulling off a diplomatic tour de force. Jackie Kennedy later requests an audience with the Queen in which she apologises profusely for her comments, although not before a mean JFK half-congratulates, half-berates his wife for changing the course of history. According to the historian Hugo Vickers, while there is some evidence that Jackie Kennedy’s perceptions of the Queen were not wholly positive, most of this account, including the link to the Ghana visit, was made up. Another poignant episode centres on Prince Philip’s decision to send Prince Charles to Gordonstoun, juxtaposing Charles’s miserable first few months there with flashbacks to Philip’s time at the school. It depicts the death of Philip’s beloved sister, Cecilie, in a plane crash, followed by his father subsequently blaming him for her death because she was on the flight as an indirect result of Philip acting up at school. But in reality, Cecilie had always planned to be on that particular flight. These also happened to be my two favourite episodes, but I’m not sure a similar dramatic effect couldn’t have been achieved without all that fabrication. It went way beyond the creative speculation we can reasonably expect from popular dramatisations, crossing the line into making up pure fiction about living people. The Crown is far from the only culprit; there’s a plethora of films and box sets that make similar historical transgressions, including this year’s The Viceroy’s House, about the partition of India and Pakistan. I’ll continue to avidly consume popular history in 2018. But in this era of fake news, creators of dramas such as The Crown have more of a responsibility to the truth than they seem to realise."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"football/2017/dec/30/premier-league-fans-january-transfer-window","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-30T12:28:32Z","webTitle":"Premier League: fans from all 20 clubs make their transfer window selections","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/dec/30/premier-league-fans-january-transfer-window","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/dec/30/premier-league-fans-january-transfer-window","fields":{"headline":"Premier League: fans from all 20 clubs make their transfer window selections","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Arsenal Hopefully our new suits will begin to make their mark, bringing some knowledge of continental rough diamonds. Sadly I can’t see Wenger admitting that Xhaka’s a Jack-of-no-trades and signing Carvalho (or even an ageing Nzonzi) as a dedicated defensive midfielder. Otherwise, our targets will be dictated by contracts for existing players, thanks to the rank incompetence that resulted in Sánchez, Özil and Wilshere being imminently out of contract.

I’d also like a new right-back to give Adam Smith some competition, but again Eddie seems happy to patch up by shifting Simon Francis over when Smith is unavailable.

Dries Mertens would also be most welcome but Napoli have no obvious reason to sell. Atlético seem to be a selling club so maybe Antoine Griezmann could be prised from their clutches.

Crystal Palace We’ve been suffering badly from having only one fit striker. It was a bizarre gamble in the summer window, and backfired badly when Benteke was injured too. With Connor Wickham still not near fitness, a forward has to be the priority. Besiktas’s Cenk Tosun was heavily linked a few months ago but he’s at Everton now; several other names are floating around. Elsewhere, a winger to provide some competition and cover for Townsend and Zaha wouldn’t go amiss, while a quality keeper has to be on the cards. Julian Speroni is assured legend status, but he’s not the long-term solution. Neither is Diego López, the 36-year-old Espanyol goalkeeper, who has been heavily linked. What gives us hope is that the player search is being led by our director of football, Dougie Freedman, who picked up Mile Jedinak and Yannick Bolasie for peanuts when he was manager. He has been to Uruguay, Germany, and Spain looking for strikers, while also looking in League One for potential up-and-coming stars. - Chris Waters palacetrust.org.uk, @Clapham_Grand Possible targets: Diego López (Espanyol), Kevin Trapp (PSG), Bartosz Bialkowski (Ipswich), Ben Watson (Watford), Zé Luís (S Moscow), Nicolás Gaitán (Atlético Madrid), Karl Toko Ekambi (Angers).

There were also some reports that Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang could be on his way from Dortmund, but, as much as I love the thought, I won’t be holding my breath on that one. We also need a left-back as Leighton Baines has started to pick up injuries more often, meaning we’ve had to play right-back Martina out of position. - Steve Jones @bluekippercom Possible targets: Cenk Tosun (Besiktas), Patrick van Aanholt (Crystal Palace), Nicolás Gaitán (Atlético Madrid), Karl Toko Ekambi (Angers), Steven Nzonzi (Sevilla), Mallik Wilks (Leeds). Huddersfield Our Premier League status is a miracle in itself – trying to hold on to it through the second half of the season will probably require some investment, though. We could really do with a dynamic No10, someone capable of unlocking defences and complementing the power of Laurent Depoitre and Steve Mounié. David Wagner has been pretty coy about it: “I have my eye on the market, but it’s my job to have my eye on the market. If I don’t have the feeling that we have to do something today, tomorrow is totally different.” - Alex Taylor @bluekippercom Possible targets: Almamy Touré (Monaco), Kyle Scott (Chelsea). Leicester City Adrien Silva will be a nice start. We signed him 14 seconds too late for the deadline in August, so he’s been waiting for a debut ever since. Elsewhere, there are still questions over our ability to defend set pieces and defensive cover wouldn’t go amiss, even with Huth and Dragovic more than capable on their day. We could also do with another option on the wings – but other than that our squad is well balanced. - Chris Whiting thechriswhitingshow.wordpress.com, @ChrisRWhiting Possible targets: Hatem Ben Arfa (PSG), Andre Almeida (Benfica), Solomon Kvirkvelia (Lokomotiv Moscow), Kyle Scott (Chelsea). Liverpool Groundhog day. When we’re having a bad day it feels the midfield are edgy because they don’t trust the back four and the back four are jumpy because they don’t have complete faith in the keeper. So, we need a keeper. Mignolet is much improved, but it can feel like he always has a mistake in him – I’d love Atlético Madrid’s Jan Oblak. We’ve finally signed Virgil van Dijk, but still need another – Lazio’s Stefan de Vrij looks like he’d be a good fit and rumours are doing the rounds we’re interested. We should probably add in a central defensive midfielder, too. We have a top line-up of front men, but it’s Coutinho who makes it work at its best, so hopefully talk of Barcelona cooling on wanting him is true and we can keep hold of him, at least until summer. - Steph Jones Possible targets: Stefan de Vrij (Lazio), Thomas Lemar (Monaco), Kevin Trapp (PSG), Hirving Lozano (PSV), Leon Goretzka (Schalke). Manchester City A centre-half is an absolute must. John Stones’s injury highlighted how threadbare we are in that position, primarily due to Vincent Kompany’s unique fitness situation. There was a lot of talk of Virgil van Dijk, which I would have been happy with: he has the credentials required to play in a Pep Guardiola defence – fast, strong, good on the ball and dominant in the air. Liverpool got there first – but those are the qualities we still need to find. Left-back is another area we could look to strengthen, but given Delph’s excellent form I’d be surprised if we made a big move in the market. - Lloyd Scragg ninetythreetwenty.com, @lloyd_scragg Possible targets: Jonny Evans (West Brom), Iñigo Martínez (Real Sociedad), Samuel Umtiti (Barcelona), Alexis Sánchez (Arsenal), Wilfried Zaha (Crystal Palace), Julian Weigl (Borussia Dortmund). Manchester United We’re being linked with all the usual faces: Gareth Bale, Antoine Griezmann and all decent ex-Mourinho players who are currently keeping the bench warm somewhere – but I honestly can’t see anyone coming in. We look in need of two full-backs, a central midfielder, a right winger and an additional forward, but I expect the real moves to come in the summer, when at least five players will depart. - Shaun O’Donnell Possible targets: Samuel Umtiti (Barcelona), André Gomes (Barcelona), Julian Weigl (Borussia Dortmund), Sergej Milinkovic-Savic (Lazio), Gareth Bale (Real Madrid), Antoine Griezmann (Atlético Madrid), Malcom (Bordeaux), Jorginho (Napoli), Mateo Kovacic (Real Madrid), Riyad Mahrez (Leicester). Newcastle United What we need and what we’ll get are two different things. The team needs major surgery: a quick, predatory goalscorer (or three), a commanding midfielder capable of dictating play, an experienced, specialist left-back … they’re all essential to our survival. While Karl Darlow and Rob Elliot have served us well in the past, we can now see why Rafa was interested in recruiting Pepe Reina in the summer. - Richard &amp; David Holmes Possible targets: Danny Ings (Liverpool), Emerson Palmieri (Roma), Chris Willock (Benfica), Islam Slimani (Leicester), Kiko Casilla (Real Madrid), Kenedy (Chelsea, loan). Southampton Who do we need to sign? Anyone with some pace. Literally anyone. Please, just someone who can run beyond a full-back. Nathan Redmond just isn’t cutting it, yet despite his non-existent performances he’s still getting regular games. Our previous reputation as a young, exciting team is slipping: we’re in danger of becoming a bit aged and stale, so you could argue that pretty much every area of the team could do with freshening up with some younger blood. Perhaps a young keeper to put a bit of pressure on Forster and maybe another striker so Shane Long isn’t one of the few options available. - Steve Grant saintsweb.co.uk, @SteveGrant1983 Possible targets: Nicolás Gaitán (A Madrid), Theo Walcott (Arsenal), Daniel Sturridge (Liverpool), Ryan Sessegnon (Fulham). Stoke City We’re in a strange situation. We obviously need reinforcements, but its hard to see the board giving Mark Hughes any significant money to spend right now: I certainly wouldn’t if it was my money. The two most crucial areas are clear. Despite all of Fletcher’s experience we can’t rely on him to carry the team week in week out; and it was obvious all summer we needed two new full-backs – that hasn’t magically sorted itself out, either. Holding on to Butland and Shaqiri will be just as important, too. - Rob Holloway Possible targets: Danny Ings (Liverpool), Daniel Sturridge (Liverpool), Dusko Tosic (Besiktas), Daniel Opare (FC Augsburg). Swansea City Our big problem is a lack of an attacking midfielder: our owners didn’t feel the need to replace Gylfi Sigurdsson in the summer. Among other needs are another striker – Bony is injury-prone and we can’t seem to play to Abraham’s strengths – and a right-back. But the feeling among many fans is a lack of trust in the club to bring in quality players. It feels like the damage is done and it’s just too late to turn things around. - Kevin Elphick Swansea.vitalfootball.co.uk Possible targets: Daniel Opare (FC Augsburg), Danny Ings (Liverpool). Tottenham I don’t think we need Ross Barkley, but we do need a pacey midfielder. Son is quick, but we need more options like him: an impact player who will beat a man, at pace and on the counter. Thomas Lemar or Riyad Mahrez would be lovely. Another striker would also be great, with Anthony Martial a quality prospect – though the likelihood of United selling seems very slim. - Jonny Holmes Possible targets: Yannick Ferreira Carrasco (Atlético Madrid), Malcom (Bordeaux), Thomas Lemar (Monaco), Dusko Tosic (Besiktas), Ross Barkley (Everton). Watford We could do with more options in wide attacking positions, where we’re susceptible to injuries: Richarlíson has played almost every minute. But rebuffing interest in the Brazilian and in midfield star Abdoulaye Doucouré is perhaps more important than who we bring in. Defensive frailties would be resolved by a kinder injury list, while we also need a way to make our forward line work. Another option there would be useful given that Stefano Okaka seems keen to move on. - Matt Rowson bhappy.wordpress.com, @mattrowson Possible targets: Luke Shaw (Manchester United), Theo Walcott (Arsenal), Pontus Dahlberg (IFK Goteborg). West Brom It’s going to be a difficult month. We’ve pretty much maxed out on wages due to financial fair play rules, so we can wish all we like but unless we move players out we’re stuck with what we have. The big clubs knew exactly what they were doing with FFP. We badly need striking options, though, and Danny Ings or Daniel Sturridge, if fit, would be decent loans. But they are big ifs. - Richard Jefferson wbaunofficial.org.uk/forum @richbaggie Possible targets: Mallik Wilks (Leeds), Solomon Kvirkvelia (Lokomotiv Moscow), Danny Ings (Liverpool), Daniel Sturridge (Liverpool), Aleksandar Mitrovic (Newcastle), Ben Mee (Burnley). West Ham We need another creative midfielder to take the pressure off Manuel Lanzini – a Jack Wilshere type, though he’s unlikely to leave Arsenal. A bit of power from the likes of Watford’s Doucouré would be useful too. The squad is also struggling with ageing and injured centre-backs and Alfie Mawson might be a promising signing. We also need to unload clearly unhappy players such as Diafra Sakho. - Pete May Author of Goodbye to Boleyn, hammersintheheart.blogspot.co.uk Possible targets: André Schürrle (Borussia Dortmund, loan), Hatem Ben Arfa (PSG), Danny Ings (Liverpool), Alfie Mawson (Swansea), Jonjo Shelvey (Newcastle), Joe Allen (Stoke)."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"books/2017/dec/30/val-mcdermid-susan-ferrier-edinburgh-scottish-jane-austen","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-30T20:30:10Z","webTitle":"Resurrection woman: crime writer revives reputation of the ‘Scottish Jane Austen’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/dec/30/val-mcdermid-susan-ferrier-edinburgh-scottish-jane-austen","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2017/dec/30/val-mcdermid-susan-ferrier-edinburgh-scottish-jane-austen","fields":{"headline":"Resurrection woman: crime writer revives reputation of the ‘Scottish Jane Austen’","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Edinburgh’s eerie gothic past, with its notorious “resurrection men” digging up graves under cover of the night in order to provide medical students with cadavers to dissect, is to receive a positive spin this New Year’s Day. Once the revelry of the city’s Hogmanay celebrations has dwindled, the Scottish author Val McDermid has a plan to “resurrect” a forgotten literary heroine – the 19th-century Scottish novelist Susan Edmonstone Ferrier. “Her writing stands up very well in comparison with the big-name Scottish writers of her day, like Sir Walter Scott, but the most remarkable thing about Ferrier is that memory of her has all but disappeared,” McDermid told the Observer this weekend, as she prepared for the launch of a city-wide project called New Year’s Resurrection that will run until 25 January. Using light displays designed by the Edinburgh-based specialists Double Take Projections and sound installations from Michael John McCarthy, Pippa Murphy and RJ McConnell, the crime writer plans to bring Ferrier back to life in the streets and steep “wynds” she once walked. “I don’t think anything like this has ever been done before,” said McDermid, who is best known for her novel The Wire in the Blood. “As far as I know, there has never been an attempt to tell one story across 12 sites in one city.” McDermid, who promises her story will also offer a few of her characteristically gruesome themes, said she was determined to re-establish Ferrier’s reputation so that one day she might stand alongside the male literary giants who have lived and worked in the city, such as Scott, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, Robert Louis Stevenson and Thomas De Quincey, and as a worthy predecessor to Edinburgh’s acclaimed female novelists Muriel Spark and JK Rowling. “I first came across Ferrier’s work when I was an undergraduate at Oxford,” said McDermid. “We were studying the early development of the novel, and I was interested in finding out if there were any Scottish writers working in that form then.” Ferrier’s work was “wildly popular in her lifetime”, according to McDermid. Her first work, Marriage, was written in 1810 but was published eight years later anonymously by the Edinburgh publisher William Blackwood. The first edition of 1,500 copies sold out within six months at a guinea a time, although at first many readers believed it had been written by Scott. Last week Virago republished Ferrier’s Marriage with a new foreword by McDermid to coincide with the Edinburgh project and on the eve of the 200th anniversary of its initial release. Ferrier went on to write a further two novels, The Inheritance and Destiny, which McDermid has described as “observant, witty and throwing wide a window on Scottish social life of the period”. “For me, her work started off as a curiosity, but then I found it stood up against the competition at the time,” said McDermid. “It has certainly been the case that much of what people think of as Scottish writing is influenced by writers such as Scott, which is full of noble highlanders and battles and tartan. And those writers who did not provide as much of all that then rather fell by the wayside.” McDermid’s project has been co-commissioned by the Edinburgh International Book Festival, and she has worked with the director and dramaturg Philip Howard from the theatre company Pearlfisher and with the graffiti artist Elph and the actors Sandy McDade and Phyllis Logan. “It is a story and a walking tour but also a quasi-theatrical experience, and we have quite a few tricks up our sleeves,” Howard said. “Ferrier’s is a remarkable story, and Val asks some very topical questions about why, as a female Scottish writer, Ferrier has been excised from the literary history of the nation. “It’s a beautiful piece of storytelling, but Val has had a lot of fun with it as well. We’re treading a course between honouring Susan’s legacy and restoring her voice and having a little bit of a crime caper along the way.” The story is inspired by the 19th-century tradition of publishing novels chapter by chapter and will begin at the historic Signet Library in the Old Town’s Parliament Square. Readers will then have to go on from one location to another to read the whole story, following instructions from an app, available in seven languages, or by more conventional street signage. The mystery of Ferrier’s disappearance from bookshelves, McDermid argues, is as much down to her subject matter as her gender. “But I do think there was a feeling around then that if we already have one famous female author in Jane Austen, we don’t need any more,” said McDermid. “That, after all, is why the Brontës and George Eliot had to write as men. Yet she earned significantly more substantial publisher advances than Jane Austen. And now almost nobody knows her name. Susan Ferrier deserves better than this.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"football/live/2017/dec/30/manchester-united-v-southampton-premier-league-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-30T19:28:29Z","webTitle":"Manchester United 0-0 Southampton: Premier League – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2017/dec/30/manchester-united-v-southampton-premier-league-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/live/2017/dec/30/manchester-united-v-southampton-premier-league-live","fields":{"headline":"Manchester United 0-0 Southampton: Premier League – as it happened","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Boooooooooooo! United are jeered off after an underwhelming draw, which extends their winless run to four games. They looked ponderous, low on confidence and lacking leadership; Southampton were determined, organised and might have nicked it on the break. Thanks for your company, goodnight! 90+2 min Yoshida makes an excellent sliding tackle to block Martial’s cross, and the resulting corner comes to nothing. 90+1 min There will be three minutes of added time. A loose ball is about to fall for Lingard six yards out when Stephens stretches to make a vital interception. 90 min Hoedt makes a superb block to deny Lingard. He was found in space by Mata, 15 yards from goal, and opened his body to sidefoot towards goal when Hoedt appeared from nowhere. 89 min United are finally putting Southampton under extended pressure, though it’s all a bit desperate. 87 min United have been poor in the second half. They certainly don’t deserve to win the game. 85 min Redmond replaces Boufal for Southampton. We’ve just seen a few replays of Pogba’s disallowed goal. On reflection, the ball might have bounced in off the post without his touch. There was also a slight touch from the keeper McCarthy before it got to Pogba. Does that mean it should have been a new phase of play and Pogba was therefore onside? I lost touch with the offside law sometime in 2004 so I’m not sure. 83 min A dismal header from Lindelof falls for McQueen, who cracks a cross shot well wide. 82 min Lemina on, Tadic off for Southampton. 81 min Pogba has a goal disallowed for offside. He stabbed a deflected shot into the net from two yards after a scramble in the box. It might have sneaked in without his touch, in which case it would have stood, though I suspect it would have rebounded off the post if Pogba had left it. 80 min Ward-Prowse is booked for kicking Lingard in the chest. 79 min Manolo Gabbiadini replaces Shane Long, who has put in his usual lung-busting shift. 78 min Here’s Peter Oh. “Unless Guardiola wins something with Wimbledon FC he won’t fully convince me either.” Yeah. And let’s see him produce orgiastic football with Beighton Miners Welfare FC. 77 min Martial hares into the area from the left and blunders through a couple of defenders, with the ball running back to Rashford. He tries to place a shot into the far corner and it’s blocked by McQueen. 76 min After a good move involving Boufal and Long, Tadic dribbles a tame shot well wide from 18 yards. Southampton look the likelier scores, with United looking a bit lost. 74 min “’Love him or hate him, you can’t ignore him!’ is a tired old cliche, but it was, for a very long time, true of Jose Mourinho,” says Gary Naylor. “But now? Unless one is invested in Manchester United, he feels totally irrelevant, the spats as predictable as a pantomime villain’s, the football blandly effective to a point, the results trundling along in the middle lane, neither disastrous nor triumphant. He must hate it - at least, I hope so.” I wonder what the turning point was. I have a vague theory that the experience of managing Real Madrid – the strain of trying to ruin one of the greatest teams of all time, the dressing-room politics, the boardroom politics, the media politics – took away some of his spark. He’s still a bloody good coach, and I think he’ll win the title with United if he’s given time, but he has become so sour. 71 min Boufal’s cross is headed over by Tadic, ten yards from goal. The cross was quite flat, with no pace on it, so it was a tricky header to execute. But the way this game has gone, a Southampton winner would not be a huge shock. 70 min Matic lines one up from 30 yards. Goal kick to Southampton. 68 min “I agree that sometimes, there’s a man, well, he’s the man for his time and place,” says Niall Mullen. “He fits right in there. And that’s Pep, at Manchester City. Nonetheless I don’t think it should be taken as a given that City’s players are light years ahead of United’s. For example if you asked me who had the most talent, Raheem Sterling or Tony Martial I would say Martial every time. Yet Sterling is outperforming him all season. Could be many reasons for this I guess but I’m giving Pep the credit.” Yep, that’s a fair point. The FA should throw all the money in the world at Guardiola and try to get him involved with England in the next few years, especially as he is already working with a few of the squad. If he can’t change the culture of English football, nobody can. Might even be worth trying to use him as a consultant at the World Cup. 67 min Young’s free-kick deflects off Stephens in the wall and goes a few yards wide of the near post. United make a Horlicks of the corner. 66 min Martial makes an instant impact, winning a free-kick 25 yards from goal. 65 min The inevitable substitution has happened. Anthony Martial replaces poor Henrikh Mkhitaryan, who had a Bebe. 64 min Zlatan isn’t on the bench for United. They could use his leadership now. That’s one of the bigger problems with this team, I think; a lack of leaders. It’s in total contrast to Mourinho’s first Chelsea team. 63 min “You said if Guardiola wants to go down as the greatest manager of all time, he needs to win something with Rushden &amp; Diamonds,” says Mike Baldwin. “He’d would be, indeed. Seeing as the mighty Diamonds folded a few years back.” Typical Guardian ignorance of the lower leagues. 62 min Pogba sprays another crossfield pass out to Mkhitaryan, who wallops a cross out for a goalkick and is helpfully jeered by the crowd. Poor bloke; his confidence is shot. 60 min Lingard is booked for a lunge at Stephens. 60 min “Now that we’re all competing for coldest temperature, you can tell Rachel and Kevin that Saskatoon is sitting pretty at -29C, feeling like -44C,” says Kristina Holm. “That makes us colder than both Poles. Too bad this game isn’t warming the cockles of my heart.” 59 min Ashley Young may be in trouble after the game, with a video showing him plant an elbow in the stomach of Tadic off the ball. That has potential for a retrospective three-match ban, which will really please Jose Mourinho. 58 min Boufal is booked for repeat offending. 54 min “Re your exchange with Gerry Scott @32 min, do you think Spurs will be able to hang together for as long as it takes for Levy to start writing proper checks?” says Ron Stack. “I think Spurs have a plan the way City have a plan, but they haven’t spent near enough to make it happen and it seems like time is running out. Your thoughts?” No. I would love them to win a big trophy but I don’t think it will happen. The FA Cup, maybe. I suspect they have – at most – 18 months before the team starts to break up. They’ll become a romantic ‘what if’ team, like Yugoslavia 1992, Newcastle 1996, Denmark 1986 and the rest. 53 min Southampton could win this. United look a bit short on confidence and leadership. I don’t think it’ll be long before we see Anthony Martial. 52 min “Evening Rob,” says Simon McMahon. “The darts is dead to me now that Gary Anderson is out, but a Taylor - Van Gerwen final would be, how to say ... competitive? And a great story whichever way you look at it.” Don’t get me started on that. I’ve kept really quiet… Gary Anderson, though. As somebody said of Alastair Cook, he makes me want to be a better person. 50 min De Gea makes another good save! Ward-Prowse curled a precise low ball into the box from the right, and Long got in front of Matic to stab a first-time shot towards goal. It flew towards De Gea, who thrust out his right foot to kick the ball over his own bar. 49 min “In comparing Guardiola &amp; Mourinho I think the real question is what would each do with the other’s set of players,” says Niall Mullen. “My suspicion is that Mourinho would not get half the tune Pep has out of Sterling &amp; Sane (say) while I imagine Martial, Mkhitaryan &amp; Rashford being considerably better under Guardiola.” What about the other 20 players? Guardiola has redefined football but he has always had elite players. Guardiola reaches greater heights; Mourinho is a superior all-weather manager. In my opinion, if Guardiola wants to go down as the greatest manager of all time, he needs to win something with Rushden &amp; Diamonds. 48 min The impressive Boufal plays a good ball down the left to McQueen, whose first-time cross is put behind by Lindelof. 47 min “Tell Rachel that -7C sounds quite balmy at the moment,” says Kevin Smith, “as Ottawa is a lovely -18C, feels like -26. Good weather for a walk if you ask me.” 46 min United begin the second half. No substitutions on either side. “Hi, Rob,” says Adam Griffiths. “I’ve no emotional involvement in this game (apart from hoping that Lukaku is ok, obviously) so nothing to say about it, but here’s thanking you and your fellow MBMers for all your sterling work this year and a merry new year to you all and to all the readers/emaileriners. May the football gods be kind to you all next year.” Well isn’t that nice? Thanks Adam! And have some of that, digital ne’er-do-wells! Half-time viewing Peep peep! That was a poor half with a few good bits. Jose Mourinho is moaning at the fourth official as they walk towards the tunnel. See you in 15 minutes for the second half. 45+5 min It’s gone a bit flat. Boufal looks lively on the break for Southampton, as do Pogba and Rashford for United. Neither side deserves to be ahead. 45+3 min “You mentioned the winter of 1989,” says Gordon Pittendrigh. “As the last chart of 1989 had Live Aid 2 at number one, Jive Bunny at number 2, Jason Donovan at number three and Andy Stewart at number four with Donald Where’s You’re Trousers, I don’t think we need to mention that period of time again.” Yeah, but Phil Collins had just released Another Day In Paradise, so it’s swings and roundabouts. 45+1 min There will be six minutes off added time. Matic’s low drive from 20 yards is comfortably saved by McCarthy. 45 min Hoedt is booked for something or other. 44 min That’s better from Mkhitaryan, a fast cross from the left that is flicked just wide by the head of Lingard. He probably should have hit the target as well. The move started with a majestic crossfield pass from Pogba, who is starting to influence the match. 41 min Des Kelly, BT Sport’s Touchline Man, says there are no plans to take Lukaku to hospital. Whether he’ll be allowed to play at Everton on New Year’s Day, I don’t know. 40 min “Hello from a very snowy and cold New York,” says Rachel Clifton. “It’s -7C here - -13 with wind chill - so that’s a good reason to stay in and watch Saints and eat Thai red curry. Am increasingly concerned about Is getting relegated this season...” Yeah, but you on the plus side, you live in New York. 39 min Chris Foy on BT Sport says the referee was right not to give a penalty against Yoshida because it wasn’t deliberate. I’ve never understood that - hardly any penalties given for handball are deliberate. 38 min Matic splats one into orbit from 35 yards. 35 min It’s a good game, this. Rashford looks really sharp in his favourite position of centre-forward. 33 min United have a huge penalty appeal turned down. Lingard did brilliantly to first kill and then juggle Pogba’s dinked pass into the area. He tried to flick it away from the covering Yoshida, whose outstretched hand definitely touched the ball. Southampton will say it wasn’t deliberate; United will say his hands were where they shouldn’t have been. 32 min “Good evening Rob,” says Gerry Scott. “Having initially scoffed I’ve become more sympathetic to Mourinho’s position about funds. Surely the real problem isn’t the amount he has spent versus Pep but rather the fact that City have been building their squad for years with some degree of planning and consistency whilst Utd have splurged huge sums post Ferguson with no particular rhyme or reason. What is needed is someone to actively build a squad with a consistent vision of how they will play and it is not ridiculous in the current climate to suppose it will take hundreds of millions of pounds. Of course the question of whether Mourinho is the right person to do so is another one entirely.” Yep, I agree with every word. Guardiola inherited a far better squad but also, as you say, a philosophically consistent one. Mourinho inherit a hodgepodge that had every type of footballer from Daley Blind to Marouane Fellaini. I think the job is bigger than Mourinho realised. 30 min Another chance for United. Young reminds everyone that he used to be a winger with a superb run and cross that is headed wide from six yards by Rashford. He couldn’t quite get over the ball to direct it towards goal. 27 min Lindelof clips a good pass over the top for Rashford, who tries to make space for a shot but is crowded out. The ball runs loose to Mata, whose low sidefooted shot from 15 yards is kicked away by McCarthy. 26 min Hojbjerg is booked for a foul on Shaw. 25 min The atmosphere is sluggish and flat, as are United. Mkhitaryan looks particularly rusty. After a cautious start, Southampton are starting to fancy this. 22 min Hoedt misses a superb chance to give Southampton the lead. Ward-Prowse curled a superb cornber from the right that dipped onto the head of Hoedt, who had the run on Matic on the six-yard line. He should have thumped a header past De Gea but allowed it to skim off his forehead and it drifted well wide of the far post. 21 min “Hi Rob,” says Alex Netherton. “I was just wondering, what is your favourite pre-assist of 2017? I know there are so many to choose from!” Are we talking all pre-assists or just half-space ones? 20 min United, led by Rashford, break thrillingly from a Southampton corner. Rashford plays the ball left to Mkhitaryan, who makes a mess of his attempted return pass. 18 min Long harasses Lindelof, who gives away a foul just outside the area on the left. Ward-Prowse might go for goal here. He does, whipping it over the wall towards the near post, and De Gea punches it behind for a corner. 16 min Shaw plays a one-two with Mkhitaryan and flashes a superb cross along the six-yard line. Rashford just couldn’t get there. 14 min “What a sad slump United is in the middle of,” says Geertjan Wielenga. I know. Three games without a win. It’s like the winter of 1989 all over again! 13 min Lukaku has an oxygen mask on as he is stretchered from the field. Marcus Rashford replaces him. 12 min This is a long delay, almost five minutes now. The medical staff are being extremely careful with Lukaku. 10 min Anyone out there? 9 min Lukaku is being eased onto a stretcher. He’s conscious but looks pretty dazed and won’t be taking any further part in this game. 8 min Lukaku is flat on his back after a clash of heads with Hoedt. I’m not sure he’ll be able to continute. 7 min De Gea makes an excellent save! Boufal’s cutback from the right of the box wasn’t cleared by Shaw, a poor piece of defending, and ran to Ward-Prowse. He clipped a low left-footed shot that would have sneaked into the corner but for a superb save down to his left by De Gea. Boufal tried to follow up but he was offside. 4 min Lukaku misses a sitter. Pogba’s flat crossfield pass was controlled beautifully by Mata, who moved the ball onto his left and crossed towards the near post. Lukaku got away from Yoshida and headed over from six yards. He should have scored. 4 min “Good Lord your body clock must be a mess Rob,” says Hubert O’Hearn. “Up all night with the Ashes now back in the evening for the football. Are you going to try for the treble and cover the darts too?” Don’t give The Man ideas. 3 min A slow start, with precisely nothing to report. 1 min Peep peep! Southampton, in their black and blue away kit, kick off. “Remember when is the lowest form of conversation” There’s plenty happening in the 3pm games. You can get the latest news with the man who gives me surname envy, Gregg Bakowski. Henrikh Mkhitaryan starts for the first time since the defeat at Chelsea on 5 November. Luke Shaw starts consecutive league games for the first time since September 2016. Southampton have dropped Fraser Forster and Nathan Redmond. In a World Cup year! Manchester United (4-2-3-1) De Gea; Young, Lindelof, Jones, Shaw; Pogba, Matic; Mata, Mkhitaryan, Lingard; Lukaku. Substitutes: Romero, Blind, Tuanzebe, Rojo, Herrera, Martial, Rashford. Southampton (4-1-4-1) McCarthy; Stephens, Yoshida, Hoedt, McQueen; Romeu; Tadic, Hojbjerg, Ward-Prowse, Boufal; Long. Substitutes: Forster, Bednarek, Pied, Lemina, Redmond, Davis, Gabbiadini. Referee Craig Pawson. Hello. Happy new year! Manchester United will sure be glad to see the back of 2017. It’s been an utterly miserable year, if you discount the two trophies, the 39 wins, the 117 goals and the return to the Champions League. I know it’s a bit more complicated than that but, jeez, football fans are a bloody tough crowd. In this age of entitlement, even the neutrals have unrealistic expectations. No wonder Jose Mourinho has the look of a man whose face has been permanently soured. You’d expect United to end their mini-slump against Southampton, who are in danger of following Swansea’s shortcut from model club to laughing stock. Since the EFL Cup final against United in February, when they lost 3-2 despite being the better side, Southampton have taken only 35 points from 33 league games. That’s relegation form in some cultures. For a team who finished in the top eight in each of the last four seasons, it has come as a bit of a shock. Kick off is at 5.30pm."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/2017/dec/30/steve-smith-century-frustrates-england-as-australia-save-fourth-ashes-test","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-30T05:58:30Z","webTitle":"Steve Smith century frustrates England as Australia save fourth Ashes Test","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/dec/30/steve-smith-century-frustrates-england-as-australia-save-fourth-ashes-test","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/dec/30/steve-smith-century-frustrates-england-as-australia-save-fourth-ashes-test","fields":{"headline":"Steve Smith century frustrates England as Australia save fourth Ashes Test","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"There was still no way past Steve Smith. The pitch may have been as docile as a lamb yet it still required wonderful concentration from Australia’s phenomenal captain to bat for almost seven hours to save the Melbourne Test match. In the process he recorded his 23rd Test century. Finding the key to removing Smith from the crease would have taxed the team at Bletchley Park, let alone the one led by Joe Root. Here Smith played with his usual fidgeting calm, as resolute in saving the game as he was when winning those in Brisbane and Perth. He now revels in self-denial as well as shredding opposition attacks. At the crease he is vaguely reminiscent of Derek Randall, who played his greatest innings here 40 years ago (there has been some footage of the Centenary Test on our screens during the rain breaks). Like Randall there is much pre-delivery movement and a self-taught, idiosyncratic method – though Smith has proven to be a far more prolific and significant batsman. He has the confidence to do it his way. Randall once told me that his Centenary Test innings of 174 was not his favourite knock. Instead he chose his 150 in Sydney in 1978 when he batted for almost 10 hours to overturn England’s first innings deficit of 142. Randall relished that innings because it was out of character. In this series Smith has demonstrated that he can peel off hundreds of different hues depending on the needs of his team. He can enjoy a 259-ball 100 in Melbourne as much as a fast-flowing 138-ball one in Perth. At the moment Smith is simply and serenely the best whatever the circumstances. There were brief moments just before lunch on the final day when the prospect of him running out of partners as England forged on to a remarkable victory was not impossible. Australia lost David Warner and Shaun Marsh in the space of six overs and maybe England scented a chance. For the most of the morning there had been no problems for Australia’s two great batsmen even though they were contained by an England attack that never faltered in its resolve to deny their opponents easy runs. Root shuffled his bowlers and eventually tossed the ball to himself. By now Warner was on 86, eyeing his second hundred of the match and a special landmark. Warner, like Ricky Ponting and Sunil Gavaskar before him, had hit two hundreds in a Test match three times. A record-breaking fourth was on the horizon when he received his first ball from Root. After five hours of rigid self-discipline Warner had a horrible heave, which coincided with the ball gripping on the solitary blemish on the surface, and James Vince calmly caught the ensuing skier. Stuart Broad was recalled and just before the interval he found the edge of Shaun Marsh’s bat. Jonny Bairstow, standing very close because of the moribund nature of the pitch, dived to his left, holding a fine one-handed catch. So at lunch there must have been some nerves in the home dressing room since Australia were effectively 14 for four. After the break Mitchell Marsh, yet to get off the mark, sliced a drive inches short of Vince at backward point. Otherwise the younger Marsh, who had battered the England bowlers in Perth, defended stoutly in an innings that will have impressed his coach, captain and selectors as much as his blazing 181 just over a week ago. He crawled along but with Smith still at the other end this suited the Australians fine. Smith himself pottered along happily to his century and then the captains shook hands at the earliest opportunity. It was a forgettable Test match except for Alastair Cook’s unbeaten 244, which, to his great chagrin, could not change the course of the series though it might change the course of his career. The vultures were circling but they have now been dispersed. He can still bat, but like many players late in their career, a pattern is emerging: there is a tendency to fail more often but once established he knows how to deliver a truly monumental innings. Consistency is harder to find. The match was ruined by a sub-standard pitch. This was akin to asking the best Australian Rules footballers to play on a ploughed field, something the authorities here would never tolerate. As a result the spectacle of one of the great sporting occasions was sadly diminished. This drop-in surface refused to deteriorate as good cricket pitch should and it was not the first time that the MCG has produced a track that is more likely to alienate cricket fans than attract them. It would have been adequate for a Big Bash match. In the spirit of cooperation I have a suggestion: move the Boxing Day Test to Hobart until a solution is found. England can, at least, travel to Sydney with their heads held high, which was more than they could do in 2006 or 2013. They strained every sinew in the field at the MCG but they cannot find the magic formula that disposes of Smith. Australia have added Ashton Agar, the left-arm spinner from WA, to their squad for the final Test and there is a good chance that he will play. The SCG does not encourage spinners as it did several decades ago but there is reckoned to be more assistance for the tweakers than when England last played there. That was not their finest hour. Scott Borthwick was England’s solitary spinner in his only Test and England contrived to lose their 20 wickets in 90 overs. The Test specialists had an embarrassing two days to spend in Sydney before their flights home. This time there is more resolve within the England camp and they won’t be introducing as many debutants in Sydney (in 2014 Borthwick received his first cap along with Gary Ballance and Boyd Rankin when there was barely a wheel left on the wagon). But there is the possibility that they might introduce Mason Crane, who played his one game for New South Wales there last season. Crane would replace Tom Curran or, rather sadly, Moeen Ali, who has never yet been dropped in his career of 48 Test matches."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"uk-news/2017/dec/30/irish-embassy-threatened-over-gift-of-queen-victoria-statue-to-sydney-papers-reveal","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-30T03:26:09Z","webTitle":"Irish embassy threatened over gift of Queen Victoria statue to Sydney, papers reveal","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/dec/30/irish-embassy-threatened-over-gift-of-queen-victoria-statue-to-sydney-papers-reveal","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2017/dec/30/irish-embassy-threatened-over-gift-of-queen-victoria-statue-to-sydney-papers-reveal","fields":{"headline":"Irish embassy threatened over gift of Queen Victoria statue to Sydney, papers reveal","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Ireland’s Australian embassy got “threatening and abusive phone calls” over the government’s gift of a statue of Queen Victoria to the city of Sydney, Irish cabinet papers declassified after 30 years have revealed. The statue, which had been in storage in Ireland for almost 40 years, was sent despite opposition from Ireland’s then finance minister, John Bruton, and the director of the National Museum of Ireland, John Teahan. It has stood outside Sydney’s Queen Victoria Building ever since. Ireland’s Australian embassy wrote to the country’s Department of Foreign Affairs on 23 December 1987 with a report on the unveiling on 20 December, the Irish Times reported. Dermot Brangan, first secretary at the embassy, said he has spoken at the ceremony and Australian officials were very grateful for the statue, but the gift had not gone down well in some quarters. “In the days preceding the unveiling, you should be aware that the embassy received a number of threatening and abusive phone calls about the propriety of an Irish government giving a statue of Victoria as a gift. The callers demanded to know the name of who was going to represent the Irish government at the ceremony and to warn him/her to stay away,” Brangan said. He said a call had also been made to the Sydney’s Daily Telegraph newspaper “from someone claiming to represent the Irish Defence Force – a group unknown to the embassy or indeed the police, warning the people of Sydney to stay away from the unveiling ceremony, threatening to bomb the statue and to picket the ceremony”. “The caller is also reported to have issued a threat against the unnamed Irish government representative.” The embassy was also warned of threats by police special branch officers, whose members escorted Brangan during his stay in Sydney for the unveiling. The statue of Queen Victoria was originally unveiled at Dublin’s Leinster House in 1908. After Irish independence from the UK in 1922, Leinster House became the home of Ireland’s parliament, the Dáil, and the statue stayed there until 1948 when it was moved to storage after decades of protests. In June 1986, Ireland’s ambassador to Australia, Joseph Small, received a request from the office of the lord mayor of Sydney, Doug Sutherland, asking if it would be possible to send Queen Victoria to Australia on loan. Despite the objections, the cabinet agreed to send the statue to Australia “on loan until recalled” and it arrived in 1987. Brangan’s cable to Dublin reported the weather in Sydney at the unveiling was “most inclement with very heavy rain falling”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2017/dec/31/greenwich-museum-staff-strike-over-low-pay-working-conditions","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-31T00:04:15Z","webTitle":"Cutty Sark mutiny: staff asked to join picket lines as dispute hits tourists","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/dec/31/greenwich-museum-staff-strike-over-low-pay-working-conditions","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/dec/31/greenwich-museum-staff-strike-over-low-pay-working-conditions","fields":{"headline":"Cutty Sark mutiny: staff asked to join picket lines as dispute hits tourists","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Braving the high seas and undertaking physically demanding work, the crew of the Cutty Sark might have expected pay to match. Instead, by 1882 the men who sailed what was once Britain’s fastest ship earned just one pound and eight shillings (£1.40) a month – less than agricultural labourers of the time. More than a century later the custodians of Britain’s naval heritage are at the centre of a struggle over pay and working conditions at the vessel’s final resting place. In Britain’s first industrial action of 2018, some of the lowest-paid employees of the Royal Museums Greenwich will go on strike on Monday to protest against changes to their hours, meaning longer shifts and shorter breaks for the same wage. A Unesco world heritage site and one of the UK’s top 10 visitor attractions, the museum in south-east London buzzed as usual this weekend to the footfall of hundreds of tourists from home and abroad. Some 17 million visitors a year now come to the site, which includes the National Maritime Museum, Royal Observatory and a villa known as the Queen’s House. Visitor numbers have more than doubled since the ship underwent a £50m restoration several years ago after being ravaged by a fire. On Monday morning picket lines will be in place at the main entrances on the Royal Museums site. “It’s getting increasingly busy here, whether that’s due to the fall in the value of the pound or down to advertising Greenwich,” said Tristram Spencer, one of up to 60 union members from the front-of-house staff who are expected to take part in the strike. “That’s something that is felt by staff, who are essentially always in the frontline. We are not allowed to sit down, for example, while other galleries have a chair. Then there are colleagues with all kinds of medical conditions who are standing up on hard surfaces or being kept to a single rotation in the one place day in, day out.” In terms of pay, the majority out of around 100 front-of-house staff earn £7.50 an hour (the “national living wage”). “It’s one of the largest things for us, and why people are so upset,” said Spencer. “We are still one of the only London museums where people are not getting the London living wage of £10.20 per hour. Some people can only afford one meal a day.” “When you recall what those on board the Cutty Sark might have earned, then it sort of puts things in perspective. I think people can see how far we have come – or not.” The row stems from contractual changes which visitor and sales assistants say were imposed on them in November. Breaks were reduced by 40 minutes, the working day now runs from 8am-8pm, according to the workers’ union, Prospect. The union adds that for those on the lowest pay, removal of paid breaks means they will effectively lose out when the national living wage increases in April. While staff from the Cutty Sark and other departments at the museum will not be on strike, they are being asked to show support in whatever way they can with their colleagues from the other sites across the road owned by Royal Museums. The picket is not designed to stop members of the public from entering the museum. Kevin Fewster, director of the Royal Museums Greenwich (RMG), said that “harmonised” terms and conditions had been introduced in November for front-of-house staff due to a merger of the museum’s visitor experience and commerce departments. “One of the many proposals on the table was to cease the payment for a rest break, which is in line with most colleague institutions across the sector and includes maintaining annual salaries at existing levels. “This increases hourly rates of pay, and proves an immediate benefit to some part-time staff and those working overtime,” he added. “After consultation, the majority of the RMG front-of-house team have agreed to the new terms and conditions. A reduction of breaks for some of the staff involved has remained at issue, and after a year, of negotiations with the union, discussions have ceased without full agreement being achieved, so the decision was taken to impose the new terms and conditions for those staff who had not yet agreed them.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/dec/30/russia-supreme-court-rules-kremlin-critic-alexei-navalny-cannot-run-president","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-30T14:59:05Z","webTitle":"Russia supreme court rules Kremlin critic cannot run for president","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/dec/30/russia-supreme-court-rules-kremlin-critic-alexei-navalny-cannot-run-president","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/dec/30/russia-supreme-court-rules-kremlin-critic-alexei-navalny-cannot-run-president","fields":{"headline":"Russia supreme court rules Kremlin critic cannot run for president","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Russia’s supreme court has upheld a ban on the government critic Alexei Navalny from running for president, a decision he has vowed to respond to with nationwide protests. “We don’t recognise elections without competition,” Navalny wrote on Twitter after the ruling on Saturday. He did not attend the hearing, which his lawyers say they will appeal against at the European court of human rights. The ruling was widely expected and came after Russia’s central election committee said on 25 December that Navalny, 41, was not allowed to stand for public office until at least 2028 because of a previous fraud conviction. An anti-corruption lawyer with a huge online following, Navalny says the charges were trumped up to prevent him taking on Vladimir Putin in the presidential election in March. He says Putin, who has been in power for 18 years and is widely expected to win re-election, is only prepared to face handpicked rival candidates. Navalny has called for mass demonstrations on 28 January and asked his hundreds of thousands of supporters to boycott the election. He has brought tens of thousands of people onto the streets across Russia for anti-Putin protests twice in 2017. The Kremlin has said Navalny’s calls for an election boycott may be illegal. Although he is currently polling at around 2%, Navalny says he would defeat Putin in “honest elections” if he were allowed to freely promote his anti-corruption policies. The Kremlin critic, who is barred from state television, has been jailed three times in 2017 as he campaigned across Russia in a bid to force his way onto the ballot. He was also nearly blinded when a pro-Kremlin activist threw a chemical into his face. Putin has never publicly referred to Navalny by name , but he said earlier this month that he was a dangerous influence whose calls for protests could plunge Russia into the kind of chaos that engulfed Ukraine after anti-government demonstrations toppled its Moscow-friendly president in 2014."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2017/dec/30/celtic-rangers-scottish-premiership-match-report","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-30T14:04:16Z","webTitle":"Craig Gordon saves Celtic as Rangers impress in goalless Old Firm derby","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/dec/30/celtic-rangers-scottish-premiership-match-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/dec/30/celtic-rangers-scottish-premiership-match-report","fields":{"headline":"Craig Gordon saves Celtic as Rangers impress in goalless Old Firm derby","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"The scale of Celtic’s domestic success under Brendan Rodgers is such that there is a danger of over-analysing minor setbacks. The audible frustration which met this scoreless draw with Rangers was unquestionably linked to the earlier expectation that Celtic would swagger to another derby victory. Plus, of course, Celtic’s support are not at all accustomed to not getting their own way in Scotland’s top flight. The fatigue as associated with a 38th competitive game of this season was visible in the performance of the champions. Yet the sense of Celtic failing to hit the heights of last season needs context; they remain untouchable at the summit of Scotland’s top flight. This marked only the second out of 74 domestic games of Brendan Rodgers’ tenure in which Celtic failed to score. It would seem harsh if Celtic are to be consistently judged against a series of outstanding feats throughout season 2016/17. This position, of 51 points and just a single defeat from 22 league games, would have seemed perfectly acceptable before a ball was kicked. Where Rodgers has a serious challenge, as recent months illustrated, is launching Celtic to a position where they can make proper inroads into the Champions League. A humdrum draw with Rangers makes no difference whatsoever to that scenario. The winter break – Celtic will return to competitive action on 20 January – has arrived at an opportune time for Rodgers and his players. The same cannot be said for Rangers, who returned such an impressive second half display here that they were unfortunate not to win. “It was probably a fair result in the end,” said Rodgers. “We didn’t take chances in the first half. In the second half Rangers had a couple of chances. I thought the game lacked quality. It was a wee bit frantic.” Rodgers did not deny the significance of tiredness. “I think it’s obvious, with number of games we have played and all that goes into it,” added the former Liverpool manager. “But then I have seen a lot of games like that, you can maybe lose it 1-0. You don’t take chances and the opponent gets a goal. We showed resilience and resolve when we couldn’t score, that made sure we didn’t lose.” The Rodgers analysis – including of an error-prone game where an ambulance was needed for the ball – was perfectly fair. Moussa Dembélé, James Forrest and Scott Sinclair spurned opportunities for the hosts before the break with Rangers’ only real attacking threat a consequence of loose Celtic defending. The Rangers manager Graeme Murty later revealed a “frank exchange of views” between players at half-time. It apparently worked wonders. James Tavernier came within an excellent Craig Gordon save of volleying Rangers into the lead, three minutes after the restart. Gordon produced an even better stop, this time with his legs, from an Alfredo Morelos header before the same player nodded wide from Tavernier’s cross. Gordon’s value to Celtic has been questioned in recent times but he remains capable of the kind of marquee moments which separate him from “normal” goalkeepers. Rodgers introduced Leigh Griffiths in place of the ineffectual Dembélé in a bid to snatch a crucial goal. Griffiths was not to be provided with sufficient opportunity to break the deadlock as Rangers remained the more impressive team for the remainder of the second half. Only when Olivier Ntcham replaced Sinclair did Celtic offer some positive contributions once again. Sinclair’s glaring loss of form has been one ominous aspect of Celtic’s campaign to date and, perhaps, an explanation as to why he arrived in Scotland in the first place. “The guys are in the changing room frustrated because we created such good chances,” said a rueful Murty. “I’m really proud of the way the players approached the game. I’m elated with the manner of performance but know we could have won it. “We have shown can step up to a level that can cause anyone problems. Our job is to make that our minimum standard.” Celtic’s is far higher. Which, by definition, can fuel criticism where not required."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"society/2017/dec/31/minimum-wage-26000-pounds-if-rises-matched-executive-pay","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-31T00:05:15Z","webTitle":"Minimum wage would be £26,000 if rate matched executive pay rises, GMB finds","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/dec/31/minimum-wage-26000-pounds-if-rises-matched-executive-pay","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2017/dec/31/minimum-wage-26000-pounds-if-rises-matched-executive-pay","fields":{"headline":"Minimum wage would be £26,000 if rate matched executive pay rises, GMB finds","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"The disparity in pay between those at the top and bottom of the earnings ladder is revealed by analysis showing the national minimum wage would be £5.24 an hour higher if it had risen at the same rate as a FTSE 100 chief executive’s pay over the last two decades. With 2018 marking the 20th anniversary of legislation that heralded the minimum wage, research by the GMB union underscores by just how much the statutory pay floor has failed to keep pace with executive earnings. It shows that if increases in the national minimum wage had kept pace with a chief executive it would be £12.74 an hour compared with £7.50 now for those 25 years and older. For a worker aged over 25 on 40 hours per week this would equate to £26,000 a year compared with the £14,664 they are currently paid. The disclosure will intensify the debate about the yawning gap between the best and worst paid. Analysis published last week by the Vlerick Business School, based on 2016 data, found that chief executives of FTSE 100 companies receive on average 94 times more than the average employee. The average FTSE 100 company chief saw an 11% rise in their median total pay between 2015 and 2016. Calculations by the High Pay Centre confirm that the average FTSE 100 chief is now paid £4.35m a year – compared with £1.23m when the national minimum wage came in – an increase of 354%. “The national minimum wage was a hugely important step for working people in this country and its anniversary should be a cause for celebration of how far we’ve come,” said Tim Roache, GMB general secretary. “But this 20th birthday risks being marred by the growing pay gap between workers and company bosses.” Every year the High Pay Centre highlights “fat cat day” when the average FTSE 100 chief executive will have already been paid the same as the average UK worker earns in a whole year. In 2018 the day falls on 4 January. Stefan Stern, director of the High Pay Centre, said: “It’s striking that the national minimum wage came in just as executive pay really started to spiral up and out of control. The pay gap has grown ever since, with terrible consequences. There are two ways to close this unacceptable and unjustifiable gap: one is to have more restraint at the top, and the other is to have the long overdue pay rise that lower paid workers deserve. We need rapid progress at both ends of the income scale.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2017/dec/30/police-arrest-fifth-man-over-possible-islamist-plot-to-attack-uk","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-30T11:36:35Z","webTitle":"Police arrest fifth man over suspected Islamist plot to attack UK","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/dec/30/police-arrest-fifth-man-over-possible-islamist-plot-to-attack-uk","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2017/dec/30/police-arrest-fifth-man-over-possible-islamist-plot-to-attack-uk","fields":{"headline":"Police arrest fifth man over suspected Islamist plot to attack UK","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"A fifth man has been arrested as part of an investigation into a possible Islamist plot to attack Britain, police have said.

Speaking after a turgid fifth day in Melbourne in which Steve Smith’s 23rd century and third of an incredible personal series saw the fourth Ashes Test play out to a draw, Root appeared to chose his words carefully when appraising Moeen’s prospects for the finale in Sydney on Thursday. “Moeen has struggled this week but is a fine player,” Root said. “Like other guys he has proven before when it is not going his way he is able to wrestle it back in his favour. He will have a big future for England. It is important that everyone knows that.” Root ultimately benefitted from being taken out of the firing line for the corresponding fixture on the last Ashes tour but how England shape up at the Sydney for the New Year Test could well depend on the pitch prepared. Australia have called up Ashton Agar as a second spinner to their squad in case the venue’s first match of the current season offers some turn. There is a strong case for Mason Crane, the uncapped leg-spinner, to play regardless – even if the balance of the team is affected – given a series in which Moeen has taken three wickets at 135 runs and was trusted to bowl just 13.2 overs out of the 124.2 sent down in the home side’s second innings in Melbourne. Moeen’s poor form with the ball has a knock-on effect, too. Jimmy Anderson, for example, has only twice sent down more than his 59 overs in this Test and that was back in 2010 and 2012 when part of four-man attack that saw the seamers usually offered relief by Graeme Swann. The batting that has brought the all-rounder five Test centuries from his 48 caps to date – a run that has seen just one match missed because of injury since his debut in 2014 – has also failed to fire. A frazzled 14-ball 20 in England’s first innings made it seven knocks without a fifty, of which six have been ended by Nathan Lyon. Root otherwise praised his players for finally giving a true reflection of their abilities during this failed Ashes campaign after they halted Australia’s march towards a second successive whitewash, albeit thanks to a Test that saw both attacks beaten by the surface. The England captain had previously lamented their inability to string together performances over five days during the slump to a 3-0 scoreline but their domination of the match for the first four days and the rot ultimately being stopped offered some solace. Alastair Cook’s return to form with an unbeaten 244 in England’s first innings and Stuart Broad’s five wickets across the Test meant two of Root’s out-of-sorts senior players also provided some cheer, with the target now to go one better next week. “I’m very proud of the way we went about it,” said Root after England ended a run of seven straight away defeats stretching back to India last winter. “To come off three very difficult games and put in a performance like that is very pleasing. That’s what we are about as a side and a fair reflection of what we are capable of. “Of course we didn’t want it to be a whitewash. You could see the way they went about training to prove a lot of people wrong and make sure that we got something good out of this tour.” Cook was named man of the match for his fifth double-century in England’s first innings, a feat that saw him record the highest score by an opener carrying his bat and thus ensured he spent all five days on the field. As Root’s predecessor, and the captain in charge during the 5-0 implosion four years ago, the 33-year-old has been impressed with how the team has stuck together on this trip. Cook said: “We have trained really well but we just haven’t quite done ourselves justice on the cricket field. Too many people have been out of form to put Australia under pressure for longer periods of time in the first three games. We just couldn’t quite get over the line. We have one more chance to get that win in Sydney.” Smith was happy to criticise the MCG pitch for a lack of pace or bounce and Melbourne Cricket Club issued a statement that said a review would take place. Asked if he would like to roll this pitch up and take it with him around the world, Smith told BT Sport: “I don’t know if I would like to, I don’t think it was a great cricket wicket. “It was flat, it was hard to get out, but it was also hard to score runs. It’s a bit of a pity really. Hopefully they can find something to do with this wicket, Boxing Day is a huge occasion and I don’t know if many people want to come and see one of those flat tracks every year. So maybe if they put some grass on it or try and get it to spin somehow it will give something to the bowlers.” However, Root remained more diplomatic and praised his opposite number for batting throughout the final day, noting that immense focus was still required when only a draw was possible. Cook, speaking about Smith’s phenomenal form that sees him going into Sydney knowing even a pair would have him averaging more than 100 for the series, added: “When we first saw him we didn’t think he’d turn out to be the player he’s turned out to be. “You have got to give him a lot of credit, the way he has worked out his game. He sticks to it for an incredibly long period of time and is setting a new benchmark for what is possible.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"media/2017/dec/31/the-post-spielberg-reporters-back-on-screen-bringers-justice","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-31T00:05:15Z","webTitle":"In ‘fake news’ era, reporters are back on screen as bringers of justice in The Post","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/dec/31/the-post-spielberg-reporters-back-on-screen-bringers-justice","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2017/dec/31/the-post-spielberg-reporters-back-on-screen-bringers-justice","fields":{"headline":"In ‘fake news’ era, reporters are back on screen as bringers of justice in The Post","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Meryl Streep steps nimbly between two worlds in Steven Spielberg’s tense new film The Post, set in the Washington of the 1970s. Dressed in a businesslike twinset, she must handle a male-dominated newspaper boardroom, then by night become the consummate society hostess, marshalling guests and domestic staff around her elegant home in a couture kaftan. Streep plays Katharine “Kay” Graham, the rich, real-life widow who was handed control of the Washington Post after the death of her publisher father and the suicide of her husband. Spielberg’s film, out in Britain on 19 January, shows Graham finding her feet in the treacherous world of political journalism, but is also a stirring anthem for press freedom. Graham’s decision to print extracts from the top secret Pentagon Papers about Vietnam, leaked by defence analyst Daniel Ellsberg in 1971, initially put the financial future of the Post in jeopardy, yet marked a turning point in attitudes to government. “We are not a little local paper any more,” declares gleeful editor Ben Bradlee, played by Tom Hanks, once the presses finally roll. Although its rival, the New York Times had, in truth, broken the story, the Post weighed in quickly, at some risk, and was later to lead the pack with its coverage of Watergate, courtesy of Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein. While Streep’s character is at the centre of the plot, much of the drama takes place in the newsroom. So The Post is soon to join a fine tradition of compelling newspaper films: a line of cinematic hits setting out either to celebrate the reporter’s honourable role in a democracy, or revel in the dirty tricks of the trade. And sometimes to do both. Much like the police, reporters are widely distrusted in the real world, but they do make handy screen protagonists. The Hollywood ideal has to be the cynical reporter played by Clark Gable, on the trail of his celebrity story in Frank Capra’s charming It Happened One Night (1934). Serious romantic competition could come only from Gregory Peck’s reporter in pursuit of his truanting princess in Roman Holiday (1953). But a newspaperman’s hunt for a story has also given shape to plenty of murky thrillers, whether based on fact, like The Post and, most notably, All the President’s Men (1976), or based on nothing more than imaginative neurosis, like the acclaimed British outing, Defence of the Realm. This dark 1986 film, which starred Gabriel Byrne as an investigative reporter, compared well with All the President’s Men for the leading American critic Roger Ebert, but was “a bleaker, more pessimistic movie”. And it still holds up next to another, better-known political fantasy: Alan J Pakula’s The Parallax View, released in 1974 and starring Warren Beatty as political reporter Joe Frady. The film’s prevailing paranoia was seen as a symptom of declining trust in the American political establishment. Newsmen – and even the occasional newswoman – have been centre stage in Hollywood from the early days, partly because so many screenwriters had a background in journalism. The former reporter Ben Hecht first successfully adapted his play The Front Page for the screen in 1931 and it was later remade with Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell as His Girl Friday – and then again under the original title with Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau. Each version offers a quaint portrait of the rivalry between newspapers as well as between reporters in the same newsroom. Newspaper investigations recur as a neat frame for storytelling in cinema. Perhaps the most exalted example is the search for the meaning of Rosebud in Citizen Kane, but on a rather more camp register the job also allows the bespectacled Clark Kent of the Daily Planet to travel around America with his photographer sidekick in the Superman films. The search for a big story helpfully takes a lead character into the heart of events in a way only otherwise credible for a private detective. So Hitchcock’s 1940 thriller Foreign Correspondent propelled hardboiled American crime reporter Joel McCrea off to Europe in search of spies, while in 1984 the Bafta-winning The Killing Fields sent Sam Waterston off to file from Cambodia only shortly after The Year of Living Dangerously had seen Mel Gibson posted out to Indonesia by director Peter Weir, in what remains a critics’ favourite in the crumpled-linen-suit school of screen reporting. Spielberg clearly has a particular feeling for the embedded journalist working on the frontline. The scene showing the typewriter Ellsberg carries with him “in country” at the opening of The Post harks back to scenes in his own earlier blockbuster, Saving Private Ryan. But more often than not a newspaper “hack” simply provides a bit of seedy colour. Disreputable reporters put the grit in the oyster of a flimsy comic plot like The Philadelphia Story of 1940, remade as the musical High Society, just as the sinister shadow of Burt Lancaster’s columnist JJ Hunsecker looms over Alexander MacKendrick’s 1957 triumph, Sweet Smell of Success. Meanwhile, in Fellini’s La Dolce Vita, the name of a supporting character, the persistent street photographer Paparazzo, subsequently came to describe a whole phalanx of the popular press. Other film directors have fallen for the magic of producing a newspaper. Early Hollywood classics such as Deadline USA or Five Star Final, along with the 1994 comedy The Paper, delight in pitting journalists and proprietors against a ticking clock. All the same, reporting can be tricky to dramatise visually and, just as police officers in films seem unable to work without a wall of photographs and arrows, so screen reporters spend a lot of time crowded around a computer terminal. In the cinema, reporters and cops are also all too frequently given “just 24 hours”. In recent years journalists have appeared powerfully on film either calling power to account or releasing shocking national secrets in collaboration with real-life whistleblowers. The Insider played by Russell Crowe in 1999 was the real source for television revelations about the tobacco industry, while the Guardian’s part in handling both Julian Assange’s WikiLeaks revelations and the Edward Snowden National Security Agency leaks were represented respectively in The Fifth Estate in 2013 and in last year’s Oliver Stone thriller, Snowden. In many Hollywood classics, from The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance to All the President’s Men, the choices made by a newspaper editor are pivotal. Director John Ford’s newspaperman in the 1962 western famously discards his notebook and opts “to print the legend”, while in Pakula’s Watergate saga of 1976 the Post’s editor Bradlee, this time played to Oscar-winning effect by Jason Robards, eventually backs the coverage that will expose Nixon. Some great newspaper films focus more closely on the morality of the individual reporter. The screenplay of Spotlight, which won awards in 2016, salutes the dogged doorstepping of the team at the Boston Globe as they put together the picture of sexual abuse in the Roman Catholic church. The journalists are sensitive in their handling of contacts, pushing for more, but only to make their story clearer. By contrast, in Absence of Malice in 1981, the inexperience of Sally Field’s reporter puts Paul Newman in danger, while, at the very worst end of the scale, Ace in the Hole (1951) brilliantly charts the moral decline of a ruthless newsman played by Kirk Douglas. It might seem an odd moment to celebrate the press. For although reporters have always existed on the edge of social acceptability, they are now especially demonised, both from the left and the right. Nevertheless, Streep and her co-star Hanks both agreed to make The Post for Spielberg as a swift response to the political atmosphere at the White House, where oppositional newspapers are again being offered limited access. In America, the film’s contribution has been warmly welcomed by critics and newspaper executives. The review in Variety typically hailed it as “a movie of galvanising relevance” and predicted Oscar honours, while Len Downie, a former executive editor at the Washington Post, has judged: “This movie means a lot at this time in history.” NEWSROOM CLASSICS His Girl Friday (1940) Reworking of Ben Hecht’s play The Front Page, starring Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell, centring on the sparring relationship between two reporters. Ace in the Hole (1951) Billy Wilder’s dark journey into the character of an ambitious and morally bankrupt reporting “ace”, played by Kirk Douglas, who bends the facts in order to achieve a ‘big scoop’ comeback.

Some of the money – due to be recouped from the sale of Olympic assets built with national lottery money that was originally earmarked for good causes – will not be repaid for 30 years or more, it is being claimed. The government has also declined to say what it intends to do with the lion’s share of the assets, currently sitting in dormant bank accounts, share portfolios and bond holdings. In March, the Dormant Assets Commission said in its final report that it had identified some £2bn of unclaimed cash that could be freed up and distributed to good causes. The commission said the “huge sum has the potential to further transform the charity sector, helping to improve communities and change lives”. At the time the minister for civil society, Rob Wilson, said: “This money could help change millions of lives across the country by helping good causes rather than gathering dust in dormant accounts.” But now, almost a year on, the government is still considering the commission’s report and has yet to publish its response. Labour MP Steve Reed, the shadow minister for civil society, said: “The commission identified £2bn that had been locked up; it’s unclear who owns it and it’s not been touched for many years. They said it could be used but the government have never used it.” In 2010, the coalition government also promised to make good on a Labour government pledge to repay £425m taken from the Big Lottery Fund to pay for the 2012 Olympics. Most of the money was for grants of less than £10,000 which were intended for grassroots projects across the UK. Jay Kennedy, director of policy and research at the Directory of Social Change, which provides advice and support to the charitable sector, said an immediate refund of the £425m owed to the Big Lottery Fund could help millions of people across the UK by supporting vital projects and services. “It would support at least 42,000 mostly local, grassroots charities and community groups,” Kennedy said. “Critical services for people in need – such as children’s hospices in Scotland, food banks in Wales or activities for isolated older people in the north east.” The government had said that it would repay the money by selling off Olympics assets by the early to mid-2020s but it has now emerged that only £57.5m has been generated so far and none has been handed to good causes. “You can’t help but think the government isn’t focusing,” Reed said. “In government speak, the mid-2020s is 10 years’ time. At the rate they’re currently planning to repay, it would take a further 30 to 40 years to get the money back to people. That’s way too long.” One of the biggest assets, the Olympic stadium, has been signed over to West Ham football club, which is paying £2.5m a year rent on its 99-year lease. The need to free up the cash for charities is likely to increase post-Brexit. Currently, some £250m a year of EU funding goes to the UK voluntary sector. “But the government has given no answers on how that funding will be replaced,” Reed said. “Charities are in a tough position and it’s going to get even tougher, and yet the government has a means to support them.” Kennedy said charities were facing funding cuts while demand for their services was rising. “Lottery revenues are declining too, which also threatens the pipeline of future grant support,” Kennedy said. “That’s why we need a Big Lottery refund now.” A spokeswoman for the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport said: “We have always been clear how money that helped fund the 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games will be returned, with the £425m the Big Lottery Fund contributed to be repaid from the early 2020s. We are to publish our response to the Dormant Assets Commission report soon.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2017/dec/29/tiger-woods-very-optimistic-2018-return","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-29T20:42:11Z","webTitle":"Tiger Woods 'very optimistic' about 2018 but remains unsure over schedule","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/dec/29/tiger-woods-very-optimistic-2018-return","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/dec/29/tiger-woods-very-optimistic-2018-return","fields":{"headline":"Tiger Woods 'very optimistic' about 2018 but remains unsure over schedule","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Tiger Woods says he is “very optimistic about 2018” following his successful return to the golf course earlier this month. The American, who turns 42 on Saturday, recorded three sub-70 rounds out of four at the Hero World Challenge in the Bahamas before announcing his intention to compete regularly in 2018. Last week Woods announced he had split from swing coach Chris Como ahead of his latest return. In a lengthy and reflective blog on his personal website, Woods said he was “very encouraged” by his performance at the Hero World Challenge and hoped “it was the start of something big”. Woods wrote: “I honestly wasn’t sure what to expect after being away from competitive golf for 10 months and came away excited about my health and my game. “There wasn’t a lot of time to fully prepare for the tournament; about a month to be honest. My surgeon was fantastic in guiding me through the rehab process. It was slow and tedious, but paid off. It was a big step for me to go out there and play four pain-free competitive rounds. I practiced after two of the days, so that was nice as well. The juices were flowing right away. It was just a matter of finding the rhythm of the round. “The biggest surprise for me was finding out that I had the lead after 27 holes. I knew I was close after I eagled the ninth. It was nice to have played well enough to do that after being gone so long. I can’t express in words how great it felt to be back in the arena and how much I missed it. “Now, I feel I’ve taken it to another level. I’ve started practicing again and was out with Justin [Thomas] the other day and had a good time. I’m continuing to progress and trying to get strong enough to where I can handle a workload again. I would love to play a full schedule in 2018. What that entails, including back-to-back events, I don’t know. I just have to continue to work on my body and game and see where I pan out. I wish I knew where I was going to play and when I was going to play – it’s a lot easier to prep for that – but we really don’t know. This is all unchartered territory. “My swing is definitely shorter and I can’t turn as far. My back is fused and that’s as far as it’s going to go. But I was surprised at how explosive I was. And on top of that, how well I putted. I had been rolling it well at home, but it’s totally different when you have adrenalin in your system. I’m more than a full-club longer than when I shut it down. I wasn’t hitting it very far and was struggling to hit it solid. That’s a bad combo.” On his injuries, Woods revealed that he had a hard time walking and often needed assistance getting out of bed during his 10-month lay-off. Woods added that “one way or another” he will be at Riviera Country Club in February for the Genesis Open. “Heading into 2018 ...” Woods signs off, “I’ve had some tough times this year with pain. To come out the other end is phenomenal.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"uk-news/2017/dec/29/guitars-stolen-in-surrey-burglary-returned-to-owner-eight-years-later","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-29T19:56:22Z","webTitle":"Guitars stolen in Surrey burglary returned to owner eight years later","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/dec/29/guitars-stolen-in-surrey-burglary-returned-to-owner-eight-years-later","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2017/dec/29/guitars-stolen-in-surrey-burglary-returned-to-owner-eight-years-later","fields":{"headline":"Guitars stolen in Surrey burglary returned to owner eight years later","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"An amateur musician has been reunited with his collection of guitars eight years after they were stolen.

The relationship was rekindled during a long car journey between Canberra and the Adelaide Hills in the small town of Balranald in the Riverina district of New South Wales. My husband Tim was driving, our two small children were in the back seat – and I had in my hands the first vanilla slice I’d bought in years. From the moment I took it out of its paper bag, I knew this vanilla slice was something special. The pastry was a glorious oven-baked brown, the custard was the sunshine yellow of fresh egg yolks, and it smelled like real vanilla. There were layers of thinly sliced almonds resting snugly between the custard and its protective pastry. This vanilla slice was one of the best I’ve ever had. I wondered if it could possibly be beaten, and so embarked on what has come to be known as the Great Vanilla Slice Taste Test. The vanilla slice has changed a lot in the years since I first had one as a child during school holidays at Dad’s workshop. To keep me quiet for an extra 15 minutes, Dad always got me a vanilla slice when the smoko truck rocked up with its many delights for workers. Those vanilla slices were bright yellow with pink icing, wrapped together so tightly their square edges became rounded and squished. They were amazing. Today, just as it was for the smoko van, the vanilla slice is big business. This is especially true for many small towns, which rely on its bakeries to attract travellers to the main street. Many will go out of their way to travel through a town with a great bakery, which is how our family road trip ended up in the agricultural township of Ouyen in the Mallee region of Victoria. Ouyen’s Mallee bakery boasts a bold yellow sign which welcomes you to the “home of the vanilla slice”. The bakery itself is massive, and its range of baked goods would rival any big-city bakery. It was hard not to get distracted by the other delicious-looking treats, but I had come for the vanilla slice. The custard was so pale it was almost white, and with its thick white icing it looked a bit anaemic. The knife wasn’t able to get through the dense pastry without making the custard bulge out the sides. The slice’s casing was disappointing, but the custard itself was incredible. It had a superior vanilla bean flavour, which was creamy and delicious. While the colour may have been bland, the flavour was anything but. The reputation of a great vanilla slice travels fast, and is aided by the likes of Gary Lum. Medical doctor by day and amateur food reviewer at other times, Lum knows what he likes in a vanilla slice – which he says is “an Australian legend” – and he’s reviewed several for his blog. According to Lum: The pastry should be thin, but not so flaky that when you bite it, it cracks and creates a flaky snow storm. I’m not a fan of the white icing with chocolate swirls. That sort of fanciness has no place on a vanilla slice. I disagree with Lum on that front. I love flaky pastry on a vanilla slice, and chocolate drizzles just make it even tastier. The absolute best vanilla slice of our recent road trip came from Belair in the Adelaide Hills, in a small but bustling bakery that has made it a mecca for vanilla slice pilgrims. The custard is thick and creamy, with a good vanilla taste. The pastry is crisp and has the texture of the lovely end bits of a croissant, a skill the baker learned during his apprenticeship under a French pastry maker. Jason Spencer, the baker and owner of Banana Boogie, explains that the swirls are called feathering, and they can mean the difference between winning and losing big vanilla slice competitions. “The first year we entered a competition the top placegetters all had chocolate feathering,” he told me. “Ours was plain, so we decided to try feathering the following year. Of course, the judges didn’t like chocolate feathering that year, so all the winners had plain icing! It’s very subjective.” Since I’ve been on the Great Vanilla Slice Taste Test, I’ve had so many people tell me where they think the BEST vanilla slice can be found. Mostly, they’re in tiny outback towns or can be found in pokey little suburban shops. It has been a great reminder that the most marvellous treats are waiting to be discovered by those who are willing to stop and look around. What do you think makes a good vanilla slice? And where is Australia’s best?

It was almost a relief when the clouds that had been hovering over the MCG released their rain upon two sets of cricketers, striving hard but making very little headway. The inhabitants of Melbourne may be the keenest spectators of sport in the world. They stroll from the city centre in huge numbers to watch the Australian Open tennis in January; likewise they turn up all winter next door to the MCG or to the Etihad Stadium at the other end of the city for their beloved AFL; the Big Bash T20 matches here turn visiting officials of the England and Wales Cricket Board green with envy, spawning crazy schemes to transport Melbourne to Manchester and beyond. And apparently at the last count about 217,000 people have passed through the turnstiles to watch this Test match. Let’s hope they all come again. But there is no guarantee of that. This drop-in pitch encourages us to drop off. The system is employed because of the sway of the Australian rules football over here. The stadium earns most of its corn from the AFL and those footballers have to run over the square. So drop-in pitches are the norm though this is not the case in Sydney where the SCG Trust has insisted that the original turf is still used for cricket, football or no football. In the 21st century when just about anything is possible by pressing a button, it appears to be surprisingly difficult to create a cricket pitch that deteriorates appropriately to allow an enthralling and changing balance between bat and ball over the space of five days. Many Australians have been railing against this surface this week, though their players and coaches have remained polite and discreet: it does not suit their bowling attack since the bounce is so low and slow. It does not suit their superior spinner since the ball declines to turn. As the game has progressed the pursuit of reverse swing becomes the only hope for some lateral movement, which is why the umpires appeared to chide the England side when the ball was thrown into bare surfaces on Friday. The game becomes a battle of attrition, which is rarely the preferred Australian way. The criticisms are more guarded from the English side of the coin. The nature of the pitch has enhanced their chance of run-scoring as has the absence of Mitchell Starc and they may be more skilful at achieving some reverse swing. Moreover there is an understandable reluctance to diminish the achievement of Alastair Cook when posting the highest score by a visiting batsman in Test cricket at the MCG. After one ball on Friday, which saw Jimmy Anderson caught at short-leg, Cook also registered the highest ever score by an opener carrying his bat, surpassing Glenn Turner’s 223 against the West Indies in Jamaica in 1972. Hopefully Cook had not spent all morning in the nets. Whatever the nature of the pitch Cook produced a remarkable innings but Anderson’s observations after the first day’s play still hold good despite Australia’s first innings collapse on Wednesday. “People want to see entertaining cricket especially in an iconic Boxing Day Test at the MCG”, he said. “It wasn’t exciting to watch and it wasn’t exciting to play in, to be honest, when it’s attritional like that. But that’s the pitch that we’ve got and we’ve got to put up with it”. For the first time on the tour there might be some Australians nodding in agreement at Anderson’s views. Amid the dash for cash it is so easy to forget that the pitch, more than anything else, dictates the nature of the entertainment available. For all its wondrous facilities beyond the boundary the MCG has failed to produce a good one. Sometimes poor pitches can produce dramatic finishes. That happened in England’s Tests against Pakistan in 2015 in Abu Dhabi and Australia in Cardiff in 2009. This was less likely to be the case here after the afternoon rain, which left a minimum of 98 overs in the game and Australia 103-2 in their second innings. So far England, through the performances of their senior players, have acquitted themselves better on this surface, but they hit a barn door in the shape of Australia’s two best batsmen, David Warner and Steve Smith. They batted the final 22.4 overs of the day, acquiring just 38 runs but looking distinctly impenetrable and, in Warner’s case, unusually patient. The pace bowlers were persistent and disciplined but the bats of Australia’s captain and vice-captain were broad as the deficit was reduced to 61. There had been some success for the England bowlers against the more fallible members of Australia’s upper order. Cameron Bancroft stayed long enough to post a half-century partnership with Warner but was then bowled through the gate off the inside edge by Chris Woakes. Since Brisbane Bancroft has looked increasingly vulnerable. If he’s not careful his imminent season at Somerset will not be interrupted by calls from Cricket Australia to attend vital training camps. Then Usman Khawaja was almost as frenetic as Moeen on Thursday. He opened his scoring with a straight six off England’s off-spinner, a more convincing stroke than Moeen’s, and he followed this with a sumptuous cover drive. But he was more tentative against the pacemen. He nibbled at Anderson, who was conjuring a little away movement against the left-hander and Jonny Bairstow accepted the catch. There followed an hour and a half of attritional cricket. England bowled straight to conservative fields; Smith and Warner played straight and never missed a ball. It was a passage of play to be relished by the connoisseur perhaps – or the fanatic. Yet no one seemed that disappointed when the rain returned with greater conviction."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"news/2017/dec/31/for-the-record-observer","type":"article","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-31T00:04:15Z","webTitle":"This week’s corrections","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2017/dec/31/for-the-record-observer","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/2017/dec/31/for-the-record-observer","fields":{"headline":"For the record","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"We should clarify that the smartphone company BlackBerry has not “abandoned handsets” as we said in “Green shoots at BlackBerry?” (Business, last week, page 36).

The attack happened at the Marmina church in the Helwan City district on the capital’s southern outskirts. The dead include members of the congregation and a police officer killed in a shootout at the security post guarding the building. Several others were wounded. One of the gunmen was killed after an exchange of fire with security forces, while another was arrested as he tried to escape to a narrower street across the road from the church, interior ministry sources told the Guardian. The source said at least four of the casualties were officers from the special forces squad guarding the church. “After the attack, explosive experts dismantled two IEDs [improvised explosive devices], near the church,” he said. The interior ministry however said in an official statement that the attack was carried out by one militant who “was going to blow himself up using a suicide belt.” It described him as a “dangerous element” who participated in several operations against security personnel. Mostafa, an auto-rickshaw driver who was near the church, said he heard several gunshots an hour before the Muslim Friday prayers. “Dozens of people ran to the church entrance to see the source of the shooting. I saw the terrorist lying on the floor bleeding as policemen surrounded him. He had a beard and had a big [armour] belt around him.” He was handcuffed, and the police was trying to push people away from him. He added that after the initial attack he heard other gunshots from a nearby street. The Coptic Orthodox church released a statement confirming the attack. “A terrorist attack has targeted the Church of the Martyr Marmina as unknown assailants fired gunshots, killing a person from the security force guarding the church as well as five of the people of the church, in addition to other injured individuals,” it said. The office of the Egyptian president, said Abdel Fatah el-Sisi, said in a statement that he had sent his condolences to the families of the victims, adding that such “terrorist attack will not get at the well of Egyptians and their national unity.” The grand imam of the mosque of al-Azhar, Sheikh Ahmed Mohamed el-Tayeb called upon Egyptians to stand aganist Egyptians and “participate in the celebration of the birthday of Jesus, peace be upon him.” Since the beginning of December, dozens of security forces have been deployed outside the country’s churches, in anticipation of militant attacks. Egypt’s Coptic Christians make up about 10% of the country’s 93 million people, and are the largest religious minority in the region. Islamic State’s affiliate group in Egypt has killed dozens of Christians in church bombings and shootings over the past year, and has threatened further attacks. It claimed responsibility for the suicide bombing of a Cairo church in December 2016 and attacks on two churches north of the capital in April. A month later, Isis gunmen shot dead about 30 Christians south of Cairo as they travelled to a monastery. The jihadis are also believed to have carried out a massacre of Muslim worshippers in Sinai last month, killing more than 300 in an attack on a mosque associated with the Sufi strand of Islam, which Isis views as heretical. The Coptic church statement said a Christian-owned electronics shop in Helwan was also attacked before the church shootout, killing the brothers Romani and Attia Shaker. Abanoub Ayman, an engineering student at Helwan University who lives below the shop, told the Guardian he was on his way to buy breakfast when he heard gunshots at 10am, and that the shooting lasted for five minutes. He said two gunmen on a motorcycle had stopped at the shop. “One of them stopped and entered the store and killed one of the brothers in front of the shop. The other brother ran after the two men but was also shot dead.” “The government [police] came and took the bodies and closed the shop,” said Ayman, who prays at the Marmina church. “It has to do with what happened at the church.” He said the gunmen had also fired at another church, Anba Antonios, in the same area, but no one was killed. He demanded more security around the churches, but asked: “What we are going to do? Are we going to put a whole police station in front of every church?”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/dec/29/north-korean-stamps-commemorate-hwasong-15-missile-launch","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-29T11:33:21Z","webTitle":"North Korean stamps commemorate Hwasong-15 missile launch","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/dec/29/north-korean-stamps-commemorate-hwasong-15-missile-launch","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/dec/29/north-korean-stamps-commemorate-hwasong-15-missile-launch","fields":{"headline":"North Korean stamps commemorate Hwasong-15 missile launch","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"North Korea’s state stamp bureau has issued a collection to commemorate last month’s launch of a rocket that the regime claims can hit anywhere in the US. According to images released by the state-run Korean Central News Agency, the stamps feature the Hwasong-15 intercontinental ballistic missile, which was successfully tested on 29 November. A government statement after the launch, which took place about 18 miles north of the capital, Pyongyang, quoted leader Kim Jong-un as saying: “Now we have finally realised the great historic cause of completing the state nuclear force.” The US ambassador to the UN, Nikki Haley, said the launch “brings us closer to war”, while the US president, Donald Trump, said of Kim Jong-un: “Little Rocket Man, he is a sick puppy.” One of the images released with the stamps shows Kim Jong-un appearing to monitor the progress of the launch. This is not the first time North Korea has produced this type of stamp. In August one was issued featuring Kim Jong-un celebrating the launch of the predecessor Hwasong-14 missile. The military propaganda of recent stamps is a far cry from those issued in North Korea during the 1970s and 80s, which were more likely to feature cats and dogs. Stamp designs have previously been known to escalate tensions in the region. In 2004 a stamp issued by South Korea depicting disputed islands known as Tokdo in South Korea and as Takeshima in Japan sparked a diplomatic row."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/dec/29/bataclan-paris-hurtful-romantic-film-dramatising-attack-put-on-hold","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-29T11:20:34Z","webTitle":"‘Hurtful’ romantic film dramatising Bataclan terror attack put on hold","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/dec/29/bataclan-paris-hurtful-romantic-film-dramatising-attack-put-on-hold","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/dec/29/bataclan-paris-hurtful-romantic-film-dramatising-attack-put-on-hold","fields":{"headline":"‘Hurtful’ romantic film dramatising Bataclan terror attack put on hold","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"French state TV has postponed the broadcast of a romantic film about a fictional couple who fall in love against the backdrop of the terrorist attack on the Bataclan concert hall in Paris, after a petition demanded the “hurtful” project be dropped. The TV film, Ce soir-là (That Night), finished filming last week. But after the widow of a Bataclan victim gathered more than 38,000 signatures for an online petition, France’s main public TV channel, France 2, said the project had been put on hold while producers consulted survivors’ groups. On 13 November 2015, 130 people were killed in coordinated terrorist attacks in Paris and the suburb of St-Denis. Armed men entered the Bataclan concert hall during a gig by Eagles of Death Metal, killing 90 people and injuring scores of others over two hours. The film had been billed as “a great love story” between a woman living behind the Bataclan and a passerby who both help people fleeing the gunmen. When survivors later ask to meet the people who helped them, the man and the woman cross paths again and a relationship begins. The attack inside the concert hall was not to be shown in the film. Claire Peltier, whose husband was killed inside the Bataclan, launched a petition last month demanding the “hurtful” film be dropped. “This project has hurt and shocked us,” she wrote. “We’re scandalised that a TV project like this could be made so soon after such a violent event. “To live our grief, we need silence, restraint, dignity and respect ... and not a romantic fiction aimed at boosting your channel’s ratings.” France 2 issued a statement saying it had decided “to adjourn this project until the film’s producers have consulted all survivors’ groups”. The channel said no date had been set for broadcast and its executives had yet to view the film. Arthur Dénouveaux, the head of one survivors’ association, Life For Paris, told the news agency AFP: “Even if we never asked for the censorship of this film, we’re happy that reserve and restraint has won out.” He said the role of his organisation was not to act as a censor."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2017/dec/29/ashes-ball-tampering-claims-pommie-bashing-bayliss","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-29T09:52:56Z","webTitle":"Ashes ball-tampering claims just ‘Pommie-bashing’, says Trevor Bayliss","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/dec/29/ashes-ball-tampering-claims-pommie-bashing-bayliss","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/dec/29/ashes-ball-tampering-claims-pommie-bashing-bayliss","fields":{"headline":"Ashes ball-tampering claims just ‘Pommie-bashing’, says Trevor Bayliss","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"England were cleared of ball-tampering during the fourth Ashes Test in Melbourne after what Trevor Bayliss described as a “beat-up” story and a touch of “Pommie-bashing” by the Australian media. A soggy fourth day on which only 44.1 overs were bowled, Alastair Cook broke the record for an opener carrying his bat with an unbeaten 244 and two Australia wickets fell, was suddenly abuzz with talk of tampering when Channel 9 showed footage of Jimmy Anderson running his fingernail down the quarter seam of the Kookaburra ball. Both sides have been warned by the match officials about deliberately throwing the ball into the rock hard MCG pitch when fielding here – in an attempt to scuff it up and induce reverse swing on an otherwise lifeless surface – but it was the images of Anderson that prompted a host of former Australia players to hint at possible foul play. “I’m not sure you are allowed to use your fingernail there,” said Shane Warne, on the Channel 9 coverage, with his co-commentator Michael Slater adding: “That’s a no-no.” On the official Cricket Australia website no less, the former batsman Mike Hussey commented: “It didn’t look great, to be honest. There might be a little bit of a ‘please explain’ there for Jimmy Anderson.” Mitchell Johnson, the scourge of England’s batsmen during the 2013-14 whitewash series, had also tweeted his surprise that Joe Root’s bowlers had got the ball to reverse through the air only 10 overs into Australia’s second innings, and these high-profile reactions then flew around online news outlets. On seeing the Channel 9 news headline on the TV in the England dressing room during the afternoon’s rain break Bayliss immediately went to see the umpires, Kumar Dharmasena and S Ravi, to establish whether they had any concerns about Anderson’s actions. Bayliss, speaking after play was called off for the day to leave England frustrated in their hunt for a win, said: “They must have already seen it because Kumar just said: ‘Don’t worry, there is absolutely nothing in it’. His words were it was a ‘beat-up’ – made-up. “You are allowed to clean the ball. Kumar had said to our guys – well, both sides – that there is no problem but he would like them to do it in front of the umpires so they can see and there is nothing untoward going on. “There is a bit of mud and dirt out there. Watching the footage, if [Anderson] was scratching it, it was the shiny side to get it to reverse – so he was doing it wrong.” On the local coverage of the story, England’s Australian coach added: “We’ve had a good couple of days and there hasn’t been much positive press from their point of view. It’s a bit of Pommie-bashing. We knew when we came here it would be 24 million versus 11. You’ve got to laugh it off.” Ball-tampering became a hot topic in Australia 12 months ago when Faf du Plessis, the South Africa captain, was fined 100% of his match fee and found himself the subject of hostile local coverage when footage emerged of him applying minty saliva from a sweet to the ball during the second Test of his side’s 2-1 series win. Root was shown to be sucking sweets on the BT Sport coverage but, with England cleared of any wrongdoing, it is unlikely to go further. That both sides have been spoken to by the ICC match referee, Ranjan Madugalle, about not throwing the ball into the pitch is not out of the ordinary; the act of scuffing the ball up is a common tactic given intention is so tough to prove. Bayliss said: “I know at different times [the ICC] have tried to stamp it out, especially in the white-ball games. But what do you do about a guy with a bad shoulder who can’t throw it back on the full? Or, if going for a run out, you’re not necessarily trying to throw it on the full every time. “That’s how [scuffing the ball] can be done. Once it gets a few marks on it you hope it starts to reverse. It doesn’t go all the time – who knows exactly why – but every team in the world does it, so it’s hard to stamp out.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2017/dec/29/peruvians-protest-against-pardon-for-jailed-ex-president-alberto-fujimori","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-29T11:34:58Z","webTitle":"Thousands march in Lima in protest over pardon for former Peru president","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/dec/29/peruvians-protest-against-pardon-for-jailed-ex-president-alberto-fujimori","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/dec/29/peruvians-protest-against-pardon-for-jailed-ex-president-alberto-fujimori","fields":{"headline":"Thousands march in Lima in protest over pardon for former Peru president","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Thousands of Peruvians have marched through Lima to vent their outrage over a pardon for the jailed former president Alberto Fujimori, in the biggest protest since the decision was announced. The public opprobrium was directed at Peru’s president, Pedro Pablo Kuczynski, who granted the pardon on health grounds on Christmas Eve to lift the 25-year sentence, Fujimori, 79, had been serving for corruption and authorising death squad killings. Public indignation threatens to push Kuczynski’s beleaguered government into a political crisis as he reshuffles his cabinet and seeks to forge a new alliance with the majority opposition party led by Fujimori’s daughter Keiko. “The president has lost all legitimacy,” said Maria Isabel Cedano, a feminist campaigner who supported Kuczynski, known as PPK, in Peru’s 2016 presidential runoff to prevent a victory for Keiko Fujimori. “He has betrayed us. He should resign and convene new elections.” Amid the face-painted drummers, workers’ unions, students and feminist collectives wearing traditional Andean embroidered skirts, Kuczynski’s image was a new addition to the rubber-faced puppet caricatures worn by actors waving bundles of banknotes in the burlesque parade usually reserved for Fujimori and other former leaders tainted with corruption. Marchers wore headbands reading “The pardon is an insult” and carried placards saying “Justice cannot be negotiated” as they chanted “Out, out PPK.” Alberto Fujimori, whose authoritarian leadership in the 1990s left an indelible mark on the country, continues to cast a long shadow over modern Peru. His supporters credit him with stamping out the Maoist Shining Path movement and responsibility for Peru’s economic success while others consider him a corrupt and iron-fisted dictator. Speaking from a hospital bed on Tuesday, Fujimori asked for forgiveness from the Peruvians he said he had “let down”. He thanked Kuczynski for the pardon and pledged to back the president’s call for national reconciliation. “It was a taunt,” said Rosa Rojas Borda, who lost her eight-year-old son Javier and husband Manuel, in the 1992 Barrios Altos massacre, one of two carried out by a military death squad Fujimori was convicted of having created. “He should ask for forgiveness from the relatives of those he had killed. They have a first and last name,” she told the Guardian as she strode at the front of the march with other family members carrying placards bearing black and white photos of their loved ones who were killed in the early 1990s. “PPK has never invited us – the families of the victims – to visit him, as he has Keiko and Kenji. We’ve asked him three times,” said Carmen Oyague, 70, whose daughter, Dora Oyague Fierro, was one of nine students and a university professor who were abducted and killed in 1992. Her niece, Carolina Oyague, 36, said: “You can’t reconcile the country by decree,” referring to a message on Tuesday in which the 79-year-old leader asked young people to leave aside “negative emotions” and “turn the page”. Human rights lawyers in Peru say there are legal grounds to challenge the pardon because it was a political and not a humanitarian decision. Carlos Rivera, a lawyer at the Legal Defence Institute, said Kuczynski issued the pardon as a part of a deal to avoid impeachment on corruption allegations last week. The president has denied wrongdoing. Human rights experts at the UN called the pardon an appalling “slap in the face” to the victims of human rights abuses, adding it was granted on “politically motivated grounds” and was a “major setback for the rule of law in Peru”. Fujimori’s “guilt is not in question” and he did “not meet the legal requirements for a pardon”, they concluded. The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights expressed “deep concern” over the pardon. “The pardon is a major reversal in the consolidation of Peru’s democracy,” says Paulo Drinot, a senior lecturer in Latin American History at University College London. “PPK has undermined the rule of law for his own political survival. He will go down as one of the most pusillanimous and unprincipled presidents in Peruvian history. “With the pardon, he may also have created the conditions for a much more fractious and openly confrontational period of Peruvian politics,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/live/2017/dec/30/ashes-2017-18-australia-v-england-fourth-test-day-five-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-30T06:13:49Z","webTitle":"Ashes 2017-18: Australia v England fourth Test, day five – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2017/dec/30/ashes-2017-18-australia-v-england-fourth-test-day-five-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/live/2017/dec/30/ashes-2017-18-australia-v-england-fourth-test-day-five-live","fields":{"headline":"Ashes 2017-18: Australia v England fourth Test, day five – as it happened","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"And that is that. I have to dash down to the press conference, so I will leave it there for today. Thanks for your company across the Test match. Not a memorable one, but some brilliant moments. On behalf of JP, Rob, Geoff and me, thanks for your company throughout the week. We’ll see you in Sydney. In the meantime, here’s Vic Marks’ report from the ‘G: Sam Lobascher channeling most of us. “The fact that I’ve barely missed a ball of today’s play fills me with self-loathing. What on Earth am I doing with my life? What have I achieved today? Sport isn’t meant to make us feel like this.” England walk over to thank the Barmy Army. Speaking of the crowd: Final crowd attendance: 14,128 Total match attendance: 262,616 The umpires have realised that Australia can declare now, and they have. In turn, a draw is recorded with 263-4 is the score, Australia 99 ahead. Smith unbeaten on 102, Marsh 29. “Congratulations to the winner of this match,” says Simon Mann on BBC, “the MCG pitch.” Not wrong. Some reaction from the presentation in a couple of minutes. 124th over: Australia 263-4 (Smith 102, M Marsh 29) Instead, Root bowls himself. Four byes! First extras of the innings. Beats a swinging Smith and YJB’s gloves. Actual spin. Second time he’s landed in the footmarks, the first when he removed Warner with his second ball today and briefly injected some excitement into this final day. Feels like a million years ago. 123rd over: Australia 259-4 (Smith 102, M Marsh 29) Geoff is singing next to me: “Undismissable, that’s what you are!” Marsh is. Certainly not where Moeen is concerned. He actually beats the bat here. I think YJB appealed. Give COOKIE A BOWL. 122nd over: Australia 259-4 (Smith 102, M Marsh 29) Smith defends each of Curran’s mixed bag of cutters, as if to make a point to the young man. 121st over: Australia 259-4 (Smith 102, M Marsh 29) Marsh took a couple off Moeen to point. In four, maybe six, overs they can shake hands and we can all move on with life. What did it look like before this, anyway? 120th over: Australia 257-4 (Smith 102, M Marsh 27) Curran returns to the attack. He’s had a decent debut. Looking forward to watching his journey in Test cricket. Leaks a few singles here before Marsh drives three through point. Second slowest ton by three deliveries for Smith, the 262 he took in Brisbane the longest. 119th over: Australia 251-4 (Smith 100, M Marsh 23) Moeen back. To Marsh. Nothing to see here. Moeen registers his first maiden of the innings. Make that match. Yuk. Mason Crane surely to debut in Sydney. One way or another. “I recently saw the splendid animated film Ferdinand,” reports Aditi. “It features a dance-off between German horses and Spanish bulls. Everyone was laughing their heads off in the theatre. I propose we have one now to decide the winner of this Test. Warner’s pass double vs Cook’s ballet. I suspect Smith’s German Expressionist break dance would just about tip Australia over the line.” That’ll do me. I’m done. 118th over: Australia 251-4 (Smith 100, M Marsh 23) Smith to 99 with a clip from Malan’s first ball. Marsh pushes to mid-off, takes one as well. Puts Smith back on strike. And he cuts to point, racing through safely to 100! Very calm response from the champion, a sedate wave of the bat. 23rd ton in 60 Tests, third of the series. Eight of them against England. Four at the MCG, where he averages 135. Only his third second innings ton. 259 balls to get there, nearly seven hours at the crease. Phew. 117th over: Australia 247-4 (Smith 98, M Marsh 21) Smith, instead of driving a lavish boundary to bring up a ton, strokes sedately down the ground for one. Brings up 600 runs in the series for Smith. Averaging 150. First Australian since Slater in 1994-95. First Australian captain since Bradman, who did it a couple of times. Andrew Samson has my back there, as always. 116th over: Australia 246-4 (Smith 97, M Marsh 21) Malan is on. I like this because it might prompt something barking mad. Or at least they will get through the overs quickly. That’s what we are reduced to at the moment. Or Mitch Marsh will defend every delivery. He does, of course. “In a different setting Marsh might hit that for six,” Ed Smith says of the least flattering delivery. Not today. 115th over: Australia 246-4 (Smith 97, M Marsh 21) “This has been a desperate pitch,” says Ed Smith on TMS. Not wrong. Woakes rolls into Smith. He misses a great chance to move to 100 with a ball that is sprayed down the legside. Leaning back into his defensive posture either side of that. A maiden. This really is grim. 114th over: Australia 246-4 (Smith 97, M Marsh 21) A new Broad over starts to Smith. He’s working ot out to cover first ball for one. Leading edge actually, but along the ground. Marsh actually attempts ot cut shot later in the over, but it is stopped at point. Okay, Smith on strike next over. Ton then? Come on . 113th over: Australia 245-4 (Smith 96, M Marsh 21) Woakes on for Jimmy. Smith drives, so straight that it hits the stumps! No run. He has another go, just to the right of short cover, so they take the quick single. Home comfortably. He’s a boundary away from three figures now. You already know what Marsh did next. The lead is 81. 112th over: Australia 244-4 (Smith 95, M Marsh 21) Smith five from a ton, then. Hook/pulling a Broad bumper of sorts. Marsh getting a very good net in here, defending the rest. This wasn’t always his bag. Plenty of critics who thought he wasn’t capable of this type of effort against top-notch bowling. An excellent selection. Smith raises his bat up when the scoreboard reveals he now has 3000 Test runs in Australia and the crowd applaud. They’ll get another chance to do that soon. Averages 76 in Australia, the local captain, Andrew Samson says on TMS. Have that. NEVER CHANGE, LIAM. Come hang out with us later tonight. 111th over: Australia 243-4 (Smith 94, M Marsh 21) Marsh playing rope-a-dope with Anderson. Probably his last spell of 2017. Simply knocking these on the head, then getting out of the way with a sway. Picture-perfect forward defence to finish. 110th over: Australia 243-4 (Smith 94, M Marsh 21) Marsh lovely off the back foot behind point, there’s a gap there and he’s hit it well enough to reach the rope. To 20 from his 113rd ball. Another single to midwicket, albeit off the inside edge, gives Smith a couple of deliveries to keep moving through the 90s. But he declines, defending both. Perth has won the WBBL blockbuster at Lilac Hill by six wickets over the Sixers, chasing down 139. Villani top scored, another half-century. Sciver smashed a few at the end. 109th over: Australia 238-4 (Smith 94, M Marsh 16) Anderson still giving it his best at Marsh, trying twice to go upstairs at Marsh. But nothing coming of it. On his pads, Marsh just squeezes it out to square leg for one. Another that hoops back a bit. So the movement is there for both bowlers, but these two are so set it is going to take something very special now. They have added 60 in 200 balls. 108th over: Australia 237-4 (Smith 94, M Marsh 15) Broad taken through square leg for another Smith single. Marsh gets a fright when leaving one that swings back, only just missing his woodwork. 34 overs to come, lead to 73. Maybe we are on track for handshakes? Wouldn’t have thought that two hours ago. Credit to this Australian pair for all-but shutting it down. 107th over: Australia 234-4 (Smith 93, M Marsh 14) Smith edges! But not to hand, through the relatively vacant cordon, to the rope. He’s into the 90s. Anderson can’t believe it. It hasn’t carried despite how close the slips are. 106th over: Australia 230-4 (Smith 88, M Marsh 14) Smith pulls Broad for one. Marsh’s turn, and he breaks with the trend, after 37 scoreless balls he smacks a cover drive to the rope! That was his 100th ball of the innings and brings up the 50 stand between these two. “Christopher emailed that there had been a lack of international readers of the OBO messaging in,” writes Michael Klinski. “First time emailer, long-time reader here from South Dakota, USA, Home of Mount Rushmore and a current temperature of -17 Celsius. My first experience with cricket was when I visited my British grandparents in 1993 at age 11. I watched cricket all summer on TV and learned the game from my grandfather, who patiently explained all the differences from cricket to baseball. I became hooked, even though our lads weren’t that good that year. When I returned to the states, I brought a cricket set with me and taught all the neighborhood kids how to play. Every subsequent trip to England to visit family was made with the cricket schedule in mind. Had to watch as many tests as possible. Oh, what I would have given back then for a monthly cricket subscription package and access to OBO — those being pre-Internet days of course. Thanks for the coverage! And come on England!” This is brilliant. Great to have you with us. Save some space on Mount Rushmore for Steve Smith. Righto - they’re back! One final session. Maybe they will shake hands in an hour? In theory, 36 overs to come. Answer to highest total with zero extras. Ben Parker has the good oil: “This question was posed in the 91st over and I found that the great Bill Frindall answered this in 2007. It was Pakistan’s 1st innings score of 328 (187.5 overs) in 1955 in Lahore against India.” Whitewash, no more. “Listening to Clarke and Warne on Ch 9 is pretty funny,” Ian Forth adds. “Their emphasis on all-out attack overlooks England’s lurking anxiety that never quite goes away: the possibility of the whitewash. England got dismissed by Bangladesh in a session within the last year.” I never want to hear that word again. Scoring rates. “Marsh brothers scoring rate today 0.7,” calculates Ian Forth. “Even a strike rate of 2.5 from those two slots would have put England in for a tricky session for an hour/hour and a half, and a chance for a sensational win?” Not so sure about that. Marsh the junior was brilliant then. For a long, long time Australia haven’t known how to draw. See Kandy, Cardiff, Perth. This year, they have Ranchi and Melbourne. “Difference between English and Australian bowlers,” emails John Ryan. “If this was Australia needing 6 wickets the England batsmen would be threatened 24-7 until close of play; Smith and Marsh haven’t had a hair on their collective heads ruffled since their partnership began. While some will call it an unfair argument, as Australian bowlers are more used to Australian conditions, it is fair when considering how England could ever win a test, let alone the Ashes, down under. Not a hope in hell of winning now, let alone even getting two or three more wickets. BT should have given Day 5 back to Sky.” To be fair, I doubt Mitchell Johnson of 2013-14 could get a decent bouncer up on this track. 105th over: Australia 225-4 (Smith 87, M Marsh 10) Last over before the short break. Jimmy has it. Smith collects an easy single, leaving Marsh to see it out. He does it well. Perfect session from the hosts, getting through unscathed. Runs irrelevant now, but they are 61 ahead. Smith and Marsh have well and truly earned a couple of slices of orange and a cup of tea. The captain can help himself to his 23rd Test ton when they get back, if he likes. I reckon he might. Back in a few minutes. 104th over: Australia 224-4 (Smith 86, M Marsh 10) Smith gets Broad away off the pads. You know the rest - Marsh has faced 94 balls for his ten runs. Would never have played an innings this slow in professional cricket. I’ll assert that without checking but without any doubt, either. This helps substantiate that claim. “Warne and Clarke are very critical of England being too defensive,” emails Ian Forth, “but why aren’t they levelling the same at Australia? Why don’t they back themselves to win and start opening up now? Set England a testing 130 to get off 20 overs (or whatever), with the chance of panic setting in.” Get Glenn McGrath on there and he’ll pitch that up, I am sure. 103rd over: Australia 223-4 (Smith 85, M Marsh 10) Smith flicking in his most distinctive way. Then Marsh digs in. Liking his work. They are within an over or two of getting through the session unscathed. And the Aussie captain is coming up to 30 hours of batting in the series, Andrew Samson says on TMS. That’s madness. 102nd over: Australia 222-4 (Smith 84, M Marsh 10) Stuart Broad is on too. So, once more with gusto from the England openers. About 13 minutes until the tea break when he begins the fresh spell, so he’ll get two in. Nice cricket, Marsh having to get down low to deny a full, swinging delivery. Defending conventionally thereafter. Ball moving around a bit. They needed some of that reverse again. Maybe it is here. 101st over: Australia 222-4 (Smith 84, M Marsh 10) Jimmy is back, replacing Malan from the northern end. To Smith. “Not now!” roars the Aussie captain when defending. You pick up on certain mannerisms of players when following them around the world. With Smith, when he calls this loudly it is a pretty good sign that he is in the zone. Oh, now I’ve written that of course he was going to play and miss. Bowled, Jimmy. Maiden. 100th over: Australia 222-4 (Smith 84, M Marsh 10) Smith drives straight without any risk, again scoring early in the over. Set and forget from Marsh, down and defending. “Very good, Moeen!” says YJB from behind the stumps. Malan probably the spinner more likely at the moment, though. 99th over: Australia 221-4 (Smith 83, M Marsh 10) Malan drives wide of cover to begin. Geoff informs me that his batting average is above 63, in his 110th innings. Ooh, nice delivery to Marsh who tries to drive but doesn’t get much of it, spitting out behind point. They take another. Then a third, Smith clipping to midwicket. Easy peasy. 98th over: Australia 218-4 (Smith 81, M Marsh 9) Spin twins. Moeen is back for his first trundle in a fair while. Smith cuts him square early in the over. Marsh gets a long way down to protect against any spin. Unlikely as it is that he will generate much. Not on this strip. Let’s be honest with each other. Maybe this bloke should get a go next? 97th over: Australia 217-4 (Smith 80, M Marsh 9) Malan keeping Smith at home with decent accuracy early on. Oh, is that a wrong’un? Smith up to it, taking one and keeping the strike. Within striking distance of his third ton of the series. I was about to write fourth, but he didn’t get one in the first innings. We all just assumed that he was going to before chopping on. Australia’s lead is 53. “Agar means ‘if’ in Hindi,” reports Aditi on the email. “CA’s hopes really seem pinned on a big ‘if only’ we could get a world beating second spinner. I like Agar, but his bowling, like Earth in the Hitchhikers Guide, seems Mostly Harmless.” I’m a fan. We’ll see. 96th over: Australia 216-4 (Smith 79, M Marsh 9) Woakes does get another set. Operating with two catching covers, but no slip. No gully. A man at backward point as well. Almost fly slip, really. Straight mid-on in the mix as well. But Smith gets it through the covers anyway, for two. Then past the midwicket for another. Mixing up his pace, Marsh defends again. Doing his job the no. 6. “I sense a little bit of belief is draining out of England’s bowlers,” says Ed Smith on TMS. 95th over: Australia 213-4 (Smith 76, M Marsh 9) Malan on for a second crack today, running away from us here at the northern end. Well, walking away from us. I quite like his no-nonsense stroll to the bowling crease. Smith takes a full toss to mid-on, then Marsh defends respectfully. “To these Pommie eyes it does seem a little strange that Agar’s been called-up for the SCG,” writes Thomas Jenkins. “Lyon’s already proven he can hold-down an end against England. What’s the point of picking Agar? He seems like a worse version of Ashley Giles at this stage in his development: a little better than the King of Spain with the bat, but considerably worse with the ball. Given the series standings and Lyon’s ability to tie-up the English why not finally take a flyer on a young leggie again in Test cricket, particularly given what Swepson’s done in the Shield? Is there something about him I don’t know? If nothing else, picking Mitchells appears to be a good policy for the Ozzies in Test cricket.” In short, they see Agar as the man post-Lyon. That might be a long way away, but given how infrequently two spinners are required, they want to get him into the XI at every available opportunity. That’s essentially what Smith said to us in Bangladesh. 94th over: Australia 212-4 (Smith 75, M Marsh 9) Woakes continues his long spell. Geoff Boycott on TMS talking about things he would do had he his time again. Said he would a) have two more daughters and b) bat like Brian Lara. Righto. Smith grabs one fine, then Marsh does the same behind point. Good batting. There will come a stage where the runs they collect will shift pressure back onto England. They are not there yet, with a lead of 48, but it is the right plan from the Australian duo to keep it ticking. Smith keeps the strike with another tickle. Might be time for a change from that end. 93rd over: Australia 209-4 (Smith 73, M Marsh 8) Curran again from the northern end. Another of those (very) slow balls to get him going, barely registering at 100kph. Next, Smith gets off strike with a clip forward of square as the Barmy Army get stuck into a loud version of GSTQ. They need something. Not urgently, though. 49 overs remain on the day. Important that Root keeps his cool. Marsh again does his bit. Smith able to do stuff with his full batting kit on that I can’t do in yoga. Show off. 92nd over: Australia 208-4 (Smith 72, M Marsh 8) Lovely clip from Smith begin the third hour of the day. They race back for three and he’s into the 70s. Another ton, Smudger? Fill your boots, I say. Woakes has Marsh defending. Oh, then an inside edge that very nearly goes through. A few oohs and aahs. Still, he’s doing well, the younger of the brothers in this middle order. As Michael Vaughan noted on TMS before, it is about balls faced rather than runs at this stage, and he’s hung around for 56 of them now. Yum on the email is watching the speed gun: “Curran is possibly overdoing his 105kph slower ball, the one he got Smith with was just 10kph slower than his normal mid 130’s but it was enough.” I do admire his back of the hand work, mind. Afternoon all. Thanks JP. A lovely long spell from you. So then. Do we get the grandstand finish that this pitch definitely does not deserve? Or the dreary draw? Let’s find out together. Like Fox Mulder, I want to believe. 91st over: Australia 205-4 (Smith 69, M Marsh 8) More of the same from Smith and Marsh who are untroubled right now. Curran unable to tempt a false shot from his bag of tricks. A little curio to keep an eye on - England have bowled 91 overs without an extra. John Catchlove has noticed and asks “what the record score is for an innings with no extras?” Can anybody furnish us with an answer? Please provide that answer to Adam Collins, who is taking over OBO duties for the remainder of this Test. 90th over: Australia 204-4 (Smith 68, M Marsh 8) Woakes with another over that lacks anything of note for the fielding side. Smith and Marsh are in for the long haul. Paul makes a worthwhile point that has to be factored in when considering Moeen’s place in Sydney. “Moeen has been a great mainstay for England. With Cook and Broad finally getting their mojo back wouldn’t a team and coaching effort to nurse cajole support enthuse rejuvenate Moeen back to form be a kinder more positive and potentially successful strategy in what is basically a dead rubber anyway?” I’m instinctively of this way of thinking but he’s bowled and batted so poorly this tour it may do him more harm than good putting him in harm’s way. Maybe pulling him out of the spotlight for a while might do him good? 89th over: Australia 201-4 (Smith 65, M Marsh 8) This pair are increasingly at ease at the crease as Australia pass 200. Woakes and now Curran are not forcing any false shots and the ball is showing no sign of misbehaving. Michael Clarke on TV wants the spinners to bowl and take advantage of the footmarks, the only element of unpredictability on offer. 88th over: Australia 198-4 (Smith 64, M Marsh 6) Woakes seems unsure what he should be doing out there. He’s mixing up his lines and lengths but nothing seems to be coming out with any vim. Anything short is easy to ride, anything really short is tennis ball bouncing through to Bairstow, and anything full is not deviating offline. England might need to start bowling for play-ons again. Another place I’d rather be. 87th over: Australia 193-4 (Smith 59, M Marsh 6) Double change for England with Curran replacing Anderson. The debutant doesn’t cause Marsh too many problems though who looks to have his eye in, standing tall at the crease, looking to press forward and drive whenever he can. England have not made this new ball count yet. Smith’s faced 180 deliveries; incredible. 86th over: Australia 193-4 (Smith 59, M Marsh 6) Woakes relieves Broad but you get the feeling they could both bowl simultaneously to Smith and he’d keep two balls out, so in control is he at the crease. Marsh is less convincing but he’s growing into his work. Things getting a touch Evertonian thanks to the contribution of Pat Howe earlier. 85th over: Australia 189-4 (Smith 57, M Marsh 4) Anderson continues with plenty of intensity but no reward. This new ball is carrying through nicely but gun barrel straight. Fair question Andrew. If Sydney plays to type England need a frontline spinner, and on form that cannot be Moeen. The question then is who does Mason Crane come in for? Is seven too high for Woakes to bat? Is Moeen’s batting form also so poor that’s a moot consideration? It’s a tough one. 84th over: Australia 188-4 (Smith 56, M Marsh 4) Marsh is off the mark after 20 deliveries with a textbook cover drive, down on one knee, caressing the new cherry through the covers for four. Broad looks like he might be tiring, could be time for a change. “Hello Jonathan,” Hi, Neil Ticky. “I can’t help but think that as disappointing as this match has looked over the previous 4 days it’s still had time to show us two batsman who stand up there with the big names. I’m not sure if it is because Cook and Smith don’t have a name that roles off the tongue like Don Bradman, Brian Lara or Sachin Tendulkar but they’re up there, right?” Bang on. And if anybody is yet to adjust their mindset to the all-time quality of Smith, they need to do so soon. We are witnessing idiosyncratic greatness. 83rd over: Australia 183-4 (Smith 55, M Marsh 0) Smith accepts a single from the opening delivery of Anderson’s over, but England can’t take advantage and Marsh handles the remaining five deliveries comfortably. Theo Collier has a zinger. “Surprised the gentleman in Quintana Roo (77th over) is not an Aussie supporter.” On that theme, Duncan Robertson is on the line from South America. “Chiming in on Christopher MacLehose’s comments, I’m following the exciting developments from a bus on the way to Guican, in Colombia’s north eastern Highlands. It’s 21.20 here and concentrating on the unlikely chance of an England win is successfully taking my mind off the erratic driving and terrifying, pitch black gorge just meters from my window. Keep it up!” 82nd over: Australia 182-4 (Smith 54, M Marsh 0) Broad also has the misfortune of bowling to Smith for his first over with the new ball. The Australian skipper is looking more positive against the new rock, aiming to get on the front foot and drive rather than hanging back and playing with soft hands as we saw for most of the morning. This intent almost gets Smith into trouble when he top-edges a guided pull that lands tantalisingly between Malan and Moeen in the deep. Broad’s one ball at Marsh whistles past the outside edge. This is a terrific passage of Test cricket as Australia’s lead creeps to 18. Aditi alerts me to something I’ve neglected to comment on so far, the prevalence of fielders either side of the non-striker. “The short mid on and off page attendants that been used throughout the series by Root make me want to throw the traditional hat eating challenge. I have yet to see anyone get dismissed by hitting there. Or are they simply functioning as psychological cricket bouncers (of the club kind).” I think that’s a lovely way of looking at it. That, ore annoying sledging bollards. 81st over: Australia 181-4 (Smith 53, M Marsh 0) England take the new ball straight away, what can Anderson do with it? Not a lot in his first over, which is full and straight but Smith is equal to it. There’s extra pace through the air and off the pitch but still no conventional swing or much seam movement. 80th over: Australia 180-4 (Smith 52, M Marsh 0) In what I presume will be the final over before the new ball is taken Marsh keeps Broad out, but on a couple of occasions only just. The riskiest was a loose drive that bounced inches in front of Vince at point but Broad also found some reverse swing tail to prompt a nervy defensive stab. 79th over: Australia 180-4 (Smith 52, M Marsh 0) Steve Smith just keeps on keeping on, blunting Anderson with that unique method of his. Never has a batsman more maddened a fielding side with the old “good job he hit that” comeback. Chris Jordan has a question. “Loving your work spicing up this occasionally dull fifth day! Could you shed any light on why Steve O’Keefe doesn’t get a look in for Australia and is deemed unlikely to be seen again?” As per the story above, O’Keefe’s value on-field no longer appears to trump his off-field indiscretions. 78th over: Australia 178-4 (Smith 50, M Marsh 0) Broad has the first dart at Mitchell Marsh and after three postprandial looseners there’s a narrow play and miss outside off followed by a half-shout for a catch down the legside. Marsh survives. 77th over: Australia 178-4 (Smith 50, M Marsh 0) Anderson gets us underway after lunch, bowling a maiden to the watchful Smith. After five uneventful deliveries around the wicket the sixth comes from over and beats the outside edge to oohs and ahhs. It’ll be fascinating to follow England’s tactics this session as they maximise Anderson and Broad’s impact with the new ball. “It has been curious during this mesmerising game to read so few messages from all over the world,” emails Christopher MacLehose. “This — from Yucatan — to let you know that your coverage has not been wasted and that Cook’s magnificent innings brought tears of joy to grateful readers in Balacar.” Great to have you on board Christopher. You are where I’d like to be. I had a fun backpacking experience in that neck of the woods a few years ago, doing all the touristy stuff on the coast and losing a few mezcal-soaked nights in Merida. It’s still dry, the players are out, and the afternoon session is moments away. We’re about ten minutes from the resumption of play and it’s dry again at the G. The tail end of the band of showers has yet to pass through - according to the radar - so we may be in for some minor disruption yet. I’ll keep you posted. Lucky it’s during the lunch break but the reappearance of rain doesn’t bode well for the afternoon. The BOM radar indicates it’s a fast-moving band of showers which should pass quickly - hopefully in time for a prompt restart. No more rain is forecast for the rest of the day after this. But then, this is Melbourne, so anything could happen. I’ll return in a few minutes, until then here’s confirmation of the news Ashton Agar has been drafted into the Australian squad for the final Test in Sydney. Well, cricket, eh? After almost two hours of composed batting and popgun bowling on a lifeless surface, England have snuck a pair of wickets late in the session to give themselves a great opportunity to push for victory. They’ll have the new ball early in the afternoon session with plenty of time left in the game to force a result. Bang bang! England roaring back into this one on the stroke of lunch. After Smith brought up his 50 Broad found the edge of Marsh’s bat and Bairstow took a blinder, diving quickly to his left, interrupting the flight of the ball almost in line with first slip. No mean feat considering how close he is to the stumps. After a long morning slog, we have a game on our hands again. 75th over: Australia 177-3 (Smith 49, S Marsh 4) With Marsh on strike the atmosphere is filled with expectation, but the result is the same, a well-presented straight bat accepting the momentum of the Kookaburra and returning it assuredly in the direction from whence it came. 74th over: Australia 177-3 (Smith 49, S Marsh 4) Broad with a brief dash as we edge 15-minutes or so towards the lunch break but Smith’s having none of it, dabbing delivery after delivery down the pitch like a considerate dad trying not to dishearten his progeny during an early career net session. 73rd over: Australia 177-3 (Smith 49, S Marsh 4) After nine deliveries on strike to Anderson Smith accepts a single. Now, what can England’s premier paceman do to Marsh? Oof! He finds the outside edge first up, but it’s played with soft hands and earns four through the vacant gully region. A couple of dots complete the over. There’s a refreshing zing about this game again. 72nd over: Australia 172-3 (Smith 48, S Marsh 0) Root keeps himself on, targeting that same dusty footmark that did for Warner. Marsh is aware of the tactic, getting forward, playing in the ‘v’ and crunching a drive straight into Cook’s nether regions at silly point. Nothing is surer to enliven a TV Commentary crew than the sound of a crunching box. Maiden over, Australia lead by eight. 71st over: Australia 172-3 (Smith 48, S Marsh 0) Anderson back into the attack hoping for an early dash at Marsh, but he’s denied the opportunity by skipper Smith who dismissively blocks out an over, defending each delivery with a look in his eye as if to say “mate, you’re wasting your time, he’s not on strike, and he ain’t gonna be any time soon.” 70th over: Australia 172-3 (Smith 48, S Marsh 0) Warner has batted beautifully all match, and so diligently this innings, making that dismissal all the more unexpected. It was an ugly swipe across the line out of nowhere and it’s given England a sniff half-an-hour from lunch and ten overs from the new ball. The seventh bowler of the day finally does the trick. Joe Root on for a birthday boy bowl and David Warner hands him a priceless gift! Warner doesn’t pick one from Root that bursts through the top of the pitch, following through with a massive lofted drive, succeeding only in launching an edge high into the sky that Vince takes comfortably at cover. Game on again? 69th over: Australia 171-2 (Warner 86, Smith 47) After Malan’s positive start he’s begun to be worked out by this excellent Australian pair. The part-timer is still landing most where he wants though and getting away with the ones that don’t. 68th over: Australia 169-2 (Warner 85, Smith 46) A milestone over for Australia as a single from Warner begins the building of a lead and the completion of a century partnership. Smith reinforces Australia’s confidence with one of the shots of the day, a crushing heavy-handed drive for four through the covers. Will Moeen survive for the Sydney Test? Surely Mason Crane comes in for somebody. 67th over: Australia 164-2 (Warner 84, Smith 42) Malan resumes his over after that shower and a terrific sweep-ish shot with a periscopic bat from Smith brings scores level. “Hi Jonathan, bit of a question to ponder over definitions. Should the term “carry ones bat” be used only for the opening batsman who faces the first ball Instinctively I would say it should. Thoughts?”. Pat Howe with a pearler for the OBO inbox. While you’re here Pat, I do hop your nickname is ‘Van Den’. The covers are coming back off, play will resume shortly. “I suspect auto-correct did for Ian Forth a moment ago when he called Slint ‘Saint’, but all is forgiven,” writes Okala Elesia. “That record even has the perfectly titled end track: Good Morning, Captain. I mean, sure, ostensibly it’s a song about a man returning after a long time at sea to find his connection with his family completely tethered (I think) but it could easily be about Smith praying Moeen bowls forever on the fifth day, or Root waking from a dream to discover the fourth day rain never happened. Either way, I’m grateful to be reading about the Ashes and thinking about Slint.” Stuart’s all over this rain. Rain stops play. Out of nowhere, and with blue sky all around the MCG, a squally shower has blown in. We won’t be off for long. 66th over: Australia 158-2 (Warner 83, Smith 37) Woakes replaces Curran and Warner uses the change of bowling to reinforce the view that he’s working up through the gears after dead-batting most of the opening hour. There’s intent to his posture and trigger movements, enabling him to step inside the line and work runs behind square on the legside. It’s a decent over from Woakes mind you, finding hints of reverse swing in both directions, keeping Warner on his toes. Meanwhile, there’s a nice moment for Joe Root who is serenaded by the Barmy Army on his 27th birthday. 65th over: Australia 152-2 (Warner 77, Smith 37) Malan appears for his first twirl of the day, replacing Moeen who bowled a toothless five over spell. The part-timer’s first dart is bang on the money, landing consistently in the rough outside Smith’s leg stump and Warner’s off. Nothing is ripping dangerously, but it’s brought an added intensity to the contest nonetheless. The deficit is down to 12. 64th over: Australia 148-2 (Warner 74, Smith 36) Among this meandering it would be remiss not to praise David Warner for his superbly compiled innings. He’s coasting to consecutive centuries with ease, reigning in his natural attacking instincts but still pummelling the bad ball when it arrives, like one from Curran that’s overpitched and spanked through extra-cover. 63rd over: Australia 140-2 (Warner 69, Smith 33) Moeen continues after drinks with a couple of singles whittling the deficit to 24. Apologies for the lack of oomph in the prose, there’s just not a lot happening between an impotent bowling attack, a defensively-minded pair of batsmen, on a dead pitch in a near-empty stadium. 62nd over: Australia 138-2 (Warner 68, Smith 32) After giving himself a sighter of Curran the previous over, Australia’s opener has figured out his approach. It is to hang back on his crease, move towards the offside and work Curran’s natural angle from around the wicket to leg. He times that flick-pull beautifully for four and nurdles a pair of twos for good measure. “Is it too early to suggest Malan, Cook or Stoneman bowl?” asks Matthew Doherty. Nope, not too early at all. England are going through the motions out there against two very good set batsmen. With the pitch offering so little and 18-overs still to the new ball, it’s worth mixing things up a bit. 61st over: Australia 130-2 (Warner 60, Smith 32) Moeen bowling his offies with all the venom of a snake sock puppet. Smith and Warner are untroubled milking a couple of singles. Ian Forth has taken issue with my suggestion this match is not a rock and roll spectacle. “This may not be rock’n’roll but I find conventional rock’n’roll too full of its own testosterone. This passage of play is more reminiscent of an early Red House Painters album, or something off Spiderland by Saint perhaps. And all the better for it.” 60th over: Australia 128-2 (Warner 59, Smith 31) Curran gets his first bowl of the day and his liquorice allsorts are repelled by Warner for a maiden. Curran’s over is delayed by another classic cricket hold-up at the MCG as a grey plastic bag floats onto the sheeting that extends the sight-screen over some of the Southern Stand seating. A Woolworths disposable plastic bag if I’m not mistaken. We can add that to the red bin incident and the stop: for hammer time (thanks Damian Clarke). 59th over: Australia 128-2 (Warner 59, Smith 31) The latest innocuous Moeen over contains a Warner four, flayed to the point boundary as if only to prove it’s no doppelgänger under the helmet. Looking ahead to the Sydney Test, Australia have called up their customary second spinner for the final match of the summer. 58th over: Australia 123-2 (Warner 54, Smith 31) Smith dead-bats a Broad maiden. Andy Mayston has emailed in, presumably to the soundtrack of Blur’s Girls and Boys. “David Warner is making Alastair Cook look like David Warner...”. I don’t think we’re far off giving everyone a bowl here. This game is deteriorating into a performance art simulation of actual Test cricket. 57th over: Australia 123-2 (Warner 54, Smith 31) A rapid Moeen over goes for one. Rock and roll this is not. 56th over: Australia 122-2 (Warner 54, Smith 30) Runs for Australia with Broad losing his rhythm this over, playing havoc with his pace, line and length. The foot-holes appear to be the problem with the groundsman making an appearance with a massive mallet to flatten the landing area for Broad’s left boot. Agreed Benjamin. Rashid’s treatment by selectors hasn’t been overly kind. Looking from an Australian perspective and their difficulties against spin, it’s not fanciful to think England’s best chance of taking 20 wickets out here would have been to select both Rashid and Crane. Clearly that was as likely as rocking horse poo, but conventional wisdom hasn’t worked either. 55th over: Australia 118-2 (Warner 52, Smith 28) Moeen into the attack for the first time today, and you’d think he’ll have to return to form if England are going to force a result here. He starts OK, forcing a leading edge from Smith, but there’s no mischief from the offie. Onya Phil, I reckon we need Mr Cadbury’s Parrot to pup up and say hello, really make a mess of a major sporting event. 54th over: Australia 115-2 (Warner 50, Smith 27) Broad bowls a maiden to Smith that Mark Taylor barely describes on commentary, preferring to extol the virtues of bowling Malan to shake the game up a bit. It’s not an over that deserves a great deal of attention but one fuller delivery swings a tad, reinforcing the view that Smith might not be as switched-on as usual this morning. David Kalucy is where I want to be. “Good morning. The ground may be sparse, but in amongst the kung fu movies and drunken locals in a late night Barcelona water hole we find a youngish Australian fretting about the fate of the #1 &amp; #2. Suspense is not lost in the noise”. 53rd over: Australia 115-2 (Warner 50, Smith 27) A more eventful maiden from Anderson who’s bending his back out there despite the apparent futility of the exercise. He gets one to jump from a length and hit the splice of Warner’s bat and then whistles a tasty bouncer past the left-hander’s grille. 52nd over: Australia 115-2 (Warner 50, Smith 27) What can Broad do? Not a great deal with conditions stacked against him and Smith in uber-defensive mode. He is noticeably fuller, trying to draw Smith out of his crease, and he succeeds with one that’s unconvincingly driven to gully, but that’s as good as it gets for England in another patient over. 51st over: Australia 115-2 (Warner 50, Smith 27) A Smith single brings up the 50-partnership and reduces the deficit below 50. Not much else to report from another Anderson over that’s on a probing line and length. Time for Broad to see if he can conjure something out of this lifeless pitch. 50th over: Australia 114-2 (Warner 50, Smith 26) Warner brings up his 26th Test 50 and at 161 balls presumably his slowest. He does so by cutting Woakes for two, an example that while Australia’s vice captain is focussed on defence he hasn’t put all his shots away. Channel Nine has just published their viewer’s poll of the outcome and the draw is understandably the runaway winner. However, more (presumably Australians) reckon Australia have a greater chance of winning than England. Where’s that surprised blinking man gif when you need it? 49th over: Australia 112-2 (Warner 48, Smith 26) “GOT ‘IM!” cries Bill Lawry as Smith fends absent-mindedly at Anderson outside off, but the ball didn’t carry to Bairstow and replays suggest there was no edge. Still, always nice to hear the legendary Victorian clear his throat. Smith switches back on and sees out an Anderson maiden. 48th over: Australia 112-2 (Warner 48, Smith 26) Woakes continues to toil unthreateningly, Warner and Smith continue to bat within themselves. All very humdrum so far to start the day. There’s a slight hold up in play because a shiny red bin has been left in front of the sight-screen at the Great Southern Stand end. Cricket, eh? 47th over: Australia 111-2 (Warner 48, Smith 25) The first false shot of the morning earns Warner four. Anderson finds a smidgen of movement on a length with Warner leaning into a checked drive that races along the ground through gully. Otherwise more of what we can become very familiar with, leaves and firm defensive strokes. Damian has joined in the doomsday scenario spitballing (09:40). For reference, contact details are at the top of the page. 46th over: Australia 107-2 (Warner 44, Smith 25) Woakes gets to stay on after his one-ball effort. Warner works a single with that ungainly pull-flick off his hip that is so often undoing. Thereafter Smith sees off the over with all the intensity of a man shadow batting in his slippers and dressing gown waiting for his toaster to furnish him with breakfast. 45th over: Australia 106-2 (Warner 43, Smith 25) James Anderson has the first full over of the morning and he sends down a warm-up over to David Warner from around the wicket. Warner leaves everything outside off and defends compactly from the crease to anything straight. One of those defensive pushes contains some sweet timing and the ball pierces the packed cover field for a jogged three. Nothing happening in the air or off the seam for Anderson. 44th over: Australia 103-2 (Warner 40, Smith 25) In a sparsely populated MCG Steve Smith defends the final ball of Chris Woakes’ rain-interrupted over from yesterday. The players are out in the middle and the final day’s play will be underway shortly. Continuing the Cook conversation (09:18), Raymond Reardon wants to know “whose name has Cook’s 244 not out replaced, as Sir Donald Bradman has the second highest individual batting record at the MCG of 270 runs”. Cook has replaced Sir Isaac Vivian Alexander Richards whose 209 was the previous highest score by a visiting batsman in Tests at the MCG. The honours board in the Percy Beames bar reflects the highest scores and best bowling figures by Australians and their opponents. In case you missed this thread from yesterday, it’s worth revisiting. Geoff is always insightful but angry Geoff is especially fun. Hard to see any demons in this day-five drop-in. “Extremely flat, no foot marks” says Michael Clarke from the popping crease. “It looks like it did on day one”. This will be the fourth Test this series to reach day five, which suggests a tighter contest than the 3-0 scoreline might signal. However, this is the first time England have gone into the final day pushing for victory, as opposed to battling to avoid defeat. Ian Forth has a question about Alastair Cook’s signage (see 09:18). “Don’t want to be picky (oh, all right then), but hasn’t someone accidentally pressed the bold button on Cook and his score in the Percy Beames bar?”. The excellent Melinda Farrell has the answer. “It’s a temporary board. The permanent one will be the same. Terrific work getting something up so that it can be a part of this Test”. I’ve been reminded by Gary Naylor that England have previous when it comes to losing the unlosable. Let’s workshop the doomsday scenario... Smith and Warner bat solidly to lunch, building a lead of 30-40. Wickets fall to the new ball in the afternoon but some lusty hitting from one top-order batsman and the tail sends the target around 150 in an elongated final session. England then collapse in an almighty heap leaving Anderson and Broad battling to save a draw with light fading and an unexpected 50,000+ walk-up crowd. Speaking of Mr Naylor, he’s handpicked his three standout moments in Test cricket from 2017. For what it’s worth, I have no problem with ‘ball tampering’. I’ve never been convinced why it’s such a big deal. The potential benefit to the spectacle is obvious, especially in Australia, where the Kookaburra is near-impossible to move in the air and recent pitches make it a slog to get it deviating off the pitch. Why not allow for ingenuity to improve the spectacle? Bat technology has improved, pitches have become more docile, why is the bowler penalised for fighting back? And not just penalised, vilified. It seems disproportionate. Swing bowling is one of the game’s great arts, and if some measure of ball manipulation is required to achieve it, so be it. As is often the case on slow days stories appear out of the ether to fill time. Yesterday’s distraction piece was a series of nod-and-wink accusations of ball tampering against England. From the off it stunk like a beat-up and England coach Trevor Bayliss gave it short thrift after the day’s play. One of the storylines of this Test has been Alastair Cook’s accumulation of records. Among the milestones the England opener has passed at the MCG is the highest total scored by a visiting batsman in Tests at the famous old ground. His reward is a massive scoreboard-style banner in the venue’s Percy Beames bar, adding his name to one of the most iconic scenes in Australian sport. TMS was on hand for the installation. In case you care (I know you do, really) Phil Taylor is demolishing Gary Anderson in a vintage performance at the darts. He’s one set away from the semis in his final appearance at the world championships. Yesterday may have been frustratingly wet but Adam Collins still found plenty to enjoy out in the middle, not least “the contest within a contest between two legitimate champions of the sport, Jimmy Anderson and David Warner”. Here we are then, live OBO coverage of day five of the Boxing Day Test in Melbourne. England fans will be hoping it’s redemption day as their side begins play the only possible winners from a stodgy contest dragged down by a disappointing surface. Australian supporters already have a 3-0 scoreline in the bag but they’ll still be keen to see their troops force a draw and show the kind of resilience they haven’t been famed for in recent years. To recap: Australia will begin day five 103-2 in their second innings, trailing England by 61 runs. Because of yesterday’s rain today’s play has 98 overs scheduled. Action will get underway half-an-hour earlier than usual with a 10am start (11pm UK). The good news is the inclement weather has blown through and we should be in for a dry day’s play. It’s a touch on the chilly side though with temperatures unlikely to get much beyond 20C courtesy of a strong south-westerly. Can England winkle out the eight wickets they require to force a consolation victory? Will the MCG surface reveal any late demons to derail Australia’s dead-bat defiance? As always, please feel free to join in via the contact details above. While I pour myself a coffee and move one of my eyes away from the darts at Ally Pally, ease your way into this fifth-day OBO with Vic Marks’ view from a damp day four at the MCG. Jonathan will be here shortly."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/dec/29/milo-yiannopouloss-draft-and-the-role-of-editors-in-dealing-with-the-far-right","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-29T05:15:41Z","webTitle":"Milo Yiannopoulos's draft and the role of editors in dealing with the far-right | Jeff Sparrow","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/29/milo-yiannopouloss-draft-and-the-role-of-editors-in-dealing-with-the-far-right","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/29/milo-yiannopouloss-draft-and-the-role-of-editors-in-dealing-with-the-far-right","fields":{"headline":"Milo Yiannopoulos's draft and the role of editors in dealing with the far-right","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"“At best, a superficial work full of incendiary jokes with no coherent or sophisticated analysis of political issues.” The exasperated notes by Mitchell Ivers appended to a manuscript by far-right agitator Milo Yiannopoulos bring to mind the old fable about the tortoise and the scorpion. Unable to swim, the scorpion asks the tortoise to carry him across the river. At first, the tortoise is sceptical. “How do I know you won’t sting me?” “That would be crazy,” replies the scorpion. “If I sting you, we’ll both die.” Reassured, the tortoise allows the scorpion onto his shell and paddles out into the water. Halfway across, the tortoise feels a sharp pain. As the scorpion’s venom begins to work, the tortoise croaks, “How could you do this? I trusted you!” The scorpion shrugs. “You knew what I was.” In 2016, when news broke that Simon &amp; Schuster had offered Milo a $250,000 advance, the New Yorker identified Yiannopoulos to its readers as “a thirty-three-year-old editor at Breitbart News … known for stunts such as announcing the creation of a scholarship fund for white men, leading a racist online harassment campaign against the comedian Leslie Jones, and evangelizing against the ‘cancer’ of ‘angry, bitter, profane, lesbianic’ modern feminism.” According to Slate’s Katy Waldman, before Yiannopoulos landed his deal for a book entitled Dangerous, he’d been shopping the proposal around for some time, with other publishers wisely refusing to have anything to do with him. Milo himself described his eventual encounter with Simon &amp; Schuster like this. I met with top execs … and spent half an hour trying to shock them with lewd jokes and outrageous opinions. I thought they were going to have me escorted from the building — but instead they offered me a wheelbarrow full of money.” In other words, they knew full well what he was. The publishers pulled Dangerous in February, after a recording surfaced of its author discussing sex between “younger boys” and older men. Yiannopoulos published the book himself; the draft and editor’s notes emerged in the context of a lawsuit alleging breach of contract. The internet reacted to the circulation of Mitchell Ivers’s interventions with undisguised schadenfreude, as if a few salty comments constituted a crushing takedown of Yiannopoulos’s literary ambitions. But according to Buzzfeed, Yiannopoulos paid his frequent collaborator Allum Bokhari $100,000 to work on the manuscript, which suggests he’s unlikely to feel personally aggrieved by Ivers’s thoughts. In any case, what’s rather more important is what the draft reveals about the methodology of the far-right’s self-styled provocateurs. Consider another recently circulated editorial document: the style guide for the openly Nazi publication the Daily Stormer. It was published in a chat group by Andrew Auernheimer (a man Yiannopoulos described last year as “one of the funniest, smartest and most interesting people I know”). In the guide, the Daily Stormer’s editor, the vile Andrew Anglin, advises would-be contributors how to write for his publication. He instructs them about the correct format for hyperlinks, the usual structure for articles … and the racial slurs he prefers. The N-word, he says, is fine but should be mixed with epithets like “monkey”, “Negroid”, “ape”, etc. Crucially, he explains the necessity of irony. “The tone of the site should be light,” he says. “Most people are not comfortable with material that comes across as vitriolic, raging, non-ironic hatred. The unindoctrinated should not be able to tell if we are joking or not.” Then he adds, “This is obviously a ploy and I actually do want to gas kikes. But that’s neither here nor there.” To be clear, Yiannopoulos is not Anglin (and in fact, the published version of Dangerous explicitly denounces the Daily Stormer). But Anglin’s text shows the relationship between form and content for the contemporary far-right. Huffpost’s Ashley Feinberg writes: Remember this style guide the next time an alt-righter says something so hammily outrageous that you begin to doubt its sincerity. This is by design. The Daily Stormer and other groups like it want you to be unsure if you should take them seriously. Andrew Anglin wants you to think he’s just a troll, that he’s spouting incendiary crap for no other reason than to get a rise out of you. Remember that the irony and the coy misdirection are all in service of tricking people into following him on his path toward a white supremacist state. This is what he believes.” In that context, the Yiannopoulos draft looks rather different. “The use of a phrase like ‘two faced backstabbing bitches’ diminishes your overall point”, writes Ivers. “Careful that the egotistical boasting that your young audience finds humorous doesn’t make you seem juvenile to other readers,” he says elsewhere. Such comments do not constitute a rejection of the Yiannopoulos agenda. Rather, they’re efforts by a professional editor trying to make that agenda more palatable for the book’s perceived readership. Yiannopoulos needs that kind of guidance. The leaked Breitbart emails published in October showed, over and over again, Yiannopoulos’s reliance on editors to keep him teetering just on the edge of acceptability. Buzzfeed’s Joseph Bernstein discusses how the task of Breitbart’s Alex Marlow in editing Yiannopoulos “came down to rejecting anti-Semitic and racist ideas and jokes.” When he edited a September 2016 Yiannopoulos speech, Marlow allowed a joke about “shekels” but said that “you can’t even flirt with OKing gas chamber tweets”, and he asked for that line to be removed. Marlow held a story about Twitter banning a prominent – frequently antisemitic and anti-black – alt-right account, “Ricky Vaughn”. And in August 2016, Bokhari sent Marlow a draft of a story titled “The Alt Right Isn’t White Supremacist, It’s Western Supremacist,” which Marlow held, explaining, “I don’t want to even flirt with okay-ing Nazi memes.” “We have found his limit”, Yiannopoulos wrote back. Simon &amp; Schuster’s Threshold Editions orients to a different audience than Breitbart. Nevertheless, on the released draft, you see Ivers playing the Marlow role – and becoming increasingly exasperated doing so. “Don’t start chapter with accusation that feminists = fat,” he says. “It destroys any seriousness of purpose.” You might object that editors always attempt to present an author’s words in their best possible form, irrespective of the specific argument being made. That’s true. But the contemporary far right presents a distinctive challenge to anyone in the media since, when you’re dealing with self-designated trolls, style and substance can’t easily be separated. That’s the real significance of the Yiannopoulos document. Rightwing provocateurs rely on editors, publishers and journalists to keep their words within the boundaries of acceptability. Obviously, editors have a job to do. But no one in the media – or anywhere else – should see themselves as responsible for prettifying hate speech or the people who use it. If we know what they are, we should say so. • Jeff Sparrow is a Guardian Australia columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"football/blog/2017/dec/29/arsene-wenger-arsenal-record-games-in-charge-alex-ferguson","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-29T20:02:00Z","webTitle":"Arsène Wenger overhauls Ferguson but legacy may prove a millstone","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2017/dec/29/arsene-wenger-arsenal-record-games-in-charge-alex-ferguson","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/blog/2017/dec/29/arsene-wenger-arsenal-record-games-in-charge-alex-ferguson","fields":{"headline":"Arsène Wenger overhauls Ferguson but legacy may prove a millstone","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Behold, the age of Arsène. The past few years of Arsène Wenger’s extended Arsenal farewell have brought something new, a gradual piling up of gongs and garlands that have little to do with trophies won or goals scored but speak instead to his extreme, unyielding longevity. Longest-serving Arsenal manager. Longest-serving manager in Europe. As Wenger ticks these marks off like some stately old slugger gamely rounding the bases, tipping his cap to the bleachers, there is a feeling of end times about this. In July Wenger edged past Sir Alex Ferguson as the longest-serving manager in Premier League history, reeling in the Scot’s tally of 7,582 days. And now, five months on, he is back to finish the job. When Arsenal travel to West Bromwich Albion on New Year’s Eve Wenger will take charge of his 811th league game as the Arsenal manager, overhauling Ferguson again to take top spot on games managed and stand alone at the head of the field in the modern era. If some pockets of the Premier League were initially rather hostile towards this gangling outsider in the double-breasted suit jacket, with his yoga stretches, distrust of beer and chocolate bars, then 21 years down the line it must once again doff its cap in supplication. Although it is in its own way a perfect Wenger record – at once hugely impressive but also oddly hard to gauge, a candidate for constant revisionist debate on the scale of such an achievement. This is a Premier League-era record. It makes some sense to measure the last quarter of a century as a self-contained matrix given the top league’s violent, all-consuming transformation in that time. But if we accept football did not actually begin in 1992, then Ferguson still has another six years on Wenger and 500 more games managed in British football. Look a little further afield and the records of Guy Roux, who managed Auxerre for 44 years – not to mention Fred Everiss who was the secretary‑manager at West Bromwich Albion for 46 seasons – are out of sight, albeit Wenger is yet to specifically rule out managing Arsenal until he is 93. As ever, though, the noise around Arsenal will be dominated by that endlessly revised debate over the true achievements of two decades of Wenger‑ism, an argument that goes beyond matches won and into aspects of a club and a footballing culture that have been redefined under that unblinking gaze. “Is it too much to hope Wenger will usher in a new age of reason in English football as a whole and not merely at Highbury?” David Lacey wrote in these pages with remarkable prescience when Wenger was first unveiled. Never mind the cobwebs flushed out, the shiny new practices, not to mention the sheer will required to keep on pushing the machine along across two decades. It turns out Lacey was right. This has been one of the great transformative English football careers. There are still a few laps to run. This is not yet the moment for a full-blown Wenger retrospective, the chance to slice and dice the transition from booze‑soaked pre-modernity, through the white heat of the grilled broccoli years to the shining, moneyed, oddly baffling present. The real issue as Wenger enters his own extended Fergie‑time is how he sets about managing his departure, the process of laying down for a post-Wenger universe. It is here the significance of that record starts to creep in. Ferguson was able to sign off in grand fashion, spending games 772 to 810 hoovering up a final league title, the eighth in his last 13 seasons – compared with Wenger’s zero – and earning the right to proclaim with overbearing certainty his own legacy from the Old Trafford centre-circle. Rightly so, too. Ferguson’s gift to United was a lasting glaze of success that has kept the money rolling in, the intimate wipes partners (Asia and surrounding territories) still lining up to feed the machine. But if he still has something to teach Wenger’s Arsenal it is that transition is a hugely difficult process, that there will naturally be a falling away, a crunching of the gears when an 800-game control freak finally vacates the premises. Like all institutions football clubs shape themselves to the most dominant presence. This takes place at every level. Manchester United still have eight first-team players and hundreds of club employees for whom a defining part of their professional and personal lives will always be Fergie flavoured. The same goes for Arsenal now, perhaps even to a greater degree. The stadium is practically Wenger-shaped, its pillars and columns and looming concrete facades coloured an austere Wenger grey. Squint a little and the Emirates Stadium even looks a bit like Wenger, the swoop of the cantilevered roof, the gleaming glass facade seeming to conceal some memory of that distinctive grey sweep of hair, that hawk-like frown. Like Ferguson, Wenger has been an enabler for an ownership regime seemingly intent on sucking the cash out of its investment. Throughout his own endgame Ferguson was the Glazer family’s winning ticket, a dream of frugal, orderly success, so firmly entrenched he could spend the last few years playing a game of big-ticket moneyball. Wenger has also been able to spend less than Chelsea, Liverpool and the two Manchester clubs while maintaining a constant elite level income. There are some parallels on the pitch, not least in the playing personnel. For all its glories there was still a dwindling in the late Fergie years. United took that last title as a pared-back winning machine, propelled by the goalscoring brilliance of Robin van Persie and Wayne Rooney, getting by on a good enough squad. Three managers down the line vast, destabilising transfer funds have been splurged. But this is a succession that is still burning through its own baggage, still wobbling about trying to find a fresh equilibrium. There are similarities with Arsenal’s playing personnel at the same stage. Wenger’s best attackers and defenders are all ageing together. The seasickness over Wenger’s gallingly familiar methods, the same cycle of hope, the same baffled looks as the same flaws appear, have come to dominate. The absence from the Champions League this year, and probably next, will hurt. But it is the lack of a real sense of direction at the heart of this team, the lack of urgency and quality in the playing staff that will hurt his successor most. As it stands Arsenal have three ways to go from here. The first is the easiest, simply hiring the biggest name available and hoping it sticks. There are choices within this. Plenty of long-term Arsène observers would get a hair-shirt pleasure out of hurling some fuming disciplinarian at this current crop of players, slinging, say, Diego Simeone in through the doors, cracking his knuckles. But the effects could also be disastrous. Carlo Ancelotti usually gets a mention here. The past two years have taken a little off his gloss, so much so that Arsenal may even be able to get him. On the other hand Ancelotti is 58 and has been a manager for 22 years. Beyond him and the usual mess of methods and styles makes up the betting. Massimo Allegri, Joachim Löw and Leonardo Jardim have little in common beyond a certain pedigree and the fact none look as though they have spent that long dreaming of managing a post-Wenger Arsenal. Would they want it? Would it work? At which point the second option starts to look appealing, the idea of hiring another version of Wenger from the Thin White Duke era, scouring Europe for the hippest young tactician available – the latest fidgety, professorial German. Some brooding Portuguese with an entire unspent store of ambition and energy and state of the art ideas to throw at the post-Arsène void. Set against this is the high probability of failure. Thomas Tuchel is the bookies’ favourite but he has already been burnt a little. At the same age Jürgen Klopp had won the Bundesliga twice. Meanwhile, and lest we forget, André Villas-Boas is currently preparing to compete in the Dakar Rally. If Wenger’s 800 league games tell us anything it is that Arsenal’s ownership is powerfully risk-averse. Old Wenger may have dished up the perfect blend of prolonged commercial stability. Young Wenger would not get a look in now. All of which leaves the final option of fudged stability, some big name from the club’s recent past with the will and energy and enough dutiful good sense to keep the ship chugging on while learning on the job: Patrick Vieira, Dennis Bergkamp, Mikel Arteta, who has been around some pretty decent coaches. But it does feel a little far off. Hence the state of extended dithering. Hence those 800 games, the latest in an ever-lengthening roster of landmarks. With two more seasons to run this record speaks more to board-level uncertainty than sure-footed planning, of an endgame being played out right to the last. What does seem certain is that from here succession is all. And more broadly the Wenger supremacy has been an oddity, a glorious blip, a deviation from the curve so extreme it seems fair to say his final mark will never be passed."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"us-news/2017/dec/28/erica-garner-suffering-from-major-brain-damage-after-going-into-cardiac-arrest","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-28T22:54:10Z","webTitle":"Erica Garner suffering from 'major brain damage' after cardiac arrest","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/dec/28/erica-garner-suffering-from-major-brain-damage-after-going-into-cardiac-arrest","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/dec/28/erica-garner-suffering-from-major-brain-damage-after-going-into-cardiac-arrest","fields":{"headline":"Erica Garner suffering from 'major brain damage' after cardiac arrest","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Erica Garner, who became a vocal member of the Black Lives Matter movement after her father was killed by a police officer three years ago, was in intensive care in a New York hospital on Thursday, after going into cardiac arrest over the weekend. According to family and close friends, Garner suffered “major brain damage” from a lack of oxygen. The family was holding out hope of recovery, though, as doctors had registered some brain activity. Garner became widely known in activist circles after her father, Eric Garner, was choked to death by a New York police officer in July 2014. Some media outlets reported on Thursday that Garner was “brain dead” and had been given no chance for recovery. An unidentified close family associate who had been sharing updates from Garner’s Twitter account rejected such reports. In August Garner, 27, gave birth to a boy named for her late father. She suffered a first heart attack shortly afterwards. Doctors said the pregnancy had put strain on her heart, which was found to be enlarged. Prayers and well wishes have flowed in from throughout the protest and activist community. The Vermont senator Bernie Sanders said he hoped Garner had “a full recovery” and could “rejoin the struggle for justice as soon as possible”. Garner endorsed Sanders during the 2016 presidential campaign and attended a number of rallies. Eric Garner’s death was caught on camera by a bystander, as police attempted to take him into custody on suspicion of the sale of untaxed loose cigarettes. As NYPD officer Daniel Pantaleo tried to restrain Garner with a type of chokehold, Garner could be heard yelling “I can’t breathe”. His words became a rallying cry of the Black Lives Matter movement and protests against police violence. Pantaleo was not charged with any crime and remains employed with the NYPD. In 2015, the Garner family settled a civil wrongful death suit with the city for $5.9m. Erica Garner became a vocal critic of the NYPD, a frequent speaker and an organizer of rallies, marches and other forms of direct action. Earlier this month, in an interview on the webshow Like it or Not, she talked about the physical toll that organizing and activism can take. “I’m struggling right now from the stress of everything,” she said, “because the system, it beats you down.” Garner cited the mother of Kalief Browder, a Bronx teen who was wrongly held in jail for three years and killed himself in 2015, as an example. Venida Browder died in 2016 from complications of a heart attack. Her lawyer said she believed grief and emotional trauma was at least partially to blame. “She died of a broken heart, she had a broken heart because she kept on fighting for her son,” Garner told Like it Or Not host Benjamin Dixon. “But I’m not giving up, and this is the fight. I’m in this fight forever.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/dec/28/sir-kenneth-stuart-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-28T18:15:23Z","webTitle":"Sir Kenneth Stuart obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/dec/28/sir-kenneth-stuart-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/dec/28/sir-kenneth-stuart-obituary","fields":{"headline":"Sir Kenneth Stuart obituary","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"My father, Sir Kenneth Stuart, who has died aged 97, rose from a modest background to become medical director of the Commonwealth. He helped establish the University of the West Indies, in Jamaica, and worked against racism and health inequalities. He was born into a respectable but humble family in Barbados, then a British colony. His father, Egbert, was a steward at the exclusive Bridgetown Club, while his mother, Louise (nee Rock), owned the Blue Caribbean hotel. He attended Harrison college on the island. In those days there was one scholarship a year to attend university from Barbados and Kenneth won it, first studying classics at McGill University, Montreal, then moving to London to study medicine. He was evacuated to Belfast, where he obtained his MD at Queen’s University. In 1952 Kenneth became one of the band of idealistic academics building up the newly established University of the West Indies in Kingston, where he worked in both clinical and academic posts. He described a previously unknown medical disorder, acute toxic hypoglycaemia, caused by eating the unripe ackee fruit, as well as veno-occlusive disease of the liver, which was killing Jamaican children who were drinking a bush tea. Both of these conditions were all but eliminated over the next two decades. In 1966 he became UWI’s first West Indian professor, and subsequently dean of the faculty of medicine. In 1958 Kenneth had married Barbara (nee Ashby). They had three children, and we enjoyed an idyllic childhood on campus as our parents set about building a new Caribbean. Many of the children from that campus are still firm friends today. However, the political and social situation on the island was getting threatening, and in 1976 the family moved to London, where my father served as medical adviser to the Commonwealth Secretariat. He was knighted in 1977. He served on boards for the Wellcome Trust, the World Health Organisation and he was a Freeman of the City of London. He was a founder trustee and patron of the charity Students Partnership Worldwide (now known as Restless Development), and a member of the academic board of St George’s University, Grenada, for more than 25 years. Ken continued to be intellectually and physically active into his 90s, playing tennis every day, and publishing his last paper in the Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine in 2011 on reducing global health inequalities.

The row began just before Christmas, when the magazine posted a series of videos in which editors and writers held up glasses of champagne and suggested satirical New Year resolutions for Clinton, Trump, the White House press secretary, Sarah Sanders, and economic adviser Gary Cohn. The clip aimed at Clinton urged, among other things, that she should stop blaming others for her loss in the 2016 presidential race; that she should teach yoga breathing classes; and that she should embrace knitting over any political ambition. “Take up a new hobby in the New Year: volunteer work, knitting, improv comedy – literally anything that will keep you from running again,” the writer Maya Kosoff suggested. Former Clinton aides, writers and celebrities were among those who tweeted their outrage, even after Vanity Fair put out a statement of regret, four days after the item was published. “So Vanity Fair decided that the best way to end 2017 was to take a repulsive cheap shot at Hillary Clinton, one of the most accomplished women in the history of the United States,” wrote Peter Daou, a Democratic strategist and former aide to Clinton and John Kerry. Adam Parkhomenko, a former Clinton adviser, tweeted an image of a copy of Vanity Fair burning on an open fire and urged readers to cancel their subscriptions. The actor Patricia Arquette tweeted: “Stop telling women what the f-ck they should do or can do.” The website Dictionary.com tweeted that telling a woman with a law degree – such as Clinton – to take up knitting was the definition of sexism. Even the Washington Post weighed in, with an opinion piece calling the videos snotty, condescending, demeaning and snarky. The six youthful staffers who posted the video on Vanity Fair’s online political and business vertical, The Hive, were “young urbanites”, the paper said. After Twitter users started identifying the group, Kosoff reportedly tweeted: “I don’t appreciate being taken out of context to make me seem super sexist.” The tweet could not be confirmed, however, as her account had been made private. Speaking to the Guardian on Thursday, Daou said he was not interested in criticising the individual journalists involved so much as the publication as a whole, which he accused of perpetuating gender bias against Clinton. “It’s an institutional issue,” he said. “This is an extension of the mainstream US media using a double standard in the way they’ve treated Hillary Clinton. It’s repugnant.” He called for Vanity Fair to apologize fully and take down the video. Later on Thursday morning, from a golf course he owns near his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, the president weighed in with a peculiar tweet. “Vanity Fair, which looks like it is on its last legs, is bending over backwards in apologizing for the minor hit they took at Crooked H[illary],” Trump wrote. “Anna Wintour, who was all set to be Amb[assador] to Court of St James’s &amp; a big fundraiser for CH [Crooked Hillary], is beside herself in grief &amp; begging for forgiveness!” The tweet appeared to allude to reports that New York-based magazine editor Wintour aspired to be US ambassador to the UK under a Clinton administration. Wintour is, however, editor-in-chief of Vogue, another magazine owned by publisher Condé Nast. Since 2013 she has also been artistic director of Condé Nast. Vanity Fair has just appointed former New York Times journalist Radhika Jones to replace longtime editor Graydon Carter. In one of the other videos, Kosoff recommended Sanders quit her day job and “take up food Instagram as a hobby”, posting pictures of “the baked goods you so love making”. The line was a reference to reports at Thanksgiving that questioned whether a chocolate pecan pie Sanders tweeted about really came out of her oven. In the video aimed at Trump, Hive editor Jon Kelly suggested the president get a new haircut. “The easiest way to not look crazy is to stop having a crazy haircut,” he said, raising a glass. In its statement, Vanity Fair said the videos were “an attempt at humor and we regret that it missed the mark”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2017/dec/28/woman-suffers-life-changing-burns-in-east-london-acid-attack","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-28T17:29:51Z","webTitle":"Woman suffers life-changing burns in east London acid attack","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/dec/28/woman-suffers-life-changing-burns-in-east-london-acid-attack","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2017/dec/28/woman-suffers-life-changing-burns-in-east-london-acid-attack","fields":{"headline":"Woman suffers life-changing burns in east London acid attack","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"A woman has suffered life-changing burns to her leg and face after she was attacked with acid while walking along a street in east London.

To combat austerity, local authorities are increasingly exploiting parks as venues for exclusive, damaging, commercial events – lucrative for the local authority but against the wishes of day-to-day users. The government should impose a statutory duty on councils to provide, monitor, manage and maintain parks and open spaces for their residents, whom the councils should consult in their running of these vital assets. Kate Ashbrook General secretary, Open Spaces Society • Good sense supports the letter from David Lambert and 11 others deploring the closing of the Heritage Lottery Fund’s Parks for People funding programme. Urban parks are places where air quality is purer, making them suitable for physical exercise both by children and active adults, unlike streets polluted by traffic. Research in recent decades has also discovered that natural surroundings alleviate stress and reduce mental illness in urban populations, a money-saver for the health service. In London, one-third of those using the parks are foreign tourists who enhance national income. Joined-up political thinking would therefore make upkeep of urban parks a properly financed statutory service, contributing as they do to the national exchequer. And as a result these parks would continue to delight us all. Hal Moggridge Lechlade, Gloucestershire • It is right that respected senior figures of the Parks Agency draw attention to the ending of Parks for People as a special programme. We have to thank the Heritage Lottery Fund for what they have given. Now we move on. In the end the message should be that the funding of parks, along with other essential services such as health, welfare and education, should not be left to voluntary organisations. We need parliament to be persuaded by the evidence collected by the communities and local government committee, but bizarrely set aside last year: the maintenance of parks should be given the status of a statutory responsibility of local authorities. Appropriate funding must be provided.

Time to get uncomfortable","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"We all agree some liberals can be boring and you wouldn’t want them at your dinner party. After all, they might be going through a vegan phase because they saw some documentary about factory farming on Netflix, which distressed them. Or when you want to talk about your investment portfolio and how well it’s doing, they bring up blood diamonds, or divesting from companies using Wilson Security or child smokers in Indonesia. They might do this. But they probably won’t, because once they start talking about Trump, they could go all night. And the next thing you know, the vibe is totally dead, the rest of your guests feel depressed and the party ends early. Baaah! But to stack the dinner party deck with conservatives? Spare me. Conservatives in this day and age are not sitting around nerdishly talking about reforming the tax system (although they are doing that in the US, and the results are going to be disastrous for the poor and middle class). In America, at least, conservatives have become wreckers – this age’s menace, voting in crazies like Trump, trying to dismantle the enlightenment project, turn back the clock one Roy Moore and Mike Pence at a time. In Britain they’re trying to do the same – Brexiting their way to a white Britain, an Albion of their impoverished imagination. So does that mean we can’t all sit down and break bread together? Unfortunately it seems like it. The days of two tribes sitting down to a good meal, lots of wine, robust arguments about politics and then heading home still friends appear to be over. Alan Scherstuhl, a film writer at the Village Voice, posted on Twitter a screen shot of a handwritten letter. It was a response to an invitation to his parent’s 50th wedding anniversary from their oldest friends. “Sorry we cannot attend your party. I have nothing in common with liberals We live in a different world, ethics and morals and I would not be comfortable.” That last word is the key. People will junk lifelong friendships to feel comfortable. They’ll not date, befriend or socialise with people who do not share their cultural values or political views. To do so is to experience unpleasant emotions; irritation, annoyance, anger, discomfort. It wasn’t always this way. Robust political debate was a common feature of my parent’s dinner parties and later was a feature of mine. How boring if everyone agrees. So what’s changed? Politics have changed, and quite quickly. The issues are just too hot and numerous right now and the stakes too high. It’s one thing to spend the night at a dinner party in 2007 arguing with your friends about the Gulf war if none of you are in the Gulf war or know anyone who is fighting, or have any stake in the matter other than ideology. But politics in 2017 is personal, and the anger is real. That’s because the consequences can be felt broadly. Race hate attacks and white supremacist movements are on the rise since Trump came into power. And if you’re a woman, having a pussy grabber in the White House feels like a personal attack (although that does not seem to stop white, right wing women voting for Trump – or Roy Moore for that matter). So how do we protect ourselves from the feelings of anger, irritation, depression and hopelessness that arises when we now argue about politics? Cut them out! Stop seeing that friend! Staying in an Airbnb where they have Art of the Deal on the shelf and copies of the Australian arriving on the doorstep each day? Cancel the booking. Dating someone who reveals that he thinks Tony Abbott was “shafted” – give him the flick! One of your old friends reveals on Facebook that they have become a born again Christian and are against marriage equality – unfriend them! Find out your favourite café doesn’t pay penalty rates? Ditch it, pronto. Just as our social media is increasingly turning into echo chambers, so are our lives. Barack Obama speaking to Prince Harry in an interview broadcast this week raised the problem of what Obama called “a Balkanisation of our society” via social media echo chambers. “One of the dangers of the internet is that people can have entirely different realities. They can be just cocooned in information that reinforces their current biases.” So basically, the former US president who is well across all the worst things that can and are happening under the current administration, says one of the biggest threats to our society is a version of Scherstuhl’s dinner party dilemma. This we can do something about. A new year is upon us. If 2017 was the year to get angry, then perhaps 2018 is the year to get uncomfortable. Break bread with your political enemy. Ride out the discomfort. But don’t retreat and don’t surrender."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/2017/dec/29/horror-holiday-accident-toll-dents-near-historic-low-road-death-figures","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-29T04:15:47Z","webTitle":"Road toll rate near record low, despite horror holiday period","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/dec/29/horror-holiday-accident-toll-dents-near-historic-low-road-death-figures","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/dec/29/horror-holiday-accident-toll-dents-near-historic-low-road-death-figures","fields":{"headline":"Road toll rate near record low, despite horror holiday period","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The national rate of road deaths was on track to reach near-historic lows before the horror holiday period, recently-released data shows. But a torrid few weeks on the roads, particularly in New South Wales, has thrown the result into doubt. In the past two weeks, 22 people have died in NSW, and there have been 1,188 major crashes. Several crashes in different states over the Christmas period involved multiple fatalities. On Friday police confirmed that Annabelle Falkholt, 21, had died in the crash on the NSW south coast that also killed her parents and another driver, and left her sister, the actor Jessica Falkholt, in a critical condition. In Queensland, an 18-year-old woman Makayla Tritton and her mother Karin were killed on their way to Christmas lunch in Brisbane. Three more people died in a collision in Point Cook, Melbourne, on Christmas Eve. On Thursday Labor’s transport spokesman, Anthony Albanese, called for an “urgent reassessment of why it is that more people are dying on our roads” and a “strategy of how we can return to a declining road toll”. But statistics for the year immediately preceding the holiday period show a markedly different picture. The figures, published by the Bureau of Infrastructure, Transport and Regional Economics (Bitre), show Australia achieved its lowest road death rate for at least five years – the only period for which exactly comparable figures are available. The number of deaths per 100,000 people fell to 4.92 in the 12 months to the end of November, down from 5.62 the previous year. The total number of deaths in the same period was 1,209, compared with 1,273 for December 2015 to November 2016. The lowest ever annual road death rate was 4.9 per 100,000, achieved for the calendar year of 2014. This year’s holiday road toll has sparked an angry response from police, who havecriticised irresponsible drivers for putting lives at risk. “Sadly, personal responsibility is lacking in many road users,” NSW police chief inspector Philip Brooks said this week. “Out of 433 random breath tests, 739 people are facing court in the new year as a result of their drink driving, 13,500 infringements [have been] issued for speeding alone, and nearly 19,000 infringements for a whole range of other traffic offences.” Men accounted for the vast majority of road deaths in the 12 months to the end of November. There were 890 male deaths, almost three times the number of female deaths. The number of female road deaths – 315 – was the lowest in five years. Fatalities involving drivers aged 75 and above reached a five-year high. In the days after Christmas, police in NSW and Victoria urged drivers on country roads to take greater care. In Victoria, police said 160 drivers had died on country roads compared with 104 on metropolitan roads so far this year. In NSW, 285 people have died in the regions compared with 103 in urban areas. The latest NSW death involved a 22-year-old man in Queanbeyan, near Canberra, who died after his motorcycle crashed into a sign about 10pm on Thursday. Speaking in the wake of the crash, the NSW assistant traffic and highway patrol commander Michael Corboy urged drivers to slow down and take greater care. “This year we have seen too many single-vehicle crashes in our state’s regional areas,” Corboy said. “Drivers need to be aware of the risks associated with tiredness and speed.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/dec/30/when-it-comes-to-refugees-abbott-turnbull-morrison-and-dutton-are-hypocrites","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-30T00:30:45Z","webTitle":"When it comes to refugees, Abbott, Turnbull, Morrison and Dutton are hypocrites | Julian Burnside","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/30/when-it-comes-to-refugees-abbott-turnbull-morrison-and-dutton-are-hypocrites","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/30/when-it-comes-to-refugees-abbott-turnbull-morrison-and-dutton-are-hypocrites","fields":{"headline":"When it comes to refugees, Abbott, Turnbull, Morrison and Dutton are hypocrites","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"In 1974 the parliament passed the Trade Practices Act which, by section 52, decreed that a corporation should not “engage in conduct which is misleading or deceptive”. But parliamentarians are not subject to similar restrictions. We accept without questioning that norms of conduct, which parliamentarians set for commerce, do not apply to them. Most people expect politicians to lie. But few politicians have shown the capacity for dishonesty and hypocrisy which Tony Abbott, Malcolm Turnbull, Scott Morrison and Peter Dutton have displayed in connection with people seeking asylum. Abbott, Morrison, Turnbull and Dutton claim to be Christians, along with most other members of the Australian parliament. For fear of being misunderstood, I should declare that I was brought up in the Christian tradition, but I no longer adhere to any religion. However, I do remember some of the fundamental tenets of Christian teaching: compassion for those in need; treat others as you would want to be treated … These men lie to us, when they call boat people “illegal”. It is not an offence to arrive in Australia without a visa, seeking to be protected from persecution. And by their wilful mistreatment of people seeking asylum they betray the Christian values they pretend to hold. The Bible tells the parable of the good Samaritan. A Jewish traveller on the road from Jerusalem to Jericho has been stripped and beaten and left helpless beside the road. A priest and a Levite both pass him by and avoid engaging with him. A Samaritan sees him and helps him, even though Jews and Samaritans were traditional enemies. Abbott, who claims to be a Roman Catholic, once suggested that the parable of the good Samaritan might have been different if a number of travellers had been found beside the road. It takes someone like Abbott to claim that he can reconstruct Christs’s teaching. Abbott had earlier exposed his bankrupt version of Christianity when he gave the second Margaret Thatcher Lecture in London on 27 October 2015. Among other things he said: Implicitly or explicitly, the imperative to ‘love your neighbour as you love yourself’ is at the heart of every Western polity. It expresses itself in laws protecting workers, in strong social security safety nets, and in the readiness to take in refugees. It’s what makes us decent and humane countries as well as prosperous ones, but – right now – this wholesome instinct is leading much of Europe into catastrophic error.” So, a wholesome instinct is sidelined because of its consequences. In the same speech, Abbott said: … no country or continent can open its borders to all comers without fundamentally weakening itself. This is the risk that the countries of Europe now run through misguided altruism. On a somewhat smaller scale, Australia has faced the same predicament and overcome it. The first wave of illegal arrivals to Australia peaked at 4,000 people a year, back in 2001, before the Howard government first stopped the boats: by processing illegal arrivals offshore; by denying them permanent residency; and in a handful of cases, by turning illegal immigrant boats back to Indonesia. The second wave of illegal boat people was running at the rate of 50,000 a year – and rising fast – by July 2013, when the Rudd government belatedly reversed its opposition to offshore processing; and then my government started turning boats around, even using orange lifeboats when people smugglers deliberately scuttled their vessels.” (Incidentally, in addition to his lie about “illegal boat people”, his figures were false. The Australia Parliament House library shows that the largest number of boat people to come to Australia in a single year was just short of 25,000). Turnbull converted to Roman Catholicism. He has not tried to reinterpret Christ’s teaching, but he has embraced Abbott’s practical lessons in morality by embracing his policy of mistreating refugees. By contrast, Pope Francis took a more principled stand on the need for compassion for the plight of asylum seekers: Biblical revelation urges us to welcome the stranger; it tells us that in so doing, we open our doors to God, and that in the faces of others we see the face of Christ himself.” Sadly, neither Abbott nor Turnbull appear to have listened to the Pope or understood the Bible. Morrison’s maiden speech in parliament placed great emphasis on his Christian values. Among other things he said: From my faith I derive the values of loving-kindness, justice and righteousness, to act with compassion and kindness, acknowledging our common humanity and to consider the welfare of others; to fight for a fair go for everyone to fulfil their human potential and to remove whatever unjust obstacles stand in their way, including diminishing their personal responsibility for their own wellbeing; and to do what is right, to respect the rule of law, the sanctity of human life and the moral integrity of marriage and the family. We must recognise an unchanging and absolute standard of what is good and what is evil. ... These are my principles.” If those are Morrison’s principles, he certainly doesn’t seem to live by them. During his time as immigration minister he showed no trace of “loving kindness” or justice or compassion for refugees who came to Australia by boat looking for protection from persecution. Dutton claims to be Christian, but he boycotted Kevin Rudd’s apology to the stolen generations in February 2008. Like other members of Coalition governments during the past 16 years, he refers to boat people as “illegal”, and he administers a system of detention which shows astonishing cruelty. This is not the place to give details of Australia’s mistreatment of refugees; the facts are known well enough. Equally well-known is the Coalition’s message that a harsh refugee policy is essential to protect refugees from the risk of drowning. But to suggest that they are worried about refugees drowning is a lie: a fig-leaf to make immoral mistreatment look compassionate. We’re so worried that, if refugees don’t drown, we call them “illegal” and punish them as if they were criminals. We do it explicitly as a deterrent so that others will not try to find safety in Australia. And these dishonest politicians, pretending to be motivated by compassion, overlook altogether that if persecuted people stand their ground and are killed by their persecutors, they are still dead – just as if they drowned; if they die in an attempt to escape to some other country, they are still dead – just as if they drowned. For politicians like Abbott, Turnbull, Morrison and Dutton to say they are worried about boat people drowning is a lie. For them to mistreat asylum seekers in the way they do is a betrayal of the Christian values they cherish. They are dishonest hypocrites. • Julian Burnside is an Australian barrister and refugee advocate"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"football/blog/2017/dec/28/jack-wilshere-arsenal-crystal-palace-discipline-and-craft","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-28T22:24:56Z","webTitle":"Resurgent Jack Wilshere’s discipline and craft give Arsenal rare balance | Jacob Steinberg","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2017/dec/28/jack-wilshere-arsenal-crystal-palace-discipline-and-craft","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/blog/2017/dec/28/jack-wilshere-arsenal-crystal-palace-discipline-and-craft","fields":{"headline":"Resurgent Jack Wilshere’s discipline and craft give Arsenal rare balance","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Jack Wilshere was not short of admirers during Arsenal’s 3-2 victory at Selhurst Park. His first touch was a beautiful piece of velcro control as the ball dropped on to his left boot in the first minute, making everyone in the away end go weak at the knees, and the Arsenal midfielder even had a fan in the opposition’s technical area. It was Roy Hodgson, of course, who sent eyebrows rocketing skywards when he named Wilshere in England’s Euro 2016 squad. Wilshere had only just returned from one of his many injuries, but that misguided show of faith from Hodgson was easier to understand after watching him help Arsenal recover from a sticky spell in the second half to take Palace apart. Like Arsène Wenger, Hodgson is a believer, even though the 25-year-old has not produced much of note since that wonderful performance against Pep Guardiola’s great Barcelona side. Recently there has even been plenty of talk that Wilshere might be allowed to leave Arsenal when his contract runs out next summer. There are times when even hopeless romantics like Wenger have to be cold and ruthless. Fortunately for Arsenal’s manager, however, there remains a chance that he will be rewarded for listening to his heart. Loaned to Bournemouth at the start of last season, it felt like Wilshere was approaching the end of his time as an elite footballer when he suffered a broken leg in April. That curtailed his preparations for this campaign, meaning that he was in danger of becoming Arsenal’s forgotten man just when he was supposed to be approaching his prime. He turns 26 on New Year’s Day and instead of being a regular starter in the league, he was forced to adjust to the slog of appearances alongside the kids and the reserves in low-intensity Carabao Cup and Europa League games. Wilshere embraced the challenge, however, and here he was on a bitterly cold December evening in south‑east London, starting for the fourth consecutive league game and looking every inch like the talent who was once hailed as the future of Arsenal and England’s midfield. A player who has received as many blows as Wilshere must be careful not to ask too much of his body. There have been times when his bravery in possession, the way that he pushes the ball forward and tempts opponents into forceful challenges, has conspired against him, leading to long spells on the sidelines. Clearly, though, Wilshere is not afraid of hard work, which he demonstrated with a smart early challenge on Wilfried Zaha. He has been impressive since winning back his place in the first team and there are signs that he is giving Arsenal’s midfield more balance. He is more disciplined than the injured Aaron Ramsey, who likes to burst forward in the style of Frank Lampard or Steven Gerrard, but he is also technically sound and it was his glorious pass from a deep position which allowed Alexis Sánchez to calm Arsenal’s nerves midway through the second half. Arsenal had been rocking after Andros Townsend equalised for Palace shortly after the break. The visitors dominated the opening period, taking the lead when Shkodran Mustafi stroked home the rebound after suspect goalkeeping from Julián Speroni, and they had chances to take the game away from their lowly hosts. Mesut Özil and Alexandre Lacazette missed decent chances, though, and such profligacy left Wenger’s side vulnerable. They have been disappointing on their travels in the league this season – they had only won at Burnley and Everton before arriving in this corner of south-east London – and their flakiness resurfaced after Townsend swept home Zaha’s cutback from the left. In those moments it was possible to see why there can be no guarantees Arsenal will regain their spot in the top four. Sloppy defending also allowed James Tomkins to nod home Palace’s second in the 89th minute, creating a nervous finale. Ending Palace’s eight-match unbeaten run required a gutsy display, however, especially as Arsenal were beaten 3-0 here in April. Those memories briefly came flooding back after Townsend’s leveller, but Arsenal’s individual brilliance made the difference. Sánchez roused himself, lashing a venomous shot past Speroni, and then Wilshere superbly released the Chilean to score his second. Wenger continues to insist that Wilshere will extend his deal if the terms are right. Performances of this class will do wonders for his bargaining power and his hopes of going to next summer’s World Cup."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2017/dec/28/crystal-palace-arsenal-premier-league-match-report","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-28T21:58:55Z","webTitle":"Alexis Sánchez fires Arsenal to victory over Crystal Palace at the double","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/dec/28/crystal-palace-arsenal-premier-league-match-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/dec/28/crystal-palace-arsenal-premier-league-match-report","fields":{"headline":"Alexis Sánchez fires Arsenal to victory over Crystal Palace at the double","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"There was some late anxiety to endure as Crystal Palace, sensing another late rally might be rewarded, flung themselves into desperate pursuit of an unlikely equaliser, but Arsenal are back to counting this corner of south London as a home from home. They had retreated battered and bruised by a chastening defeat at this venue in April, yet they had not benefited from a fit Jack Wilshere in their ranks on that occasion. Times have changed. The England midfielder was at the heart of everything impressive they tried here, spiky in the tackle and mature with his positioning, and a creator of his team’s decisive third goal with a carefully lofted pass over Palace’s back-line for Alexis Sánchez to collect on his thigh and poke into the corner on the gallop. The Chilean’s form, perhaps predictably, is flickering back into life with the transfer window so close and his contract ticking down. Wilshere’s deal, too, expires in the summer, though arguably the visiting fans’ best news of an encouraging night was the midfielder’s post-match assertion that he was sure a new contract “will get done”. On this evidence, he is rightly restored as the side’s fulcrum, his metronomic presence a source of reassurance for a team who have been prone to panic at times. “Jack is coming back in competitive shape and gives something to the team at the moment,” said Wenger. “People who don’t have long contracts are questioned, always. But as long as you are somewhere, you give your best. The best way to show they are committed is to give that kind of performance. I felt Sánchez was very good from the first minute. This kind of Sánchez is a great football player, as we know. That’s the kind of performance we want from him.” Possibly more disconcerting was the sight of the forward looking nonplussed – perhaps more bemused than infuriated – to discover only a handful of team-mates had joined him in front of the away support to celebrate Arsenal’s second goal. Sánchez, all short back-lift and frightening power, had ripped his shot through James Tomkins’ legs and inside Julián Speroni’s near post, but plenty of his colleagues preferred to celebrate together nearer the halfway line. It had Thierry Henry chuntering up in the Sky studio, though, in truth, it is easy to read too much into apparent splits when, in reality, raw emotion at a lead restored had probably taken over. The problem is observers will continue to scrutinise the body language until Sánchez’s time at the club is either extended or ends in divorce. The thought of losing a player of his calibre feels all the more troubling in the aftermath of a performance this scintillating, even if all of Arsenal’s attackers had purred through the opening period. Comfortable with a back three and far more sprightly than tentative opponents, with Palace so nervous as runners infiltrated their lines, the visitors should have ended the contest by the interval. Nothing illustrated their superiority better than Sánchez’s delicious diagonal slide-rule pass beyond Tomkins for the on-rushing Mesut Özil to flick goalwards, only for Speroni to thrust out a left hand instinctively and paw the attempt away. The German would waltz through the centre again before the half was out, this time undoing his work with a heavy touch, but by then Arsenal were ahead. After Palace failed to clear their lines Alexandre Lacazette was permitted to turn inside and curl a left-footed shot which was only pushed out by the diving Speroni. Shkodran Mustafi, alone beyond Martin Kelly at the far post, calmly side-footed into the net. Sánchez, standing with one foot beyond the back-line, had made a vague attempt to reach Lacazette’s effort, but the offside appeals were half-hearted. So had been much of the hosts’ play with frustration eventually overcoming Wilfried Zaha who was booked for dissent as the teams departed for the interval. At least he spent half-time channelling that exasperation into a positive response. He, and Palace, were unrecognisable as an attacking force thereafter. Andros Townsend, after Zaha’s dart beyond Calum Chambers and pull-back from the byline, side-footed the hosts level and they might have led had Chambers not blocked Ruben Loftus-Cheek’s attempt. Even Arsenal’s flurry of goals around the hour-mark did not knock the stuffing from the home side’s approach and Zaha, mistiming a header in front of goal, and Bakary Sako might have scored before Tomkins nodded home as full time approached. That was Palace’s first goal from a set piece this season – so much for such routines being their forte – and provoked late anxiety, but Wenger’s side maintained their composure to survive. This defeat ended Palace’s eight-match unbeaten run and left them a point above the relegation zone. To make matters considerably worse, Manchester City are their opponents at Selhurst Park on Sunday to confront a patched up side. Yet, while Hodgson juggles his options, Arsenal are buoyed. Sunday’s trip to the Hawthorns, another venue where they had sunk without trace last season, suddenly feels like an opportunity."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"science/sifting-the-evidence/2017/dec/29/e-cigarettes-vaping-safer-than-smoking","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-29T12:00:32Z","webTitle":"The evidence keeps piling up: e-cigarettes are definitely safer than smoking","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/sifting-the-evidence/2017/dec/29/e-cigarettes-vaping-safer-than-smoking","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/sifting-the-evidence/2017/dec/29/e-cigarettes-vaping-safer-than-smoking","fields":{"headline":"The evidence keeps piling up: e-cigarettes are definitely safer than smoking","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Search for the term ‘vaping’ online and you’d be forgiven for thinking that it is an activity fraught with risks. The top stories relate to health problems, explosions and that vaping leads to smoking in teenagers. For the average smoker seeking information on vaping, a quick internet search offers little reassurance. Might as well continue smoking, the headlines imply, if these products are so dangerous. But the reality is that they are not. In the past year, more than any other, the evidence that using an e-cigarette is far safer than smoking has continued to accumulate. 2017 saw the publication of the first longer term study of vaping, comparing toxicant exposure between people who’d stopped smoking and used the products for an average of 16 months, compared with those who continued to smoke. Funded by Cancer Research UK, the study found large reductions in carcinogens and other toxic compounds in vapers compared with smokers, but only if the user had stopped smoking completely. A further recent study compared toxicants in vapour and smoke that can cause cancer, and estimated excess cancer risk over a lifetime from smoking cigarettes or vaping. Most of the available data on e-cigarettes in this study suggested a cancer risk from vaping around 1% of that from smoking. E-cigarettes are less harmful than smoking because they don’t contain tobacco. Inhaling burnt tobacco - but also chewing it - is hugely damaging to human health. Remove the tobacco and the combustion and it is hardly surprising that risk is reduced. That doesn’t mean e-cigarettes are harmless. But it does mean that we can be relatively confident that switching from smoking to vaping will have health benefits. These new studies and others have influenced policy, at least in the UK. In England, a broad consensus endorsed by many health organisations has existed since 2016 encouraging smokers to try vaping. This year additional organisations, like the Royal College of General Practitioners and the British Medical Association issued new reports also pointing to e-cigarettes as a positive choice for smokers trying to quit. And for the first time, Public Health England included e-cigarettes in its advertising for ‘Stoptober’ an annual stop smoking campaign. In Scotland, a large number of organisations led by Health Scotland issued a statement making clear that vaping is definitely safer than smoking that was also supported by Scotland’s Chief Medical Officer. Overseas, many countries still ban e-cigarettes and using them can result in fines or even imprisonment for vapers or vendors. Yet gradually this is changing. 2017 saw a complete reversal of New Zealand’s position on these devices and their new policies look very similar to those in place in the UK. Canada is also legalising e-cigarettes, although details of the regulatory framework are still being ironed out. These countries are following the research evidence and in time others may follow. A primary reason for caution in many countries is the fear that vaping will lead to smoking, particularly in young people. This year we did see research suggesting that some teenagers experimenting with vaping go on to smoke when followed up a year later, and this included studies from the UK. There seems little doubt that there are groups of young people susceptible to both. Yet these studies can’t prove that it was the act of trying an e-cigarette that lead to subsequent smoking - many other factors could explain this, including the simple fact that tobacco is still widely available. 2017 saw the publication of the world’s largest study to date of young people and vaping, including over 60,000 teenagers. It found that while experimentation with these products was occurring, regular use by teens who had never smoked remains very low, at less than 1%. Meanwhile in the UK and many other countries like the USA, youth smoking rates continue to decline at an encouraging pace. If vaping was causing smoking, these trends would reverse. So, what is the average smoker to make of the continued controversy, and seemingly insatiable press interest around e-cigarettes? Who should they believe? Good sources of information do exist but they are not prominent enough. We need clear public information, from reputable sources, to shout above the noise and deliver the facts. And these are the facts. If you are a smoker, the best thing you can do for your health and the health of those around you is to stop smoking. If you choose to vape to stop smoking, that’s great, and no one should criticise you for that choice. I think we may well see a public information campaign along those lines in the near future. And from my perspective, it can’t come soon enough. Linda Bauld is Professor of Health Policy at the University of Stirling and Deputy Director of the UK Centre for Tobacco and Alcohol Studies. She also holds a Chair in Behavioural Research for Cancer Prevention at Cancer Research UK, and is the current President of the Society for Research on Nicotine and Tobacco Europe. Her research is funded by government and charitable sources and she has never conducted research or consultancy for tobacco or e-cigarette companies."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2017/dec/28/trump-very-disappointed-china-alleged-oil-supplies-north-korea","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-28T20:01:08Z","webTitle":"Trump claims China 'caught red handed' transferring oil to North Korea","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/dec/28/trump-very-disappointed-china-alleged-oil-supplies-north-korea","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/dec/28/trump-very-disappointed-china-alleged-oil-supplies-north-korea","fields":{"headline":"Trump claims China 'caught red handed' transferring oil to North Korea","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Donald Trump on Thursday said he was “very disappointed that China is allowing oil to go into North Korea” and said such moves would prevent “a friendly solution” to the crisis over Pyongyang’s nuclear program. Earlier, China said there had been no sanction-breaking oil transfers between Chinese ships and North Korean vessels, of the kind described by a South Korea newspaper, Chosun Ilbo, which said spy satellites had detected 30 instances of such transfers since October. That report was picked up by Fox News, commonly a source of information linked to Trump’s tweets. “Caught RED HANDED,” the president wrote, with a characteristic use of capitals. “Very disappointed that China is allowing oil to go into North Korea. There will never be a friendly solution to the North Korea problem if this continues to happen!” Trump was spending another day in Florida, where he was staying at his Mar-a-Lago resort. Before the tweet was sent, the White House press pool reported that he had travelled to one of his golf courses in the state. Trump has often departed from diplomatic niceties when discussing North Korea, both on Twitter and in speeches. In August, for example, he told reporters that if Pyongyang made any more threats to strike the US, it would “be met with fire and fury like the world has never seen”. While repeatedly stressing that all options including military force are on the table, the president has routinely asked that China take responsibility for reducing the threat a nuclear North Korea poses, because it is the isolated nation’s primary trading partner. In an illustrative tweet in April, he wrote: “China is very much the economic lifeline to North Korea so, while nothing is easy, if they want to solve the North Korean problem, they will.” On Thursday, Rex Tillerson, the secretary of state, urged Beijing to exert “decisive economic leverage” on Pyongyang. “China has applied certain import bans and sanctions, but it could and should do more,” he wrote in the New York Times. The UN security council last week unanimously imposed new sanctions on North Korea, in response to a recent intercontinental ballistic missile test. The US-drafted UN resolution seeks to ban nearly 90% of refined petroleum exports to North Korea by capping them at 500,000 barrels a year. The resolution also caps crude oil supplies to North Korea at 4m barrels a year and commits the security council to further reductions if North Korea conducts another nuclear test or launches another ICBM. Documents seen by Reuters this month showed that Washington called on the security council to blacklist 10 ships for circumventing sanctions by conducting ship-to-ship transfers of refined petroleum products to North Korean vessels or transporting North Korean coal. China and Russia subsequently asked for more time to consider the proposal. In September, the security council put a cap of 2m barrels a year on refined petroleum products exports to North Korea. China has repeatedly said it is fully enforcing all resolutions against North Korea, despite suspicion in Washington, Seoul and Tokyo that loopholes still exist. Asked at a regular briefing whether Chinese ships were illegally providing oil to North Korean ships, a Chinese defence ministry spokesman, Ren Guoqiang, reiterated that China, including the military, strictly enforced UN resolutions. “The situation you have mentioned absolutely does not exist,” he said. A US state department official suggested on Wednesday that such transfers could still be going on. “Ship-to-ship transfers … remain a concern as part of North Korea’s sanctions evasions activities,” the official said, while declining to provide details. A state department spokesman, Michael Cavey, reiterated that the US had called on all countries to cut economic ties with North Korea. “We urge China to end all economic ties with the DPRK, including tourism, and the provision of any oil or petroleum products, and expel all DPRK workers,” he said, using the acronym for North Korea’s official name, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2017/dec/28/the-facts-on-fiction-and-marleys-origins","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-28T17:28:45Z","webTitle":"The facts on fiction and Marley’s origins | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/dec/28/the-facts-on-fiction-and-marleys-origins","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2017/dec/28/the-facts-on-fiction-and-marleys-origins","fields":{"headline":"The facts on fiction and Marley’s origins","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"With reference to your leader on literary fiction (28 December), as a small publisher we are faced with huge obstacles in the way of selling our books or even letting anyone know our titles exist, however good they are. Last year we published an excellent novel called To the Lake, by a Russian writer, Yana Vagner. This had sold over 100,000 copies in Russia, and is being made into a TV series there. It has won prizes throughout Europe, and been translated into half a dozen languages, with sales outside Russia running into tens of thousands. We paid an advance to the author, a fee to a translator, and typesetting, cover design and printing costs, a total of about £9,000. We sent at least 50 copies out to major periodicals, newspapers and broadcast media in the hope of getting reviews, but there were none. The one thing we couldn’t afford was advertising, at a cost of £1,000 or so for a quarter page in a literary journal and far more in widely selling newspapers. So far, we have sold 64 copies. Can anyone wonder why we don’t publish more such books? Karl Sabbagh Managing director, Skyscraper Publications • Dr Christopher Goulding (Letters, 26 December) may regard Barry West’s “theory” about Dickens’ use of the name Marley as tenuous; in our family we regard it as long-established fact. I am a descendant of Dr Miles Marley on my mother’s side, and was born in Padstow. Our family also owns the little portrait of him that was reproduced in the article. I knew Adela Harvey (née Marley), his granddaughter, and her daughter was my godmother. Adela related that Dickens often dined at 11 Cork Street (Dr Marley’s home) and that the conversation between the two men was on St Patrick’s Day, when Dickens said: “By the end of the year, your name will be a household word.” She had no doubt it was true. (We also knew that Marley’s grave was at St Endellion.) So Full marks to Barry West for getting it right, though we could have saved him some trouble.

And there’s nothing that provokes more fury among the middle classes than the prospect of an average home, particularly in the south of England, being grabbed off them at death by the evil taxman. Except that it’s a complete load of codswallop. A report on Saturday from the Resolution Foundation lifts the lid on what’s really happening with inheritances. Firstly, let’s call a halt to the nonsense that the money goes to kids, or to young adults needing a hand up the property ladder. The average age at which someone receives an inheritance is 61. These people are certainly not “kids” – indeed, many of the recipients of unearned inheritances (largely created by property inflation, not personal endeavour) will be grandparents themselves. Now let’s look at who receives the money. The report reveals how it doesn’t really go to those who need a leg-up – it goes to those who already have assets. Resolution looked at the millennial generation – generally those seen as reaching their late teens and early 20s after 2000 – and found that the ones who haven’t got on the property ladder are likely to be those whose parents also never made it. In contrast, 83% of millennials who have bought their homes have parents who also bought their own homes. You can see where inheritance is going. What it does is simply entrench inequality and make the divide between the housing haves and have-nots wider. Make no mistake about the flood of inheritance money on its way, with the amount of money passed on set to more than double over the next two decades and peak in 2035, as high-wealth baby boomers progress through old age. But this money won’t be a silver bullet for younger adults priced out of the property market. As the Resolution Foundation says, “inheritances will be distributed unequally and arrive far too late in life”. Social mobility risks grinding to a near halt, making it much more difficult to become wealthy from one’s own endeavours. Society will, more than ever, be run for the benefit of a trustafarian gerontocracy of the 60-plus who inherited property, not a society where entrepreneurial vigour counts. Of course, the rightwing papers tell you all the money is being gobbled up by evil inheritance taxes – a typical Express headline this year was “Shock poll reveals pensioners’ despair at not leaving more to children”. The headline would not work so well if we replaced the word “children” with “61-year olds”. The tax haul from IHT is indeed up – it will be £5.3bn in this tax year, up from £4.7bn in 2016/17. But that amounts to just 0.08% of the UK’s £6tn in property wealth. And the vast majority of people won’t pay a penny in tax: the current tax-free allowance is £325,000, but that rises to £425,000 if the money is going to children or grandchildren. What’s more, the surviving partner from a married couple is allowed to use both tax-free allowances. So parents can already pass on as much as £850,000 without paying a penny in tax. Given that the average property price in the UK is £210,000, and many elderly people will have to pay large care home bills, the reality is that tiny numbers are caught in the net. Every cut in inheritance tax, such as Trump’s immoral estates plan that allows couples to pass down up to $22m tax free, is designed to benefit the 1%, not the many. The problem with inheritance is that we don’t tax it more. We live in a country where social care for the elderly is in crisis; we could solve it by abandoning the toxic phrase “inheritance tax” and renaming it something like “pensioner care contribution”, then raise the rate to 50% and drop the threshold back to the average property price. But the wealthy won’t let this happen; as billionaire Leona Helmsley said, “We don’t pay taxes; only the little people pay taxes.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/dec/28/the-guardian-view-on-social-mobility-lost-in-brexitland","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-28T17:05:20Z","webTitle":"The Guardian view on social mobility: lost in Brexitland | Editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/28/the-guardian-view-on-social-mobility-lost-in-brexitland","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/28/the-guardian-view-on-social-mobility-lost-in-brexitland","fields":{"headline":"The Guardian view on social mobility: lost in Brexitland","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"In the wake of two more reports predicting growing inequality in Britain, it is worth looking back to the start of the month and the abrupt resignation of Alan Milburn from the Social Mobility Commission, along with all its commissioners. “The growing sense that we have become an ‘us and them’ society is deeply corrosive of our cohesion as a nation,” wrote Mr Milburn in his resignation letter. This was a moment that confirmed two things about Theresa May’s government. First, there is no energy in Whitehall for anything except getting out of the EU. The commission had been left to stew, its recommendations ignored, departing members not replaced, its resources inadequate. Second, Mrs May’s words about helping the so-called left-behind may have been meant in earnest but it will be no more of a priority for her than it was for her predecessors. No wonder the commission’s reports had grown ever more blunt about the failure to improve the chances of the least well off. Social mobility, a phrase meant to capture the ease with which children can do better than their parents, was made common currency by Gordon Brown. In 2009 he asked Mr Milburn, a Blair-era cabinet minister who has become an expert in the interlocking policies that shape life chances, to look at how to improve them. Three years later Mr Milburn was asked by the coalition to head the new Social Mobility Commission. In June this year he published a report that reviewed the past 20 years of social policy, and explicitly called for a change of direction. A government serious about fairness would have listened. Instead, with the distinguished exception of the education secretary, Justine Greening, inertia ruled. In November the commission published its fifth and final State of the Nation report, and then resigned en masse. It is easy to see why Mrs May lost interest in the commission as a vehicle for helping the least advantaged. She interprets her mandate as delivering on Brexit and increasing the number of grammar schools. The commission, cross-party in its membership, notably unpolitical in its prescriptions, recommends 10-year time horizons and policymaking that is coherently designed and consistently applied. That means recognising – for example – that early years interventions are an important extension of the welfare state intended to eliminate the irrecoverable gap between poor and better-off children when they start school – and not primarily a way of making sure mothers can work. It means ending the constant structural reforms to education and allowing change to bed down; and recognising that while access to university is important, so are the prospects for the large proportion of the low-paid workforce who, rather than move up the pay scale, move out of work entirely. It means ending over-generous pensioner benefits, tougher tax rules on housing wealth, and an end to huge disparities in regional and sometimes intra-regional spending. Following the Brexit referendum, few would argue with the commission’s depiction of a country divided by age, geography, income and wealth. After 1997, the disadvantages of being born into poorer families started to be eroded by higher spending and a growing economy. Now that is stalled – not only because of the shrinking state, nor the inevitable impact of globalisation, but because it is not the measure of success by which Conservative governments want to be judged. That much was clear when the coalition set up the commission in the name of “improving life chances”, and at the same time abandoned Mr Brown’s targets for reducing child poverty. Meanwhile, economists developed the idea of the Great Gatsby curve, showing that the greater a country’s wealth equality, the higher the social mobility. An important academic debate about the impact of framing – between a focus on social mobility and a focus on promoting equality – is now beginning to shape public policy choices. Some Tories believe that social mobility is the same as meritocracy; it is not. Realising talent takes more than a level playing field, and meritocracy can all too easily turn into a justification for an elite’s defence of its privilege. It was the great Guardian journalist Simon Hoggart who first pointed out the law of the ridiculous reverse: no politician would declare they intended to govern for the few. But that can still be the impact of their policy choices. Mr Milburn’s moribund Social Mobility Commission has mapped out how to make a reality of governing for the country as a whole. It is time for a change."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"technology/2017/dec/31/ripple-cryptocurrency-bitcoin-value","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-31T19:35:44Z","webTitle":"Ripple: cryptocurrency enjoys end-of-year surge – but will it endure?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/dec/31/ripple-cryptocurrency-bitcoin-value","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2017/dec/31/ripple-cryptocurrency-bitcoin-value","fields":{"headline":"Ripple: cryptocurrency enjoys end-of-year surge – but will it endure?","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"If 2017 was the year of bitcoin, the pioneering cryptocurrency that neared $20,000 in December, will 2018 be the year of Ripple? The market value of Ripple, also known as XRP, rose more than 50% on Friday, to a record $85bn. Ripple continued to climb over the weekend, peaking at over $100bn, and now surpasses Ethereum ($72bn) as the second most valuable cryptocurrency after bitcoin ($237bn). Friday’s sharp run-up puts the currency on track to have risen in value by more than 35,000% over the course of 2017. It began the year trading at around $0.006 and now sits at $2.25, according to coinmarketcap.com. Just three weeks ago, the currency was trading at 25¢. According to Bloomberg, Ripple’s gains in 2017 have far outpaced the gains of Ethereum and bitcoin, which have gained roughly 9,000 and 1,400% year-to-date, respectively. Ripple’s CEO, Brad Garlinghouse, said on Twitter on Sunday: “Proud to be ending 2017 with incredible momentum on a number of fronts! A huge, heartfelt thank you to the amazing @Ripple team, our great partners and an incredibly supportive $XRP community.” The gains come as Ripple has made steps to establish itself as a coherent currency used by institutions. Established in 2012 and designed for interbank payments and settlements, Ripple has articulated a vision to ease the intense volatility experienced by other cryptocurrencies by establishing the structured sale and use of its currency. The company has more than 100 banks signed on to its platform, RippleNet, and was recently accepted for testing by a consortium of Japanese banks. Global banks including Bank of America, RBC and UBS are also customers. The company initially created 99bn XRP, and has released around 38bn. In May, Garlinghouse announced the company would place 55bn of its XRP into escrow and will unleash up to 1bn into the market each month. Garlinghouse, formerly a senior executive at Yahoo and AOL, and CEO of the file transfer site Hightail (formerly YouSendIt), told the Wall Street Journal that the recent gains are a reflection of confidence in the coin’s development. “We have real customers, really in production using this,” Garlinghouse, 46, said, “not science experiments. Science experiments are not a business model.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2017/dec/31/nottingham-forest-sack-manager-mark-warburton-owners-lose-confidence","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-31T10:34:11Z","webTitle":"Nottingham Forest sack Mark Warburton as owners lose confidence","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/dec/31/nottingham-forest-sack-manager-mark-warburton-owners-lose-confidence","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/dec/31/nottingham-forest-sack-manager-mark-warburton-owners-lose-confidence","fields":{"headline":"Nottingham Forest sack Mark Warburton as owners lose confidence","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Nottingham Forest are looking for a new manager after losing faith in Mark Warburton and sacking him on the back of their 14th league defeat of the season.

But you would never know it from the Queensland cabinet minutes from that year, released on 1 January. Nor could you guess at the impact the Fitzgerald inquiry would have on the state for decades to come. Instead, the documents released after 30 years reveal the “hillbilly dictator” desperately attempting business as usual in an environment that was anything but. Having won government in his own right the year before, Bjelke-Petersen used the first day of 1987 to announce his intention to run for prime minister. By February, in what has become known as the Hervey Bay resolutions, the Queensland Nationals’ president, Robert Sparkes, decreed the state party’s support for the move. By April Queensland Nationals MPs had withdrawn from the federal Coalition but Bjelke-Petersen’s campaign was already beginning to run off the rails. Privately, Sparkes had fallen out with Bjelke-Petersen, and the then Labor prime minister, Bob Hawke, and his government did all they could to capitalise on the disunity within the federal Coalition, while the then Liberal leader, John Howard, learned firsthand why “disunity is death”. Hawke called a snap election, catching Bjelke-Petersen unawares. The Queensland leader was forced to announce his candidacy from Disneyland. He hadn’t even nominated as a federal candidate before he left and, his supporters dwindling in number, struggled to find enough pro-Joh candidates for a ticket. “Joh for PM” became “Joh for Canberra” before fizzling out to nothing. But Bjelke-Petersen had bigger problems. The white-shoe brigade of property developers, a group of developers predominantly found on the Gold Coast, had begun to attract notice from outside the state. Cracks in the institutionally corrupt government he had overseen were widening to chasms and friends were few and far between. It was during his ill-timed trip to the US that the ABC, following on from the work from the Courier-Mail journalist Phil Dickie, aired The Moonlight State, a Four Corners exposé of corruption in Queensland. Acting premier Bill Gunn faced the media on 12 May to announce an independent inquiry into the allegations. On 25 May, he took it to cabinet, as a secret submission, with the result that the QC Tony Fitzgerald was appointed to head the inquiry. Bjelke-Peteresen wasn’t there. It was the only reason the inquiry went ahead. By the time the premier returned to Queensland, the wheels were in motion and deemed too far along the track to be halted. But that didn’t stop Bjelke-Petersen continuing on as if Rome wasn’t burning. It was in 1987 that the white shoe brigade, who found that a well placed brown paper bag could help pave the way to approvals, came to prominence. Russ Hinze, the “minister for everything”, who would resign in disgrace in February 1988, and who died before corruption charges could be levelled against him, used his ministerial power to rezone land to ensure developments, opposed by local councils and communities, could go ahead. Hinze was also known as the “minister who could get things done” and that included approving the Sanctuary Cove resort, developed by Mike Gore, a well-known supporter of Bjelke-Petersen. The Bjelke-Petersen government passed a special act of parliament to ensure it became a reality. The Sanctuary Cove Resort Act allowed for an additional 210 hectares of land to be released for 500 residences and an 18-hole golf course. Objections from local councils over other developments were overcome through rezoning. The cabinet minutes show that is how north Queensland received its Trinity Beach resort and how Brisbane ended up with the Myer Centre. The redevelopment of the historic Port Office site, in Brisbane’s CBD, came up repeatedly during 1987 cabinet discussions – and then during the Fitzgerald inquiry. But by August, when the cabinet was considering the world’s tallest building proposal for Brisbane, Bjelke-Petersen was rapidly losing allies. The man who would take his position as premier, then health minister Mike Ahern, who had already battled Bjelke-Petersen over his response to the HIV crisis, noted this period of time marked “the beginning of the end”. Ahern spent much of 1987 fighting Bjelke-Petersen over his insistence condom machines be removed from the University of Queensland and Griffith University. He also challenged Bjelke-Petersen’s attitude that HIV should be allowed to wipe out local Indigenous communities. The minutes also reveal that the premier, along with two departmental heads, travelled to Romania to meet communist dictator Nicolae Ceaușescu. With his bid to head to Canberra to stop Labor’s “socialist policies”, including Medicare, having failed, Bjelke-Petersen sought to embrace Ceausescu in a bid to sell 2m tonnes of coking coal to Romania. The country had no money, so it was proposed that coking coal, used in steel production, would be swapped for oil, steel, machines, fertiliser and trains. It appeared to fail because of a lack of interest from local coal producers. Ceausescu and his wife, Elena, were executed by firing squad in 1989 after the communist regimes of eastern Europe were overthrown. Bjelke-Petersen and his delegation then headed to London as he tried to stop the Hawke government locking up tracts of rainforest as national heritage land, a move the premier opposed because of the restrictions it would put on mining and agriculture. As his government crumbled around him, Bjelke-Petersen also moved to fight a widening of the Great Barrier Reef marine park for the same reason. As 1987 drew to a close, Bjelke-Petersen found himself with a rapidly diminishing circle of allies. He headed to the governor’s house in an attempt to sack members of the executive who opposed him. Sir Walter Campbell refused. Instead, he managed to sack three of his biggest critics, including Ahern, from his ministry. But his victory lasted only seven days. He held his last cabinet meeting on 30 November 1987. There was no hint of what was to come in the minutes. The next day, under pressure from the public and members of his government, Bjelke-Petersen resigned as premier, ending a 19-year political career that still reverberates around Queensland three decades later."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2017/dec/31/pdc-world-darts-semi-finals-cross-van-gerwen-taylor-lewis","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-31T01:22:10Z","webTitle":"Debutant Rob Cross stuns Michael van Gerwen to set up final with Phil Taylor","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/dec/31/pdc-world-darts-semi-finals-cross-van-gerwen-taylor-lewis","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/dec/31/pdc-world-darts-semi-finals-cross-van-gerwen-taylor-lewis","fields":{"headline":"Debutant Rob Cross stuns Michael van Gerwen to set up final with Phil Taylor","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"World championship debutant Rob Cross will face 16-time champion Phil Taylor in Monday’s final after the No20 seed shocked world No1 Michael van Gerwen 6-5 in an epic semi-final. Cross held his nerve in a sudden-death leg to win the deciding set by six legs to five after Van Gerwen had missed five darts at a match-winning double. He will take on Taylor for the title after the No6 seed overcame qualifier Jamie Lewis 6-1 in his final professional tournament. When Van Gerwen lifted the trophy at Alexandra Palace back in January, Cross was still an amateur player having recently secured his first PDC tour card. The 27-year-old has climbed the rankings rapidly since but was still a firm outsider against the defending champion. It was clear from the outset however that Cross would not be overawed by the occasion, trading blows with Van Gerwen as the players shared the first two sets. Cross then checked out from 161 to grab the fifth set from his opponent’s grasp. Van Gerwen won the sixth set 3-0 but Cross retaliated in the seventh, taking it 3-1 with a 126 checkout. The Dutchman took the next set in three straight legs and after Cross led 2-0 in the eighth, rallied to take a 5-4 lead. The No1 seed looked set to complete the job and seal the expected heavyweight final against Taylor but his opponent found renewed purpose to take the first two legs. Van Gerwen then missed three darts at double top to level the set, setting up a decider at a raucous Ally Pally. Both players maintained averages above 100 in a breathless final set, with Cross missing a shot at bull to snatch victory in the sixth leg. The pressure appeared to be telling on the debutant, and Van Gerwen pounced to hit double 12 in the ninth leg and throw for the match. Incredibly, the double world champion blew five chances to win, and Cross found his composure to check out on double 18 and set up a sudden-death leg. It was the underdog who threw first, and he held his nerve to clinch an astonishing win on double eight. Cross told Sky Sports: “Words can’t explain it. Don’t get me wrong, I played well but the crowd helped me, they really did. They got on Michael’s back and that’s why I won. “At points I felt inexperienced, I really did, but I still got through. I will come out [in the final] and want to win. “[Taylor] is my favourite player actually. He was dominant and now he’s leaving, it’s going to be special for him but at the same time I’ve got to do my own job and do what I need to do to win that game. “I never expected this, it’s amazing, absolutely amazing. I never expected this rise, I really didn’t. I’m just a working boy, I come from a normal household and don’t get me wrong, I believe in my own ability and that’s only why I got here.” Taylor one step from 17th title after win over Lewis Phil Taylor will make his professional darts swansong in the world championship final after he defeated Jamie Lewis 6-1 in the earlier semi-final. Taylor started strongly and broke Lewis’ throw in the first leg then led 2-0, but the Welsh qualifier hit back and won the next three legs to claim the first set with a double 16 finish. The second set was as closely matched but Taylor edged past his 26-year-old opponent after he missed a double 13 finish to level at 1-1. The third set also went to a fifth leg thanks to a 100 checkout from Taylor, with three missed darts from Lewis then allowing the 16-time world champion a shot at double 20 to move 2-1 ahead in sets, which he duly took. Taylor’s experience proved crucial as the match developed, with Lewis missing opportunities to close out legs as the No6 seed rattled off three sets to lead 5-1. Lewis put up a fight in the seventh set by claiming the first two legs but Taylor pegged him back before clinching victory to the joy of the packed crowd. He now faces Cross, who was born six months after Taylor won his first BDO title, in an intriguing final. “I’m over the moon. The first two or three sets I didn’t know where I was. I was struggling, I couldn’t put three darts together,” Taylor said. “Now I’m retiring, [Jamie Lewis] is the one to watch for, trust me, because he’s a lovely player, he’s got a cracking family behind him and he’s got no airs and graces, just gets on with his job. I can’t say enough about him.” PA"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"music/2017/dec/31/police-investigate-alleged-sexual-assault-in-falls-festival-mosh-pit","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-31T00:25:27Z","webTitle":"Police investigate alleged sexual assault in Falls festival mosh pit","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/dec/31/police-investigate-alleged-sexual-assault-in-falls-festival-mosh-pit","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2017/dec/31/police-investigate-alleged-sexual-assault-in-falls-festival-mosh-pit","fields":{"headline":"Police investigate alleged sexual assault in Falls festival mosh pit","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Police in Tasmania are investigating reports of a sexual assault at Falls festival in Marion Bay. In a statement, Tasmania police said a 19-year-old woman was sexually assaulted by an unknown man in the mosh pit of the main stage about 9.30pm Friday, during a set by the Jungle Giants. She was helped out of the mosh pit by other women before being taken to police. “Police and event organisers condemn the behaviour and are urging those joining the mosh pit to stay with friends and if you become isolated or feel unsafe at any time to seek assistance from the nearest police officer or event security,” the police statement said. “Police would like to hear from anyone who may have witnessed the incident and in particular would like to speak with two female patrons who assisted the victim exit the mosh pit on Friday night.” A second young woman complained of being sexually assaulted at festival on Saturday evening. Police said the victim was given support after the assault in the camping area on Saturday evening, but did not want police to formally investigate. Festival organisers said they were aware of the reports. “We have been made aware of these complaints, and have been told by police these are allegations at this point, until the police have concluded their investigations, we are unable to comment,” festival co-producer Paul Piticco said. Undercover police joined uniformed officers patrolling the music festival this year, after last year’s festival was marred by reports of five sexual assaults, including one rape in the camping area. Most of the assaults reported last year occurred in the mosh pit. “The mosh pit, yes it is designed for close contact, people crowding in,” Tasmanian senior sergeant Troy Hodge told the ABC. “What we saw last year was deliberate acts of assaults and that’s the behaviour we don’t want to tolerate.” He urged victims of and bystanders to inappropriate sexual behaviour to report it to police. “Police will be there [in the mosh pit] supervising — they might have a slight jig or two — but they’ll be just there supervising the mosh pit,” he said. “Inappropriate behaviour or behaviour that makes someone feel uncomfortable won’t be tolerated.” Police reiterated that message on Saturday, saying: “The key message is that although there’s close contact in the mosh pit, any form of touching without the other person’s consent is not OK.” Stickers with the message “enjoy the festival, don’t assault anyone” have been plastered around the venue. Music industry players launched the Your Choice campaign following the reported sexual assaults at Falls festival last year, encouraging bands and promoters to do more to stamp out sexual assault at their gigs. This month, leading Australian artists launched the #MeNoMore movement calling out sexual assault, harassment, and rape in the Australian music industry."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"football/2018/jan/01/football-transfer-rumours-gareth-bale-back-to-spurs-part-of-harry-kane-deal","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-01T08:37:03Z","webTitle":"Football transfer rumours: Gareth Bale back to Spurs as part of Harry Kane deal?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jan/01/football-transfer-rumours-gareth-bale-back-to-spurs-part-of-harry-kane-deal","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/jan/01/football-transfer-rumours-gareth-bale-back-to-spurs-part-of-harry-kane-deal","fields":{"headline":"Football transfer rumours: Gareth Bale back to Spurs as part of Harry Kane deal?","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"It’s that time again!

Sadly, it’s a case of same fluff, different year. Which of the usual suspects to begin with? How about Alexis Sánchez? It seems that Manchester City move put on ice for fear of the Chilean being the new Rodney Marsh may be back on, with Gabriel Jesus facing two months out. As one South American of dubious popularity departs, another may arrive at Arsenal – they’re keen on David Luiz, currently on the receiving end of Antonio Conte’s cold shoulder. Next on the roll call is Eden Hazard, whose circumstances remain clear as mud. Some say that Real Madrid are prepping an opening bid; others think Zinedine Zidane has got cold feet, with Marco Asensio developing and a move for Harry Kane in the offing. Real are prepared to offer Gareth Bale – a player Spurs sold them for £85m – and a ton of cash in a £150m deal. Oof, those 2018 prices. Tottenham could reinvest the cash on Bordeaux hotshot Malcom, and a bumper new deal for Toby Alderweireld. Barcelona could be about to do us all a favour by snapping up two Rumour Mill regulars at once. They are set to renew their interest, if it ever really went away, in Philippe Coutinho. Get your shirts here! The Catalan giants are not so presumptuous about Antoine Griezmann but fancy adding the Frenchman to their new-look forward line. That could be bad news for Arda Turan, Gerard Deulofeu and a host of others who will be surplus to requirements. In addition to bad luck, marginal refereeing decisions and Manchester City’s outlay on full-backs, José Mourinho has decided to lay blame for Manchester United’s stagnation on Henrikh Mkhitaryan. He could be farmed out to Internazionale, with João Mário and the striker Mauro Icardi– one to surely unite the Old Trafford dressing room – heading the other way. Matteo Darmian might also be off to Italy – he’s caught in a painful tug-of-war between Juventus, Napoli and Roma. Theo Walcott has been linked with a move away from Arsenal since the Mill was a young pup chasing down youth team rumours. But this month, it might finally happen,with Everton, Southampton, West Ham United and Watford forming an orderly queue. Watford are also closing in on Leicester outcast Islam Slimani, with Claude Puel busy ordering more padded waistcoats and targeting a full-back. Celta Vigo’s Jonny, Benfica’s André Almeida and Bournemouth’s Adam Smith are on his list. Finally, a team that know how to do business.

An NHS-wide lack of interventional radiologists means that some patients are having to undergo major, life-changing operations – ending up disabled after a stroke or losing a limb as a result of diabetes – simply because they cannot get the minimally invasive help they need, senior doctors have revealed. They have spoken out to highlight the human cost of the health service’s shortage of specialist radiologists after the government admitted that one in four hospitals cannot provide such care to patients every day of the week because they cannot recruit enough of them. Interventional radiologists are doctors who are also known as “image-guided surgeons” and use state-of-the-art imaging devices to pinpoint where in the body medical problems have occurred. They then perform minimally invasive surgery to stop acute bleeding, remove life-threatening blockages such as blood clots and also treat cancers and the potentially fatal infection sepsis. Advances in medicine mean they now perform almost one million procedures a year, NHS figures show. “There is no doubt that around the country people are dying or coming to serious harm due to the lack of interventional radiology provision in their area, although we can’t explicitly quantify how many people die or suffer because they do not get seen by an interventional radiologist,” Dr Nicola Strickland, president of the Royal College of Radiologists (RCR), told the Observer. “We know of cases where patients suffering severe bleeding from their kidneys and post-operative bleeding have died because they were unable to reach an interventional radiologist in time.” One patient had an obstruction in their bile duct and had it drained but then developed an aneurysm, a life-threatening weakness in the wall of an artery. But the hospital could not get hold of an interventional radiologist in time and the patient died, said Strickland. The shortage – a dramatic illustration of the NHS’s staffing crisis – means that some women who suffer a haemorrhage as a result of giving birth are having to undergo a hysterectomy to stop them bleeding to death. “It’s tragic for a young woman who wants more children to lose her womb unnecessarily due to lack of interventional radiology,” said Strickland. In other cases, patients end up needing to have a colostomy bag fitted after having part of their colon removed, again because the NHS could not provide specialist help. And in others the shortage means that people who have had a stroke end up permanently disabled. “It’s outrageously unfair that if you have had the misfortune to have a thrombotic stroke in a part of the country where there are no neuro-specialist interventional radiologists, or no out-of-hours stroke thrombectomy services, you could end up in a wheelchair with half your body paralysed and possibly not being able to speak,” added Strickland. “This postcode lottery, where the NHS is unable to offer the 24/7 care by these IR specialists that everyone agrees is crucial to ensure good patient care, means that some patients come to avoidable harm because their urgent health needs are not addressed. This really serious shortage of these specialists across the NHS is having a damagingly negative effect on patient care.” Her intervention follows health minister Philip Dunne’s recent disclosure, in a parliamentary written answer, that 39 out of 148 hospital trusts in England – 26% – are so short of interventional radiologists that they cannot offer the service to patients across all seven days of the week. Hospitals have about 44% fewer interventional radiologists than they need. Five years after a government-commissioned review said the NHS in England needed about 735 of the specialists to provide a 24/7 on-call service everywhere, there are just 414 of them, according to RCR figures. In a recent case, a cyclist who had severe bleeding in his thigh after being hit by a car avoided having to have a leg amputated because an interventional radiologist was able to perform a procedure called coil embolisation. Dr Trevor Cleveland, an interventional radiologist at the Sheffield Vascular Institute and president of the British Society of Interventional Radiology, said the shortage means that some patients end up being transferred as a medical emergency to another hospital, sometimes as far as 100 miles away, so they can receive specialist help. However, “inter-hospital transfer of seriously ill patients can be risky and complex”, and many NHS trusts do not have any arrangements in place to ensure a patient who needs interventional radiology is moved quickly to another hospital, he said. The Department of Health declined to comment on the claims of patients dying and suffering avoidable harm, and insisted that hospitals were obliged to ensure that all units were safely staffed. A spokesperson said: “There are 29% more clinical radiologists than in 2010, and Health Education England is running an additional 35 clinical radiology training programmes each year from 2017 to 2021. “We expect trust boards to take responsibility for safe staffing in their hospitals, and support doctors to decide the best course of action for their patients.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2017/dec/30/chris-grayling-must-quit-says-lord-adonis-east-coast-line-bailout","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-30T22:00:12Z","webTitle":"Lord Adonis calls on Grayling to quit and slams ‘broken’ Brexit government","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/dec/30/chris-grayling-must-quit-says-lord-adonis-east-coast-line-bailout","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/dec/30/chris-grayling-must-quit-says-lord-adonis-east-coast-line-bailout","fields":{"headline":"Lord Adonis calls on Grayling to quit and slams ‘broken’ Brexit government","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Lord Adonis is calling for the resignation of transport secretary Chris Grayling for using hundreds of millions in taxpayers’ money to bail out private rail companies – a decision which the former government infrastructure tsar says is symptomatic of a government that has “broken down” under the strain of Brexit. Adonis, who resigned as head of the government-backed National Infrastructure Commission on Friday, says in an interview with the Observer that the decision has landed taxpayers with a potential bill running into billions and will lead to higher fares and less investment in the network. His intervention comes as rail passengers brace themselves for the biggest fare rises in five years, which come into effect on Tuesday. Commuter groups and opposition politicians are planning protests across the country. With the price of season tickets set to increase by up to 3.6% Labour, unions and transport groups warned that commuters were starting to turn their back on rail travel. Adonis said his relations with government had become severely strained over Brexit in recent months. But it was Grayling’s move to bail out Stagecoach and Virgin, which were contracted to run the East Coast line until 2023, that was the final straw. “Handing a cheque worth hundreds of millions of pounds to Richard Branson and Brian Souter [chair of Stagecoach] would be indefensible at the best of times but we are now at the worst of times with a Brexit squeeze on the public finances and with rail fares going through the roof,” Adonis said. “The cost of this bailout is going to be a slashing of the national infrastructure programme and even bigger fare rises – and as that becomes apparent in parliament and in the media I think Chris Grayling’s position is going to become untenable. It is of a piece with him being a radical Brexiter to whom everything is subordinate to hard-right ideology.” Adonis added: “I think he is going to have to go because, as he is forced to defend a massive bailout to the private sector, the question will be asked by the public accounts committee and the National Audit Office – why didn’t you adopt the alternative course which was to set up state companies to avoid the need for a bailout? He has no answer to that. He deliberately avoided doing so for ideological reasons and he was not even upfront about not doing so.” Grayling announced at the end of November that a new partnership would take responsibility for intercity trains and track operations on the East Coast route in 2020. Virgin Trains East Coast, involving Stagecoach and Sir Richard Branson’s Virgin, had previously agreed to pay the government £3.3bn to run the service until 2023. The Department for Transport refused to comment on Adonis’s criticism of Grayling. But sources said it was “unacceptable” for Adonis to make “misleading” statements. They said there was no bailout and the Virgin Stagecoach joint venture would continue to meet its financial commitments. Adonis said Grayling should have followed his own example when, as Labour transport secretary in 2009, he set up a new state-owned company to take over the line on a temporary basis when National Express ran into difficulties. He claimed that the reason Grayling did not do so was because he did not want to “legitimise” Jeremy Corbyn’s policy of taking rail back into the public sector. Adonis said his experience in working with the Tory government in recent months had shown him that the entire system had become dysfunctional: “Good government has essentially broken down in the face of Brexit. Normal standards of conduct are not being observed. Independent advice is being dismissed because remember experts were supposedly part of the problem. All the experts in Whitehall are trying to square the circle of leaving the EU, the single market, the customs union without undermining British trade and British jobs and, since that is an impossibility, even the best minds in Whitehall are not able to do that. There is very low morale in Whitehall because almost no civil servants agree with the policy of the government. “I do not think there has ever been a period when the civil service has been more disaffected from the government it serves.” A Department for Transport spokesperson said: “No one is getting a bailout and Virgin Stagecoach will continue to meet its financial commitments made on the East Coast rail franchise to the taxpayer as it has done since 2015. “Stagecoach has also – on average - paid 20% more back to the taxpayer than when the line was operated by Directly Operated Rail and we continue to receive hundreds of millions of pounds. “The decision bring in a partnership to run the service from 2020 is to ensure the train companies work more closely with those responsible for the infrastructure like the track and signalling to help improve the service for passengers.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2017/dec/31/brexit-threat-to-arts","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-31T00:04:15Z","webTitle":"British cultural leaders fear the end of free movement","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/dec/31/brexit-threat-to-arts","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/dec/31/brexit-threat-to-arts","fields":{"headline":"British cultural leaders fear the end of free movement","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"A survey of leading figures in British cultural life, among them theatre director Sir Nicholas Hytner, ITV chairman Sir Peter Bazalgette, and acclaimed artists such as Nitin Sawhney, Lenny Henry, Beverley Knight and Jo Brand, reveals that most now fear the biggest threat to Britain’s creative reputation is the loss of freedom of movement in Europe after a potential hard Brexit. For the overwhelming majority of the 50 cultural leaders, the ability of artists to continue to work abroad freely is a higher priority even than maintaining seriously jeopardised levels of funding. “Brexit has been a total disaster from its inception to its current execution,” said Sawhney, who this year won an Ivor Novello lifetime achievement award for his music. “The impact on the arts will be devastating. It will have a hugely negative impact on the perception of the UK as a multicultural hub of creativity and free expression.” The results of the research, conducted by the thinktank Global Future and released to the Observer, show a clear level of agreement across dance, theatre, music and the visual arts about the dangers of ending artists’ ability to work freely throughout Europe. Those creative leaders who took part, including the revered dancers and ballet company directors Tamara Rojo and Akram Khan, along with Alistair Spalding, artistic director of Sadler’s Wells, and Alex Beard, head of the Royal Opera House, spoke with almost one voice, with 46 out of 50 saying a hard Brexit that ended free movement would have a negative or even devastating impact. For Paul Roseby, director of the National Youth Theatre, where many stars, including Daniel Craig, Matt Lucas, Kate Winslet, Helen Mirren and Idris Elba, began their careers, the health of the creative sector, which the government acknowledges brings in £87bn a year to the economy, is ignored at Britain’s peril. “It is simply a question of trade really. Although Brexiters are very keen on free trade, they don’t acknowledge this will close down a freedom of trade in a very important area – despite the fact it is a growth market, growing more than any other sector apart from banking.” For Roseby, like other respondents, preserving freedom of movement comes above efforts to secure investment, because it will immediately damage Britain’s artistic reputation. The large majority of those surveyed also said diversity was one of the chief reasons behind Britain’s creative success, while 46 respondents felt there was now a big risk to the country’s “soft power and creative reputation”, and 41 believed that morale had fallen since the EU referendum. Roseby also pointed to the recent decision of the European Youth Orchestra to relocate to mainland Europe, cutting off many young musicians in the UK from playing and learning with international artists. “The impact is going to be on diversity of talent,” he said. “We rely on that cultural diversity, and when that goes we will be isolated. It is about perceptions across Europe, and sadly the perception is already changing out there. It is a very serious question across the arts community.” Khan famously performed to great acclaim at the Olympic opening ceremony in 2012, but it is now the fear of Farooq Chaudhry, producer of Khan’s dance company, that the threatened changes will signal the end of a great creative era. “In the past 20 years Britain has been living in a golden age of arts and culture,” he said. “We have fostered a whole generation of artists who have led the way in the global artistic community with their brilliance and values of innovation and excellence. This has been built on a platform of international collaborations and cooperation. It would be catastrophic if this exchange was shut down. Not just for us, but for the whole world.” Working in the non-verbal world of dance, Chaudhry said that the nationality of artists has always been less relevant than their talent. “Freedom of movement for that talent is vital if we are to refresh our ideas and stimulate creativity. The key in art is to find new ways to do things, that is how we make interesting work, and we cannot do that without open doors. Otherwise you just continue to do things in the same way and become irrelevant. “We will soon be culturally devalued. If it doesn’t kill our creative sector, it will certainly seriously diminish it.” His pessimistic predictions are backed by Sawnhey, who said: “The lack of any clear path to how artists will perform and collaborate with European partners is also exacerbated by inadequate current provision for new funding mechanisms to compensate the huge losses that will result from touring and travel restrictions.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2017/dec/30/watford-swansea-premier-league-match-report","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-30T17:20:49Z","webTitle":"Swansea beat Watford with two late goals from Ayew and Narsingh","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/dec/30/watford-swansea-premier-league-match-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/dec/30/watford-swansea-premier-league-match-report","fields":{"headline":"Swansea beat Watford with two late goals from Ayew and Narsingh","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"It was a sensational turnaround, Swansea finding belief and determination to score two late goals and win a match that looked to have slipped beyond them.

Both players entered the match as second-half substitutes, as did Oliver McBurnie, who set up Jordan Ayew’s equaliser. Tactics changed and new formations were employed too, but perhaps most importantly the Portuguese’s new charges seemed to have found some of the confidence so sorely lacking from their play this season. “We finished the game trying everything to win,” Carvalhal said after the match. “We played with two attackers, two wingers, [full back Martin] Olsson played like a winger. We tried everything to win, but if the players don’t play with commitment, with heart, you don’t win. “In two training sessions it’s not easy to give a new formation to the players but the main ideas were there. If the beginning of this is what we did today then I believe we will be better in future. We will improve the dynamic, play better. But just because we win one game, it doesn’t mean that it’s paradise, all birds and flowers. Before this match if you asked 100 people who would be relegated, 100 would say Swansea. After this match, maybe it’s 98.” For Watford, this was a chastening defeat. Ahead in the match from the 10th minute after André Carrillo headed home, it appeared that they were cruising to victory. But Marco Silva’s men should have known that appearances can be deceptive. They seemed sure that a second goal would eventually arrive, but never actually scored it and have now given up more points from a winning position this season than any other club in the Premier League. Silva was reluctant to accept his team had let themselves down in this match, citing mid-winter fatigue and a small squad that wouldn’t tolerate too much rotation. “It was a big disappointment for all of us and for our fans‚” he said. “I think we did enough to win this match. Our opponents shot once at our goal in the opening minutes and after they didn’t create one chance until they scored. We had enough chances to kill the match and we controlled it. “We are playing three games in a short time, we have a lot of injuries and it’s not easy to make rotation every time. These three games, when you play more or less same 11 it is not easy for our players to be fresh in the second half. But it was the same for our opponent.” Therein lay the rub. The early chance Silva spoke of saw Ayew crash a shot off Gomes’s bar from 25 yards in the third minute. Seven minutes later and the goalkeeper’s long kick found Stefano Okaka. The big striker controlled the ball, turned and slipped Richarlison past Kyle Naughton. The Brazilian in turn got off a shot that Lukasz Fabianski parried horribly to the Peruvian Carrillo for his first goal for Watford. But after that, the home side’s chances dribbled away, while Swansea found more confidence and ultimately more assertiveness. After Narsingh was introduced at half-time for defensive midfielder Roque Mesa, McBurnie came on for the hobbling Tammy Abraham and immediately put himself about. Dyer was added to the mix as well, adding pace on the left flank. And finally emerging from his shell was Renato Sanches, liberated in the middle of the park and able to run at the Watford back line. At 1-0 Watford created the one chance that really should have killed the game but Okaka’s replacement Andre Gray was denied by Fabianski after being put clean through. Then the moment Swansea had been waiting for finally arrived. Narsingh got the ball on the right and floated a cross to the back post where McBurnie won his duel and headed down to Ayew six yards out from goal. Watford screamed for offside but Ayew was on and he coolly tucked the ball home past Gomes."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2017/dec/30/bournemouth-everton-premier-league-match-report","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-30T17:15:29Z","webTitle":"Ryan Fraser at the double for Bournemouth to see off Everton","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/dec/30/bournemouth-everton-premier-league-match-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/dec/30/bournemouth-everton-premier-league-match-report","fields":{"headline":"Ryan Fraser at the double for Bournemouth to see off Everton","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Sometimes football can be a cruel game. Jordan Pickford had spent the afternoon showing why he has every chance of going to next year’s World Cup as England’s No1 goalkeeper when a wicked deflection off Michael Keane’s heel in the penultimate minute of the match sent Ryan Fraser’s shot spinning out of his reach and into the net. In one stroke, that ended Bournemouth’s nine-match run without a win and lifted Eddie Howe’s side out of the relegation zone, while also condemning Sam Allardyce to his first defeat as Everton manager. Having dominated from the moment Idrissa Gueye equalised Fraser’s first-half volley, it was probably no more than the home side deserved but the result still felt harsh on Pickford and the £30m spent on him in the summer is already looking like a bargain. Everton are hoping to complete the signing of Cenk Tosun for £25m in the coming days, with the Turkey striker expected to arrive on Merseyside this weekend after agreeing terms on a four-and-a-half-year contract. On this evidence, his arrival cannot come soon enough after a lacklustre display that showed Allardyce still has plenty of work to do despite his encouraging start. “It’s a frustrating way for the unbeaten run to end because we should have avoided both goals. That’s the bottom line,” he admitted. “I was pleased with the recovery from 1-0 down but in the end it’s a very disappointing defeat for us.” On Pickford, Allardyce added: “He’s a top-drawer goalkeeper. The players should be disappointed that they have let him down a bit because we should have got a point after some of the saves he made.” Bournemouth had begun the day in the bottom three, having accumulated only nine points at home all season. Howe selected an unchanged side from the draw against West Ham on Boxing Day, with Joshua King passing a late fitness test to start in a withdrawn role behind Callum Wilson in attack. Allardyce made four alterations to the team that drew against West Brom – their seventh match unbeaten since he replaced Ronald Koeman at the end of November – with Gueye back from injury and James McCarthy starting his first game for more than two months. Given their perilous state, the onus was on Bournemouth to take the game to their opponents and, after a slow start, they gradually began to pick holes in Everton’s defence. Wilson should have opened the scoring in the 18th minute but found Pickford in superb form, before the goalkeeper denied Jordon Ibe’s smart turn and shot from the edge of the penalty area. By contrast, the visitors appeared reluctant to commit numbers forward and that lack of ambition proved to be their undoing. But the manner in which Bournemouth ruthlessly exploited McCarthy’s sloppiness in midfield, with Fraser adjusting the timing of his run to finish off King’s precise cross, showed that they are more than capable of scoring enough goals to survive. To Howe’s obvious disappointment, however, the impressive King’s afternoon ended soon after when he limped off with a hamstring injury. Allardyce had clearly seen enough and introduced Wayne Rooney to the action after he had missed two matches with flu, swiftly followed by Oumar Niasse in place of the ineffective Dominic Calvert-Lewin. The result was a far more threatening approach that paid dividends immediately, although once again the goal came as a result of the opposition giving the ball away. Steve Cook’s pass was seized upon by Gylfi Sigurdsson, who fed Niasse on the edge of the area and he teed up his Senegalese compatriot Gueye with an excellent piece of skill. Everton had Pickford to thank again for not falling behind immediately as he denied Wilson once more with a brilliant save down to his left. Ibe also came close to finding a way through but saw his effort from distance skim the crossbar after again testing Pickford. Apart from one lightning quick break from the substitute Yannick Bolasie that almost set up Sigurdsson, Everton seemed content to hang on for a point. They were punished as the clock ticked towards the 90-minute mark, with Fraser given too much time to take aim but grateful to see the ball loop away from Pickford’s despairing dive. “It would have been harsh on us not to win. The players showed they can dig deep and it was a great feeling when the winner went in,” admitted Howe. “We make it difficult for ourselves but that was where the true character comes through. I’m so pleased for Ryan, who is beginning to show just how good a player he is.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"uk-news/2017/dec/30/storm-dylan-set-to-disrupt-new-years-eve-travel-across-britain","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-30T17:09:48Z","webTitle":"Storm Dylan set to disrupt New Year's Eve travel across Britain","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/dec/30/storm-dylan-set-to-disrupt-new-years-eve-travel-across-britain","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2017/dec/30/storm-dylan-set-to-disrupt-new-years-eve-travel-across-britain","fields":{"headline":"Storm Dylan set to disrupt New Year's Eve travel across Britain","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Power cuts, flooding and fresh travel disruption are expected on New Year’s Eve as Storm Dylan brings strong winds and heavy rain to the UK. Gusts of up to 80mph have been forecast in Northern Ireland and southern Scotland, with warnings of possible injury and danger to life. The latest storm comes after freezing temperatures, heavy snow, rain and wind caused disruption during the Christmas break. The Met Office has issued an amber wind warning for Northern Ireland and Scotland on Sunday morning, as Dylan begins to roll across the region in the early hours. The warning is in place from 4am to 1pm, when forecasters said there “will probably be some damage to buildings such as tiles blown from roofs, with flying debris likely with the possibility of injuries or danger to life”. “In coastal areas large waves are likely as well as beach material being thrown on to coastal roads, sea fronts and perhaps some properties,” the Met Office said. “Longer journey times and cancellations are likely as road, rail, air and ferry services may be affected. Some roads and bridges are likely to close. “There is also a good chance of power cuts and the potential to affect other services such as mobile phone coverage.” Heavy rain is also forecast for much of south-east Wales and south-west England over the weekend. The Met Office has issued a yellow warning for heavy rain for 6pm on Saturday to 9am on Sunday, and predicts that up to 25mm (1in) is likely to fall. Up to 40mm (1.6in) could be seen in some spots. “With the ground very wet in these areas, this is likely to lead to rising water levels and some flooding in places,” the Met Office said. Despite a squally start, conditions are expected to ease by the time people head out to see in the new year. Meteorologist Alex Burkhill said: “The good news is the worst of the weather will clear by midnight for the New Year’s Eve celebrations. “There will be some wind and rain in the south and west, and the north and east have a better chance of staying dry. “It will be a chilly night, but not exceptionally cold and the breeze might blow a few fireworks in slightly different directions, but it shouldn’t cause too many problems.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2017/dec/30/alabama-election-roy-moore-write-in-votes","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-30T19:35:53Z","webTitle":"Mickey Mouse and Jesus among write-in votes that helped sink Roy Moore","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/dec/30/alabama-election-roy-moore-write-in-votes","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/dec/30/alabama-election-roy-moore-write-in-votes","fields":{"headline":"Mickey Mouse and Jesus among write-in votes that helped sink Roy Moore","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Votes for Mickey Mouse, football coach Nick Saban and “any other Republican” were among more than 22,000 write-ins in the Alabama Senate election the Democrat Doug Jones won this month by a little less than that number. Controversy surrounding Roy Moore, the first Republican to lose a Senate race in Alabama in 25 years, prompted the high number of write-ins: 22,852 in total, or 1.6% of the 1.3 million who voted. Moore, a controversial rightwing hardliner who was endorsed by Donald Trump despite allegations of sexual misconduct towards a number of teenage women, received 651,969 votes. Jones, who was certified as the winner this week after a legal challenge from Moore alleging widespread voter fraud and casting doubt on high turnout among African Americans, received 673,891 ballots: 21,922 more than Moore. The outgoing Republican senator, Luther Strange, who was appointed to the post vacated by Trump attorney general Jeff Sessions but lost the primary to Moore, was the top write-in candidate in most counties. State officials did not tally statewide numbers of write-ins but numbers submitted by counties showed that Strange received more than 7,500 votes, roughly a third of the write-in total. Many such ballots followed the recommendation of the serving Alabama senator Richard Shelby, who said shortly before the vote he could not vote for Moore and would instead write in the name of another Republican. Strange was followed by Lee Busby, a retired Marine colonel and former aide to White House chief of staff John Kelly, who was the top write-in candidate in at least 10 counties. Other names frequently written in included Sessions and Saban, the successful and revered University of Alabama football coach. State officials stressed ahead of the election that voters had to write-in the name of a living person in order for the vote to be tallied. That did not stop votes for Bugs Bunny, Mickey Mouse, Snoopy, SpongeBob SquarePants, Ronald Reagan, Jesus and “UR Mom”. There was also a vote for Sassy, the name of the horse Moore rode to the polls. At least one person voted by write-in for Leigh Corfman, one of the women who raised an allegation against Moore, who is 70, about behaviour said to have taken place when he was in his 30s. Moore denied all such allegations. Other voters voted for another woman, Dianne Bentley, who divorced former Alabama governor Robert Bentley amid accusations that he was having an affair with an aide."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"science/2018/jan/02/weatherwatch-scientists-develop-speed-breeding-to-feed-rising-population","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-02T21:30:27Z","webTitle":"Weatherwatch: scientists develop 'speed breeding' to feed rising population","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/jan/02/weatherwatch-scientists-develop-speed-breeding-to-feed-rising-population","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2018/jan/02/weatherwatch-scientists-develop-speed-breeding-to-feed-rising-population","fields":{"headline":"Weatherwatch: scientists develop 'speed breeding' to feed rising population","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Scientists are engaged in a race against time to breed staple crops that can both survive climate change and yield bigger harvests. Their aim is to feed a growing population in a warming world. The method used for centuries of growing one crop a year in variable weather conditions and then selecting the seeds from the best plants is no longer viable in fast-changing climatic conditions. Scientists are concerned that for some years there have been few improvements in yields of grain. A new system called speed breeding, designed to grow six crops a year, has been developed in glasshouses to accelerate the process. Using LED lighting to aid photosynthesis, intensive regimes allow the plants to grow for 22 hours a day. This new form of lighting is a lot cheaper and also more efficient than using the old sodium vapour lamps that produced too much heat and not enough light. Among the crops that can now be grown up to six generations a year are wheat, barley, peas and chickpeas. Canola, a form of rapeseed, can achieve four cycles. Using this technology, scientists can study the way plants deal with diseases, and their shape and structure and flowering time, and the growing cycle can be repeated every eight weeks. It is hoped the technique will yield new varieties of crops that can be grown on a commercial scale within 10 years. If this could be achieved, it would increase productivity in the same way as the green revolution of the 1960s, when new crop varieties, modern farm practices, and use of fertilisers saved millions of people from starvation."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2017/dec/31/fine-words-alone-will-not-keep-britain-in-the-eu","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-31T18:51:12Z","webTitle":"Fine words alone will not keep Britain in the EU | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/dec/31/fine-words-alone-will-not-keep-britain-in-the-eu","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/dec/31/fine-words-alone-will-not-keep-britain-in-the-eu","fields":{"headline":"Fine words alone will not keep Britain in the EU","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Natalie Nougayrède (Opinion, 30 December) suggests that France’s President Macron could stop Brexit. Maybe, but fine words alone will not be much use. The EU will have to make a significant concession that might change public opinion in the UK. When the EU was enlarged in 2004 existing members were entitled to take advantage of transitional arrangements limiting the flow of migrants from eastern Europe for up to seven years. Three countries – the UK, Ireland and Sweden – waived their right to restrict free movement. In the UK’s case, we did so on the basis of research that grossly underestimated the likely flow of migrants. If the EU wants us to stay, why not offer the UK all or part of the moratorium that we unwisely turned down last time around? A long shot, I know, but worth a try. Chris Mullin Alnwick, Northumberland • Lord Adonis’s resignation letter probably tells us much more about recent British politics than he realises (Adonis quits, calling May the ‘voice of Ukip’, 30 December). He describes Brexit as “a populist and nationalist spasm” – challenging the ability of the people of this country to make decisions about their own future. As a remain voter I regret the decision to leave the EU, but the consensus politics and “cooperation across parties” that he advocates reflect a society where the needs of ordinary people are continuously ignored.

It would be true folly to predict what will happen in Iran in the coming hours and days. The protests, which reached their fourth day on Sunday, quickly spread across provinces to become the largest since the huge pro-reform rallies of 2009’s green movement. There have been unprecedented calls of “Death to [Ayatollah Ali] Khamenei”, the supreme leader, and even reports of people lauding the monarchy toppled in the 1979 revolution. Other chants have attacked Tehran’s geopolitical ambitions: “Let go of Syria, think about us.” It is Iran’s growing heft in the region, and the sharpening of its rivalry with Saudi Arabia, that makes internal turbulence more significant than ever. The brutal repression of the green movement weighs heavily on people’s minds. The interior minister warned that those who disrupt public order will “pay the price”; the Revolutionary Guards have threatened an “iron fist”; two protesters have died; some social media apps have been blocked. But very little about this wave of protests is clear. No one is sure how they started and spread, or which of the multiple demands have most force. It is impossible to know where they are heading. The deep intra-elite fissures – reflecting differences of ideology, policy and personal interests in finance and power – contribute to this uncertainty. Reformists are especially suspicious that the unrest began in Mashhad, home of Ebrahim Raisi, the hardline cleric defeated by Hassan Rouhani in last May’s presidential elections, and that “Death to Rouhani” chants were prominent there. The authorities’ initially limited response and the fact that these events have, unusually, received domestic press coverage have added to the questions. Many of the early slogans reflected grievances over high unemployment and food prices, corruption and inequality. The nuclear accord of 2015 has failed to deliver the material improvements promised – sanctions remain a major cause of economic woes, though domestic policy plays its part too. Protesters appear to be largely working class; in 2009 they were more middle class. The unrest appears leaderless, with relatively few chants backing Mir Hossein Mousavi and Mehdi Karroubi, who led opposition then and are now under house arrest. Donald Trump, still threatening to rip up the nuclear deal, tweeted gleefully: “Oppressive regimes cannot endure forever.” Plenty have seized on these events as proof that the regime change they want is imminent. But viewing them through the lens of wishful thinking in Washington will not help us gauge protesters’ motivations or levels of support for their various demands. This is a test for President Rouhani, who won votes not only by promising economic improvements but also because he was considered a moderate. On Sunday he said that protests were legal, institutions should allow criticism, and state television should reflect different opinions, while adding that people should focus on solutions, and that their actions should not lead to violence or damage public property. Will the unrest peter out, will he achieve a peaceful resolution – or will there be the kind of crackdown Mahmoud Ahmadinejad oversaw in 2009? These protests will be causing anxiety across all camps. And they are likely to exacerbate and be exploited in Iran’s internal conflicts."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/2017/dec/31/why-anti-zionism-is-seen-as-antisemitism","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-31T18:48:16Z","webTitle":"Why anti-Zionism is seen as antisemitism | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/dec/31/why-anti-zionism-is-seen-as-antisemitism","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/dec/31/why-anti-zionism-is-seen-as-antisemitism","fields":{"headline":"Why anti-Zionism is seen as antisemitism","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Much of Jonathan Rosenhead’s letter (29 December) was devoted to Israel and Palestine. He makes the tendentious claim that the IHRA definition of antisemitism is discredited. A small minority has disputed the definition, but there is no evidence that it is discredited. He then makes the charge that UK governments have been unclear about the difference between antisemitism and anti-Zionism. Most Jews in the UK would challenge the idea that there is much difference between the two. In recent years, anti-Zionism has manifested itself as opposition to the existence of a specifically Jewish state. In a 2015 survey, The Attitudes of British Jews to Israel, “90% of British Jews support Israel’s right to exist as a Jewish state”, the implication being that current anti-Zionism will be experienced as antisemitism. While it is clear that there was a very large immigration into Israel/Palestine during the 20th century, there has been a continuous history of Jewish settlement there for 3,000 years, so the demand for a Jewish state was not inconsistent with demands for their own state by ethnic groups in other countries. This does not, however, continue over as unmitigated support for the Israeli government. In the same survey, 68% of British Jews “feel a sense of despair every time Israel approves further expansion of settlements on the West Bank”. This is consistent again with the IHRA definition of antisemitism, which states that “criticism of Israel similar to that levelled against any other country cannot be regarded as antisemitic”. Legitimate criticism of the Israeli government is therefore perfectly acceptable in British universities. Anti-Zionist opposition to the existence of Israel is not.

Watson added his voice to that of the Labour peer Andrew Adonis, who resigned as head of the government’s National Infrastructure Commission with a broadside against the minister. In addition to speaking about his vehement disagreements with the government over Brexit, Lord Adonis said Grayling’s decision to bail out Stagecoach and Virgin, which were contracted to run the east coast mainline until 2023, was the final straw. Handing a cheque worth hundreds of millions of pounds to Virgin’s founder, Richard Branson, and the Stagecoach founder, Brian Souter, “would be indefensible at the best of times but we are now at the worst of times with a Brexit squeeze on public finances and with rail fares going through the roof”, Adonis told the Observer. He said the move would cut infrastructure spending. Grayling could have opted for a state rescue, Watson said, but “that would have meant borrowing a key Labour policy - taking our failing rail system back into the public sector. Instead, Grayling has agreed to hand over billions of pounds of our money to the ridiculously wealthy Richard Branson and Brian Souter. “Using taxpayers’ money as an act of political expediency is indefensible and Grayling should go now.” Passengers are currently bracing themselves for the biggest rise in rail fares for five years, with the price of season tickets to increase by up to 3.6% on Tuesday. A senior Conservative source said it was disappointing to see “someone of Lord Adonis’s experience making completely inaccurate statements based on a lack of knowledge of the facts”. A Department for Transport spokeswoman said: “No one is getting a bailout. Virgin Stagecoach will continue to meet its financial commitments made on the East Coast rail franchise to the taxpayer as it has done since 2015. “Stagecoach has also – on average - paid 20% more back to the taxpayer than when the line was operated by Directly Operated Rail and we continue to receive hundreds of millions of pounds. “The decision to bring in a partnership to run the service from 2020 is to ensure the train companies work more closely with those responsible for the infrastructure like the track and signalling to help improve the service for passengers.” The new rail strategy Grayling announced last month contained plans to replace the Virgin Trains East Coast contract running to September 2023 with a model of a partnership between track and train operators from 2020. Although the minister denied that he was bailing out Stagecoach, the company’s share price rose by 15% after the plan was published."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2017/dec/31/firefighters-praised-for-response-to-manchester-blaze","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-31T15:15:56Z","webTitle":"Firefighters praised for response to Manchester blaze","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/dec/31/firefighters-praised-for-response-to-manchester-blaze","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2017/dec/31/firefighters-praised-for-response-to-manchester-blaze","fields":{"headline":"Firefighters praised for response to Manchester blaze","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Firefighters in Manchester have been praised after they brought a huge blaze in an apartment block under control.

Now taking on a political dimension of huge scale, those protests – which continued for the consecutive fourth day on Sunday night – are posing the biggest challenge to Tehran’s leadership since the 2009 unrest, shaking the foundations of the Islamic Republic. The geographical scale of the unrest in provinces, and the harshness of the slogans chanted are unprecedented since the 1979 Iranian revolution. They are also drawing parallels to the months of anti-government unrest that ensued the 2009 disputed election, which gave Mahmoud Ahmadinejad a second term in office amid a bloody crackdown. But the new protests, labelled by many on Twitter as “Eteraz-e-omomi” (or “the general strike” in Farsi) are posing more questions than answers, puzzling observers about how it all started, why it spread so quickly, and what it means for the future of the Iran. There are also big differences between this time round and the turbulence eight years ago. A relatively small protest on Thursday in Mashhad, Iran’s second largest city, and also the main base for the opponents of moderate president Hassan Rouhani, unexpectedly gave impetus to a wave of spontaneous protests spreading across provinces. A source close to government officials told the Guardian that Rouhani’s administration believes the first protests were organised by his opponents, most notably supporters of his campaign rival, hardline cleric Ebrahim Raisi. “Death to Rouhani” were among the first chants in Mashhad but the situation soon got out of control, with people chanting anti-regime slogans, such as “death to dictator”, denouncing the leadership of the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Within a day, the protests spread to Kermanshah, in the west of the country, Isfahan, in the centre, Rasht, in the north, and even Qom, the hotbed of clerics, as well as other cities such as Sari, Hamedan and Qazvin. On Saturday evening, as protests grew bigger, anti-regime demonstrations were held in Tehran but also in Shahr-e-Kord, Bandar Abbas, Izeh, Arak, Zanjan, Abhar, Doroud (in Lorestan province where at least two protesters were killed), Khorramabad, Ahvaz, Karaj and Tonekabon. Mohammad-Taghi Karroubi, the son of an Iranian opposition leader under house arrest, Mehdi Karroubi, said new demonstrations show despite the crackdown in 2009, the desire for protest has remained. “Instead of blaming foreign powers and saying that they are inciting the protests, the establishment has to acknowledge that there is a base for protest within Iran,” he said. Karroubi said that after Rouhani won a landslide victory with the support of reformists, his unexpected conservative turn since had disappointed his base. “It’s always been the reformist youth who pumped hope inside the country and they’re silent now – that’s the government’s weakness, people are hopeless and when reformists are not pumping hope, they’re becoming even more disgruntled.” Senior figures within the reformist camp, who do not back regime change, and even many supporters of the Green movement are uncomfortable with some of the slogans, such as those chanted in support of monarchy. Compared with 2009, the new protests also appear to lack any specific organisation behind them, which many see as an advantage because the state cannot easily crackdown on them by arresting a leader, and others as a disadvantage because they don’t have a clear strategy on the next step. A former political prisoner, Mostafa Tajzadeh, who served many years in jail following the 2009 unrest, was also sceptical, warning that Iran may become another Syria. He called on the authorities to allow protests and urged protesters to respect the law. While the middle class and the elites were behind the 2009 protests, this new wave appears to be led by the working class, which is most affected by the country’s economic woes. Others say it is too soon to fully comprehend the new protests. “It’s a jigsaw puzzle,” said one commentator who did not want to be identified. “There might be other reasons at play too, such as internal rivalries between different factions especially as Khamenei becomes older and the succession race becomes serious.” In sharp contrast to the coverage of the 2009 protests, a number of state news agencies and local newspapers reported on the recent protests. On Sunday night, the state-run newspaper Iran was among the first to publish images of protests in Tehran. Earlier in the day, senior conservative cleric Gholamreza Mesbahi-Moghadam, speaking to semi-official Isna news, said authorities should listen to the protesters, give permission for gatherings and state TV must cover the demonstrations. Mohammad Marandi, a Tehran University professor sympathetic to the Islamic Republic, blamed Rouhani government’s economic policy over the protests, which began just weeks after the president unveiled next year’s budget. “There are obviously economic problems ... I think that perhaps the government policy seems to some as leaning towards the liberalisation of the economy, rising the price of gasoline and removing subsidies, and at the moment because the economy is not doing so well, it has created a sense of concern among a lot of people,” he said. Marandi added the protests have to be divided into two categories: “One is those who are protesting because of the economic situation, but I think there is a second trend which is far more political, but the two are not the same.” The question now is how the administration of Hassan Rouhani will handle the protests and whether his approach would be any different to the brutality seen under his predecessor in 2009. “The world is watching,” the US president, Donald Trump, tweeted."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2017/dec/31/jimmy-anderson-hundreds-90mph-ashes-xfactor-england","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-31T18:54:00Z","webTitle":"Jimmy Anderson calls for big hundreds and 90mph Ashes X-factor","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/dec/31/jimmy-anderson-hundreds-90mph-ashes-xfactor-england","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/dec/31/jimmy-anderson-hundreds-90mph-ashes-xfactor-england","fields":{"headline":"Jimmy Anderson calls for big hundreds and 90mph Ashes X-factor","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Jimmy Anderson has never bowled as many overs in a Test match. His tally reached 59 in Melbourne. This is a lot for a 35-year-old – in fact, it’s a heavy load for a 25-year-old, especially when the temperature occasionally creeps above 35C. That figure of 59 is also a compliment to Anderson. He was England’s best bowler and Joe Root kept turning to him in his attempts to defeat Australia and a dire surface for cricket. “That pitch was so unresponsive,” said Anderson after the match. “I know my speed dropped off in my 58th and 59th overs. By then I was bowling it, looking up at the speed and then he [Steve Smith, inevitably] was hitting it. It’s quite demoralising when it gets to that point. He’s a world-class player in the form of his life. It’s going to take something special to get him out.” Anderson’s workload – he has bowled 22 more overs than any other Englishman and more than any Australian – is not just explained by the fact that he has been England’s most successful bowler in this series. His burden has been increased by the imbalance of the attack. However hard he tries Moeen Ali has struggled out here; his confidence as a bowler, which seldom soars, has dipped rapidly after those inconvenient injuries at the start; he has tinkered with his action and as a bowler he has not been much help to Root throughout the series. For the first time in Moeen’s 48 Tests there is the distinct possibility of him being dropped from the Test side – though Root was at pains to point out after the Melbourne Test that there is a long-term future for him. At the moment Moeen is battered and he may benefit from a break. Everyone wants him in the side if he is anywhere near his best, especially in Ben Stokes’s absence. But that aspiration may not stretch to the Sydney match after such a slump in form. There are two places up for grabs among five players. Moeen, Tom Curran, Mason Crane, Craig Overton (if he has returned to full fitness) and, just conceivably, Mark Wood – an assessment that, I concede, does not narrow the options down greatly. First there will be an expert perusal of the pitch and Trevor Bayliss, back on home turf, should be able to provide that. The assumption is that Anderson will have recovered from his exertions. “I should sleep well for the next few days,” he said. “The Tests are not completely back to back. Hopefully I’ll pull up OK. It takes so much out of you here. The pitches are rock hard and the foot-holes get so uneven, which makes it tough on your ankles and knees.” His recipe for success for the team is a very common one among bowlers over the years but it remains legitimate. “We’ve got to score more runs. We need big hundreds, like Cooky in the last game. It would be great if we could get someone who could bowl 90mph plus, to have that sort of X-factor. Someone like [Mitchell] Starc who bowls above 90mph can take the pitch out of the equation.” For England the pitch is always very much in the equation. Stuart Broad is the pantomime villain here and Anderson is more than happy to let him remain in that role. However, umbrage was taken when Anderson outlined the contrast between Starc and Jackson Bird before the Melbourne Test, an observation that was self-evidently true by the end of the match. “I wasn’t trying to have a dig at anyone or to slag him off. I just spoke my mind at the time.” If the Aussies are criticised for an excess of sledging, the standard response is not a denial but a “What about Anderson?” It would be an exaggeration to suggest that the home fans have taken him to their hearts. “You’ve got to have a thick skin here,” he says. “There was a guy shouting at me in Melbourne: ‘You can’t bowl with a kookaburra’. And I said: ‘You might have a point there’. You have to brush it off in your own way … And it’s no good worrying about ex-players, whether opposition ones or even English ones. You’ve got to block them out.” The evidence of Melbourne suggests that this England side is fighting much harder and is more determined than those of 2013 and 2006, who were whitewashed. Anderson is an excellent witness here having been on so many tours of Australia. He says that there are none of the divisions that became apparent on the last visit. “We’ve got a really strong group, good management as well, but it’s just not worked. We’ve not played well enough for long enough.” There have been very serious issues to deal with, such as Stokes’s absence, and some trivial ones that have been blown up by elements of the Aussie media who want credit for winning the Ashes themselves – such as the headbutt saga that came to light in Brisbane and English ball-tampering on a rainy day in Melbourne. In Perth on the first day there was also a spot-fixing story, whose legs were shorter than a dachshund’s, though that one emanated from the UK. Anderson and his thumb were implicated in the ball-tampering “scandal”. He explains what he was doing. “I was getting dirt off the ball. They’d watered the square so the foot-holes on the old wickets had some mud in them. I went to the umpires to make sure they were happy with it. It was on the shiny side [which bowlers do not want to be scuffed]. “The story escalated quite quickly, didn’t it? It was ridiculous, but what we’ve come to expect.” Meanwhile, it is just as easy to establish what Root expects in Sydney from Anderson. Another 50 overs, thank you very much."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/2017/dec/31/alastair-cook-david-warner-test-maestros-ashes-jason-gillespie","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-31T11:07:01Z","webTitle":"Alastair Cook and David Warner: two Test maestros playing to a different beat | Jason Gillespie","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/dec/31/alastair-cook-david-warner-test-maestros-ashes-jason-gillespie","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/dec/31/alastair-cook-david-warner-test-maestros-ashes-jason-gillespie","fields":{"headline":"Alastair Cook and David Warner: two Test maestros playing to a different beat","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Cricket is a sport of wonderful contrasts and during the Melbourne Test we saw the beauty of this in Alastair Cook and David Warner. Here are two champions who are performing the same job for their team and yet could not be more different in terms of personality or the way they go about their business. “Finding a way” is a very good coaching phrase in cricket. It denotes the individuality of this team sport. There is no one-size-fits-all route to success, rather a unique path that each player must take to get the best out of themselves. What works for you is the key. And the two openers I mention, who both put on fine shows at the MCG, are very good examples of this. Cook’s unbeaten 244 over nearly 11 hours at the crease was a classic of his genre. He was the first to admit an innings like this should have come sooner in this Ashes tour. But as a firm believer in the primacy of each Test match and there being no dead-rubbers, I take issue with anyone who saw the series scoreline as somehow detracting from his efforts here. Opening the batting against the freshest bowlers and the hardest ball for all but a handful of his 151 caps, delivering in all conditions and sitting as the only opener in the top six all-time run-scorers marks him down as a great of the game. His skill comes in his mental fortitude and impeccable fitness. Batting for as long as he can should be extremely draining. And yet he barely breaks sweat. My first encounter with Cook was on the 2005 Ashes tour when, as a 20-year-old Essex kid, he belted an attack containing myself, Brett Lee, Michael Kasprowicz and Stuart MacGill for 214 at just under a run a ball. From that day through to now he has always played the ball and never the bowler at the top of his mark. Sounds obvious? Maybe, but the weaker batsmen don’t always achieve this. Absorbing pressure doesn’t just come on the field but off it, too, and it is hard not to respect how Cook has stayed so level during his 11 years as an international cricketer. There were always going to be ups and downs – few players of such longevity cruise through from start to finish – and he has had a few, both in terms of his place at times and the inevitable strains of four years of captaincy. My hunch is that he is very good at blocking out much of the noise. He is not on social media and most likely doesn’t read the sport sections of the newspapers bar the rugby pages. He will, of course, reflect on his own performances and listen to confidants but his ability to reset and keep a healthy perspective is impressive and it will make him a strong lieutenant for Joe Root right now. We crossed paths in the United Arab Emirates in 2015, when he played for MCC against Yorkshire – a time he was under the pump about the Kevin Pietersen saga and his captaincy. You would not have known it from the chat we had. It was typical laid-back stuff, with inquiries about the best young bowlers I had seen in the county game and a bit of family talk. He just seemed a lovely and genuine bloke. Now a lot is made of Warner’s character and it is true that you often don’t know whether you will get the aggressive Bull persona or the peace-loving Reverend. Personally I prefer to see more of the Bull on the cricket field, ruffling feathers and getting stuck into the opposition. I know he has huge respect for the game and his opponents deep down, even when he pushes hard at the line. But it was his adaptability that, for me, came to the fore during the fourth Test. His first-innings century transcended the conditions – he had made 103 of the 135 runs scored when he was second man out – while his 83 in the second dig, though ended by a loose shot, was comfortably his slowest half-century and saw him override his natural inclination to just brutalise bowling attacks with a more watchful approach built on a rock-solid defence. Don’t forget, Warner has essentially learned the first-class game at Test level, with just eight Sheffield Shield matches before his debut in 2011 and only 12 since. And when he first played international cricket in the white-ball formats, he hadn’t turned out in first-class cricket at all. Scratch below the brash exterior and you find a deep-thinking, hardworking cricketer. Now, Cook may have been fast-tracked from an early age for a Test debut in 2006 but by this stage he had still played nearly 40 first-class matches. Two different paths. Two different players. Two different characters. And yet both have mastered Test cricket in their own unique way. Two other contrasting batsmen are Joe Root and Steve Smith at No4, although here there is a bit of a gap opening up due to the former’s struggle to consistently convert half-centuries into huge innings. There were many great players in my era but bowlers, almost to a man, would rank Brian Lara above the lot because of his ability to just go on and on when set through that sheer ruthlessness. Smith has hit that level, with his unbeaten 102 in the second innings a phenomenal 23rd Test century from the 45 times he has passed 50. Root, meanwhile, has just seen another half-century go unconverted to sit at 13 from 48. If he wants to join his opposite number as one of the greats of the game, he now needs to find a way to become even more single-minded about his batting."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"uk-news/2017/dec/30/lord-adonis-resignation-brexit-policy-theresa-may-whitehall-morale-collapsed","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-30T22:00:12Z","webTitle":"Adonis on Brexit: ‘No mandarin backs May.

Government has broken down’","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Andrew Adonis was in church in the Austrian village of Alpbach on Christmas Day when he decided to step down as chair of the national infrastructure commission. The Alpine air had cleared his mind and led him to what he had suspected for some weeks might be his eventual decision. In a nutshell, he had realised his differences with Theresa May’s government were simply too profound. It was time to break free: “I decided in the middle of mass that I was going to resign. When I was skiing the following day I started writing the letter of resignation in my mind while looking out over the Austrian Alps. I was thinking to myself that there may just be a better future.” The Labour peer was first appointed by George Osborne in 2015 and then confirmed in the role by Theresa May a year later. The post as a paid adviser to a Tory government was supposed to be one that showed how, these days, governing parties can draw on the talents of political opponents in the national interest. Adonis is a former Labour transport secretary and prime mover behind the HS2 high speed rail project. His abilities would be wasted on the Lords’ opposition benches when the country was crying out for bright ideas, experience and talent. At least that was the plan. As it was, in Adonis’s case, things turned sour fairly fast, not least because of Brexit. Adonis is an outspoken remainer and not one inclined to keep quiet on issues he feels deeply about. “Relations with the government had become increasingly tense in recent months because they kept telling me to shut up on Brexit, which I declined to do,” he says in an interview with the Observer, the day after news of his resignation broke. Officials in the Treasury ordered him to hold his tongue but he refused. “I told them my views on Brexit were quite separate from the future of national infrastructure.” If that was the extent of his differences with the Conservative government, Adonis would probably have stumbled on into 2018 still in post. But something else, to do with his former brief at transport, had riled him. He had fallen out spectacularly with the current transport secretary Chris Grayling over a decision Grayling took in late November over the future of the East Coast rail line. Essentially the joint venture between Stagecoach and Richard Branson’s Virgin that had won the franchise to run the line from 2015 to 2023 found it had overbid and wanted out of the deal. Grayling stepped in and allowed them to pull the plug without the companies having to pay around £2bn that was payable for the final years. Adonis was outraged. “The manner of doing so, was in my view, deplorable,” says Adonis. “He used some smokescreen about reopening closed Beeching lines and bringing Thomas the Tank Engine back to East Grinstead [to conceal what he was really doing]. He didn’t spell out that what this meant was that the companies were going to be excused from making £2bn worth of payments to the government.” The result, Adonis says, is that “there is going to be a massive loss to the taxpayer as a result of this”. Adonis calls the move a “scandal” because it is, he argues, taxpayers who will be left to pick up the bill, and rail users who will be hit with still higher fares. In 2009 Adonis faced a similar problem when National Express wanted out of the same East Coast franchise. He set up a nationally owned company, East Coast, to take temporary control. “If I had offered a bail-out to National Express, I would have had everyone demanding the same treatment. What we are now facing is not only hundreds of millions of pounds of losses to the taxpayer, but potentially billions of losses to the public purse from the deal that will have to be offered to other train companies running other lines that will demand the same treatment. “About half of the rail companies at the moment are operating at a loss or are threatened with losses because they have overbid for their contracts. “Handing a cheque worth hundreds of millions of pounds to Richard Branson and Brian Souter [chair of Stagecoach] would be indefensible at the best of times but we are now at the worst of times, with a Brexit squeeze on the public finances and with rail fares going through the roof. The cost of this bailout is going to be a slashing of the national infrastructure programme and even bigger fare rises in future – and as that becomes apparent in parliament and in the media I just think Chris Grayling’s position is going to become untenable. It is of a piece with him being a radical Brexiter to whom everything is subordinate to hard-right ideology.” He adds: “I think he is going to have to go because, as he is forced to defend a massive bailout to the private sector, the question will be asked by the Public Accounts Committee and the National Audit Office – why didn’t you adopt the alternative course, which was to set up a state company to avoid the need for a bailout? He has no answer to that. He deliberately avoided doing so for ideological reason and he was not even upfront about not doing so.” Adonis made his grave concerns known to the chancellor, Philip Hammond, but found himself shouting in the dark. There were tense text exchanges between him and senior civil servants, which led eventually to him being cut out of social events in the Department for Transport. “I had a very unpleasant period just before Christmas when the government threatened the National Infrastructure Commission with non-cooperation if I carried on criticising Chris Grayling’s bailout. I thought that was deeply improper since I am an independent adviser. In my whole experience of government, I have never come across bully-boy tactics of this kind before.” The East Coast mainline episode is, Adonis believes, just one example of a government that is falling to pieces as it directs all its energies into dealing with a Brexit conundrum it cannot solve. Civil servants who had doubts about a hard Brexit are not being listened to. Advice, he says, is being ignored. Ideology is trumping good governance. In Grayling’s case, Adonis thinks the transport secretary was simply averse to taking the East Coast line into public ownership because he did not want to do anything to legitimise Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn’s policy of returning the rail system to state ownership. As a result, he allowed the private sector off the financial hook. “I think, unfortunately, it is of a piece with the nervous breakdown that has taken place across Whitehall since Brexit,” Adonis says. “The senior civil service is now totally drained physically and psychologically by attempting to deliver the impossible with Brexit, such that it is no longer able to deliver the ordinary business of government. This is now apparent department by department, and in the Department for Transport it is why we have had the breakdown of good government over the East Coast line and the threats to me. It is deeply unpleasant.” He paints a picture of a political system that is consumed by an impossible goal of securing a Brexit that is good for the UK economy, and a civil service at war with its governing masters. “Good government has essentially broken down in the face of Brexit. Normal standards of conduct are not being observed. Independent advice is being dismissed because, remember, experts were supposedly part of the problem. “There is very low morale in Whitehall because almost no civil servants agree with the policy of the government. I do not think there has ever been a period when the civil service has been more disaffected with the government it serves. I do not know a single senior civil servant who thinks that Brexit is the right policy, and those that are responsible for negotiating it are in a desperate and constant argument with the government over the need to minimise the damage done by the prime minister’s hard-Brexit stance. “It is an open secret that no one will go and work in David Davis’s department [DexEU], and Liam Fox is regarded as a semi-lunatic. The only departments that have retained their institutional integrity during this crisis are the Foreign Office and the Treasury, but they have been sidelined in the Brexit negotiations which is a huge mistake because that is where most of the brains and ability in Whitehall is located. “What essentially is happening is that a government-in-exile in the Treasury and Foreign Office is waiting for the collapse of the current strategy and the moment when it will have to pick up the pieces. The tragedy for the country is that unless something dramatic changes, that collapse will not happen until after we have left the EU in March 2019, whereas it is profoundly important that we understand the crisis that will hit and that we do not leave the EU.” Now free of his ties to the Tories, Adonis wants to devote his considerable energy to leading the campaign to keep the UK in the EU. The key task, he believes, is to persuade Corbyn to back a second referendum, this time on the eventual deal that May strikes with the other 27 member states. The public should be given the option to back the deal or stay in the EU. “The strategy now is to persuade Labour and my very good friend Jeremy Corbyn. “I have huge admiration for Jeremy as a politician, even though there are areas of policy where we do not see eye to eye. What I hope Jeremy will do is come out for a referendum on Mrs May’s final deal, which I do not believe he can in all conscience support, since it is going to destroy British jobs and British trade. “Once that happens, the whole issue will be decided by 10 or 15 votes in the House of Commons. It will all come down to Dominic Grieve [the Tory MP who led the recent rebellion in favour of a final vote by MPs] and his friends, and I hope they do the decent thing for the country as they did before Christmas. In which case we can have a referendum on the final deal – between accepting the deal and staying in the EU– and we can put this national nightmare behind us. That is my strategy for the next year.” And that is the brighter future which he caught a glimpse of while skiing in the Alps. The texts that led to the resignation These are excerpts from texts leading up to the resignation of Andrew Adonis 2 December Andrew Adonis to chancellor Philip Hammond Philip, I sense a serious scandal over [transport secretary] Chris Grayling’s decision last week to bail out Stagecoach/Virgin on East Coast. Just want you to be aware – obvious HMT [Treasury] interest (it looks to me as if your officials have been AWOL on this) but also because I suspect it might get very tense between me &amp; Chris as I expose more about it. I would be happy to brief either of your perm secs on my view of what happened and why it is a scandal if you wish. Best, Andrew 5 December Bernadette Kelly, permanent secretary at the Department of Transport, to AA Andrew do you have a moment to speak later today? Bernadette AA Bernadette - I’m in Kuala Lumpur about to get on plane to London. Can we speak first thing in morning? Assume its about Stagecoach. I have a strong sense of public duty on that ... but happy to speak. A BK to AA Yes fine. It is linked to Stagecoach. Concern here is that it becomes more difficult to work cooperatively on NIC [National Infrastructure Commission] business if you are attacking Dept on other aspects of policy. Let’s speak tomorrow however. Bernadette. AA to BK VG. Maybe I have to resign from nic tho that wd be a huge pity ... problem is, I think CG put party before country on east coast and given money and policy at stake, I have to go for him. A 6 December AA to BK Bernadette, I’ve thought about this a lot on the plane overnight &amp; I think my duty lies in sticking to my guns - ie both the NIC and my criticism of CG for bailing out the private rail companies. Problem is, there aren’t many others who can do either of these well - ie expose the racket on East Coast &amp;/or plan infra for the future. I know this is tricky for you, but you and I didn’t get where we are without juggling tricky situations. The Chancellor could, of course, dismiss me as Chair of the NIC, but I would have thought that the worst possible reason would be that I am criticising the ethics and value for money of HMG undermining the rail franchising regime! Very happy to speak, tho I suspect you might prefer not to, given my view. Andrew BK to AA Thx Andrew. I have to say I think you are quite wrong about the East Coast. Clearly the politics around franchising are sensitive but I am frankly dismayed that you should characterise the action being taken as unethical, or imagine that the Dept would allow a reckless view of VFM to be taken. Rather we are working very hard with CG [Chris Grayling] to ensure we have a positive way forward for the franchise. I’d be happy to elaborate though it is more difficult, and possibly pointless, for me to do so when you are taking such a strong political position yourself, or if you are not open to the points I might make. I am tied up today with PAC prep today but will reflect on whether a conversation may be helpful. PS – am not sure if you were still planning to attend our Annual Reception but given your current views, this may be awkward! PPS – yes it is the best Dept in Whitehall."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2018/jan/05/ineos-fracking-robin-hood-sherwood-forest","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-07T15:55:58Z","webTitle":"Ineos 'misled' public over fracking in Sherwood Forest","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jan/05/ineos-fracking-robin-hood-sherwood-forest","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/jan/05/ineos-fracking-robin-hood-sherwood-forest","fields":{"headline":"Ineos 'misled' public over fracking in Sherwood Forest","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"One of Britain’s top fracking firms has been accused of misleading the public over its intent to explore for shale gas in a protected area of ancient woodland in Sherwood Forest. Ineos, a UK-based petrochemicals firm, has said publicly it would exclude sensitive areas of the legendary home of Robin Hood from its seismic surveys. However, documents released under freedom of information rules reveal the company privately later sought and won permission from authorities to survey those areas, which involves laying small explosive charges underground. Guy Shrubsole, a campaigner at Friends of the Earth, the group that obtained the documents, said: “It’s clear that Ineos will stop at nothing to explore for shale gas, even in Sherwood Forest, home of Robin Hood and one of our most cherished woodlands. “They have misled everyone, promising publicly to spare the most ecologically sensitive parts of Sherwood Forest from their intrusive seismic surveys – while negotiating behind closed doors to press ahead with them.” Ineos is one of the four main players exploring for oil and gas trapped below ground in shale rock across the country. The firm has taken a robust and sometimes controversial approach to exploration, winning and defending an injunction against anti-fracking campaigners, bypassing tardy councils and appealing to authorities to force the National Trust to allow it access to their land. In planning documents submitted to Nottinghamshire county council in May, Ineos said it would not undertake a seismic survey in a part of the forest known as a site of special scientific interest (SSSI), one of 4,000 of the most important nature sites in England. “Ineos made a commercial decision to exclude all such designated areas from the survey. The Sherwood Forest NNR, Birklands and Bilhaugh SAC, Birklands and Bilhaugh SSSI and Birklands West and Ollerton Corner SSSI (all located in Nottinghamshire) were entirely removed from the survey area,” the company said. But just over a month later, the company sought a licence agreement with the Forestry Commission that included maps showing parts of the Birklands SSSI would be within its survey areas. Seismic surveys are used to understand the geology below the forest, and see if shale gas could be recovered. They involve the use of small explosive charges buried in holes to create seismic waves, which are monitored by recording equipment known as geophones. As part of the licence, Ineos has agreed it is: “not to drive vehicles, set any charges, explosives or combustible equipment within 50m of any conservation site, badger set or other sensitive location (including ancient or veteran trees).” The licence was subsequently agreed by the Forestry Commission on 5 July and signed-off by environment secretary Michael Gove. The commission made the decision but the rubber-stamping by Gove may be seen as sitting awkwardly with his series of pro-environment plans, such as tackling plastic waste. Ineos said despite the license agreement seeking to survey the Birklands SSSI, it would not be going ahead with a survey there. The company said its submission to the council took precedence over the Forestry Commission document. A spokesperson said: “Ineos has clearly set out its plans for the East Midlands seismic survey which clearly state it will not survey inside SSSI designated areas. This is true for all SSSI sites including Birklands. “Surveying will take place throughout January and will include areas close by which have been pre-walked by surveyors and ecologists to ensure continued safe operations. In the case of Birklands Wood, we have determined that no vibration points will be deployed to further protect the SSSI.” While Ineos’s shale plans are mostly in the surveying and planning stages, other companies are further advanced. The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy is imminently expected to issue a green light for oil and gas company Third Energy to frack at a site in North Yorkshire. It will be the first well to be fracked in the UK since 2011. Meanwhile the National Trust has written to Ineos asking it to abandon plans to survey its Clumber Park estate near Worksop for shale gas reserves, according to the Sunday Telegraph."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/dec/30/trump-us-constitution-weakness-founding-fathers","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-30T07:30:06Z","webTitle":"The year of Trump has laid bare the US constitution’s serious flaws | Jonathan Freedland","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/30/trump-us-constitution-weakness-founding-fathers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/30/trump-us-constitution-weakness-founding-fathers","fields":{"headline":"The year of Trump has laid bare the US constitution’s serious flaws","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"There’s a million things to love about Hamilton, the musical that has opened in London to reviews as glowing as those that greeted its debut on Broadway. The lyrics are so ingenious, so intricate and dexterous, that the show’s creator, Lin-Manuel Miranda, has a claim to be among the most exciting writers, in any medium, in the world today. Rarely have I seen an audience delight in the tricks and rhyming pyrotechnics of language the way I saw a preview audience react to Hamilton a fortnight ago. As I say, there are countless other pleasures. The staging is inventive, the melodies memorable and, by having black and minority ethnic actors play Alexander Hamilton and his fellow founding fathers, the musical instantly offers a powerful new take on America’s tragic, enduring flaw: race. But it was the idealism of the show – which venerates Hamilton and George Washington and unabashedly romanticises the revolution that birthed the United States of America – that struck a particular chord for me. In 2018, it will be 20 years since I published a book called Bring Home the Revolution. Begun when I was still in my 20s, it too was an essay in idealism, arguing that the American uprising of 1776 and the constitution that followed in 1787 were a rebellion against a system of government under which we Britons still laboured two centuries later – albeit with an overmighty, overcentralised government in place of the bewigged King George. The American revolution, I argued, was our inheritance, a part of our patrimony mislaid across the Atlantic. From a written constitution to a system of radically devolved power to the replacement of monarchy with an elected head of state, it was time for us to bring home the revolution that we had made in America. With impeccable timing, my hymn of praise for the US constitution appeared a matter of months before what looked a lot like a US constitutional crisis, with the impeachment of Bill Clinton over perjury charges arising from his denials of a relationship with a White House intern, Monica Lewinsky. “So you want us to live the American dream?” one interviewer asked. “All a bit of nightmare now, isn’t it?” That, or something like it, has happened at intervals ever since. If it wasn’t a hideous, only-in-America mass shooting, it would be an election in which a man with fewer votes defeated an infinitely more qualified opponent who had won more. Usually, I have managed to deflect these challenges, arguing that my book was a homage to a founding ideal, not to the necessarily flawed reality. But it’s time for me to admit my doubts about its core idea – its admiration for the US constitution and system of government. For this first year of the Donald Trump presidency has exposed two flaws in the model that I cannot brush aside so easily. The first is that Trump has vividly demonstrated that much of what keeps a democracy intact is not enshrined in the written letter of a constitution, but resides instead in customs and conventions – norms – that are essential to civic wellbeing. Trump trampled all over those as a candidate – refusing to disclose his tax returns, for example – and has trampled over even more as president. Convention dictated that he had to divest himself of private business concerns on taking office, to prevent a conflict of interest – but in the absence of a law explicitly forcing him to do so, he did no such thing. The same goes for appointing unqualified relatives to senior jobs, sacking the director of the FBI with no legitimate cause, or endorsing an accused child molester for the US Senate. No law told him he couldn’t, so he did. I once thought the US constitution – a document crafted with almost mathematical precision, constructing a near-perfect equilibrium of checks and balances – offered protection against such perils. And there’s no denying that that text, as interpreted by the courts, has indeed acted as a partial roadblock in Trump’s path, delaying and diluting his Muslim-focused “travel ban”, for example. But this year of Trump has also shown the extent to which the US has an unwritten constitution that – just like ours – relies on the self-restraint of the key political players, a self-restraint usually insisted upon by a free press. Yet when confronted with a leader unbound by any sense of shame – and shamelessness might just be Trump’s defining quality – America is left unexpectedly vulnerable. Of course, there is a remedy, and its name is impeachment. Scholars are clear that Trump has already provided sufficient legal grounds for such a move – the case against him is far more compelling than the one against Bill Clinton. But impeachment proceedings are triggered by the House of Representatives, followed by a trial in the Senate, and nothing will happen so long as Republicans control both houses of Congress. In 2017 we saw with new clarity that the strength of the US constitution depends entirely on the willingness of those charged with enforcing it to do their duty. And today’s Republicans refuse to fulfil that obligation. They, like Trump, are without shame. This was a fatal oversight by Hamilton, James Madison and their fellow framers of the constitution. They did not reckon on a partisanship so intense it would blind elected representatives to the national interest – so that they would, repeatedly, put party ahead of country. The founders did not conceive of a force like today’s Republican party, willing to indulge a president nakedly hostile to ideals Americans once held sacred. My 1998 self asks me whether, say, the Westminster parliament would really be so different if confronted by a Trump-like would-be autocrat. Would individual MPs suppress their own revulsion and back him, fearing deselection by party activists if they did not – much as congressional Republicans won’t move against Trump lest they face the wrath of his base? It’s conceivable. And yet a parliamentary vote of no confidence is a lower hurdle than impeachment. Put simply, it would be easier to get rid of a British Trump. And these weaknesses in the US model have prompted me to see others. The second amendment does not compel Americans to allow an unrestricted flow of guns into the hands of the violent and dangerous, but the fact that the argument hinges on interpretations of a text written more than two centuries ago is itself a problem. It means America, in the words of that great revolutionary Thomas Paine, is too often “like dead and living bodies chained together”, today’s generation shackled to the words of their ancestors. And yet, despite everything, I still see so much to admire in the founding achievement of America. The society remains innovative, restless and creative: it’s still capable of producing a work of genius like Hamilton. But its next act of renewal might be to update or amend the text that gave it birth, to declare that no human invention, no matter how great, can remain stuck. Were he around, I suspect that “bastard, orphan, son of a whore and a Scotsman” would agree. • Jonathan Freedland is a Guardian columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"business/2017/dec/29/trumps-tax-changes-to-blow-a-5bn-hole-in-goldman-sachs-profits","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-29T13:52:28Z","webTitle":"Trump's tax changes to blow a $5bn hole in Goldman Sachs profits","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/dec/29/trumps-tax-changes-to-blow-a-5bn-hole-in-goldman-sachs-profits","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2017/dec/29/trumps-tax-changes-to-blow-a-5bn-hole-in-goldman-sachs-profits","fields":{"headline":"Trump's tax changes to blow a $5bn hole in Goldman Sachs profits","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Goldman Sachs has said Donald Trump’s radical US tax changes will knock about $5bn (£3.7bn) off its profits this year. The investment bank said most of the cost would come from Trump’s “repatriation tax” designed to encourage multinationals to bring back the trillions of dollars they hold overseas to avoid tax. Goldman, which made profits of $7.4bn last year, said: “The enactment of the tax legislation will result in a reduction of approximately $5bn in the firm’s earnings for the fourth quarter and year ending 31 December 2017, approximately two-thirds of which is due to the repatriation tax. “The remainder includes the effects of the implementation of the territorial tax system and the remeasurement of US deferred tax assets at lower enacted corporate tax rates,” the bank said in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Friday. Last week Congress approved the biggest tax overhaul in 30 years, which includes big tax cuts for companies and wealthy people. The reduction in corporation tax – from 35% to 21% – is designed in part to encourage multinational to repatriate cash from overseas. US companies were estimated, by Citigroup, to hold $2.5tn of capital overseas. Companies had previously explained that they had a duty to shareholders to keep the money abroad, rather than bring it back to the US and pay large tax bills. The tax overhaul will allow Apple to bring back its $252.3bn foreign cash mountain without a major tax hit. The huge amount of untaxed profits Apple holds overseas has become a major political football and a headache for the world’s most valuable company. Drugmaker Amgen said last week that it expected to pay $6bn to $6.5bn repatriating its cash to the US. Goldman said the rest of the $5bn knock to its profits would come from the cost of implementation of the territorial tax system, and tax changes that will make it harder for companies to deduct past losses from future tax bills. Barclays said this week the change to “deferred tax assets” and would cost it about £1bn. The tax changes were overseen by the treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, who declared the bill to be “great for hardworking workers”. Mnuchin worked at Goldman for 17 years until 2002. • Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/dec/29/royal-yacht-lottery-brittania-monarchy-queen-timeshare","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-29T11:58:52Z","webTitle":"Use lottery money to pay for a royal yacht?

OK – under these conditions","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"As a naive and sexless 16-year-old I once admitted to my psychology class that I had a phobia of large, red, salty boats. Big ships. Tankers, liners, cruise ships, yachts – that sort of thing. Only for us all to turn, the following week, to Freudian dream theory and the symbolism of boats, and have that same room full of 16-year-olds suddenly and gleefully accuse me of having a latent terror of large, red, wet and salty vaginas. Bearing such a phobia in mind, you can imagine my sinking-knicker sense of doom upon reading that a group of 50 Conservative MPs has written to ministers in the cabinet of our heartless-ditherer-in-chief, Theresa May, suggesting that we set up a national lottery to raise £120m to give the Queen a new yacht. That’s right – we all club together in a lovely national fit of gambling to give one of the richest women in the entire country a new boat to holiday in. What a gloriously and deeply Tory idea. It finally feels as if every cream-chinos, steak-and-ale-pie, trip-to-the-garden centre, Dire-Straits-in-the-car, 20-Benson-and-Hedges, comb-over cliche has finally found a home in government at the moment, doesn’t it? With the attitude to the royal family acting as a sticky, tasteless cherry on top of all of it. Those who have added their names to the letter said the new lottery game would allow the public to feel “the pride of having a stake” in the boat that would “showcase the best of British business and project our humanitarian role across the globe” after Brexit. Remember “the pride of having a stake” in things? Like the railways and the Royal Mail and the health system and or energy supply? That’s right: through taxation. Perhaps this is how we’ll have to explain taxation to our grandchildren: it was like a huge Kickstarter campaign that everyone in the country paid into, directly from their wages instead of the faff of sponsorship, and then we all received “rewards” throughout the year by using those things whenever we needed. Or like a lottery, where we all bought a monthly ticket of ownership and then could cash in that stake through lower prices, a more efficient system and profits that stayed within the economy. I still take pride in having a stake in the BBC, in schools, in hospitals, in the few bits of public infrastructure that haven’t been sold off in the name of a quick undervalued buck and a slow disintegration of service. I would gladly pay more to “have a stake” in more of the nation’s services, institutions and investments. But in a big holiday boat for a family already subsidised to the tune of hundreds of millions by British taxpayers? Perhaps not. As the letter says: “As we leave the European Union, there has never been a better time to consider how Britain projects herself on the world stage.” Absolutely bloody right. For instance, we could actually follow the Dubs amendment and provide shelter to the thousands of children fleeing war, terrorism and starvation as refugees. Although, of course, May’s government decided not to do that. Or, if we want to make things really red-white-and-British, we could actually get back all the money hidden in British overseas territories such as Jersey by tax-avoiding millionaires and use all our unpaid tax (more than £12.8bn in five years, according to some Labour party claims) to get rid of homelessness, or pay for our schools, or pay nurses properly. Imagine the impression that would make on the world stage. Although May doesn’t seem to want to do that either. But don’t worry friends – I’ve sorted this one. I’ve cracked it. Those of us who can afford it, all put in £2, build the boat, and then run this ship as a sort of national timeshare. Jim, Elaine, Sanjay, Morris, Colin: we can all use it for our holidays when our number comes up. And the Queen can do the same. If she wants to use it a lot then she can buy a lot of tickets. In 40 years of service, the old HMY Britannia took part in 968 official visits, travelling more than 1m miles at sea. That’s, what, 25 holidays a year? If we put in £4 each we could probably bump that up to 50 holidays easily, right? And – this may be wild speculation as to the number of toilets the Windsors use, but what the hell – I’m imagining you could fit quite a few British families on HMY Britannia at a time. Say, 100? I’d happily shout a few of my friends and neighbours, maybe even some of my family, a timeshare in a massive floating palace of luxury with no exits. Just don’t expect me to climb aboard.

The 4-0 series scoreline was wrapped up at 2.15pm on the fifth day in Sydney when Anderson was out to Josh Hazlewood for defeat by an innings and 123 runs, with Root, asleep in the dressing room because of viral gastroenteritis, unable to resume his innings of 58 not out. The England captain, who had spent the morning in hospital with severe dehydration, vomiting and diarrhoea following the extreme heat on day four, batted for an hour before lunch but then failed to emerge in the afternoon, even when Steve Smith was lifting the Ashes urn amid wild celebrations. That left Anderson, the vice-captain, to face the music and offer a defence of the set-up under Trevor Bayliss, whose Test record is 18 defeats to 14 wins with successive 4-0 away defeats following the failed India campaign last winter. The whitewash four years ago prompted regime change but the leading wicket-taker sees it differently this time. “It doesn’t feel like a series where there should be a big upheaval,” said Anderson, who had personally shone in leading an otherwise misfiring bowling attack over the course of the five Tests, with the 35-year-old claiming 17 wickets in unhelpful conditions. “We’ve not been blown away in every game and it doesn’t feel like a completely disastrous series. “We’re hurting and we know we’ve got to improve in many areas. We’ve not dealt with those pressure situations well with bat or ball. That’s been the difference. I don’t think the planning could have been better. It’s just the way we’ve performed.” Tom Harrison, the England and Wales Cricket Board’s chief executive, has already stated there will be no knee-jerk reaction and it is clear the one-day side’s dramatic improvement is in the favour of Bayliss staying as England look to win the World Cup on home soil in 2019. The selection panel, led by James Whitaker, may well be one department under scrutiny, though. Certainly, the numbers do not stack up favourably for England on this tour, likewise the assertion by Anderson it had felt closer than 4-0. Root’s batsmen averaged 29 runs per wicket, compared with 51 by Australia, and his bowlers picked up only 58 wickets – 19 fewer than during the 5-0 defeat in 2013-14 – while failing to claim 20 in a Test. Anderson aims to still be playing Test cricket when Smith’s side look to defend the urn in England next year and will doubtless be included when the squad for the tour of New Zealand in March is named, though others will be more nervous. James Vince and Mark Stoneman averaged in the mid-20s, while Moeen Ali’s all-round game fell apart and Stuart Broad’s 11 wickets across the series raised questions about his longevity. “All the guys in the dressing room are hurting as much as I am,” Anderson said. “That feeling you get should make you want to win the Ashes back in 2019. I’m going to do everything I can to be available for that series. I don’t pick the team, I can’t say I’m definitely going to be there but I’m still as hungry as ever. I’d really like to be around in 2019.” England doubtless suffered from the loss of Ben Stokes but, though the tour was dogged by some trivial off-field distractions amplified by the shadow of the all-rounder’s suspension, Anderson pushed back at the suggestion it affected their cricket. He said: “It’s no secret he’s one of the best all-rounders in the world and on his day as good as anyone with bat and ball. We miss a player like that. I hope he’s back very soon but from our point of view, it’s not affected the way we’ve gone about our business. The off-field stuff has had no impact whatsoever. Once we get to the ground, that’s what we’re focused on.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"politics/blog/live/2018/jan/08/cabinet-reshuffle-theresa-may-tory-government-pm-to-start-shifting-ministers-politics-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-09T00:16:42Z","webTitle":"Cabinet reshuffle: Justine Greening quits the government No 10 confirms – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2018/jan/08/cabinet-reshuffle-theresa-may-tory-government-pm-to-start-shifting-ministers-politics-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/blog/live/2018/jan/08/cabinet-reshuffle-theresa-may-tory-government-pm-to-start-shifting-ministers-politics-live","fields":{"headline":"Cabinet reshuffle: Justine Greening quits the government No 10 confirms – as it happened","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"I am closing this liveblog now. Thanks so much for joining us today and for all your comments. Here’s a round up of today’s reshuffle or “refresh” as Theresa May called it: At the end of May’s new year reshuffle, all of the top jobs remain in the same hands although some new faces have joined the ranks. Her plans were thrown off course when senior members of the cabinet refused to move. Jeremy Corbyn said the reshuffle was a “pointless and lacklustre PR exercise”. The biggest shock of the day happened when Justine Greening quit the government after turning down a job as work and pensions secretary. She was replaced by Damian Hinds while Esther McVey becomes the new work and pensions secretary Jeremy Hunt refused to be moved to a new position as business secretary and instead persuaded May to allow him to stay in health but with social care added to his portfolio. Matt Hancock was promoted to the cabinet as culture secretary, David Gauke moved to justice and David Lidington to the cabinet office. Greg Clark stays in his role after it was expected he would be promoted. Karen Bradley was appointed Northern Ireland secretary after James Brokenshire resigned on health grounds ahead of surgery on a lung condition. Brandon Lewis is to be the new party chairman. James Cleverly was appointed deputy chair, while there were 13 additional posts of vice chair covering areas such as youth, women, communities, business and policy. May’s decision to appoint Maria Caulfield as the new Conservative vice chair for women was met with criticism from women’s campaigners as Caulfield opposes the decriminalisation of abortion. There will be more changes on Tuesday in the junior and middle ministerial levels. The BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg says the reshuffle did not “entirely go to script” as of the three ministers Theresa May wanted to move, one quit, one persuaded her that he should stay and the other consequently wasn’t moved. She also pointed out that the proportion of those from Oxbridge and private school backgrounds has increased. Amber Rudd will take over the responsibilities of being minister for women and equalities – a role that was carried out by Justine Greening. My colleagues Anushka Asthana and Rowena Mason have got the full story on today’s events. Theresa May’s new year reshuffle was thrown off course when senior members of the cabinet refused to move and Justine Greening quit the government after turning down a job as work and pensions secretary. Earlier, Jeremy Hunt rejected a new position as business secretary and instead persuaded the prime minister to allow him to remain at health in a beefed-up role taking on more responsibility for social care. That meant that a planned move for Greg Clark did not go ahead, and he instead remained at the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy. The result was a less dramatic shake-up than planned on a day that began with a social media gaffe in which the Conservatives’ official Twitter feed wrongly congratulated Chris Grayling for becoming party chair. In fact, Patrick McLoughlin was replaced by Brandon Lewis, the Great Yarmouth MP, and Grayling remained as transport secretary. Read more here: Beth Rigby of Sky News says there has been some progress on the gender mix of cabinet with two more women attending than before today’s reshuffle. However, Henry Zeffman from The Times points out that only six are full members. Earlier the Daily Telegraph’s Christopher Hope pointed out how all those who have joined cabinet today are white. And that’s it for tonight. Number 10 have ended the day with a tweet about the number of women who will attend cabinet and said more ministerial appointments will be made tomorrow. Julian Smith stays on as chief whip. He has been in post since November when Gavin Williamson, who previously held the post, was promoted to Defence Secretary by Theresa May. My colleague Claire Phipps has sent me a screengrab of yet another Conservsative social media gaffe, this time from Tory MP Nadhim Zahawi. Earlier this evening, Jeremy Hunt liked – and then “unliked” – a tweet about Justine Greening resigning and this morning the Conservatives mistakenly announced Chris Grayling as chairman in a tweet that quickly got deleted. Here, Zahawi has shared Labour MP Lisa Nandy’s strong criticism of Esther McVey, the new secretary of state for work and pensions. The retweet was also deleted shortly after. Elizabeth Truss will stay on as chief secretary to the treasury. Andrea Leadsom remains Leader of the House of Commons, Downing Street said. Here’s the hot take from former Conservative minister Nicholas Soames. There was sympathy for Justine Greening following her resignation, and regret from many in the sector who have welcomed her less combative approach and her willingness to listen to teachers’ concerns. Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said her departure was disappointing at a time when stability was needed in the sector after the “policy pyrotechnics” of recent years. He said: She has tried hard to tackle the school funding crisis, without any help from the Chancellor or Prime Minister. She has demonstrated an absolute commitment to social mobility, to addressing the serious difficulties in teacher recruitment and retention, and to developing education policy on the basis of evidence. Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers said: “Free from needless ‘big ticket’ policy announcements significant progress has been made lately on areas like primary assessment.” He praised Greening’s work on careers’ guidance in schools, sex and relationships education and social mobility. Children need stability and their teachers can only provide that if the backdrop of education policy provides continuity for the profession. New secretaries of state often feel that new announcements are obligatory. In 2018, where budgets are at breaking point and recruitment is still a massive challenge, education does not need more upheaval. Jules White, head teacher and a key figure in the Worth Less? Campaign for fair funding for schools, added: “The issues of teacher supply, adequate funding and opportunity for all young people must be effectively and urgently addressed.” He noted that the new education secretary was a former grammar school pupil – unlike Greening who went to a comprehensive – with a stated commitment to improving social mobility. We hope that he fully understands these two items are inextricably linked whilst all the independent evidence confirms that grammar schools and widespread social mobility are mutually exclusive. Mary Bousted and Kevin Courtney, joint general secretaries of the National Education Union, said: We had a good relationship with Justine Greening, with whom we had regular meetings. She listened to teachers and the unions, although she was not able to make the necessary changes in education policy. We hope Damian Hinds will be similarly willing to meet and engage with us and the profession. And we hope he will be able to make the changes we need in education policy. Most crucially we hope he champions the need for extra funding for education and is able to get more money for education from the Treasury. Angela Rayner, shadow education secretary, has wished Justine Greening well in the future in a tweet following her surprise decision to leave government. Meanwhile the Liberal Democrat leader Vince Cable has said this of Theresa May’s decision to let Greening go: The only rational explanation would be that this is an acknowledgement that the Conservatives have a failed schools policy. A department of health spokeswoman has released a statement regarding Jeremy Hunt’s new role, after it was announced he would also be taking on the social care portfolio as well as staying on as secretary of state for health. The spokeswoman confirmed the department will be changing names and that Hunt will be responsible for the forth coming social care green paper. She said: From today the department will be renamed Department of Health and Social Care, taking on responsibility for the forthcoming social care green paper which will set out the Government’s proposals to improve care and support for older people and tackle the challenge of an ageing population. All costs associated with changing the department’s name will be kept to a minimum. My colleague Heather Stewart looks back on today’s largely underwhelming reshuffle. By the end of Monday, Theresa May must have felt like all the other hapless British workers who returned to the office for the new year with a spring in their step and the best of intentions, only to find the fearless resolutions they made over the Christmas break crumbling in the face of reality. Theresa May’s cabinet reshuffle: promotions, demotions and exitsRead more The prime minister had three main aims in her much-trailed new year reshuffle. She hoped to showcase a fresh generation of Tory talent; shake up the party election-fighting machinery that misfired so badly last year; and show her determination to get to grips with domestic challenges that have been all but overshadowed by Brexit for the past 12 months. It didn’t start well. The Conservatives’ official media account tweeted its congratulations to Brexiteer Chris Grayling as the Tory party’s new chair – but staff rapidly had to backtrack and delete the message. It was some time before Brandon Lewis, the ebullient immigration minister, was formally given the post, as deadlines were missed and progress slipped. Read the full piece here: Caroline Nokes has been appointed minister of state for immigration. Lucy Fisher from The Times has her own prediction about the women and equalities brief. She suggests Theresa May may make the role a cabinet position in its own right following the Westminster sexual harassment scandal. Jeremy Wright remains as attorney general and will attend cabinet. Justine Greening has released a short statement on Twitter in the wake of her resignation from government. She says it was an “honour and privilege” to serve since 2010 and that social mobility “matters more” than her ministerial career. Claire Perry will attend Cabinet and take on the role of minister of state at the department for business, energy and industrial strategy. She will also become member of the Privy Council. The Evening Standard’s editor (and former chancellor) George Osborne has called the reshuffle “unusual” in a tweet praising his old colleagues. Esther McVey becomes Secretary of State for Work and Pensions after the role was turned down by Justine Greening. In an embarrassing twist to a reshuffle beset with social media mistakes, Jeremy Hunt, who was kept on as health secretary with an extended social care role in the shake-up, was forced to explain why he had “liked” a tweet stating that Justine Greening had resigned from government. He quickly unliked the tweet after it was spotted by Guido Fawkes’ Alex Wickham. For those just joining us, here is the full story so far on Theresa May’s cabinet refresh from my colleague Peter Walker. Justine Greening resigned from the government on Monday after Theresa May tried to move her from her post as secretary of state for education to the Department for Work and Pensions in a cabinet reshuffle designed to reboot her government. In a statement Theresa May said said she was “disappointed” but respects Greening’s decision. Greening was succeeded as education secretary by Damian Hinds who was promoted from being a junior work and pensions minister. Earlier May kept Jeremy Hunt as her health secretary with new responsibility for social care, signalling that the prime minister wants to make another attempt to reform the troubled system. The rest of the story is here: ITV’s Paul Brand has predicted Claire Perry, who has just arrived at number 10, will be the new minister for women and equalities. Justine Greening previously held the role alongside her education job. Brand also suggests Esther McVey could get the department for work and pensions. Damian Hinds has been appointed Education Secretary, taking Justine Greening’s job. Alun Cairns MP is to remain the secretary of state for Wales. Justine Greening was once dubbed a “Tory to watch” back in 2013. Here’s an interview from shortly after she had become the international development secretary, a position she held before taking on the department for education in 2016. Theresa May is “disappointed” but respects former education secretary Justine Greening’s decision to leave the Government after being offered the Work and Pensions Department, Downing Street sources have said. The Telegraph’s Asa Bennett suggests Greening may join the high profile Tory remainers who rebelled against the government in December. The BBC’s Nick Robinson agrees. Downing Street have confirmed that Justine Greening has resigned from government. Anushka Asthana, our political editor, says Greening was “offered DWP, but declined to take it”. Justine Greening has been seen leaving number 10. No news yet on what she will be doing, if anything. David Mundell stays on as secretary of state for Scotland. Baroness Evans is remaining in post as the leader of the House of Lords. Justine Greening is still inside number 10 with The Sun’s Tom Newton Dunn saying she has been offered the department of work and pensions but is refusing to take it. Jeremy Corbyn has been discussing the reshuffle in a meeting of the Parliamentary Labour Party, saying it is a “pointless and lacklustre” PR stunt. He said: In 2018, the impact of Tory austerity is hitting home with the public, most tragically with the most serious NHS winter crisis yet. And yet the Government’s big plan for the new year is to dodge the real issues and reshuffle the pack in a pointless and lacklustre PR exercise. It’s simply not good enough. You can’t make up for nearly eight years of failure by changing the name of a department. Michael Gove is also staying on in his role heading up the department for environment, food and rural affairs, making him the 12th cabinet minister to stay put. This is Nicola Slawson taking over from Andrew for the remainder of this mini shuffle. The latest is that Penny Mordaunt is staying on as Secretary of State for International Development. She has only been doing the role since early November, when she succeeded Priti Patel. Channel 4 News’s Gary Gibbon has written a good blog on the reshuffle. It is headlined: “Reshuffle: night of the long plastic forks.” Here’s an extract. Well it wasn’t really worth the drum roll build-up. As reshuffles go this has not been transformatory. There’s more still to come tomorrow with middle and junior ranks outside the cabinet, but Theresa may has not felt able to shift big irritants from senior jobs and, as I write, has yet to announce any cabinet sackings ... But it seems like quite a lot of power has migrated to Vote Leave leaders Michael Gove and Boris Johnson in recent months. They decree what Brexit supporters will tolerate as the negotiations progress. Some think it was fear of their reaction that meant the prime minister didn’t reverse the decision to appoint Toby Young as a director of the Office for Students. His tweets and other public comments would be the sort of stuff that people close to Theresa May say she would find repugnant. Her reflex would be to make that clear by removing him from the post, allies say. But what hope a really drastic reshuffle from a prime minister who can’t act as she pleases over a board member of a university regulator? The small scale of this reshuffle reveals the prime minister’s weakened political position … but, she’s still there. That’s all from me for today. My colleague Nicola Slawson is taking over now. This is from the FT’s George Parker. Chris Grayling remains as transport secretary. Here is ITV’s Robert Peston on the prevalence of Conservative party vice chairmen. This may be a bit harsh. But now there are more Tory vice chairs (13) than there are Lib Dem MPs (12). Meanwhile, the parliamentary Labour party is meeting. According to the Daily Mirror’s Mikey Smith, the leading pro-European Chuka Umunna has just walked out. Sky’s Tamara Cohen may have the explanation. As Guido Fawkes’s Alex Wickham points out, the new secretary of state at DCMS is already noted for his contribution towards cultural excellence. Here is Matt Hancock singing. Here are the reshuffle moves that have been confirmed. Promotions David Lidington becomes Cabinet Office minister and Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster. This means he replaces Damian Green as the government’s cross-departmental fixer, although he has not inherited Green’s first secretary of state title. Brandon Lewis becomes Conservative party chairman, and a minister without portfolio. Previously he was immigration minister, attending cabinet but not as a full member. Matt Hancock becomes culture secretary. He was minister for digital in the department. James Cleverly becomes Conservative party deputy chairman. He was a backbencher and parliamentary private secretary (PPS) to Lewis. Sideways moves David Gauke becomes justice secretary and lord chancellor. He was work and pensions secretary. Karen Bradley becomes Northern Ireland secretary. She was culture secretary. Changes to job titles Jeremy Hunt becomes secretary of state for health and social care. He was previously just health secretary. Sajid Javid becomes secretary of state for housing, communities and local government. He was previously just secretary of state for communities and local government. Demotions and departures Sir Patrick McLoughlin has resigned as Conservative party chairman. James Brokenshire has resigned as Northern Ireland secretary on health grounds. Chris Skidmore has left his post as minister for the constitution. He is now Conservative vice chairman for policy. Andrew Jones has left his post as a Treasury minister. He is now Conservative vice chairman for business engagement. Marcus Jones has left his post as communities minister. He is now Conservative vice chairman for local government. Matt Hancock, the minister for digital, has become culture secretary. Here is some opposition comment on the reshuffle. From Labour’s Jon Trickett, the shadow Cabinet Office minister With the NHS in crisis, working people worse off and Brexit preparations in turmoil, Theresa May is leading a failing government. By simply rearranging the deckchairs in her reshuffle, Theresa May has shown that her floundering government is out of fresh ideas. It takes more than re-naming departments to erase seven years of failure. What the country desperately needs is a new approach. With Jeremy Corbyn, that’s what Labour offers: a new Britain, run in the interests of the many, not the few. From Stephen Gethins, the SNP’s foreign affairs and Europe spokesman Today’s shambolic on-going cabinet reshuffle has confirmed that Theresa May is a prisoner to the Brexit hard liners who now hold the power in the government, and cannot be moved. They are calling the tune. The truth is that this prime minister cannot make a move without upsetting one faction or another of her party – and her authority since her disastrous election is being diminished day by day. This has created a revolving door government in which we have had six justice secretaries in 7 years - four immigration ministers in as many years and the shortest serving party chairman in history – congratulated on his appointment by the party - and then removed within half an hour. The prime minister should be focused on saving jobs and the economy from the Brexit disaster not just the jobs of top Tories who created the mess. From Alistair Carmichael, the Lib Dem chief whip Just like Theresa May’s U-turn on the hated dementia tax, this reshuffle can be summed up with the phrase ‘nothing has changed.’ We still have a hapless prime minister and an incompetent government, dragging the country towards a destructive Brexit. Theresa May wanted to reassert her authority but has come out of this looking weaker than ever. Here is the BBC’s health editor Hugh Pym on whether or not changing the name of the department of health to include social care actually makes any difference or not. Like the rest of us, he doesn’t know. I’ve asked Number 10 but they referred me to the department of health. And the department of health press office said someone would get back to me with an answer. I’m still waiting ... Marc Stears, who was an adviser to Ed Miliband when he was Labour leader, reckons that if Theresa May can get out-negotiated by Jeremy Hunt (see 5.51pm), she does not have much chance with Michel Barnier and Jean-Claude Juncker. The Lib Dem MP Norman Lamb, who used to be a social care minister in the department of health, reckons the change to the department’s name (see 4.44pm and 5.45pm) is just cosmetic. And Chris Grayling, the transport secretary, has gone into Number 10 too. Matt Hancock, minister for digital at the culture department, has arrived at Number 10. Karen Bradley, the culture secretary, is replacing James Brokenshire as Northern Ireland secretary. The BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg is also saying that Theresa May wanted to move Jeremy Hunt but was persuaded to let him stay. Damian Hinds, minister of state at the department for work and pensions, has arrived at Number 10, the BBC reports. This is from Nick Golding, editor of the Local Government Chronicle, on Jeremy Hunt getting social care added to his departmental title. The BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg says Hunt will take charge of the adult social care green paper. As mentioned earlier, David Gauke will be the sixth justice secretary in less than eight years. At the afternoon lobby briefing Downing Street denied that having such a high turnover was a problem. The prime minister’s spokesman said: The commitment from the government throughout its time has been into ensuring that rehabilitation is a priority and to break the cycle of reoffending. That has been a continuous theme and I’m sure it will be one that the new secretary of state will continue with. This is from the BBC’s Denis Doherty. The health minister Philip Dunne has committed a gaffe while defending the government’s handling of the NHS winter crisis in the Commons when he was responding to the Commons urgent questions earlier. When Labour MP Tracy Brabin raised the issue of poorly people sleeping on the floor in A&amp;E, he apologised for cancelled operations and said people sleeping on the floor was not acceptable but added: “There are seats available in most hospitals where beds are not available.” David Gauke has moved from the department for work and pensions to the ministry for justice. The Conservative party has now send out a press notice about today’s party appointments. In addition to the nine vice chair posts announced earlier (see 1.41pm), the party has confirmed that another four vice chairmen remain in post. They are: David Brownlow - vice chairman, campaigning Dominic Johnson - vice chairman, finance Paul Scully - vice chairman, London Alec Shelbrooke - vice chairman, international Gavin Williamson remains as defence secretary The Sun’s Tom Newton Dunn says it wasn’t Greg Clark who refused to budge; it was Jeremy Hunt. The Sun’s Tom Newton Dunn says Jeremy Hunt was supposed to come out of Number 10 as the new business secretary. Greg Clark is staying as business secretary. There was a lot of speculation, fuelled by briefing from within government, that he was going to be moved, but he’s defied predictions. David Lidington, the new Cabinet Office minister, will stand in for Theresa May at PMQs when she is away, Number 10 has said. Jeremy Hunt becomes secretary of state for health and social care, Number 10 says. At first sight this just looks like a tokenistic tweak to his job title - which is effectively what has happened with Sajid Javid and housing (see 3.08pm) - but this may turn out to be much more significant. Social care is currently funded through local government (the minister responsible for adult social care in DCLG was Marcus Jones, who today lost his job). If Hunt’s new title is to mean anything, then presumably he will take over responsibility for this portfolio. It could be a real step forwards towards the integration of health and social care, a long-term ambition for policy makers in this area. We have not had any briefing on the move yet, but presumably Number 10 will clarify this soon. Theresa May’s intermission with members of the Welsh assembly is over, and the reshuffle is back on, Sky’s Faisal Islam reports. As BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg has 90 minutes to prepare her reshuffle package for the News at Six. It sounds as if she’s worrying about not having anything to report ... This is from the Times’ Patrick Maguire. Here is another Institute for Government reshuffle graph. Theresa May is now meeting members of the Welsh assembly. Perhaps one of them will end up as the new first secretary of state ... Theresa May’s promotion of Maria Caulfield to a new role as vice chair for women has provoked outrage over her views on abortion. Labour branded the appointment an “appalling decision”, while the British Pregnancy Advice service said it was “incredibly disappointing”. Caulfield led opposition to the campaign to decriminalise abortion last year, arguing that more consideration should be given to the rights of the unborn child. She spoke out against Diana Johnson’s ten-minute rule bill to decriminalise abortion, saying “more must be done to effectively combat the dangerous liberalisation of abortion, which hides under the premise of championing women’s rights”. Caulfield, a former nurse who still does some hospital shifts, said she was delighted by the new role and tweeted about her efforts to make sure women in custody have access to sanitary products. But Dawn Butler, the shadow women and equalities secretary, said it was a very bad decision given Caulfield’s stance on abortion. “Women deserve to have the strongest advocates at the top of politics, not people who seek to restrict their rights and freedoms,” she said. The British Pregnancy Advisory Service said it was “incredibly disappointed” by the appointment as Caulfield had “defended the current law which threatens any woman who ends her own pregnancy without the approval of two doctors with life imprisonment”. It went on: This is not an abstract issue. Women in across the UK have faced prosecution and prison sentences for ending pregnancies using abortion medication bought online. These are often women in the most desperate of circumstances. One study found 1 in 5 who tried to use online abortion medication were in a violent or controlling relationship. Should these women face criminal prosecution? According to the new CCHQ vice chair for women, yes. These are from Sky’s Faisal Islam. This is from the BBC’s Hugh Pym. Last week Jeremy Hunt, the health secretary, was refusing to accept that there was an NHS winter crisis. In the Commons the health minister Philip Dunne has paid tribute to Jeremy Hunt. Labour whips, an official account, reckons that could be a sign Hunt is on the move. This is from the BBC’s Denis Doherty. Prospect’s Tom Clark says this is a “nothing has changed’ reshuffle. If you like machinery of government graphs and quotes from ex-ministers about their time in government (confession: I do), then you’ll agree that Gavin Freeguard’s live blog about the reshuffle for the Institute for Government is excellent. He’s been tweeting too. In the Commons the health minister Philip Dunne is responding to the urgent question on the NHS winter crisis. We don’t know yet whether Jeremy Hunt is still his boss, and Dunne hasn’t said. James Brokenshire, who resigned as Northern Ireland secretary this morning on health grounds, has tweeted a message of thanks to people who have expressed support. It was his 50th birthday yesterday. More speculation about how might be the next justice secretary, from the Spectator’s James Forsyth. And here is my colleague John Crace on Sajid Javid’s new title. Here is ITV’s Robert Peston on Sajid Javid’s new title. Sajid Javid, the communities secretary, has kept his job. But his department has now got housing in the title, suggesting that housing is now his priority. Previously he was secretary of state for communities and local government. Now he is secretary of state for housing, communities and local government. In media shorthand, he will probably be known as the housing secretary. My colleague Alan Travis, the Guardian’s home affairs editor, says David Lidington’s move means the Ministry of Justice will have had six justice secretaries in less than eight years. And Jeremy Hunt, the health secretary, has gone in. The NHS pin badge may be significant because in July 2016, when May became PM, Hunt arrived to see her during the reshuffle without the badge, in what was seen as a sign that he expected to be moved. He was wearing the badge when he came out, confirmed in post. Ireland’s foreign affairs minister, Simon Coveney, phoned James Brokenshire today while on a visit to Cairo to wish him well following the news that Brokenshire has resigned as Northern Ireland secretary on health grounds. Coveney said Brokenshire had shown unfailing dedication and determination to secure political progress consistent with the objectives and commitments of the Good Friday agreement. He said: His unwavering commitment - in public and in private - over the last year to securing the effective operation of the devolved power-sharing institutions in Belfast has been hugely important. While it is not always obvious to the public gaze, very important progress has been made on significant issues over the last year and I believe that a positive outcome can still be achieved. If it is, it will be a testament to the quiet, understated but hugely valuable work of James Brokenshire. Latest speculation ... From ITV’s Robert Peston From the FT’s Jim Pickard At some point we’re going to get a Labour reshuffle too, ITV’s Paul Brand reports. Greg Clark, the business secretary, has gone in to Number 10. He is expected to be moved. Theresa May posed for a picture outside Number 10 earlier with Brandon Lewis, the new Conservative party chairman, James Cleverly, the new Conservative party deputy chairman, and the new Conservative party vice chairmen. No surprise here ... If David Lidington is moving to the Cabinet Office, Dominic Raab must be favourite to replace him. Raab is already minister of state at the ministry for justice - effectively Lidingon’s number two. David Lidington has moved from justice minister to Cabinet Office minister and chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster. This means he will take on the Westminster coordinating role (chairing committees etc) that Damian Green had. But May has not made Lidington first secretary of state, the title that Green also had. Perhaps someone else is getting that title. Or perhaps (contrary to the steer we were getting yesterday) May will the title lapse. In the past many PMs have managed perfectly well without a first secretary of state. A government source has confirmed that the three new Conservative vice chairmen who were ministers have now left the government. They are: Chris Skidmore, the minister for the constitution; Andrew Jones, a Treasury minister; and Marcus Jones, the communities minister. It is hard to believe that any of them would have voluntarily given up a (paid) government job for an (unpaid) position with the party, and so it is probably that case that they have been sacked. But I haven’t been told that, and it is conceivable that one or all of them may have voluntarily opted for a quieter life. And Conservative HQ has also announced the appointment of nine new vice chairmen. Three of them were until this morning junior ministers. This may well mean that they have been sacked - vice chairmen are not normally government ministers - but that has not been confirmed yet. Being a vice chairman of the Conservative party is a bit like being vice president of an American bank; it sounds impressive, but they are ten-a-penny, and the title means relatively little. Here are the names in full. Chris Skidmore - vice chairman for policy Skidmore, at least until today, was minister for the constitution in the Cabinet Office. It is not clear yet whether this CCHQ appointment means he has been sacked from government. Kemi Badenoch - vice chairman for candidates Ben Bradley - vice chairman for youth Bradley is 28, which helps to explain why he’s qualified for this post. Maria Caulfield - vice chairman for women Rehman Chishti and Helen Grant - vice chairmen for communities Andrew Jones - vice chairman for business engagement Jones was a Treasury minister until this morning. As with Skidmore, it is not clear yet if this appointment means he has left the government Marcus Jones - vice chairman for local government And this Jones was a local government minister until today. Perhaps he still is. Or perhaps he’s been sacked. James Morris - vice chairman for training and development The Conservative Party has confirmed that James Cleverly has been made deputy chairman. Arlene Foster, leader of the DUP, has issued this tribute to James Brokenshire, who has resigned as Northern Ireland secretary for health reasons. She said: This is clearly a difficult time for not only James but for Cathy, his wife and his children. I send my best wishes to him and the entire Brokenshire family. I trust James will have the surgery he needs and will make a full recovery. Since becoming secretary of state in 2016, Mr Brokenshire had immersed himself fully in the role by dedicating long hours to trying to make progress. James leaves the role with a very intimate knowledge of Northern Ireland and I look forward to working with him again in the future. There’s been another reshuffle Twitter error, my colleague Peter Walker reports. While we wait for some more actual facts, here are some tweets about other reshuffle cock-ups. From the Guardian’s Gaby Hinsliff Gaby is referring to the leftwing Labour MP Brian Donohoe, who was contacted by the Number 10 switchboard when Tony Blair wanted to offer a job to Bernard Donoughue. Apparently Blair got put through to Donohoe but quickly terminated the call when he realised he was about to offer a job to the wrong man. The Conservative Ed Vaizey says he had a similar experience. And the Mail on Sunday columnist Dan Hodges has another example. The Downing Street Twitter account has made its first reshuffle announcement. It has confirmed that the immigration minister Brandon Lewis has become Conservative party chairman. Nigel Farage has welcomed the prospect of a minister for a no-deal Brexit (see 11.23am), while accusing the government of ignoring the issue of immigration in negotiations with the European Union. Speaking to reporters in Brussels, following a 30-minute meeting with the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, Farage said: It is a very good thing that there is going to be a minister for no-deal. It does at least show that Theresa May is prepared to walk away. And I think that is because she has been getting these under-the-radar voices for business saying we can’t spend years trying to get somewhere if it is frankly going to be unachievable. The Ukip MEP’s contention that business is prepared to accept no-deal is starkly at odds with Britain’s biggest business group, the Confederation for British Industry, which has been urging the government to agree transition arrangements and warned that no-deal would cost jobs. But there are pro-Brexit business voices outside the CBI. The Ukip MEP had requested the meeting, after a trio of remain-supporting ex-ministers, Lord Adonis, Nick Clegg and Ken Clarke, met Barnier last October. Farage said the meeting was “very civil”. Coffee was offered, but there was no exchange of gifts. (Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn gave Barnier an Arsenal shirt, while the Brexit secretary David Davis presented him with a book about a mountaineering expedition that went badly wrong.) To no one’s surprise, there wasn’t a meeting of minds between the European commissioner and lifelong Eurosceptic. Farage said Barnier doesn’t understand why people voted for Brexit. I really don’t think he gets it. And when I suggested to him that it might be something to do with open door immigration within the European Union, he almost looked at me with incredulity. He also accused the government of not prioritising immigration in the negotiations, underlining his attempt to position himself as the voice of leave voters and force the debate away from the economy. [Theresa May] says she is the Brexit prime minister. She fought the general election on that basis and we find she is the Brexit prime minister, apart from one issue, called immigration, which she hasn’t event talked about. The commission has so far declined to comment, beyond noting: “The two men discussed the state of play of article 50 negotiations.” Here’s Rupert Harrison, who was chief of staff to George Osborne, on the reshuffle. We’ve got two urgent questions in the Commons this afternoon. But we don’t know if Jeremy Hunt or Justine Greening will still be in post this afternoon. Both UQs may well be answered by junior ministers ... Turning to Brexit for a moment, the former Ukip leader Nigel Farage has been tweeting about his meeting with Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator. And here is the text of May’s response to Brokenshire. In it, May suggests that Brokenshire could be offered another government job when he recovers. She says: I very much look forward to working alongside you again when you are back to full health. Here is the text of James Brokenshire’s resignation letter. Sir Patrick McLoughlin, the outgoing Conservative party chairman, has confirmed that he has left the cabinet. Speaking to Sky News, he said that he had been in cabinet for eight years and that he had had “a very good run”. Sky’s Beth Rigby says McLoughlin told May in the autumn that he wanted to stand down, but that he was asked to stay on until the reshuffle. James Cleverly, a backbencher, is going to get the deputy post at CCHQ, the Spectator’s James Forsyth and the Telegraph’s Gordon Rayner report. This is from the BBC’s Denis Doherty. Christopher Hope, who wrote the Telegraph splash about May appointing a minister for a no deal Brexit (see 11.23am), reports the job could go to a remainer, and not Steve Baker. This is from the Sun’s Harry Cole. The Times’ Sam Coates says a CCHQ official was to blame for the Grayling error. Brandon Lewis, the immigration minister, has arrived at Number 10. He is now being tipped for Conservative chairman. Sky’s Faisal Islam is speculating that Chris Grayling could turn out to be the shortest-lived Conservative party chairman of all time. This is from the Spectator’s James Forsyth. If, on reshuffle day, it gets reported that X has got a particular job and then it ends up going to Y, that may because the reshuffle has gone wrong and there has been a last-minute change of heart. But equally it might just be because a reporter or a news organisation made a mistake. The danger for Number 10, as Forsyth points out, is that news organisations are reluctant to admit that they have got it wrong, and the cock-up narrative is much more attractive. And this is from the Times’ Sam Coates. The Chris Grayling announcement may be premature, it has now emerged. More on James Brokenshire. These are from two Northern Ireland journalists. According to the Times’s Sam Coates, the Conservative party has just deleted a tweet announcing Chris Grayling’s appointment as party chairman. This is from the BBC’s Iain Watson. The Press Association has more on James Brokenshire’s illness. This is from the Telegraph’s Gordon Rayner. James Brokenshire’s resignation has not been officially announced yet, but Sky News says the story has been confirmed. This is from the Spectator’s James Forsyth. This is from the Sun’s Harry Cole. He says James Brokenshire is resigning as Northern Ireland secretary because of ill health. These are from my colleague Jennifer Rankin on Nigel Farage’s meeting with Michel Barnier. Farage was referring to today’s Daily Telegraph splash, which starts: A “cabinet minister for no deal” is to be appointed by Theresa May as part of the reshuffle of her top team which begins on Monday, the Telegraph can reveal. A close reading of the Telegraph story shows that the proposal it is reporting is for Steve Baker, the Brexit minister already in charge of cross-Whitehall preparations for Brexit, to have his role beefed up, so that he would attend cabinet. But he would not actually be a cabinet minister. Government sources have not confirmed or denied the story. Brexiters would welcome the idea of a minister for a no deal Brexit because most of them believe that the UK has to show it is prepared to walk way without a deal to force the EU to offer it a generous trade deal. But Sir Vince Cable, the Lib Dem leader, thinks this shows how far the Tories are moving to the right. In a reference to the Telegraph splash, he said: The government should not even be considering leaving the EU with no deal - that is the worst of all possible options. However, this shows the journey the Conservatives are taking, steering the country further and further into a highly damaging hard Brexit. The prime minister should be negotiating Brexit on what are the best terms for Britain, not on what might temporarily salve ideological arguments in her deeply divided party. For the good of our economic future, a no deal Brexit must be ruled out immediately. We’re going to get the first reshuffle names imminently, but they will be new appointments at Conservative party headquarters. Cabinet appointments will follow after that. And the PM is planning to see all ministers who are staying and all new ministers, we’re told. By the end of the day we will know the facts about the reshuffle, but for the moment all we’ve got is speculation of sorts, some of which will turn out to be well-founded - and some won’t. Here’s the latest from the Sunday Times’ Tim Shipman. It is worth pointing that we’re still quite early in the day, and reshuffles can unravel. There will be a white board in Number 10 with various names pencilled in for various posts. But if one minister refuses a particular job unexpectedly, then the entire plan may need a rethink. ITV’s political editor Robert Peston has written an interesting blog on the reshuffle. Here’s an extract. Justine Greening seems to be dead minister walking at the Department for Education. Her crimes? “Senior backbench MPs are still fuming at the way she killed the plan to open new grammar schools” said one of her colleagues. “And my goodness she goes on and on at cabinet. The annoyance on the prime minister’s face when Justine won’t stop talking is quite a picture”. Greg Clark, the business secretary, looks to be on his way out – because “he’s too secretive and is said to be a ditherer”, said a source. The party chairman, Patrick McLoughlin, will be axed – because if the prime minister hasn’t taken personal responsibility for the Tories’ lacklustre performance in last year’s election, he’ll be forced to do so. Also Andrea Leadsom is expected to be replaced as leader of the House of Commons: she attracts too much attention for the prime minister’s taste, and often for the wrong reasons, said one of their colleagues. And the BBC’s political editor, Laura Kuenssberg, has written a good blog too on reshuffles generally. Here’s an excerpt. There is not necessarily a direct relationship between successful reshuffles and prime ministerial authority. Strong leaders have botched them sometimes. But clever reshuffles can embolden weak prime ministers. According to Sky’s Beth Rigby, ministers being sacked won’t have to do the “walk of shame” up Downing Street (see 8.58am) after all. Theresa May has just arrived back in Downing Street from her Maidenhead constituency, the BBC is reporting. The wikipedia page of Anne Milton, tipped as possible incoming health secretary, has just been edited from somewhere on the parliamentary estate, according to this Twitter bot, which tracks wiki edits made from the parliamentary estate. Milton has already faced questions on social media about her husband’s role with Virgin Care. The page did say that Dr Graham Henderson holds a high level position with the private healthcare company, but as of 9.10am this morning, now says he “previously served” as one. Fancy that. UPDATE: Blimey - someone is not quite there with technology this morning. Since a 9.10am edit from within the parliamentary estate, there has been another edit on the Anne Milton wiki page (from outside parliament) reappointing her husband to serving at Virgin Care again. (And someone - in between - also said that she was appointed as first secretary of state on 8 Jan, before deleting that, although that seems to be from outside parliament). Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland’s first minister, said that leaving the EU with no deal would be “unthinkable”, and again insisted that the UK should be seeking the softest possible Brexit deal. In her first broadcast interview of 2018, Sturgeon told BBC Radio Scotland’s Good Morning Scotland programme stressed she believed there was no option facing the UK which would be economically more beneficial that remaining the EU. But she had to be pragmatic. She said: There is no doubt at all that staying in the single market, staying in the customs union – they’re not the best outcomes, staying in the EU is, in my view the best outcome – but it’s the least damaging outcome. I think 2018 has to be the year where we say jobs, the economy, the protections that come from EU membership, like workers rights, consumers rights, really come to the fore and the hardline Tory Brexiteers sidelined rather than given greater precedence. But Sturgeon was unable to offer any clearer insight into her strategy on Brexit this year, her plans for a second independence referendum or whether she backed a new referendum on the Brexit deal. A Queens university study last week said 87% of SNP voters wanted a vote on the deal, but Sturgeon repeated her previous stance that the case for that confirmatory vote “could become irresistible”. She said the full impacts of the various scenarios on the UK’s economy, such as a soft Brexit, a so-called “Canada-plus” free trade deal or no deal at all, would be spelt out in a Scottish government report later this month. This is from the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg. These are from ITV’s Paul Brand. (If every cabinet minister is getting a performance review, it’s going to take hours.) Here are tweets from the BBC’s Adam Fleming and Rob Watts about Nigel Farage, who is meeting Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, about now. With Farage in Brussels, I suppose at least we can rule him out for the first secretary of state job ... Writing about reshuffles in his memoirs, Tony Blair said: “Here’s some advice: you should always promote or demote for a purpose, not for effect.” He says this in a paragraph describing the 2006 reshuffle, in which he - rather pointlessly, he now admits - replaced Jack Straw as foreign secretary with Margaret Beckett. Blair says overall that reshuffle was a failure; “it did little for the government and harm to me.” There is a casual assumption that, with a bold reshuffle, a prime minister can somehow boost the fortunes of a government. In crude terms, that’s not the case. There may be some examples of a government receiving an obvious bounce in the opinion polls, or in electoral contests, as a direct result of a reshuffle, but I can’t think of one. But reshuffles do make a difference in other way. Here are three effects that can be broadly positive. 1 - Reshuffles create future leaders. In theory anyone can stand for the leadership of their party (and even win, as Jeremy Corbyn proved) but in practice most leadership contests are won by someone with a high-profile cabinet-level job. By tonight there will be some people “in play” for a future leader contest who aren’t in play at the moment. And the reshuffle of junior ranks, expected tomorrow, will for some MPs start a career rise that will at some point in the future also make them future leadership candidates. 2 - Reshuffles create new policy opportunities. In theory a prime minister should be able to determine what a government does. But most executive powers in government reside with secretaries of state, not the prime minister (the article 50 bill was a rare example of legislation giving a specific power to the prime minister) and even strong prime ministers find it hard to push through reform if departmental ministers are not in favour. This seems to be why Justine Greening is set to be replaced as education secretary. (She is “slowing down successful policies she inherited”, Nick Timothy, May’s former co chief of staff, wrote in a damning column in the Sun last month.) 3 - Reshuffles can change the personality of a government (a bit). In recent years all prime ministers, Labour and Tory, have been keen to use reshuffles to make their administrations more diverse, particularly more female and less white, and May is no different. Often the overall impact is relatively marginal, but sometimes a reshuffle can make a government look noticeably different. For example, after the cull of Cameroon Etonians in May’s first reshuffle, the Tories did look less posh. But, as the Blair memoirs show, reshuffles can backfire too - and not just for the obvious reason. 4 - Reshuffles can create problems for prime ministers because of whom they sack. This is the main reason they are so risky. Today’s reshuffle has been described as an opportunity to refresh the government. But it is also an opportunity to refresh the pool of Brexit “mutineeers”, as the Telegraph calls them, because ex-ministers featured prominently in the list of Tories who rebelled over the EU withdrawal bill last month. 5 - But reshuffles can also create problems for prime ministers because of whom they promote. David Cameron’s decision to make Theresa May home secretary in 2010 was a surprise, not least to her. Cameron and George Osborne were not especially close to her, but they recognised her ability and did not want to form a government without a woman in one of the top jobs. Six years later, as May sacked him, Osborne may have reflected that their earlier decision did not turn out quite as planned. The Labour whips are expecting a Commons statement on the NHS winter crisis - although they don’t know who will deliver it. These are from my colleague Heather Stewart. This is from the Sun’s Harry Cole. On the Today programme this morning George Freeman, the Tory MP who until November headed May’s policy unit, called for a significant “freshening and sharpening of the team”to promote younger talent. “I’m encouraging her to be bold,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. “I think the country will reward and enjoy a prime minister determined the make Brexit a moment of inspiring renewal for the next generation.” More widely, Freeman said, May should oversee “a big shakeup of Conservative headquarters”. He said: Politics is changing. I think this election showed that our party structure is not fit for winning modern elections. We don’t just need to repair it, I think we need to be really bold and set out what a 21st century Conservative party looks like. Sky News doorstepped Justine Greening, who is expected to lose her post as education secretary, as she left her home this morning. Greening said good morning to the reporter but after that ignored repeated questions about whether she expected to be in her post by the end of the day as she got into her car. Sky has also broadast some footage of Chris Grayling, the transport secretary, leaving home. He sounded a bit more cheerful about his prospects and was smiling. Asked if he expected to keep his job, he said these things were always in the gift of the prime minister. On the Today programme Tim Shipman, the Sunday Times political editor, has just said that ministers facing the sack will be summoned to Downing Street where they will have to walk past the cameras before they go through the door. This hasn’t happened for a while; in recent years, to avoid publicly humiliating the reshuffle losers, prime ministers have tended to meet people they are sacking (when they do meet them face to face) in their office in the Commons, where MPs can come and go without reporters seeing. Shipman also said there would be an extensive shake-up at Conservative HQ, going well beyond the appointment of a new party chairman. These are from the Times’ Matt Chorley. (I think he means stiff - unless he is talking about a cocktail.) Michael Howard, the former Conservative leader, told the Today programme this morning that he hoped Theresa May would use the reshuffle to promote new talent in the Conservative party. He said: The challenge facing the prime minister today, what she will want to do is to give fresh impetus to the government and there is an array of talent on the back benches, and in junior ministerial position ... There really is, particularly but not exclusively those who have entered parliament relatively recently and I hope and I believe that the prime minister will seize this opportunity to give some of those people a chance to show what they can do. We’ve got a cabinet reshuffle today. Here’s our overnight preview. And here is my colleague Anushka Asthana’s analysis. We expected the first announcements to start coming at around lunchtime. I will be focusing on the reshuffle, but I will be keeping an eye on the other politics too. Here is the agenda for the day. 10am: Nigel Farage, the former Ukip leader, is meeting Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, in Brussels. 2.30pm: Amber Rudd, the home secretary, takes questions in the Commons. 3.30pm: MPs start debating the second reading of the taxation (cross-border trade) bill.

Even a month later my voice still sometimes cracks and trembles when I say it. Tears well and burst behind my sunnies, streak my cheeks as I survey the surviving dog at the end of the lead and judge her inferior to the one we euthanised. It’s not fair. Grief takes no prisoners. And this is grief. Perhaps not quite the same as I’ve felt when family and friends have died. But it’s grief, raw and visceral, nonetheless. I pinch myself, start the internal discussion that goes, “She was just a dog – don’t be so pathetic ... ,” and resolve to move on. But something – an abandoned, chewed-up ball on the beach down the road, the other dog sniffing the house and garden for her, the limp collar on the hook by the front door next to the redundant ball thrower (she would chase for hours; inferior dog neither fetches nor swims) – always reminds me of Nari. I’ve never quite known what it was about Nari. I’ve had dogs for much of my life, including the dachshund Mandy (apparently you get your porn star name from both your first dog and street, so I’m Mandy Lockhart), a sweet, awkward girl who had to negotiate steps backwards and who’d waddle faithfully after us, and Georgie, the stray alpha male fox terrier who’d climb the fig tree in my parents’ backyard, shimmy across the neighbours’ shed roof and jump nine feet, like a cat, onto the grass below to escape. But Nari found another league in my heart. Never an easy dog or a classic beauty (she was barrel chested and her black coat tended to tawny), she pulled on the lead until her last days and when we lived in Canberra she’d occasionally open the back gate and slip up to the nearby reserve, Red Hill, where, intoxicated by the scent of foxes, hares and the giant eastern grey kangaroos, she’d run and sniff and delight in all the things that dogs and humans should love about the Australian bush. She’d return, always, when she’d had enough. One, two, three big walks a day were never enough. As soon as we’d get home from the last she’d run backwards and forwards wanting another. She rippled with muscle (unusual for a labrador, a breed prone to obesity), inhaled her food, had no interest in possums (black as night, surviving labrador Ronda is a threat to marsupials and birds) and she eschewed the backyard kennel, even on those minus-six Canberra nights, for the hole she’d dig in the garden. She hated inside. She loved the human touch but was too hyperactive, too sensitive to noise and the notion of being trapped by walls, to be a couch snuggler. She grew up with my daughter, three when Nari, already named (she was first in the “N” litter) came to us as a rejected sniffer trainee from the detector dog unit of the Australian Customs Service. They told me she was clever – and she was. But they couldn’t break her in to a life of escalators, shipping containers and airport luggage carousels. Her hazel eyes sparkled – with intelligence and love, energy and unbridled enthusiasm for every damn moment of every thing in the outside world. There was something else, too. It was a kindness that translated variously, including into an instinctive lick of my hand, a wag of the tail and a nudge of my leg on days when human life seemed shithouse to me, when I’d curse the keyboard and damn the filthy weather. We’d walk for miles in the cold or heat. That always made things better. The transaction was simple. Food and a little shelter was all she required. It never felt like enough. That’s why Nari’s eyes always made me want to be a better person, to give more of myself to her and her other humans, and to surrender myself more blithely to the simple joys of the earth. Her love seemed to come without caveat or demand. She kissed babies and trod lightly around bare human feet. She’d growl territorially when strangers, sometimes with bad intent, wandered onto our property. When I’d say, “Who are you kidding? You’re just a labrador”, she’d look at me quizzically, with a tilt of the head and bared teeth that I’m tempted to anthropomorphise into a knowing smile. She never demanded affection. Even when Ronda, another failed sniffer, came along seven years later, she’d walk away when the ravishing new girl thieved all canine oxygen from any occasion. Ronda, a shiny raven-haired beauty who crosses her front paws and makes eyes at strangers, is something of “a piece of work”. On occasions when I was patting Nari (always the alpha of the duo) Ronda would snatch my hand in her mouth and pull it away from the older dog. While she’d never bite a person or a dog, it was a bad habit we were working on, though one that’s disappeared, of course, with Nari’s death. Nari settled me in to Sydney, choosing on the nearby off-lead beach the dogs whose owners I’d become friendly with. Swimming daily in the harbour was bliss for her and no less for us as we watched her venture out to where the shark-phobics feared to paddle. As her health deteriorated on a rollercoaster of ups and down, I pondered the mystery of man-dog emotional alchemy. This coincided with my re-reading of the research for an early book I wrote which included first person accounts of the enduring, sometimes lifelong, trauma of battle-hardened Australian light horsemen who left their animals behind in the Middle East at war’s end. Love is love, I thought, and I wept at the prospect of losing her. When the moment came, Nari was blind and lame. My daughter cradled Nari as the green fluid coursed into her. I patted her silky ear and said “good girl” for the last time. She wagged her tail at my voice, exhaled. She’d dug her hole under the big gumtree in our yard a week or two earlier. I should’ve known then she was on the way out. But, unthinking, I chided her because we’d just planted something there. And as we buried her ashes there in the grave she’d dug for herself and screwed her metal name tag to the trunk, I realised what the legacy of our alchemy must be. I’ll have to learn to love her survivor."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/jan/09/finally-gay-couples-ceremonies-officially-mark-dawning-of-marriage-equality","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-08T17:00:16Z","webTitle":"Gay couples' weddings officially mark dawning of Australian marriage equality","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/jan/09/finally-gay-couples-ceremonies-officially-mark-dawning-of-marriage-equality","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/jan/09/finally-gay-couples-ceremonies-officially-mark-dawning-of-marriage-equality","fields":{"headline":"Gay couples' weddings officially mark dawning of Australian marriage equality","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"If practice makes perfect, the wedding of Ron van Houwelingen and Antony McManus on Tuesday should go off without a hitch. The couple have committed to each other in 16 unofficial wedding ceremonies, but this will be the first legal marriage, and one of the first in Australia since marriage equality was legalised in December. Although a few gay weddings have occurred with special dispensation, the 30-day waiting period to marry after lodging official notice means most same-sex couples have had to wait until 9 January to tie the knot. Van Houwelingen and McManus met 30 years ago while studying performing arts at Prahran Tafe in Melbourne. The wedding will be held where they met, at the David Williamson Theatre, now part of Melbourne Polytechnic. “Our first wedding was on our sixth anniversary, that was a big deal with family and friends,” Van Houwelingen said. “Most of the others have been more protests – we’ve renewed our vows at rallies, married on TV and on radio. They’ve been a statement in the fight for marriage equality.” Marriage “feels very different” this time round, he said. “We’ve had 16 ceremonies – it’s the first legal one though!” Both worked with Equal Love, a campaign group that has organised demonstrations in favour of marriage equality, for eight years and always planned to officially marry as soon as it was legal. The couple have invited 120 guests, but Van Houwelingen won’t give away the secret of their special vows except to say that their celebrant, Coral Teague, has forbade them from recycling lines from the earlier ceremonies. And how does it feel to be among the first? “It feels amazing,” Van Houwelingen said. “We’ve been involved in the fight for so long - it’s an important message that we’ve finally achieved some sort of equality.” They won’t be the first to marry on Tuesday. One of the first ceremonies took place overnight near Tweed Heads, where athletes Craig Burns and Luke Sullivan timed their proceedings so the marriage would become official minutes after midnight. Three hours behind in Perth, Gillian Brady and Lisa Goldsmith married at The Court. A Melbourne wedding business, the Altar Electric, helped Teegan Daly and Mahatia Minniecon marry at midnight. They were engaged in 2015 and held a commitment ceremony in 2016. Daly said they already consider themselves married, so it’s another case of the law catching up with LGBTI relationships. “We decided to have a commitment ceremony and called it our wedding,” she said. “We got sick of waiting. We wanted to be able to have the wedding with the dresses, the fairy tale. “We felt like it was never going to happen, so we went ahead and did it ... we actually can’t believe only a year later and it’s actually happened!” The couple have invited 40 guests but the wedding is open to the public, so it could be a big one. “To us this isn’t just our wedding – we’ve been married for a year – it’s a celebration for everyone in the community to celebrate a new era, it’s massive, it’s a change for the future,” Daly said. But she said it felt “kind of creepy” being one of the first because both she and Minniecon were usually very private people. “Most of our friends are in very long term relationships, but they’re in no rush. For so long it was never an option, so a lot of people in the community never considered it. “Now that it’s legal, our friends are taking their time. It’s a serious thing, people don’t just say ‘oh it’s legal let’s get married’.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/jan/08/roots-absence-hastens-englands-demise-as-australia-take-series-4-0","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-08T04:59:08Z","webTitle":"Ashes: Joe Root's absence hastens England's demise as Australia take series 4-0","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/jan/08/roots-absence-hastens-englands-demise-as-australia-take-series-4-0","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/jan/08/roots-absence-hastens-englands-demise-as-australia-take-series-4-0","fields":{"headline":"Ashes: Joe Root's absence hastens England's demise as Australia take series 4-0","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"It was all over by 2.15pm – though not quite in the manner anticipated – and the margin of victory reflected Australia’s dominance in the series. Steve Smith’s side won by a monumental innings and 123 runs. To the disappointment of just about everyone at the SCG, Joe Root was unable to resume his innings at the start of play, which greatly reduced the possibility of a compelling rearguard action. Root had played superbly on Sunday evening and was unbeaten on 42. But on Monday morning he was taken to hospital suffering from severe dehydration and diarrhoea. It was assumed that this was a consequence of his being in the field for almost all of Sunday when temperatures in the middle soared as high as 57 degrees, initially trying to marshal England’s flagging attack, then defiantly batting for some pride and the draw. Later, it transpired that Root had a viral gastroenteritis bug and that his illness had noting to do with heat exhaustion, although the temperatures on Sunday could not helped his condition. As a fragile Root was arriving at the ground, Moeen Ali joined Jonny Bairstow at the crease at 10.30am. For an hour they blunted the Australian attack. Moeen was, at least, clear-headed. He was in defensive mode even against his great tormentor Nathan Lyon. The pitch was offering some turn, as it should on the final day, but not much movement for Australia’s triumvirate of quick bowlers. This pair battled away for an hour with Bairstow also in self-denial mode. There had been remarkably few alarms. But after drinks Moeen, inevitably, fell to Lyon in the most predictable manner. He pushed forward defensively; the ball did not turn much and it thudded into the middle of Moeen’s front pad, the classic modern dismissal of a left-hander by an off-spin bowler. Moeen had a quick look at his partner but he knew that a review was pointless and he set off on his forlorn walk back to the pavilion, his last act on a tour where both his batting and bowling has been shredded by the Australians. This was the seventh time in ten innings that Moeen had been dismissed by Lyon in this series. The off-spinner has tormented all of England’s left-handers in this series with the possible exception of Jimmy Anderson. But no-one has been as tormented as Moeen. He is a touch player rather than a technician, and when his confidence is low he has few buttresses left to lean on. The selectors are picking the squad for the two Tests in New Zealand starting at the end of March – with undue haste. We expect to know the squad by Tuesday night. Moeen may well be in it even though the case for him to be dropped for the first time in 49 Tests has never been stronger. A break now might, in fact, prolong his Test career. Eyes swivelled to the pavilion as Moeen made his slow departure. The frail figure making his way to the middle was indeed Root, who would do his best to deliver his Eddie Paynter impersonations (in 1932 in Brisbane the indomitable Lancastrian came off his sickbed to hit a vital 83). He received a warm reception from the crowd plus his usual anthem from the Barmy Army to the tune of “Hey Jude”. Apart from when running between the wickets very gingerly Root did not appear to be too hindered. In fact he middled the ball as regularly as on Sunday night. The two Yorkshiremen made their way sedately to the pavilion for lunch with England hanging on at 144-5 and two of their best players at the crease. But Root would never reappear. The symptoms returned, which meant that Root could not. No-one in the England camp could have battled harder than him throughout the series. But now his body had rebelled. Root’s absence after the break hastened the end as did the bowling of Pat Cummins. Bairstow was soon lbw; Broad fended his second delivery, a bouncer, and the ball ballooned to the keeper; Mason Crane followed in similar fashion. With this surge of wickets Cummins became the leading wicket-taker in the series – with 23 – and history was soon made. This was the first time in a five-match series when there have only been four wicket-takers in the side – even though Mitchell Starc missed the Melbourne Test. As ever, Jimmy Anderson was there at the end. He was given out caught behind against Josh Hazlewood. He would have reviewed the decision by Umpire Dharmasena but England had no reviews left. The local TV coverage did not bother to investigate whether Anderson had hit the ball. In any case, by now only Anderson was in the slightest bit interested. An exhausted Root, meanwhile, was fast asleep in the dressing room. Not quite the climax to the Ashes series that was planned back in England in September."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/jan/08/government-tackles-youth-anxiety-and-depression-with-110m-package","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-08T03:10:42Z","webTitle":"Government tackles youth anxiety and depression with $110m package","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/jan/08/government-tackles-youth-anxiety-and-depression-with-110m-package","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/jan/08/government-tackles-youth-anxiety-and-depression-with-110m-package","fields":{"headline":"Government tackles youth anxiety and depression with $110m package","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The federal government has announced a $110m package targeting youth anxiety and depression, including $46m in funding to a beyondblue program to teach students about good mental health in early learning, primary and secondary schools. Online and phone support services including Kids Helpline and ReachOut will share an extra $1.8m in funding over two years, while $13.5m has been allocated to the Orygen National Centre of Excellence in Youth Mental Health. The executive director of Orygen, psychiatrist Patrick McGorry, said the funding would help to maintain youth mental health services, including Headspace centres throughout Australia. “The announcement shows that the health minister Greg Hunt has been listening to the sector and this funding will mean vital support services for young people can keep going,” McGorry said. “We are very grateful for that support because we need to keep this early intervention going.” But he said only about 60% of young Australians had access to a Headspace centre. The funding announced on Monday would not provide for any new centres, he said. “We need to finish the job of national coverage,” McGorry said. “Headspace centres are just one step towards improving youth mental health. What’s really missing is expert, team-based care that organisations like Orygen provide, and which is in very short supply. “So while a lot of young people get access to help through Headspace, one third of those who go to headspace are too complex for headspace alone, and they become trapped in a bottleneck in the system where they can’t get the specialised care they need.” He said further funding was required to meet complex care needs. The 10-session cap on allied mental health sessions should be lifted, he said, and funding was needed for mobile and home-based interventions. “So Greg Hunt deserves a big tick for this funding today, but it should be seen as funding that is setting the scene for the next wave of reform, and I very much hope he will support that next phase,” McGorry said. The chief executive officer of headspace, Jason Trethowan, told the ABC the funding for school-based programs was particularly welcome. “When students are feeling a little bit down or have issues at home, often they go to a teacher for support,” he said. “We will be there on the front line, working with those school communities to help them work with those young people and families.” Kids Helpline 1800 55 1800 (for young people aged five to 25)."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jan/08/metoo-due-process-televictions","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-08T11:00:08Z","webTitle":"After #MeToo, we can't ditch due process | Shira Scheindlin and Joel Cohen","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jan/08/metoo-due-process-televictions","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/jan/08/metoo-due-process-televictions","fields":{"headline":"After #MeToo, we can't ditch due process","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Rushing to judgment without due process defies core values that Americans hold dear. Everybody should have the opportunity to state their case, whether a victim or an alleged perpetrator. The flip side – quietly sweeping a scandal under the rug – is equally offensive. At a time when improper interactions between men and women, particularly in the workplace, are part of a raucous national conversation, we must find a way to ensure that everyone – the public, private and public institutions, victims and alleged perpetrators – is given a fair shake through a swift and fair process. We must be mindful of transparency, recalling Justice Louis Brandeis’s iconic proclamation that sunlight is the best disinfectant. Of course, sunlight may also cause melanoma! How do we deal with these competing goals and ensure that a mere allegation, without compelling evidence, does not quickly morph into judgment? The public conversation has largely been advanced through the press and social media. Stories have been generated by alleged victims who speak with reporters, or tell their stories to others, who then “go public”. Whether published in mainstream outlets, tabloids or postings on social media, the accounts often go viral. The media may fairly report allegations of wrongdoing. Nonetheless, in many instances – particularly given the number of sensational or ideological outlets – this may not be the case. There will be times where victims are harmed in ways that repeat and reinforce their victimization; there may also be times where false or specious allegations become public, though it is later shown that the alleged perpetrator is innocent of wrongdoing or of the type of misbehavior that has been broadcast. Sexual harassment allegations have reached almost every industry and institution. No one is immune. Recently, the federal judiciary suffered its first public revelation of sexual improprieties by a distinguished appellate judge, who chose to resign before an investigation of the charges. Earlier allegations rocked the political world with the sexual abuse allegations against Roy Moore, the Republican candidate for the Alabama Senate seat. Before that, the media, the entertainment world, academia, cultural institutions (notably opera and art), and – yes – journalism were repeatedly hit with allegations against some of their most high-profile members. In corporate America there has recently been a groundswell of high-profile “televictions” of men accused of workplace harassment. Often this is not wanted by either the victims or the accused. Ideally, an accuser should be able to confidentially bring her allegations to an independent fact-finding body, whose conclusion may or may not become public depending on many factors – including a victim’s desire not to “go public” based on the consequences she may suffer in her career. Yet there may be an overriding need for transparency so that other potential victims are warned of known predators. We are not advocating that findings of wrongdoing be buried. But the views of all involved must be carefully considered. Any investigative process must have integrity and be perceived as such by the victim, the accused and the public. Otherwise, there can be no trust in the process. Lack of trust in an in-house investigation may be one reason some victims tell their story to the press rather than seeking internal redress. Once they do that, they have waived confidentiality. But what about others who may want to come forward privately to address similar actions by the same person? And what about the accused, forced to engage in trial by media – a boon for public relations firms, but often a hindrance to truth-finding. It is a difficult question whether the public’s right to know should outweigh the privacy interests of both the victim and the accused. The critical component for internal investigations is whether they are truly independent. If a corporation – which may ultimately bear civil or potentially criminal liability for the conduct of its harasser/employee – conducts the investigation, even through its general counsel’s office, the investigation may appear to lack integrity, particularly if the accused is cleared of wrongdoing. The integrity of the process must be the sine qua non of any investigation. Further demonstrating the need for an independent investigation is the recent revelation that the United States Department of Justice failed to properly handle sexual harassment complaints within its own ranks. The Department’s inspector general reportedly noted that employees who acted improperly did not receive appropriate punishments. He conceded that complaints had been mishandled and urged “high level” action to address the problem. No organization can be sure that sexual misconduct allegations will not emerge. When they do the organization must be ready to respond decisively. If an investigation is viewed as a “whitewash”, the victim and the public may rightly see the organization as having twice victimized the victim. There can be no worse result for the victim, or the employer, and even the employee who has been exonerated. Even if a company assigns its investigation to outside professionals with a reputation for integrity, the fact remains that the corporation paid for it, with the lingering perception that the outside “experts” did the corporation’s bidding. While there is no perfect solution, proceeding with an outside professional seems the better course of action. Most important, one size simply does not fit all. Investigations need to be tailored to the needs of the particular situation, the perceived bona fides of the complainant, the wishes of the accusers, and the consequences that publishing the findings may have to the commissioning entity. Corporations and other organizations face difficult times in the days ahead due to the wayward acts of some wrongdoers in their midst, or because of accusers who severely misperceived, grossly overstated or even outright lied about acts allegedly committed by the accused. Separating the wheat from the chaff and deciding how to clean house, how to investigate, disclose and deal with the results is a challenge, particularly given the striking events of the last few months.

The New Jim Crow, an award-winning book by Michelle Alexander published in 2010, appears on lists of publications that inmates in state correctional facilities may not possess. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), which obtained the banned book lists in response to a public records request, called for the ban to be lifted and said it violated the rights of inmates under the first amendment to the US constitution. In a letter due to be sent on Monday to Gary Lanigan, New Jersey’s corrections commissioner, the ACLU said the ban was particularly troubling because the state had the country’s widest disparity between white and black incarceration rates. “For the state burdened with this systemic injustice to prohibit prisoners from reading a book about race and mass incarceration is grossly ironic, misguided, and harmful,” Tess Borden, an ACLU staff attorney, said in the letter. Alexander said in an email the ban was in keeping with a widespread denial of civil and human rights to inmates in American prisons. “Those who run our prisons and jails seem determined to keep those who are locked up and locked out as ignorant as possible about the racial, social, and political forces that have turned this country into the most punitive nation on earth,” she said. “There’s no reasonable explanation for this save one: prison officials must fear what would happen if people fully understood how biased and corrupt our so-called justice system actually is.” Under New Jersey regulations, inmates are not allowed to receive publications that threaten prison safety, incite violence or feature details of activities such as bomb-making and lock-picking. Magazines appealing to a “prurient interest in sex” are also barred. It was not clear from the records why Alexander’s book had been judged unsuitable. Also banned were magazines covering hip-hop and black culture such as The Source and XXL. Other banned books included My Infamous Life: The Autobiography of Mobb Deep’s Prodigy; The Last Narco: Inside the Hunt for El Chapo, the World’s Most Wanted Drug Lord, by Malcolm Beith; and true crime titles including In the Minds of Murderers and The World’s Most Evil Psychopaths. A spokesman for the state corrections department did not immediately respond to a request for comment by email. Subtitled “Mass Incarceration in the Age of Colorblindness”, Alexander’s book spent several weeks on US bestseller lists and was hailed as the “secular bible of a new social movement” by the academic Cornel West. It argues that the American criminal justice system amounts to “a contemporary system of racial control”, decades after the abolition of slavery and so-called “Jim Crow” laws that enforced racial segregation. The newly released records, which were not clearly labelled by state authorities, indicated that Alexander’s book was banned at New Jersey State Prison in Trenton and Southern State Correctional Facility in Delmont."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"media/2018/jan/07/bbcs-china-editor-carrie-gracie-resigns-in-protest-over-gender-pay-gap","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-08T04:13:57Z","webTitle":"BBC's China editor resigns in protest over gender pay gap","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/jan/07/bbcs-china-editor-carrie-gracie-resigns-in-protest-over-gender-pay-gap","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2018/jan/07/bbcs-china-editor-carrie-gracie-resigns-in-protest-over-gender-pay-gap","fields":{"headline":"BBC's China editor resigns in protest over gender pay gap","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"One of the most senior journalists at the BBC has resigned from her post because of the gender pay gap at the corporation, accusing it of a “secretive and illegal” pay culture. In a significant escalation of the pay row at the BBC, Carrie Gracie said she was resigning from her position as China editor while accusing the corporation of breaking equality laws and saying she did not trust management to deal with the problem. Gracie said there was a “crisis of trust” at the BBC and that it was “not living up to its stated values of trust, honesty and accountability”. Gracie has worked for the BBC for 30 years and is scheduled to be a co-presenter of the Today programme on Radio 4 on Monday morning. She is widely regarded as one of the BBC’s most talented journalists. Gracie said she wanted to return to her old post in the BBC newsroom “where I expect to be paid equally”. A host of leading BBC presenters, including Clare Balding, Kirsty Wark and Sarah Montague, joined the #IStandWithCarrie hashtag on social media to support her stance. The gender pay row at the BBC erupted last summer when it published a list of its top-earning on-air stars, which revealed that just a third were women and the top seven were all men. This led to more than 40 of its highest-profile female presenters, including Balding, Fiona Bruce and Emily Maitlis, to publicly call for change through a letter to director general Tony Hall. The furore prompted the BBC to review its pay structure, with the corporation finding that men are being paid 9.3% more than women at the broadcaster on average and that nearly 500 employees may be getting paid less than colleagues in a similar role simply because of their gender. However, senior women at the BBC, including Jane Garvey, the presenter of Women’s Hour on Radio 4, openly questioned the validity of the report. In an open letter to BBC licence fee payers, which was first reported by BuzzFeed, Gracie criticised the broadcaster for the gender pay gap and its efforts to eradicate it. “The BBC belongs to you, the licence fee payer. I believe you have a right to know that it is breaking equality law and resisting pressure for a fair and transparent pay structure,” she said. “On pay, the BBC is not living up to its stated values of trust, honesty and accountability. “Salary disclosures the BBC was forced to make six months ago revealed not only unacceptably high pay for top presenters and managers but also an indefensible pay gap between men and women doing equal work. These revelations damaged the trust of BBC staff. For the first time, women saw hard evidence of what they’d long suspected, that they are not being valued equally. “Many have since sought pay equality through internal negotiation but managers still deny there is a problem. This bunker mentality is likely to end in a disastrous legal defeat for the BBC and an exodus of female talent at every level.” Gracie said that over the past four years the BBC has had four international editors – two men and two women – and the men earned at last 50% more than the women. She said the BBC had offered a pay rise but this was “far short” of equality with her male peers and the broadcaster had failed to justify the difference. “The BBC must admit the problem, apologise and set in place an equal, fair and transparent pay structure,” she said. “To avoid wasting your licence fee on an unwinnable court fight against female staff, the BBC should immediately agree to independent arbitration to settle individual cases. “Patience and goodwill are running out. In the six months since July’s revelations, the BBC has attempted a botched solution based on divide and rule. It has offered some women pay ‘revisions’ which do not guarantee equality, while locking down other women in a protracted complaints process.” The BBC’s chief international correspondent, Lyse Doucet, called the letter “brave and brilliant” and Jane Garvey, presenter of BBC’s Woman’s Hour, tweeted: “As we’ve said from the start: we are privileged women. We must use that privilege to ensure equal pay becomes a reality for all.” Sophie Walker, leader of the Women’s Equality party, said Gracie had taken “a courageous stand” and that the BBC should be “ashamed”. She said: “The BBC cynically manipulated its equal pay audit in an attempt to hide its discrimination against women such as Carrie. Carrie has shone a light on the BBC’s treatment of women and highlighted the urgent need for pay legislation that calls dishonest work practices to account. “Equality legislation has consistently failed to stamp out discrimination. It must now be redesigned so businesses cannot hide discriminatory practices.” In response, a BBC spokesperson said: “Fairness in pay is vital. A significant number of organisations have now published their gender pay figures showing that we are performing considerably better than many and are well below the national average. Alongside that, we have already conducted a independent judge-led audit of pay for rank and file staff which showed ‘no systemic discrimination against women’. “A separate report for on-air staff will be published in the not too distant future.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jan/07/the-guardian-view-on-cryptocurrencies-a-greater-fools-gold","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-07T19:02:09Z","webTitle":"The Guardian view on cryptocurrencies: a greater fool’s gold | Editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jan/07/the-guardian-view-on-cryptocurrencies-a-greater-fools-gold","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/jan/07/the-guardian-view-on-cryptocurrencies-a-greater-fools-gold","fields":{"headline":"The Guardian view on cryptocurrencies: a greater fool’s gold","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Last month a plague of kittens brought down one of the most fashionable cryptocurrencies on the internet. This might not have been news, except that the cryptocurrency, Ethereum, bills itself as “the world computer” – a distributed program that can replace large parts of both the legitimate banking system and the legal system itself, since contracts can be written into computer code. Unless, that is, Ethereum becomes the plaything of an imaginary kitten. Like all other cryptocurrencies that have appeared in the wake of bitcoin, and like bitcoin itself, Ethereum is useless as a medium of exchange because the price fluctuates violently and unpredictably. But it turns out to be an excellent medium for the propagation of imaginary kittens and when a small Canadian company introduced a game that let players buy and breed cartoon cats, the resulting popularity brought the whole network briefly to its knees. Had Ethereum been a real currency, this would have been as if the Beanie Baby craze of the last century had crashed the world’s credit card system. But of course Ethereum is not a real currency, and neither is bitcoin; nor are Ripple, Monero, Litecoin, Dogecoin, or any of the other thousands of cryptocurrencies that are the focus of intense speculation today. They are the latest manifestation of the eternal dream that we could, by magic, become really rich really quickly. Why, if only you had bought bitcoin a year ago, they would now be worth 16 or 17 times as much, or, last week, only 13 times as much. What could possibly go wrong? Nonetheless the bubble must one day pop and the fool’s gold vanish, leaving only fools. The central paradox of all these currencies is that we’re told they have eliminated the need for trust between humans and replaced it by mathematical guarantees; but all their tradeable value depends on blind faith and ignorance of computer code. Only last week a Google researcher discovered a hole in some software widely used to store bitcoins which would leak all their contents to any suitably malicious webpage that the owner visited. This had in fact been pointed out to the developers months ago, but they had not bothered to fix it. Flaws in the code of Ethereum led to the theft of $30m in the summer of 2016 and the disappearance of $170m last autumn, though all these sums are entirely notional. Even software built by gigantic, legitimate companies can turn out to have catastrophic bugs in it, as we learned last week from the publication of the Meltdown and Spectre flaws, which between them affect almost all modern computer chips. There is even less reason to trust software developed by small teams of programmers who hope both to become insanely rich and to circumvent all efforts by governments to control them – and that is how all cryptocurrencies have been built. But there is not much use in sober realism here. So long as ordinary people can expect to make their fortunes overnight, they will step up to the gaming table and play – at least while the cryptokittens are away."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"fashion/2018/jan/08/dress-it-black-fashions-response-to-the-post-weinstein","type":"article","sectionId":"fashion","sectionName":"Fashion","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-08T08:31:41Z","webTitle":"A show of power, not fashion: dressing for the post-Weinstein Golden Globes","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2018/jan/08/dress-it-black-fashions-response-to-the-post-weinstein","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/fashion/2018/jan/08/dress-it-black-fashions-response-to-the-post-weinstein","fields":{"headline":"A show of power, not fashion: dressing for the post-Weinstein Golden Globes","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"This Golden Globes red carpet was not a fashion show, but a show of power. The cynics dismissed a black dress code as a lazy form of protest against harassment and gender inequality, but when it happened, many of those watching felt the impact. With an almost airtight blackout and a sea of Time’s Up pins, the images from this year’s ceremony spoke of women in terms of power and solidarity rather than glamour or competition. This was a dazzling kind of blackout. There was Angelina Jolie in feather-trimmed black tulle, arm-in-arm with her teenage son Pax sporting his Time’s Up pin. Reese Witherspoon and Emma Stone stood (bare) shoulder to shoulder with Billie Jean King, founder of the Women’s Tennis Association, whom Stone portrays in Battle of the Sexes. Claire Foy and Mat Smith, stars of The Crown, wore matching tuxedos; Laura Dern, in black Armani, stood with Monica Ramirez, a campaigner who fights sexual violence against farmworkers. This was not so much a silent protest as a multimedia one. Natalie Portman inserted two pointed words – “all-male” – into the list of best director nominees she read out on stage; she also, like many other female attendees, chose to be photographed on the red carpet arm in arm with other women, rather than squired by her husband. Those images of groups of women – Portman with Jessica Chastain, Octavia Spencer and America Ferrara; Eva Longoria clutching Reese Witherspoon with one hand and reaching for Salma Hayek with the other – have a simple visual power which will reach a different demographic than those who stayed up to toast the night’s speeches. Meryl Streep, who planted a red-carpet kiss on Ai-jen Poo, director of the National Domestic Workers Alliance, was one of many who chose to wear black and to bring a female activist as a date. This, along with the “reverse-Handmaiding” effect of the black dresses, applied a Bechdel-test rigour to the notion, apparently revolutionary in Hollywood, that women might have a significance beyond their status as lust objects or trophy wives. Many male attendees swapped their white shirts for black, and thrust their Time’s Up pins eagerly toward every camera. Caleb McLaughlin, 16-year-old star of Stranger Things, looked particularly dapper in a black polo neck under his tux. But this night wasn’t really about them. Most actors chose relatively sober silhouettes. Belted and structured dresses were a theme, while froth and frills were notable by their absence, at least at leadership level among the power players. Exaggerated thigh-high splits and ultra-low necklines were less in evidence. The post-Weinstein fallout has coloured every nuance of life in Hollywood, and red carpet interviewers found themselves gingerly side-stepping the issue of who looked sexy. The unspoken conundrum of this red carpet was whether a glitzily saucy black dress was as in-step with the dress code as, say, Gal Gadot’s tuxedo-inspired Tom Ford gown. There are complexities as to how sexiness can be safely handled. But just as everyone agrees it should still be perfectly possible for two consensual adults who fancy each other in a workplace to find their way to romance, so do we know that it should be quite straightforward for an actor who chooses to wear a sexy dress on the red carpet to do so. It’s just that we haven’t quite figured out how to unpick this stuff, yet. After all, as the aphorism sometimes attributed to Oscar Wilde says, “everything in the world is about sex except sex. Sex is about power.” The designer Prabal Gurung, who dressed Kerry Washington and Issa Rae, told Harper’s Bazaar during the run-up to the event that fashion was “proving it can be an important factor in communicating powerful values and ideals … when future generations look back on this watershed moment, I hope they will realise that fashion served a crucial role in conveying this powerful message, and that fashion is no longer just about beauty and glamour.” As the great Yves Saint Laurent, master of the LBD, put it, “a woman in a black dress is a pencil stroke”. What was written on the red carpet was clear: for the women of Hollywood, business as usual is not an option."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"business/live/2018/jan/08/stock-markets-rally-shares-asia-eurozone-mothercare-profits-warning-business-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-08T19:11:55Z","webTitle":"Stock markets at record levels, but Vauxhall cuts cuts and UK house prices fall - as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2018/jan/08/stock-markets-rally-shares-asia-eurozone-mothercare-profits-warning-business-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/live/2018/jan/08/stock-markets-rally-shares-asia-eurozone-mothercare-profits-warning-business-live","fields":{"headline":"Stock markets at record levels, but Vauxhall cuts cuts and UK house prices fall - as it happened","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Vauxhall says it is cutting jobs at Ellesmere Port so it can move to a single daily production shift. This will “accelerate the recovery of plant productivity”, it argues. Unions, though, say the cuts show the importance of a transition deal that shields the industry from Brexit disruption. Here’s the full story: And that’s all for tonight, GW Here’s Rebecca Long-Bailey MP, Labour’s Shadow Business Secretary, on the loss of a further 250 jobs at Vauxhall’s Ellesmere Port plant: ‘’When PSA Group took over Vauxhall last year the Government promised it would do the utmost to protect workers, but since then a third of jobs at Ellesmere Port have been cut. “The Tories are failing to give businesses and workers the security they need to navigate Brexit, which has been demonstrated again in today’s EEF report on manufacturer’s expectations for 2018. “The Government must set out how it will support the plant and urgently provide certainty for the sector as a whole after Brexit.’’ Hello again. London’t stock market couldn’t close at a fresh record high tonight. The blue-chip index ended the day down 27 points at 7696, a drop of around 0.3%. Europe had a better day, though, with the German DAX and Italian FTSE MIB both up 0.38% and the French CAC close behind. Fiona Cincotta, Senior Market Analyst at City Index, says: The FTSE quickly hit a fresh record high in early trade as the “January Effect” boosted equities. However, the index was unable to maintain the pace and soon drifted into the red, where it spent most of the day. It was a fairly muted start to the trading week; however, volatility is due to pick up given the slew of corporate releases on the calendar going forward. Micro Focus was the standout loser on the FTSE, shedding over 16% after the software maker disappointed investors with the interim update. The shares hit a low of 2116, its lowest level since August last year. Britain’s car industry has just been dealt two pieces of bad news. Firstly, auto group PSA is cutting an extra 250 jobs at its Vauxhall factory at Ellesmere Port, in the North West of England. This takes the total headcount cuts to 750. In a statement, Vauxhall says: “At a meeting held on Thursday 4 January 2018 between representatives from Vauxhall Motors and UNITE the Union, the company explained that although the initial voluntary separation programme at its Ellesmere Port plant announced in October (aligned to adjustment of production volumes in order to protect its future) has been successful, it needs to initiate a further voluntary programme for eligible employees of a further 250 heads in the period from April to the end of September 2018.” The Ellesmere Port, which produces the Vauxhall Astra, has been hit by falling demand. PSA has also warned that Brexit uncertainty will also affect investment decisions. PSA, which also owns Peugeot, says it remains committed to the Ellesmere Port site - but dropped a heavy hint that future improvements are needed. “Vauxhall Management affirmed the company’s continued commitment to the Astra plant at Ellesmere Port. “The company remains confident in the ability of the Ellesmere Port workforce to deliver the necessary improvements in financial performance.” Secondly, rival carmaker Jaguar Landrover has warned that the UK economy is tough. JLR says it achieved record worldwide sales last year, up 7% to 621,109 vehicles, thanks to strong demand in China and the US. Britain, though, is more problematic. Group sales operations director Andy Goss says: “We have once again delivered year-on-year sales increases thanks to a world-class product range and new models such as the E-PACE and Velar, as well as China-specific models such as the XFL. “But we are facing tough times in key markets such as the UK where consumer confidence and diesel taxes will hit us.” Last week, the car industry reported that sales fell by 5.7% last year, with further declines expected in 2018..... Take note, bullish investors. Bloomberg’s Luke Kawa has calculated that several major stock market indices have now surged to levels that suggest they are ‘overbought’. That’s often (but not always) a prelude to a correction. Kawa explains: The S&amp;P 500 Index, MSCI Asia Pacific Index, MSCI World Index, Nikkei 225 Index, and MSCI Emerging Markets Index are all in overbought territory, while the Euro Stoxx 600 Index lingers just shy of such a level. The average reading for this collection of gauges soared to a weekly record as of Jan. 5, according to data compiled by Bloomberg going back to 1988. The relative strength index is a technical indicator that tracks the magnitude and speed of price fluctuations. Typically, a security with an RSI above 70 is considered to be overbought, while those below 30 are viewed as oversold. The New York stock market has opened without major drama. In early trading, the Dow Jones industrial average and the S&amp;P 500 indices have both dipped by 0.1%. In other news... the former executive chairman of auto repair and insurance group AA is bringing legal action over his sacking last year, following a bust-up with a colleague. Bob Mackenzie lost his job - and share options worth millions of pounds - after reportedly starting a ‘physical altercation’ in a hotel bar, which triggered his dismissal. The Press Association has the story: AA has said it is “astonished” over news that ousted chairman Bob Mackenzie is pushing for an employment tribunal hearing after being fired over gross misconduct last summer. The breakdown recovery and car insurance firm may now be forced to defend its decision to sack Mr Mackenzie - a move that was formally announced in August. AA said in a statement: “We are astonished that Mr Mackenzie is taking this to an employment tribunal. “We stand by our decision to dismiss him for gross misconduct following his sustained and violent assault on another employee of the AA, and will robustly defend any action.” Reports have linked his dismissal to an attempted spin-off of the AA’s insurance arm, which led to a physical altercation between Mr Mackenzie and insurance chief Michael Lloyd, as well as an earlier altercation in a public place with someone not thought to be an employee of the company. AA has since called on Mr Mackenzie to pay back more than £1.2m, accounting for annual bonuses stretching from 2016 to 2017. No change at the top of Britain’s finance ministry: It’s been another lively day in the world of crypto-currencies. Bitcoin has tumbled by over 9%, taking its value back down to $14,650. Three weeks ago hit an all-time peak of nearly $20,000 before retracing its steps. But other digital currencies are in vogue, including Ether (the coin behind the Ethereum distributed app platform). The crypto boom has also pushed dogecoin to a fresh record high - even though this particular digital coin was created as a spoof. The FT’s Alice Woodhouse explains: Dogecoin, the cryptocurrency based on an internet meme of a Shiba Inu dog, almost doubled in value over the weekend, bringing its market capitalisation to more than $2bn on Sunday. Launched as a joke digital currency in late 2013 by self-described “data geek” Jackson Palmer, Dogecoin describes itself as the “fun and friendly internet currency”. The digital currency’s recent gains suggest it has been caught up in the recent investor frenzy for cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin. Credit rating agency Fitch has added to the optimistic mood in the markets, by reporting that the outlook for credit is the best in a decade. Fitch reports that the number of likely credit upgrades in 2018 and 2019 outnumbers potential downgrades by the most since 2008. But it also warns that this may be as good as it gets - some companies could find it harder to service their debts once interest rates rise higher. Monica Insoll, a Fitch managing director, explains: “The rating outlook trend is the most upbeat in a decade, with positive outlooks outnumbering negatives. But the net bias is only just over 1% and occurs as the world is about to hit peak growth in the current cycle. The continued tightening of monetary policy, together with significant policy and political uncertainty, is likely to pose increasing challenges to ratings.” The futures market suggests the US stock market will hold onto Friday night’s record highs, when trading begins in an hour. Over in Germany, acting chancellor Angela Merkel has entered coalition talks with the left-leaning Social Democrats. It looks like a final attempt to form a new government, following last autumn’s inconclusive election. Reaching an agreement could be tough; the SPD are likely to demand concessions on issues like welfare spending, tax, and European integration. But optimism that a deal is possible is helping the market today, says Mike van Dulken, head of Research at Accendo Markets: “Equities are off their best levels but maintain a northerly bearing, buoyed by German coalition talks and fresh highs on Wall St, despite mixed Eurozone macro data and commodities off their best levels. A stronger US dollar helps, pushing the British pound and the euro lower, especially the latter to ensure the German DAX outperforms the UK FTSE. US futures point to another positive opening this afternoon. Over in Athens, prime minister Alexis Tsipras has told his first cabinet meeting of the year that Greece is in the “final stretch” of its third bailout programme. Helena Smith reports from Athens The leftist leader told cabinet members that he expected the debt-stricken country, under international surveillance since 2010, to return to international markets after its current economic adjustment program officially expires in August. Sounding an optimistic note, Tsipras described 2018 as a landmark year that would be replete with challenge, adding: “2018 is a milestone year ... a year full of challenges that in order to be met require hard work so that this can also be a year of vindication for the sacrifices of the Greek people.” The third - and penultimate - compliance review of terms agreed in exchange for emergency funding under Greece’s latest bailout was reaching conclusion, the prime minister told his cabinet. When Athens enters “the last chapter” of fiscal adjustment Greece will have closed a “huge circle of supervision which began in May 2010 when the country was excluded from money markets,” he said. A multi-bill outlining almost 100 agreed reforms known as “prior actions” will be submitted to parliament tomorrow ahead of a three-day debate. Leading members of Tsipras’ leftist Syriza party have voiced opposition to some of the more onerous measures, such as electronic auctions of property owners who are indebted to banks. Sterling has made a subdued start to the week, as traders watch Theresa May reshuffle her cabinet. The pound dropped 0.2% to $1.354 against the US dollar, but has risen a little against the euro to €1.13. The cabinet reshuffle could have implications for Brexit; according to the Daily Telegraph, the PM will appoint “a cabinet minister for no-deal”, who will prepare for a Hard Brexit. Royal Bank of Canada say: The UK papers are full with reports of a pending cabinet reshuffle of May’s government. The most interesting development for markets seems the planned creation of a ‘minister for no-deal Brexit’ which should underpin the notion of the UK being in a position to walk away from the negotiations with the EU. The reshuffle is getting up to speed now, with Northern Ireland secretary James Brokenshire resigning on health grounds, and confusion over whether transport secretary Chris Grayling has been moved to become Conservative Party chairman. My colleague Andrew Sparrow has full details in his Politics Live blog: World stock markets are celebrating their best start to a new year since 2010 this morning. European shares are doing their bit, having hit their highest level since August 2015 this morning, after Asia rallied to near-record levels. Traders are encouraged by this morning’s strong consumer confidence and investor sentiment survey, which suggests the eurozone economy is continuing to flourish. Dennis de Jong, managing director at UFX.com, sees no sign of ‘January Blues’ in the markets today: “All the key indicators for December show that confidence amongst investors and consumers is firmly on the rise, which only increases the likelihood of the European Central Bank winding down its quantitative easing programme. “After being in the doldrums for so long, the eurozone has rebounded in spectacular fashion, with investors piling into the euro in their droves. In another piece of encouraging soft data, the European Commission’s economic confidence index has hit its highest level since 2000. The sentiment index has risen to 116, beating forecasts of 114.8, showing that the pick-up in Europe’s economy has raised morale in the region. Just in: Investor optimism across the eurozone has risen, in the latest sign of confidence in the global economy. The monthly survey of investor morale produced by research group Sentix jumped to 32.9, up from December’s 31.1. When asked about the current economic situation, investors were at their most upbeat since 2007. This optimism underlines why stock markets have been rallying recently, as investors react to signs that economic growth is picking. Sentix says: “The economy in all regions of the world is looking stable and positive and is showing moderate improvements.... “The upturn is therefore broad and synchronous. The likelihood of possible overheating is rising.” Jonathan Samuels, CEO of property lender Octane Capital, agrees that UK house prices will be subdued this year. Halifax’s verdict on 2017 is of a flat and uneventful year, restrained by economic uncertainty in the light of Brexit and consumer caution given the high cost of living.” Few would argue with theHalifax’s conclusion that UK price growth is likely to remain pedestrian at best during 2018. “Low single digit growth is about as exciting as it’s going to get, but in reality this is a positive for the market given the affordability crisis in many areas of the country. Jeremy Leaf, north London estate agent, says UK house-buyers are driving harder bargains - so owners need to be ‘realistic’ when setting prices. There is no doubt that prices are softening, particularly in London, but Halifax also confirms what we are seeing on the high street - that a lot of hard bargaining is going on and people are generally trying to get on with their moves. ‘We don’t expect to see any great change in the next few months but the realistic players will succeed, whereas those wedded to the idea of the housing market we have seen in previous years will simply not sell.’ Halifax also reports that house price buyers, and sellers, are in short supply: New buyer enquiries appeared a little more stable over the month having declined sharply in autumn, this measure, however, has now fallen for the last eight months. Turning to supply, new instructions to sell continued to deteriorate at the headline level and has now fallen for 22 consecutive months – the worst sequence for close to eight years. UK house prices fell by 0.6% in December, according to the latest survey from Halifax bank. It’s the first monthly decline since last June, and the latest signal that Britain’s property market is weakening. Halifax also reports that prices only rose by 2.7% during 2017, with the quarterly growth rate slowing to 1.3% in October-December. Russell Galley, Managing Director, Halifax Community Bank, blames economic uncertainty and falling real wages. “As we’d anticipated, the housing market in 2017 followed a similar pattern to the previous year. House price growth slowed, whilst building activity, completed sales and mortgage approvals for house purchase all remained flat. This has been driven by a squeeze on real wage growth and continuing uncertainty over the economy. However, nationally house prices in 2018 are likely to be supported by the ongoing shortage of properties for sale, low levels of housebuilding, high employment and a continuation of low interest rates making mortgage servicing affordable in relative terms. Overall we expect annual price growth to continue in the range of 0-3% at the end 2018.” Here’s some rapid reaction from property analyst Pete Wargent... ..and economist Shaun Richards Britain’s FTSE 100 index has hit a fresh record high today. The blue-chip gauge of the biggest companies listed in London rose to 7733 points, nine points higher than Friday’s record close. But the rally didn’t last long. The Footsie then slipped back, thanks to tech firm Micro Focus which has slumped by 9% after releasing its latest financial results Micro Focus, which merged with Hewlett Packard’s enterprise software arm last year, reported a 9.5% drop in earnings per share, despite am 80% jump in revenues thanks to the HP deal. Ouch! Shares in Mothercare have tumbled by a quarter after this morning’s profit warning. Shares slumped to just 42p at the open before stabilising around 47p, down from 62p on Friday. It looks like a record low. Mothercare has shed around 90% of its value since the start of the decade, and is now worth just £80m. Neil Wilson fo ETX Capital says the company has suffered from its decision not to cut prices in the run-up to Christmas. We should look to management’s decision not to discount in the peak trading season as a significant contributing factor. Admirable perhaps but with competitors slashing prices ahead of Christmas amid (justified) fears of a slowdown in consumer spending, it looks as if the ‘conscious decision’ to remain at full price prior to Christmas but to then discount more heavily in the end of season sale was a mistake. Clearly Mothercare et al are up against it and the update does not bode especially well for the retail sector ahead of an important week of releases. UK mother and baby retailer Mothercare has just become the second high street retailer to hit the City with a profits warning, after a disappointing Christmas. And it looks like a stonker: Mothercare’s UK like-for-like sales shrank by 7.2% in the last 12 weeks over 2017. It even managed to shrink its online sales, by 6.9%. Profits are now expected to shrink to between £1m and £5m this financial year; investors had expected more like £10m. Mothercare blames: ...lower footfall and spend, both in stores and online, following the continuation of consumer trends flagged in our half year results. And worryingly, Mothercare’s CEO Mark Newton-Jones doesn’t expect any improvement in the short-term market conditions for the UK. This follows the profits warning from high-street chain Debenhams last week. Boom! European stocks have opened at their highest level in two and a half years. The Stoxx 600, which tracks the biggest companies in the region, has gained 0.3% in early trading, reaching levels last seen in August 2015. Here’s Reuters take on the stock market rally: Asian shares crept toward all-time peaks on Monday after Wall Street boasted its best start to a year in over a decade, with brisk economic growth and benign inflation proving a potent cocktail for risk appetites. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan added 0.2 percent having climbed 3.1 percent last week, its strongest performance in six months. At 588.55, the index is within spitting distance of its record top of 591.50 hit in November 2007. The Philippines is already at a record, while Australian stocks eked out another decade top. Japan’s Nikkei was closed for a holiday but last week touched its highest since 1992. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Global stock markets remain buoyant this morning, as the bull market shows no signs of running out of steam. Investors remain optimistic about the prospects for growth and corporate earnings this year, putting aside concerns such as Brexit and the Trump presidency. China’s stock market has risen to its highest levels since the second half of November, amid an optimistic session in Asia. Europe is expected to follow suit today too, with Germany’s DAX also tipped to rally. Jasper Lawler, head of research at London Capital Group, says: Shares in Europe look set for a strong open on Monday. The FTSE 100 could buck the trend by opening lower after a record-breaking first week of trading in 2018. Optimism stemming from strength of European and global economy should help the German DAX index open at 7-week highs. The opening strength tracks small gain in Asia, where markets were unperturbed by reports from China that the PBOC think “there is room for an increase in interest rates in the short term”. Last Friday’s underwhelming US jobs report hasn’t punctured the rally. So traders - some of whom have driven the euro up in recent weeks - will be looking at new eurozone investor confidence and retail sales figures today. In the UK, the Halifax bank will report new house price figures - at a time when prices seem to be slowing.

Tandberg spent more than four decades drawing for the Age, winning 11 Walkley awards, including two gold Walkleys. He died on Monday afternoon in St John of God Hospital in Geelong, according to Fairfax. “Much loved Age cartoonist Ron Tandberg has died this afternoon after a battle with cancer,” the Age tweeted on Monday afternoon. Tandberg’s illness was revealed to Age readers just before Christmas, in a piece by the associate editor, Tony Wright, a long-time friend of Tandberg’s. The piece revealed the cartoonist was receiving radiation treatment for oesophageal cancer and was accompanied by a series of drawings where the cartoonist contemplated his mortality, the banality of his treatment, the odds of his recovery and what legacy he might leave. Tandberg was beloved by generations of Melburnians who read his highly astute and deceptively simple cartoons. Each pocket cartoon was just a few simple lines of ink, yet regular readers did not have to look at the signature to immediately recognise a Tandberg. His political cartoons sometimes drew anger from their targets, including the former Victorian premier Jeff Kennett, who turned his back on Tandberg at a public function. The cartoonist was fond of drawing Kennett with a mouth like the entrance to St Kilda’s Luna Park. Tandberg was first published by the Age in 1972, joining the paper after working as an art teacher. The news prompted an outpouring of tributes on social media. A fellow long-time cartoonist at Fairfax, Alan Moir, said he was “shocked and saddened” by Tandberg’s death, describing him as one of Australia’s greatest ever cartoonists. A fellow award-winning Fairfax cartoonist, Cathy Wilcox, tweeted a touching tribute. “If brevity is the soul of wit, then Ron Tandberg was its embodiment,” Wilcox wrote. “Nobody could say so much so succinctly; he never lost his sharpness of humour or the power of his commentary. What a way to leave the world, drawing to the last breath.” The Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, described Tandberg as an “icon”, who would be sorely missed. The Age’s editor, Alex Lavelle, said Tandberg was a “world-class cartoonist and world-class human being”. “I always felt better about the world after a conversation with Ron,” Lavelle told Fairfax Media. “Even during these impossibly hard few months while he was battling this awful disease, he maintained his extraordinary sense of humour and was still drawing a few days ago.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2018/jan/08/what-we-learned-from-golden-globes-lady-bird-three-billboards-the-post","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-08T13:49:55Z","webTitle":"Is Lady Bird this year's Moonlight? 10 things we learned at the Golden Globes","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/jan/08/what-we-learned-from-golden-globes-lady-bird-three-billboards-the-post","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/jan/08/what-we-learned-from-golden-globes-lady-bird-three-billboards-the-post","fields":{"headline":"Is Lady Bird this year's Moonlight? 10 things we learned at the Golden Globes","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Three Billboards is the film to beat at the Oscars With four wins from six nominations, Martin McDonagh’s dark comedy-drama stole the show in the film portion of this year’s awards, and now looks well-placed to triumph when the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences have their own shindig in just under two months’ time. McDonagh’s film, which stars Frances McDormand as a mother seeking justice for the murder of her daughter, certainly seems to have a timeliness that could chime with voters, with resonant subject matter and a strong female lead, though questions have been raised about its iffy racial politics. And, of course, it should be noted that the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, who vote on the Globes, often come up with more eccentric choices than Oscar voters. Still, there’s a sense of momentum building behind the film that’s hard to deny, and in McDormand it has a firecracker of a lead: it would be great to see her give another rousing speech at the Dolby theatre come 4 March. But Lady Bird might just be this year’s Moonlight Last year La La Land dominated the musical/comedy categories at the Golden Globes ... only to lose out on the biggest prize when the Oscars came around. The film that pipped it to best picture – famously, belatedly – was Moonlight, which itself had enjoyed its own quieter success at the Globes, winning best film (drama). If you’re looking for an equivalent this year it’s probably Lady Bird, which took the best film (comedy/musical), as well as a best actress (comedy/musical) gong for Saoirse Ronan. While the chance of lightning striking twice seems slightly slim, there certainly is the same sort of underdog buzz around Lady Bird, and it’s not impossible that the new, younger makeup of Oscars voters could give Greta Gerwig’s film a boost in the same way that they did Barry Jenkins’ drama last year. #MeToo loomed large over proceedings It was nigh-on essential that this year’s Globes confronted the Weinstein-sized elephant in the room, but even given that, the sheer scale of the #MeToo movement at this year’s ceremony was remarkable to witness. From the sea of LBDs and #Time’sUp pins, to the speeches made by Frances McDormand, Oprah and others, it was impossible to miss the statement being made. Crucially, the awards themselves matched the overarching message, with female-fronted fare dominating in both film and TV: alongside wins for Lady Bird and Three Billboards, there were small-screen victories for Big Little Lies, The Handmaid’s Tale and newcomer The Marvelous Mrs Maisel. But there’s still work to do to make Time’s Up a reality For all the positive notes, there were some jarring signs that parity in Hollywood is some way off. In particular, the all-male best director nominees list seems preposterous in the year of Greta Gerwig’s Lady Bird and Dee Rees’ Mudbound, a point hammered home rather brilliantly by Natalie Portman when she was handing out the award. Also, providing withering commentary on the entertainment industry’s gender imbalance was Debra Messing, who flagged up wage inequality at the E! network during an interview with ... the E! network. And, for all the talk of women leading the way at the awards, it should be noted that that largely meant white women: Mary J Blige, Hong Chau and Octavia Spencer lost out in the best supporting actress (musical/comedy) race, while Tiffany Haddish’s absence entirely from that category remains one of the truly baffling omissions of this year’s Globes. That points to a larger diversity problem in the film portion of this year’s Globes: in total, there were just five non-white acting nominees out of 30 in the film categories, and none won. The Oscar best actor/actress race may already be over Being a pre-race favourite is often a disadvantage, but the early action around Gary Oldman (latexed up the wazoo as Winston Churchill) and Frances McDormand (exuding righteous anger in Three Billboards) has coalesced into unstoppable momentum. Sure, James Franco and Saoirse Ronan picked up baubles for their highly likable turns in The Disaster Artist and Lady Bird, but without the Globes’ rather odd category distinction between drama and musical/comedy, there’s little sense that either will trouble the Oscar voters come ballot time. There are others circling, of course: notably Daniel Day-Lewis gunning for his fourth best actor Oscar in the superbly judged Phantom Thread, and Sally Hawkins, who has blown everyone away in The Shape of Water, but the Oldman/McDormand combo is already a juggernaut. What happened to The Post? Steven Spielberg’s impeccably liberal whistleblower drama – and the first major film to be consciously aimed at the Trump presidency – got completely frozen out, despite its six nominations. That may be a harbinger of things to come at the Oscars: perhaps its sense of comfortable familiarity handicapped it in comparison with more outré contenders. That said, Get Out drew a blank, and the much-ballyhooed The Shape of Water failed to meet expectations, scoring two wins (for director Guillermo del Toro and composer Alexandre Desplat) out of seven noms. We’re also a bit sad to see DDL (see above) lose out for Phantom Thread, but maybe the consensus is that he’s already got enough awards; and Willem Dafoe is in the same boat – possibly not enough members of the famously hardworking Hollywood Foreign Press Association got around to seeing the relatively obscure The Florida Project? Seth Meyers confounds negative expectations ... with a little help from his friends It remains the case that Meyers – or indeed any man – probably shouldn’t have been hosting this year’s Globes given the context. In the circumstances, though, the late-night host performed his duties admirably. His opening monologue tackled the abuse scandal head on, and while not all the gags landed – his line about there not being a woman host because none wanted to be “judged by powerful people” in a hotel felt particularly clunky – the overall ratio of laughs to groans landed inarguably on the former side of the scale. Perhaps his smartest decision was to incorporate his Jokes Seth Can’t Tell segment, where two female members of his Late Night writing staff provide the punchlines to gags that he, as a straight white man, can’t deliver. Here his writers were replaced by gay and female members of the audience: Jessica Chastain, Billy Eichner, Issa Rae and former Globes host Amy Poehler, who jokingly took Meyers to task for “mansplaining” the segment to her. It was clever optics – a male host handing over a portion of his monologue time to women – but perhaps most importantly of all, it was very funny. TV’s star power wins over voters – but the Globes still love a newbie At a glance it would be easy to mistake the TV acting categories at this year’s Globes for the film ones. Nicole Kidman, Laura Dern, Ewan McGregor, all walked away with gongs, while Robert De Niro, Michelle Pfeiffer, Jude Law and Maggie Gyllenhaal were some of the big-name nominees to lose out. Clearly the Hollywood Foreign Press Association isn’t immune to the charms of a big name. At the same time, however, the Globes has always loved to beat the rival Emmy awards in coronating a new star, which tallies with the two awards for The Marvelous Mrs Maisel. Oprah wins the night The rather cumbersomely titled Cecil B DeMille award for outstanding contributions to the world of entertainment has become bit of an impressive soapbox in recent years: last year Meryl Streep had a go at Trump’s vile mocking of a disabled reporter, and in 2013 Jodie Foster took the opportunity to officially “come out” . (In a slightly different vein, the 2014 award to Woody Allen was greeted by Ronan Farrow’s revival of sex abuse claims against Allen concerning Mia Farrow’s adopted daughter Dylan.) Oprah Winfrey’s magisterial speech on #MeToo and associated issues followed in the tradition, and predictably saw immediate #Oprah2020 hashtags multiply everywhere. Whether she will actually bid to take on Trump is a discussion for another time, but what is certain is that unlike many others in the entertainment industry she actually possesses the gravitas to stand up to him. Go on, Oprah! Tommy Wiseau gets his moment in the sun ... almost As the director and star of The Room, the film widely regarded as the worst ever made, the chances of Tommy Wiseau ever walking the carpet at the Golden Globes were always slim to absolutely zero. Yet here he was, basking in the limelight afforded him by the success of The Disaster Artist, James Franco’s comedy about the making of his disasterpiece, and seemingly loving every second of it. He even came close to making a speech when Franco won the award for best actor (comedy/musical), only for Franco to cruelly snatch away the microphone at the last second. James: if you do manage a shock win at the Oscars in March, please do give Tommy the limelight – his speech will almost certainly be more interesting than most others on the night."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"sport/blog/2018/jan/08/philadelphia-eagles-nick-foles-nfl-playoffs","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-08T10:00:07Z","webTitle":"Few will be surprised if the NFC's 'best' teams lose next weekend","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2018/jan/08/philadelphia-eagles-nick-foles-nfl-playoffs","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/blog/2018/jan/08/philadelphia-eagles-nick-foles-nfl-playoffs","fields":{"headline":"Few will be surprised if the NFC's 'best' teams lose next weekend","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Over the last 42 years the regular season’s top teams have gone to the playoffs with an expectation of winning their first postseason game. They often don’t, of course, but the people who set sports betting lines have named the No1 seed as favorites every time in their playoff opener. Never have they wavered on this. Their faith in the higher seed has been automatic. But faith never met Nick Foles, the unfortunate replacement for Carson Wentz as the Philadelphia Eagles quarterback in these playoffs. For the first time since the NFL began using team records to set seeding the sports books are picking a No1 seed to lose a first playoff game, naming the Atlanta Falcons as 2.5 point favorites for their divisional round game next Saturday in Philadelphia. This is unfair to Foles whose reputation as a serviceable but uninspiring back-up does not match his career statistics, which are pretty decent (this, remember, is a man who once threw seven touchdowns in a single game). But Foles is not Wentz, who may be the league’s best young quarterback. And since Foles only completed 4-of-11 passes for 39 yards in the handful of minutes he played in his last game (one where the Eagles rested their key players for the coming postseason) there is an impression Philadelphia, who were 13-3 in 2017, are going to be trampled by the Falcons. That perception may be right. Not because of Foles but because of the way Atlanta played in their 26-13 smothering of the Los Angeles Rams in Saturday’s wild card round. The Falcons linebackers and defensive backs swarmed over the Rams’ fleet of top receivers, batting away passes, crashing into LA’s players and in some cases, knocking them down. It was clear they had intimidated Los Angeles and quarterback Jared Goff, just as they must intimidate the Eagles as well. This has been an unusual NFL season, one in which many of the game’s best players went out with season-ending injuries. The rush to build bigger, stronger and faster players has only led to more horrific injuries and probably has contributed as much as anything to lower ratings. Who wants to watch an NFL without Odell Beckham Jr, JJ Watt and Aaron Rodgers? While the Eagles and Minnesota Vikings became the NFC’s top two seeds they finished the year without their starting quarterbacks. Just as it is hard to believe in Foles it’s also an enormous leap to expect Case Keenum, who came into the year with almost as many interceptions as touchdowns before filling in for the injured Sam Bradford, will take the Vikings to the Super Bowl that will be held in their own stadium. Much like the Eagles are underdogs to the Falcons, many will expect Minnesota to lose to the New Orleans Saints. On Sunday, the Saints beat rival Carolina 31-26 as quarterback Drew Brees threw for 376 yards and two touchdowns. Just days from turning 39, Brees is not the same player he once was. – he threw for fewer yards and touchdowns this year than in any of his 12 seasons with the Saints. But he might have been more efficient, and with New Orleans having a more complete attack and an aggressive defense the Saints feel a lot like the team that won the Super Bowl in 2010. The Vikings, while balanced, don’t feel like a championship team. It’s probably unfair to say this but Atlanta and New Orleans probably are on a collision course for the NFC championship game because they have Matt Ryan and Brees while their opponents have Foles and Keenum. But this is the reality of the NFC in the 2018 postseason. The AFC doesn’t have such a dilemma. The AFC’s top two seeds, New England and Pittsburgh, are still led by Tom Brady and Ben Roethlisberger, who have both won Super Bowls. Their presence on the field next weekend against Jacksonville and Tennessee all but guarantee the Pats and Steelers will meet in an AFC championship. This is the state of football today: great quarterbacks usually win in the postseason. Fantasy player of the week Marcus Mariota. When you get credit for both throwing and catching a touchdown pass on the same play you are a fantasy, well … fantasy. In fact, throwing a touchdown to yourself is such a rare feat no one had done it in the postseason before and the last person to do so in a regular season game was Minnesota’s Brad Johnson. That was 20 years ago. Mariota later joked the pass he threw that was batted down and landed in his arms was about being in “the right place at the right time”. It definitely came at the right time for the Titans, who were trailing Kansas City 21-3 in the third quarter and appeared headed to a blowout defeat. Mariota, who struggled with injuries and inconsistency for much of 2017, was fantastic in the second-half of the Titans’ 22-21 victory over the Chiefs on Saturday. He only threw for 205 yards in the game but rushed for another 46, threw a second touchdown pass and even landed a key block for running back Derrick Henry that sealed the game. Henry, with 156 yards and a touchdown, could have been Fantasy Player of the Week himself. Still, Mariota’s two touchdowns on one play make him the obvious pick. It may have saved the job of his coach, Mike Mularkey, who was rumored to be fired if the Titans didn’t win. The dream is likely to be short-lived, however. Tennessee will have to play at New England next Saturday, where coming back from 21-3 seems highly unlikely. Stat of the week 37:35. This is Atlanta’s time of possession in their 26-13 victory over Los Angeles on Saturday night. It’s a remarkable number given the fact the Rams were supposed to have one of the most explosive offenses in these playoffs. But they are still a young team filled with players who had never been in the postseason before. Atlanta, on the other hand, were in the Super Bowl last year. The Rams’ offensive players seemed nervous and the Falcons’ secondary was tremendous, controlling star running back Todd Gurley and keeping LA from making too many big plays. Atlanta probably got away with pass interference in a couple of circumstances that might have made this game closer but the Rams simply looked overwhelmed. Punt returner Pharoh Cooper struggled all night to catch kicks and the wet turf seemed to slow them more than the Falcons players. For a team that promised to light up the scoreboard they disappointed. Then again, that’s what the playoffs do and why it takes a team two or three years to fully adjust to postseason intensity. Los Angeles are too good not to be coming back to the playoffs for years to come. Video of the week You can forgive Tony Khan, the son of Jaguars owner Shahid Khad and the team’s vice president of technology and analysis, for not acting like he’s been part of a playoff win before. He hasn’t. The Jags haven’t been to the postseason since 2007, back when they were owned by Wayne Weaver. Plus, the way Sunday’s game between Buffalo and Jacksonville was going it didn’t seem like anyone would score a touchdown. So when the Jaguars did early in the second half, well Khan was suitably delighted. What’s wrong with a good handclap and double fist pump? The Jags’ touchdown, on a Blake Bortles to Ben Koyack pass, blew open a game dominated by defense and was the deciding score in a 10-3 Jacksonville victory. It might be the last time Khan gets to celebrate in these playoffs. The Jags play at Pittsburgh next Sunday. Given the way they struggled to move the ball against Buffalo – Bortles actually had more rushing yards (88) than passing (87) – there might be little for them to clap about. This is probably why Jags president Tom Coughlin, the franchise’s most successful coach who also won two Super Bowls with the New York Giants, reacted to his team’s lone touchdown with Coughlin-like indifference. As for the Bills, the end of their season may well be remembered for ugly allegations against Richie Incognito. Quote of the week “We had a good chance and it’s gone, it’s over” Kansas City quarterback Alex Smith after the Chiefs 22-21 loss to Tennessee on Saturday. His words were supposedly about a football game but they might have been about something far bigger. The 21-3 halftime lead Kansas City blew will stand as one of the worst playoff losses for a franchise that has had many in the past few decades and it could also be the end of an era. Smith has been a solid if not underappreciated quarterback for the Chiefs the last five seasons, throwing for more than 3,000 in all of them. This past season he actually had more than 4,000. But he has never been able to pull Kansas City to the next level and the Chiefs signaled their intention to move on from him by trading up in the first round of April’s draft to take Texas Tech quarterback Patrick Mahomes II. You don’t pick a quarterback as high as Kansas City took Mahomes without the intention of playing him. It was clear that 2017 was probably Smith’s last as the Chiefs starting quarterback and he played the first half on Saturday as if he was locked in on one last Super Bowl run, throwing for 231 yards and two touchdowns. The problem for him was Tennessee defensive coordinator Dick LeBeau – still as wily as ever at the age of 80 – made halftime adjustments and Smith only threw for 33 yards in the second half. Smith slumped off the field on Saturday and it was easy to imagine it was for the last time with the Chiefs."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/jan/08/craig-mclachlan-steps-aside-rocky-horror-show-sexual-assault-claims","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-08T06:03:40Z","webTitle":"Craig McLachlan steps aside from Rocky Horror Show after sexual assault claims","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/jan/08/craig-mclachlan-steps-aside-rocky-horror-show-sexual-assault-claims","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/jan/08/craig-mclachlan-steps-aside-rocky-horror-show-sexual-assault-claims","fields":{"headline":"Craig McLachlan steps aside from Rocky Horror Show after sexual assault claims","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Craig McLachlan has stepped down from his role in the stage musical Rocky Horror Show in the wake of allegations that he sexually assaulted and bullied female cast members. The 52-year-old Australian actor has denied accusations from former colleagues Erika Heynatz, Christie Whelan Browne and Angela Scundi, published by the ABC and Fairfax on Monday, that he exposed himself to them or sexually assaulted them during their time performing in the Australian stage version of the cult film in 2014. The Rocky Horror Show was remounted for a tour of Adelaide on 28 December , and is scheduled to tour to Brisbane and Perth in the coming months. The Gordon Frost Organisation issued a statement on Monday afternoon saying the company was “shocked” to learn of the allegations against McLachlan and that the two parties have “mutually agreed that it is not appropriate for him to continue in the current production of the show”. “We will be conducting a full internal investigation and will cooperate fully with authorities,” the statement said. The company also sought to clarify reports that it had been told of the allegations but had not acted upon them. “We were not aware of any details of these allegations until they were published in the media today. We received correspondence from a law firm shortly before Christmas however this contained no details of the claims or the claimants. The response from our lawyers was based on this lack of information and was not in any way directed at the women who have come forward and made these allegations,” the company said. Whelan Browne, Scundi and Heynatz say they alerted the production company to McLachlan’s behaviour at the time – with Whelan Browne saying she informed GFO’s managing director John Frost directly of her concerns – but that their complaints went unheeded. McLachlan has described the allegations as “baseless” and “made up”. Victoria police have confirmed they are investigating. McLachlan’s role in the television series The Doctor Blake Mysteries is also under a cloud. A representative from Channel Seven, which airs the show, told Mumbrella it was seeking an “urgent update” from December Media, the producers of the program. Representatives for McLachlan and December Media have been approached for comment.

Eminem came first and then a landslide of Logic, Travis Scott, Migos, Post Malone, Lil Pump, 21 Savage, Gucci Mane and Playboi Carti. Their taste shrunk in breadth, but deepened in intensity. “The twins are into really mopey hip-hop,” I told a friend. “E-mop?” he said. I was sad they didn’t like the music I played them anymore – until I realised it didn’t matter. In a few years their tastes would broaden and I’d have access again. The most important thing was the music bug had bit hard. “During the teenage years, we embrace music at the top of the charts more than at any other time in our lives,” wrote Spotify’s Eliot Van Buskirk. “As we grow older, our taste in music diverges sharply from the mainstream up to age 25.” Crucial albums for me as a kid were compilation cassette tapes including Way To Go 1986, Smash Hits ’87 and Hit Pix ’88. I still have them. When I was 11, I won the lucky door prize at my year six formal: Summer ’89 on vinyl. I had to collect it onstage and I handled it so poorly the record fell out and rolled the length of the room. I’ve never been that embarrassed again. I hope my nephews won’t stop listening to new music at around 33 though. It certainly happened to a lot of my friends – earlier than that. Some were the same people who’d once lead the way for me, musically. When we met up they’d still want to talk about music, but they were spinning their wheels on dusty old ground. Without the exchange of ideas, the fire died. They became like colleagues from a past job. But how do you tell someone you were only friends because of the music? This column wraps up Music You Missed from the final quarter of 2017. If you’re on Spotify, a playlist of the year’s albums is here. HTMLflowers – Chrome Halo Could music’s last taboo be illness and disability? On this blinding debut LP, 27-year-old Melbourne artist Grant Gronewold lights the topic up and holds the fiery ruins high amid a hybrid of trap, R&amp;B and shuddering bass, bookended by Boards of Canada-esque synthesiser. Gronewold has cystic fibrosis and his life expectancy is 35 – but he’s outlived by 26 years the prognosis he was given growing up poor in America, with no healthcare. “There is power in expecting to die young,” he told It’s Nice That in 2015. That power is unleashed in a spectrum of shades ranging from brutal and beautiful, aided in the latter by superstars of the Melbourne R&amp;B scene Oscar Key Sung, Sui Zhen of No Zu and Banoffee. Gronewold’s dark lyrics hit hard because he’s flooding light across a communal blindspot: what it’s like to live with chronic disease. Over a tinny Caribbean loop on Choke Chain, in a voice that’s reedy and insistent, he raps: “They say my body is a curse/Ambulance please bring a nurse but they pulled up in a hearse.” He spares no quarter. Do people sing along at gigs? Do they put their hands in the air? Ela Stiles and Jensen Tjhung – Golden Scapel With a bubbling pot of active projects, this collaboration between Jensen Tjhung (Lower Plenty, Deaf Wish) and Ela Stiles (Songs, Bushwalking, solo) was released with zero ado. Which suits it, completely. Channelling the loose-limbed intensity of Moonpix-era Cat Power, its nine songs were slow-cooked between Sydney beach trips and late nights foolin’ around on an eight track in Melbourne. “Most of the songs are about each other in some way,” says Stiles. Amid a smattering of duos, the two sling lead vocals back and forth and provide harmonies that serve the perfect offhanded justice to each other’s intent. Tjhung’s warm, weary croak is cooled by Stiles’s bare and sombre voice. But it’s when she sings plainly, alone – on White Tiled Room and piano ballad Who Do You Believe – that you find yourself wading thigh-deep through feelings you didn’t see coming. There’s constant, quiet experimentation here, with luscious percussion couching the frayed and rambling Curse, and fractal sprays of folk guitar on Woman Returned. Miss Blanks – Diary Of A Thotaholic Brisbane rapper Miss Blanks (Sian Vandermuelen) is often compared to Nicki Minaj but Missy Elliot is more on point: fine, filthy and also very funny. At gigs, Vandermuelen’s trademark call for women, trans and non-binary folk to come to the front is an overdue example of how inclusivity in music scenes can be fun not hectoring. Such is her sass and charisma. Vandermuelen is all ego, all the time, chest-thumping ceaselessly about her skills on the mic. She uses minimal beats, throws in a classic Erik B &amp; Rakim sample or two, and deals out some boy-band style R&amp;B on the chorus of Worldwide Pussy. It’s hard not to fist-pump in delight when she raps “I got haters to my left/Got haters to my right/I ain’t afraid to slap a hatin’ homie on sight”, because as a trans woman of colour, the stats and stories suggest that too much of Vandermuelen’s existence is in unwelcoming spaces. On stage and on record, at least, she runs the world. But is an earworm like “Skinny bitches in my zone, baby feed them” only body positive for women with meat on their bones? Or is she just righting the scales? Hypergiant – Father Sky The metal bros will love this: my gauge for what constitutes great stoner rock is “how big does it make me feel?”. If a band’s got it, I’m super-sized into fuelled, filled-up vastness, even if just for a molten hot moment. Sydney band Hypergiant size me right up with their debut LP of space-slash-stoner metal and its “we gave it all” quality. When an aspect works, such as the thrash outro on Colossi, they let it ride … until it breaks into the desert metal groove of Island 3, which could be a lost recording from Welcome To Sky Valley by Kyuss. But who isn’t OK with that? Solar Landslide opens with a post-metal climax most bands would finger their way towards for 12 minutes. Influences of Pink Floyd’s early psych and later stadium rock are both here, most obviously in the David Gilmour-esque soloing on Apogee. Julian Moxon’s drums sound actually sweaty – as opposed to tweaked to drum-bot perfection – and it could be conjectured that singer Nathan Lee plants himself some distance from the microphone so he really has to belt it out in a voice of thickness and rasp. Machine Translations – Oh Machine Translations is singer, producer and multi-instrumentalist Greg Walker, and I’ve used up my ration of the word “underrated” on him. Two decades of only occasional albums still add up to a pretty extraordinary back catalogue of nine LPs. Good luck tracking them down, though. Walker wanted Oh to be “lean and mean”, but his stripped-back is far more layered-up than the next guy. Doom Boogie is a song but it aptly describes this record’s flavour, with its aggressive density and percussive piano thuds. He seems to be in a constant quest to unlearn; to make the wrong things right. His experimentation is within strict parameters though – you might not even hear it on a first listen. An odd tuning, perhaps, or a piano that’s plunky and broken; lyrics that don’t deliver the turn of phrase you expect and rarely rhyme. A tart taste prickles the sweeter sounds; something vinegary sours the warm acoustic strum. Instrumental track Spider At The Wheel is the best showcase of this – hammered onto a piano’s exposed strings, perhaps? Your guess is as good as mine. Raven – The night is dark, the night is silent, the night is bright, the night is loud Radiating out from his core instrument – a cello – Raven (Peter Hollo) journeys to meridian points wide and deep in this epic 60-minute album. In addition to his long-running “postfolkrocktronica” program on Sydney’s FBi Radio, Hollo is a fixture in Sydney’s neo-classical and jazz scenes guesting with Lisa Gerrard (Dead Can Dance) and pianist Sophie Hutchings. He plays in experimental jazz band Tangents and string quartet FourPlay. Solo, he adds piano, laptop and a loop pedal to the perambulations of his trusty cell, and the variety of these compositions is pretty incredible, as though a whole cast were involved. It’s seamless, too, best evidenced when fluttering breaks only briefly rupture the tranquil surface of Begin. Parallels are lazy but in this case, it’s illustrious company. There is The Necks on the portentous plucks of Lockstep; The Dirty Three with a dash of Arthur Russell in the rocky, amplified strings of Copra. The song Descent does just that, sending you down into a mongrel of free jazz percussion, icy synth and a room-clearing buzz of power electronics. Untethered, meanwhile, slips under your guard by stitching together the residue of emotion that clings to fading notes. Full Flower Moon Band – Chinatown On discovering Chinatown had an accompanying film (called Chinatown) and an EP from 2014 (also called Chinatown and released as five video clips), I went down the Full Flower Moon Band YouTube rabbit hole. The AV package comes care of creator, singer and guitarist, Kate “Babyshakes” Dillon, who’s teamed up with Gabriella Cohen in the band. Dillon told the website Hhhhappy that Chinatown is a future where “how you spend your time and energy contributes to your line of credit”. Food, shelter and healthcare are assured so artists can practice “without the threat of poverty”. While it’s a tad under-grad, the concept’s whiff of post-Brandis Australia is impressively pungent. There’s a lot to love about the record alone, with its Velvet Underground opiate haze. Babyshakes sure knows how to elevate style over substance and when you embrace that, the album opens up. On Street Love, her vocals swing from deadpan to kittenish in a flash, while Ceremony has the ominous oriental drone of Swans. Lyrics like “He’s got all this space around him, so I can never leave” on Space slice through any lingering pretension."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"football/2018/jan/12/russia-football-british-media-smear-2018-world-cup-propaganda","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-12T19:01:54Z","webTitle":"Russia accuses British media of ‘pumping out’ propaganda against World Cup hosts","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jan/12/russia-football-british-media-smear-2018-world-cup-propaganda","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/jan/12/russia-football-british-media-smear-2018-world-cup-propaganda","fields":{"headline":"Russia accuses British of ‘pumping out’ propaganda against them","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Russia has accused the British media of “conjuring up” government-led propaganda in the leadup to the World Cup. The hosts have stumbled their way towards football’s summer showpiece with Vitaly Mutko, the head of the 2018 World Cup organising committee, recently stepping down after being cited in a series of reports exposing the country’s systematic doping regime. Russia has been fighting its own propaganda war since a report from the Canadian law professor Richard McLaren in July 2016 found the government, security services and sporting authorities colluded to hide widespread doping across “a vast majority” of winter and summer sports. In December, Russia’s Olympic Committee was banned from the Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang and ordered to pay $15m (£11m) in costs after making what the International Olympic Committee called an “unprecedented attack on the integrity of the Olympic Games and sport”. In another public relations disaster, there was also a directive from the Russian Football Union official and former Chelsea player Alexei Smertin that fans would be allowed to fly rainbow flags at the World Cup but supporters must not promote same-sex relationships to minors. However, despite the seemingly overwhelming evidence against the World Cup hosts, Russia has now accused the British media – on behalf of the government – of whipping up stories to “smear” the country. Russia’s foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova said: “We learned that reporters from the United Kingdom – not just one media outlet, but a number of them – received, in the truest sense of the word, a state order to launch a smear campaign for holding the World Cup in Russia.” Zakharova then suggested that journalists were dissuaded from focusing on searching for different news angles because “stories, topics and approaches had been already conjured up”. “Talking points were developed and offered to the UK media to be used in their materials,” she added. “Among these subjects and stories, I can name the following: Russia’s alleged lack of the necessary infrastructure and conditions to hold the championship, the aggressive behaviour of Russian fans, a lack of professionalism among local law enforcement officials and the inability to guarantee foreign tourists’ safety. The western media will be actively pumping out this story in the runup to the World Cup in Russia.” Russia will kick off the World Cup on 14 June against Saudi Arabia at the Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2018/jan/12/watford-southampton-match-preview","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-12T18:46:36Z","webTitle":"Watford v Southampton: match preview","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jan/12/watford-southampton-match-preview","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/jan/12/watford-southampton-match-preview","fields":{"headline":"Watford v Southampton: match preview","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Two points from six games sees Southampton sit bottom of the Premier League form table but Watford are only one point and one place ahead of them.

More than half a million black cars were registered in 2017, overtaking white as the colour of choice for the first time since 2012. Black last returned to the top in the midst of the financial crisis, in 2009, after years of noughties prosperity when shiny silver cars proliferated. Red cars have fallen out of favour, however, as they slipped out of the top five. Pink and mauve are also on the wane, according to figures from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders. An underlying trend appears to be the inexorable rise of grey cars – a phenomenon that experts have said could be attributed to Donald Trump, although the US president has yet to tweet to claim credit. The website of the colour psychology consultant Karen Haller says: “When there is a level of insecurity and uncertainty – as we have seen following the US elections and Brexit – we tend to retreat and gravitate towards things that make us safe, which is why grey is so popular.” Sales of 500,714 grey cars last year were the colour’s highest annual UK figures on record. In the east Midlands, grey is now the most popular colour of all. A primary colour has not made the top three since 2010. Austerity Britain’s appetite for monochrome cars is such that almost 60% are registered in black, grey or white – with silver accounting for another 10%. Green, orange and yellow have all increased their market share, albeit to a cumulative 2.3%. Bronze has re-entered the top 10 at the expense of dull brown, and gold is the fastest growing in popularity. Demand for gold is up 19.1%, although it accounts for only one in 500 cars sold. Other reasons for the reascension of black might be more prosaic: an ever higher proportion of new cars bought in the UK have been purchased for company fleets, such as cab firms. Sales to private customers dipped by nearly 7% in 2017 after years of growth. While drivers of Britain’s most popular car, the Ford Fiesta, still mostly opt for blue, executive cars in the top 10 such as the Mercedes C-class are resolutely black. Mike Hawes, the SMMT’s chief executive, said: “Picking a colour is one of the many exciting decisions to make when specifying a new car, as well as selecting from the cutting-edge safety and comfort tech available on the latest low emission vehicles. Manufacturers are continually investing to bring more choice to car buyers, including more colours and colour combinations than ever before.” • Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/feb/08/france-is-50-years-behind-the-state-scandal-of-french-autism-treatment","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-08T05:00:22Z","webTitle":"'France is 50 years behind': the 'state scandal' of French autism treatment","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/feb/08/france-is-50-years-behind-the-state-scandal-of-french-autism-treatment","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/feb/08/france-is-50-years-behind-the-state-scandal-of-french-autism-treatment","fields":{"headline":"'France is 50 years behind': the 'state scandal' of French autism treatment","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Like thousands of French children whose parents believe they have autism, Rachel’s six-year-old son had been placed by the state in a psychiatric hospital day unit. The team there, of the school of post-Freudian psychoanalysis, did not give a clear-cut diagnosis. Rachel, who lived in a small village outside the alpine city of Grenoble, said she would go elsewhere to assess all three of her children. But the hospital called social services, who threatened to take the children away from her. A consultant psychiatrist said Rachel was fabricating her children’s symptoms for attention, that they were not autistic, and that she wanted them to have autism spectrum disorder in order to make herself look more interesting. Rachel’s children were taken and placed in care homes. The children were subsequently diagnosed with autism and other issues, proving Rachel right. But despite a high-profile court battle in which parents’ groups denounced the “prehistoric vision of autism in France”, Rachel, who herself has Asperger syndrome, has still not won back custody of her children two years later. They remain in care with limited visiting rights. Local authorities insist the decision was correct. “I’m condemned to stand by powerless at the loss of my family,” she wrote after their latest visit to her at Christmas, fearing her children had regressed in care. “I’m destroyed, my children are destroyed.” The “Rachel affair”, entering another courtroom appeal battle this summer, has become a symbol of what parents’ groups call the “state scandal” of the treatment of autistic children in France. The crisis is so acute that the centrist French president Emmanuel Macron has deemed it an urgent “civilisational challenge”, promising a new autism action plan to be announced within weeks. The United Nations stated in its most recent report that autistic children in France “continue to be subjected to widespread violations of their rights”. The French state has been forced to pay hundreds of thousands of euros in damages to families for inadequate care of autistic children in recent years. The UN found that the majority of children with autism do not have access to mainstream education and many “are still offered inefficient psychoanalytical therapies, overmedication and placement in psychiatric hospitals and institutions”. Parents who oppose the institutionalisation of their children “are intimidated and threatened and, in some cases, lose custody of their children”. Autism associations in France complain that autistic adults are shut away in hospitals, children face a lack of diagnosis and there is a persistence with a post-Freudian psychoanalytic approach that focuses not on education but on the autistic child’s unconscious feelings towards the mother. A 2005 law guarantees every child the right to education in a mainstream school, but the Council of Europe has condemned France for not respecting it. Pressure groups estimate that only 20% of autistic children are in school, compared with 70% in England. “France is 50 years behind on autism,” said Sophie Janois, Rachel’s lawyer. Her book, The Autists’ Cause, published this month, sets out to raise the alarm on the abuses of autistic people’s legal rights. “Parents are told: ‘Forget your child, grieve for your child and accept the fact that they will be put in an institution’.” “Underlying this is a cultural problem in France,” Janois says. “France is the last bastion of psychoanalysis. In neighbouring countries, methods in education and behavioural therapies are the norm and psychoanalysis was abandoned a long time ago. In France, psychoanalysis continues to be applied to autistic children and taught in universities.” She said parents were forced to fight a constant administrative battle for their children’s rights. “There are suicides of parents of autistic children … at least five in the last couple of years.”. The row over post-Freudian psychoanalysis and autism in France has been bitter. Eighteen months ago, a group of deputies tried and failed to make parliament ban the use of psychoanalysis in the treatment of autistic children, claiming that the “outdated” view of autism as a child’s unconscious rejection of a cold, so-called “refrigerator” mother was denying children educational support. Psychoanalysts, who have a powerful, leading role in French mental health care, criticised the campaign as “harmful” and defamatory. In 2012, the French health authority stated that psychoanalysis was not recommended as an exclusive treatment method for autistic people because of a lack of consensus on its effectiveness. But most state hospitals still use the methods. In addition, the United Nations warned in 2016 that a technique called “packing” – in which an autistic child is wrapped in cold, wet sheets – amounted to “ill-treatment” but had not been legally banned and was reportedly “still practised” on some children with autism. The then health minister issued a memo advising that the practice should stop. Parents insist that excellent professionals are present in France, but they are few and in high demand, with services patchy and varying by area. “I was told by local authorities: ‘Why are you insisting on school? Put him in an institution,’” said one mother near Tours of her high-functioning autistic seven-year-old who is now doing well academically. “In France, there is an autism of the poor, and the autism of the rich. If I didn’t have money and the skill to fight, my son would have ended up in psychiatric hospital.” Catherine Chavy’s son Adrien is 20 years old. As a small child he was treated part-time at a state psychiatric hospital that used a psychoanalytical approach. His autism went undiagnosed for years. Chavy fought for a diagnosis and entry to primary school, later finding a centre that used educational and behavioural methods, where Adrien flourished. When he reached 15, there were no provisions at all. She privately organised permanent support for him at home. “He cooks, does sport, goes to his grandma’s for lunch. He has a lovely life, going out every day. If I hadn’t have done this on my own, I think he would be in an adult psychiatric hospital, tied up, on medication,” she said. “The situation in France is a health and education scandal.” Pascale Millo set up an association for parents of autistic children in Corsica. She has a 14-year-old son, also called Adrien, with high-functioning autism and dyspraxia. The state put him in a psychiatric hospital day unit for years, but Millo didn’t get a diagnosis until he was nine. Adrien is academically strong but she has had to fight for his right, as someone with dyspraxia, to do all schoolwork on a computer, taking on the training and support herself, never sure whether, from one month to the next, lack of support in the education system will mean his studies are cut short. “In theory, France has everything: state finances, and laws to protect us,” she said. “But those laws are not being respected.” Vincent Dennery, who heads a collective of autism associations, said he hoped for concrete, practical measures in Macron’s autism action plan, and a move from a medicalised approach towards education. “There are still thousands of autistic children in psychiatric hospital day units who have no reason to be there, but their parents can’t find any other solution,” he said. Dennery said he felt society needed to shift. “Culturally, French society has been a place of exclusion. A large number of societies deinstitutionalised disability or difference and moved to include people in ordinary life, but France has not.” • The bottom picture caption was amended on 14 February 2018 to correct Adrien Stranieri’s last name from Straniero."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2018/jan/18/the-best-recent-crime-novels-review-roundup","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-18T14:00:16Z","webTitle":"The best recent crime novels – review roundup","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jan/18/the-best-recent-crime-novels-review-roundup","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/jan/18/the-best-recent-crime-novels-review-roundup","fields":{"headline":"The best recent crime novels – review roundup","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Set in the snowy mountain forests of Oregon, The Child Finder (W&amp;N, £12.99) is the second novel from bestselling American author Rene Denfeld. Naomi, the eponymous investigator, is asked to track down eight-year-old Madison Culver, who disappeared three years earlier during a trip to cut down a Christmas tree and is generally assumed to have frozen to death. Single-minded Naomi – herself once a missing child, now with only vague memories to help her solve the mystery of her origins – is determined to find Madison, come what may. The narrative alternates between Naomi’s search and Madison’s experience of being locked in the cave-like cellar of a remote cabin. Her coping mechanism is to reinvent herself as “the snow girl”, putting herself into a fairytale to deal with the trauma of being wrenched from her family by a predatory stranger she knows only as “B”. Given the subject matter, Denfeld’s lyrical writing can, on occasion, be discomforting, but the sense of physical and psychological isolation is palpable in this moving exploration of loss, hope and human resilience. There is more wilderness in Dark Pines (Point Blank, £12.99) by Will Dean, who has set his debut novel in his adoptive country, Sweden. Journalist Tuva Moodyson has relocated to the isolated town of Gavrik to be near her sick mother. A former city-dweller, she hates the vast forest that surrounds the place, and her sense of otherness is exacerbated by the fact that she is deaf. Work on the local paper is humdrum until the discovery of a body with missing eyes, and a possible link to earlier killings, propels her into an investigation. The suspects, who include a hoarder and two sisters who carve stupendously creepy trolls, are satisfyingly bizarre, and the forest, teeming with all manner of dangerous wildlife, is wonderfully depicted. Memorably atmospheric, with a dogged and engaging protagonist, this is a compelling start to what promises to be an excellent series. The small Scillonian island of Bryher is the setting for Hell Bay by Kate Rhodes (Simon &amp; Schuster, £20), also the first in a projected series. DI Ben Kitto, on leave from the Met after the death of his partner, returns to his childhood home to ponder his future, but his plans for a three-month stint working at Uncle Ray’s boatyard are scuppered when the body of a 16-year-old girl is discovered. Ben volunteers to help find the culprit, who must still be on the island as a two-day storm has prevented any of the inhabitants – all of whom are friends or acquaintances – from leaving. Bryher may be beautiful, but life, largely dependent on fishing and tourism, isn’t easy; although people leave their doors unlocked, they also harbour plenty of secrets. Beautifully written and expertly plotted, this is a masterclass in “closed world” crime fiction. There’s nothing wild or windswept about Sarah Vaughan’s debut crime novel, Anatomy of a Scandal (Simon &amp; Schuster, £12.99), but its glossy, privileged London setting abounds with human predators. Barrister Kate Woodcroft is tasked with prosecuting junior Home Office minister James Whitehouse for raping a young researcher with whom he has recently had an affair. James has been chummy with the prime minister since Eton and belonged to a Bullingdon-type club at Oxford where drunken, drug-fuelled toffs behaved badly at parties; he is handsome, charismatic and a family man. The narrative baton passes between Kate, James and his adoring wife, Sophie. A second storyline is set in the 1990s, featuring Holly, who studied at Oxford at the same time as Sophie, James and future prime minister Tom. While it’s not hard to guess the part Holly plays in the story, this engrossing psych-thriller-cum-courtroom-drama makes some pertinent observations about sex, power and entitlement, and makes for a particularly timely read in the wake of the #MeToo movement. CJ Tudor’s assured debut novel, The Chalk Man (Michael Joseph, £12.99), is a timeslip set in a market town on the south coast of England. In 1986, the narrator Eddie Adams is 12 years old, building dens, riding bikes and communicating in a secret code of chalk figures with his friends Fat Gav, Metal Mickey, Hoppo and Nicky. The fun and games are undercut by disturbing events which culminate in a series of anonymous chalk drawings leading to the discovery of a dismembered girl in the woods. In 2016, Eddie, now 42 and still living in the family home, is a teacher with a drink problem, tormented by lucid dreams and fearing for his mental health.

They say the report, which is not due until September, just days before a Brexit deal is expected to be sealed with the EU, will come too late for businesses desperately trying to plan their futures post-Brexit. “The government’s refusal to publish its findings until two days before the UK’s scheduled departure from the EU could be catastrophic for the continuity of the supply chain,” said James Hookham, deputy chief executive of the Freight Transport Association (FTA), which represents cargo owners ranging from Tesco and John Lewis to Honda. The FTA along with other business leaders is calling for an interim report or the employment data to be released “as soon as possible” to start “an honest debate about how reliant Britain has become on EU workers”. Their concerns echo warnings from businesses that they are already seeing a shortage of EU workers. On Monday it emerged that farmers in the Channel Islands fear that their next crop of Jersey Royal potatoes could be affected by a shortage of Polish workers who have previously harvested them. Around 1,000 foreign workers are needed to pick the potatoes in Jersey each year. The home secretary commissioned the report from the Migration Advisory Commission last summer in the face of fierce industry opposition to a clampdown on immigration post-Brexit. The Recruitment &amp; Employment Confederation (REC) called on the government to grasp “the urgency” of getting the official data on EU citizens into the public domain. “Employers have to look at contingency and the worst case scenario is that companies decide to invest elsewhere or move part of their business out of the country altogether where they will be able to get the workers,” said Tom Hadley, director of policy at REC. The National Farmers’ Union has called for the publication of an interim report. “The more clarity we can get for EU workers coming in and out of the country the better,” said Tom Keen, Brexit adviser at the NFU. He said it was not just important to allow fruit and vegetable farmers to hire seasonal workers, but also to give security to workers who come for a few years and then return home. Hadley described the report “as a bit late in the day” and said he feared immigration policies would prioritise skilled workers, not people working in the fields “picking potatoes or flowers”. Employers ranging from the coffee shop chain Pret a Manger to the NHS have complained they cannot recruit British workers or are losing foreign EU staff because of Brexit. The FTA says logistics is the “lifeblood” of industry and very vulnerable to Brexit. The sector employs 310,000 EU workers, about 12% of the workforce, including 35,000 drivers of vans, forklift trucks and large goods vehicles. “If those EU workers are to be denied access to work as the UK leaves the EU, their employers need to know now so that plans can be made now, not with only two days’ notice,” said Hookham. Pete Taylor, operations director at Encore Personnel Services, said numbers of EU citizens were already declining. Some of the agencies who acted as middlemen for his recruitment in places such as Latvia, Poland and Romania had already gone out of business because of Brexit. He places up to 4,500 unskilled temporary workers a week into car plants in the Midlands, including BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, and into the large logistics warehouses dotted around the motorways. “It is absolutely vital we see this report without delay and see the statistics. It was bad enough before Brexit. Even if we had British workers there wouldn’t be enough of them to meet demand,” said Taylor. • This article was amended on 25 January 2018.

However, if his earlier thinking on the subject was anything to go by, Churchill should have added the rejoinder: women will be allowed to do so only if they are dressed as men. A long-neglected essay by Britain’s wartime leader, written a year before war with Germany was declared and explored in a new book, reveals that Churchill held bizarre views on the role of women in conflict. The essay, published in the monthly Strand Magazine and entitled Women in War, opens with the arresting observation: “The idea of women entering the line of battle and fighting in war is revolting to us. The whole civilisation of the western world is based upon the traditions of chivalry which have come down from medieval times and still exert a potent force.” Invoking the Christian canon and Greek philosophers, Churchill, who was then a backbench MP, suggested there could, however, be exceptions. “We are not revolted particularly by the idea of women fighting disguised as men,” he wrote. And he continues: “Some women are very like men, and a woman disguised as a man does not challenge the principle of women fighting.” Churchill’s comments are light years away from those of the modern British army, which last week launched a new recruitment campaign aimed at reaching people who have historically not been attracted to a military career. General Sir Nick Carter, chief of the general staff, explained: “Our traditional cohort would have been white, male, Caucasian 16 to 25-year-olds, and there are not as many of those around as there once were. Our society is changing, and I think it’s entirely appropriate for us therefore to reach out to a much broader base to get the talent we need to stay in that combat effectiveness.” Professor Richard Toye, head of history at the University of Exeter, and a leading expert on Churchill, came across the essay while researching for a chapter he contributed to a new book, Rethinking Right-Wing Women. “It wasn’t something Churchill was obsessed with making a point,” Toye said. “He rather kept his views about women under his hat.” Rather, Toye suggested, Churchill, who would go on to win the Nobel prize for literature, was doing the bidding of his literary agent, Emery Reves who would suggest topics for the politician to write about. “Churchill didn’t do stuff unless he was being pretty well paid,” Toye said. “Strand Magazine’s ability to pay him what would probably have been several hundred pounds in those days indicates this was a commercially successful magazine.” In his essay, Churchill suggested that even the Germans had “set their faces like flint against using women as fighters. They hold to the broad human principle that the women’s place is in the home and that the male protects her.” But, despite feminist ideas gaining “a great ascendancy” in England, he suggested “the tests of war would very soon show that the stronger sex would have to do the fighting and the weaker the suffering and weeping”. Toye suggested Churchill’s views were relatively unusual for the time. “He was fundamentally fairly sexist but, unlike a lot of other politicians at the time, he didn’t tend to offer generalisations about women’s capacities. He was somebody who was at best a lukewarm supporter of votes for women. He’d resisted the extension of the franchise in 1928 but in spite of that he generally didn’t say ‘we mustn’t give women the vote because their brains aren’t right or they lack physical capacity’, it was more ‘I don’t see that the demand is there, that this will not be beneficial to our party electorally’.” The transformative power of technology was a particular concern, given how it could create a level playing field for the sexes. “The women, at great disadvantage with club or spear, will, it is said, be on equal terms in pressing the button of a machine-gun or in pulling a trigger,” Churchill wrote. But that did not mean women should participate in aerial conflict. “Only at the very last gasp of our life and civilisation should we allow women fight in the air,” Churchill concluded. While the tone of the piece is undoubtedly Churchillian, the extent to which it is all his own work remains opaque. He employed ghostwriters and an army of researchers to help craft his words – words that continue to resonate as the fascination with Churchill, typified by the new film Darkest Hourcorrect starring Gary Oldman, shows no sign of abating. “He’s become the archetype for many people of what is successful political leadership,” Toye said. “He succeeded in rising above party, at least during the war itself -so he can be seen as a non-partisan figure.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"crosswords/2018/jan/15/cell-block-and-pieceword-solutions","type":"article","sectionId":"crosswords","sectionName":"Crosswords","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-15T00:01:40Z","webTitle":"Codeword, Cell block and Pieceword solutions Friday 12 January 2017","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/2018/jan/15/cell-block-and-pieceword-solutions","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/crosswords/2018/jan/15/cell-block-and-pieceword-solutions","fields":{"headline":"Codeword, Cell block and Pieceword solutions Friday 12 January 2017","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"world/2018/jan/12/cypriot-veterans-win-right-to-claim-damages-over-uk-torture-claims","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-12T19:00:52Z","webTitle":"Cypriot veterans win right to claim damages over UK torture claims","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jan/12/cypriot-veterans-win-right-to-claim-damages-over-uk-torture-claims","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jan/12/cypriot-veterans-win-right-to-claim-damages-over-uk-torture-claims","fields":{"headline":"Cypriot veterans win right to claim damages over UK torture claims","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"A high court judge has opened the way for 34 Greek Cypriots to seek damages from Britain, following claims of torture and human rights abuses at the hands of colonial forces during the island’s struggle for independence in the 1950s. Passing judgment at the Royal Courts of Justice, Mr Justice Kerr dismissed the British government’s argument that Cypriot law applied in the case, which would have resulted in the statute of limitations kicking in. “It seems to me that, in this case at any rate, where a state stands to be held to account for acts of violence against its citizens, it should be held to account in its own courts, by its own law and should not escape liability by reference to a colonial law it has itself made,” he said. Lawyers representing former members of Eoka, the Greek Cypriot nationalist guerrilla organisation that fought to end British rule in Cyprus, described the verdict as a significant victory. “It is an extremely important day because this case can, and will, now go full steam to a trial,” said Howard Shelley, for the group. “The claimants will have their day in court.” Under Cypriot law, the alleged crimes would have fallen outside the scope of a statute of limitations, which is much stricter than that in English law. The UK government had raised the legal roadblock – an obscure piece of international private law known as “double actionability” – at a preliminary hearing before Justice Kerr last November in the hope the case would be struck out. “This is a significant victory for the claimants ... who have been fighting for recognition of the torture and human rights abuses committed against them nearly 60 years ago,” said Kevin Conroy, the group’s chief solicitor. “I have no doubt in my mind that the British government brought this preliminary issue up as a deliberate attempt to frustrate the claimants from receiving justice. Many of them still suffer from the physical and psychological injuries inflicted on them at the time.” The judgment was met with jubilation by the Eoka veterans, who turned up at the courts with walking sticks and on the arms of younger relatives. Most were juveniles at the time of the 1955-59 insurgency and now mainly in their eighties. “I feel very strong today, very strongly that after all these years justice finally may come,” Christos Sokratous told the Guardian outside the courts. “There aren’t many more years left. I am 79. For a whole month, they beat me, kicked me, slapped me and hurt me and I only hope they don’t find another argument not to do what is right,” he claimed. “The English are cunning. They are as cunning as wolves.” The plaintiffs, who include two women, filed the class action suit in 2015, two years after the then foreign secretary, William Hague, expressed “sincere regret” for indignities suffered by elderly Kenyans during the Mau Mau revolt against colonial rule in the 1950s and 1960s. In an attempt at redress, the British government paid out nearly £20m in costs and compensation to more than 5,000 victims who had suffered torture and abuse. In this case, the Greek Cypriot group say International Red Cross archives containing eyewitness accounts from officials then working for the organisation provide evidence of their claims. In 2012, the Foreign Office released highly classified documents that shed further light on the Cyprus insurgency, including admissions by colonial-era officers of torture and abuse. In the reports, British soldiers and security services were accused of killing a blind man, telling another Greek Cypriot to dig his own grave and punching a pregnant woman who then miscarried. In one incident in 1958, colonial forces rounded up 300 civilians before beating them and leaving some for dead. One of the women, known as XY, has described how, at the age of 16, she was raped in a forest clearing by British special branch officers before being subjected to days of brutal interrogation for her role in Eoka, then campaigning for union with Greece and considered a terrorist organisation by the British government. Sokratous and other Eoka veterans claim say they were tortured while in custody. “I was 18 at the time,” he recalled. “They kept me in a cell for a week and then they passed me to special branch where it wasn’t soldiers but men in civilian clothes who did the beating. I heard that the English supervisor, the man in charge, died a few years ago. I wanted very much to meet him.” Cyprus’ waning days as a crown colony was a tumultuous time. Eoka, though vastly outmanned, was also brutal. Assassination squads headed by the nationalist militants regularly murdered British soldiers, conducted ambushes and in one case shot the wife of a British sergeant, prompting the London media at the time to dub Ledra street, the main shopping strip in Nicosia, the island’s capital, “murder mile”. Lawyers have not ruled out an out-of-court settlement given Britain’s “need for friends in Europe” in the aftermath of Brexit. “The more the risk of litigation, the more attractive a settlement looks,” said Shelley. “Making an enemy of the Cyprus government by forcing a lot of elderly Cypriots to go to court and relive such trauma might not be the best route to follow at a time when we need as many friends as we can get in Europe.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/jan/15/why-are-the-letters-of-the-alphabet-in-that-order","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-15T11:30:02Z","webTitle":"Why are the letters of the alphabet in that order? | Notes and queries","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jan/15/why-are-the-letters-of-the-alphabet-in-that-order","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jan/15/why-are-the-letters-of-the-alphabet-in-that-order","fields":{"headline":"Why are the letters of the alphabet in that order?","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Why are the letters of the alphabet in that order?

It would be tempting to offer money on the proposition, but pointless; I shan’t be around to collect.” Last was reviewing a new arts programme on LWT called The South Bank Show that featured a certain former Beatle. I don’t know if Richard is around now, but if he is he’s keeping his head down. A TV critic who is still around is the great Clive James, who thought The South Bank Show was on to something and said so in a column back then. And James is here on The South Bank Show 40th Anniversary. “I didn’t guess that you’d got it even better than right; you’d actually picked the popular guy who really was the genius,” he says, about Macca being on Melvyn’s first show. And that sets the tenor for this big-bonanza birthday celebration: you were right … no, you were right … you were better than right … we were right. Melvyn especially was right, about everything. He starts with a little dig at the BBC, whom he was working for before and who couldn’t believe he was leaving for the downmarket London Weekend Television. “But what they offered was a chance to do a full arts programme right across the arts. And what I wanted to do was bring popular culture into a high arts programme.” So that’s what he did. There was TV drama as well as West End drama, musicals as well as opera and dance. “This wasn’t a hierarchy; this was a rainbow and you plucked out the colour that suited,” he says. And here it all is, glorious extended rainbow highlights: Sylvie Guillem and Michael Flatley (with his head in a bucket, perhaps he didn’t feel he should be on The South Bank Show). Francis Ford Coppola on Apocalypse Now, Steven Spielberg, Martin Scorsese, Clint Eastwood and Jack Lemmon, Judi Dench singing, Victoria Wood making people laugh. And Elizabeth Taylor telling Melvyn how, with a mental snap, she can become, say, Martha in Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf? in seconds, then she does it. Then she can snap right back into being plain old Liz Taylor again. You have to agree, it does look very, very right, even if Melvyn does say so himself. Over the years, while the famous Bragg Abrupt Opener (even more pronounced on BBC Radio 4’s In Our Time) may have stayed the same, his lapels, collars and hair grew and shrank according to the decade. To be fair, it wasn’t just Melvyn and Clive who loved it. The artists themselves did, too, and they’re lining up to say so here. The writer and director Amma Asante says it’s the show she watches to see who artists are and what they do. The trumpeter Alison Balsom says she was allowed to stay up late to watch as a kid. Damon Albarn was so incensed about Morrissey’s appearance when he said the Smiths were the last important band that he set out to prove him wrong. For David Puttnam, The South Bank Show proved that the arts – all cultural activity, in fact – were interconnected. “You lined up the dot,” he tells Melvyn. He uses The South Bank Show as material at the six universities he teaches at. Then The South Bank Show moved to Sky Arts and – guess what – that was right as well. It enabled them to do more programmes and be more diverse, and that’s a couple more ticks in the right boxes. No wonder Melvyn is looking pleased about it … Hey, it’s a significant birthday, the big 4-0. He’s allowed to indulge himself a little. Balsom is not the only one with a trumpet round here; Melvyn has brought his own trumpet and he’s going to jolly well blow it. And to say yah-boo-sucks to the BBC and to Richard Last. Actually, Richard deserves to be cut some slack. (I feel sympathy. It’s possible I’ve been wrong about something once or twice myself.) And, still around or not, he hasn’t been proved wrong yet. The 100 years is far from up. I suppose it’s possible that in 2078 people will be asking: Paul McWho?"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"environment/2018/jan/23/satellite-eye-on-earth-november-and-december-2017-in-pictures","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-23T06:00:01Z","webTitle":"Satellite Eye on Earth: November and December 2017 - in pictures","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jan/23/satellite-eye-on-earth-november-and-december-2017-in-pictures","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/jan/23/satellite-eye-on-earth-november-and-december-2017-in-pictures","fields":{"headline":"Satellite Eye on Earth: November and December 2017 - in pictures","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Dust blowing out of the Copper River valley on Alaska’s south coast. The dust plume was likely comprised of fine-grained loess, which was formed as glacial ice moved over the area and ground the underlying rock into a powder. Dust storms in southern Alaska generally occur in late autumn, when river levels are relatively low, snow has not yet fallen, and the layers of dried, loess-rich mud are exposed to the wind. The Copper River - named for ore deposits found upstream - drains an area of more than 24,000 square miles (62,000 square kilometres) and is, by volume of discharge, the 10th largest river in the United States. Its delta forms one of the largest and most productive wetlands on the Pacific Coast of North America. Since 2011, satellite sensors have been collecting data on the brightness of lights — natural and manmade — that shine around the Earth at night. With each orbit, this adds to an ever-growing archive of data that is allowing scientists and geographers to track changes in artificial lights, fishing practices, economic activity, development patterns, the movement of goods and people, and many other research areas in innovative ways and on a global scale. This map offers a few small-scale examples of the sort of changes that can be seen: the map shows where the intensity of light decreased (orange), increased (purple), and stayed the same (white) between 2012 and 2016 in the American midwest. Smoke from California’s wildfires is drawn northward into an approaching storm system off the US Pacific coast on 11 December. The beige-coloured smoke is visible in the lower-centre portion of this image, while the comma-shaped storm system, known as a mid-latitude cyclone, is seen just to the west. Southerly winds ahead of the storm are pushing wildfire smoke several hundred miles northward, parallel to the coastline. Lake Chad sustains people, animals, fishing, irrigation, and economic activity in west-central Africa. But in the past half century, the once-great lake has lost most of its water and now spans less than a tenth of the area it covered in the 1960s. Scientists and resource managers are concerned about the dramatic loss of fresh water that is the lifeblood of more than 30 million people. Extreme swings in Lake Chad’s water levels are not new. The lake has experienced wet and dry periods for thousands of years, according to research. More recently, variations in depth and extent were noted by French explorer Jean Tilho, who reported in 1910 that parts of the lake had dried up. But what is new is the way researchers are studying changes in the lake. The combination of visible and infrared light helps to better differentiate between vegetation (red) and water (blue and slate grey). These photographs were captured by the Corona spy satellite in 1963 and by an astronaut on the International Space Station in 2015. In the South Pacific Ocean, part of Fiji’s largest island, Viti Levu, is fringed with coral reefs. Shaped by volcanic activity and earthquakes, the centre of the island contains forests and a mountain range. The highest peak, Mount Tomanivi, reaches more than 1,320m and is located on the central-right side of the image. While the area east of the mountain range receives heavy rainfall, the west side pictured here is in the “rain shadow”, meaning that the mountains block the rain clouds, leaving this area drier than the east. In addition to the human population of around 600,000, lives one of the largest insect species: the giant Fijian long-horned beetle. The island is the only known home to the beetle, which grows up to about 15cm long – excluding antennae and legs. With more than 300 islands, the Fijian archipelago’s low-lying coastal areas are at risk of sea-level rise – a devastating consequence of climate change. Tropical storm Ockhi brought heavy rain to the west coast of India in early December 2017, stirring up dust plumes and disturbing stagnant, smoggy air in the interior. To the north and west in the image, streams of airborne dust and sand blew out over the Arabian Sea from Pakistan and Iran. The outer bands of Ockhi stretched far to the north, and the system likely strengthened the pressure gradient between the cyclone and a high-pressure system to the north-west, intensifying surface winds until they picked up dust. At the time of the image, sustained winds were estimated to be 50mph (80kph). Ockhi was the strongest cyclone to develop in the Arabian Sea since 2015. It formed near southern India and Sri Lanka on 30 November, moved out over the Arabian Sea, intensified to category three strength on December 2–3, but then weakened quickly as it moved north and closer to land. According to Indian media, the name Ockhi means “eye” in the Bengali language. Before the opening of the Panama Canal, Cape Horn was a place that gave sailors nightmares. The waters off this rocky point, at the southern tip of Chile’s Tierra del Fuego peninsula, pose a perfect storm of hazards. South-west of Cape Horn, the ocean floor rises sharply from 4,020m to 100m within a few kilometres. This sharp difference, combined with the potent westerly winds that swirl around the “furious fifties”, pushes up massive waves. Combined with frigid water temperatures, rocky coastal shoals, and stray icebergs , it is easy to see why the area is known as a graveyard for ships. Kutupalong refugee camp, Bangladesh, is inhabited by Rohingya Muslims fleeing persecution in neighbouring Myanmar, and has become one of the densest refugee populations in the world. More than 655,000 Rohingya people have sought refuge in Bangladesh following the outbreak of violence in Rakhine state in August, joining 200,000 other refugees who had already crossed the border. Satellite images collected in the last 12 months clearly show how huts and tents have overtaken the previously vegetated areas. During October, weak La Niña conditions emerged across most of the central and eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean. The opposite of an El Niño event, La Niña occurs when sea surface temperatures in the central equatorial Pacific are at least 0.5C below average for five consecutive three-month periods. These cooler than normal sea surface temperatures are accompanied by stronger trade winds blowing from east to west, altering weather patterns in the Pacific and around the globe. The coastal waters along China’s Jiangsu province are brown all year round due to the large volume of suspended sediment that flows out from the Yangtze, Yellow, and other rivers. But every winter, an even larger tongue of sediment emerges over the Great Yangtze Bank and extends hundreds of kilometres into the East China Sea. Some remote sensing scientists argue that the plume is a product of currents moving sediment-laden river water eastward from the coast: others say it is caused by tides lifting up sediment deposited hundreds of years ago. Autumnal colours on the flanks of Mt Vesuvius, which sits beside the Gulf of Naples in Campania, Italy. It is best known for the eruption in AD79 that buried the Roman cities of Pompeii and Herculaneum. It has hardly been quiet since then, and is the only volcano to have erupted within the last hundred years. Despite this, it is estimated that 3,000,000 people are living nearby - making it the most densely populated volcanic region in the world City lights of Naples and Campania at night. The Naples region is one of the brightest in the country; roughly 3 million people live in and around this metropolitan area. The different colours of lights in the scene reflect some of the history of development in the area. The green lights are mercury vapour bulbs, an older variety that has been replaced in newer developments by orange sodium bulbs (yellow-orange). To the north-east, the lightless gaps between the homes and businesses are agricultural fields. The bright yellow-orange complex amidst the fields is the CIS emporium, the largest commercial retail facility in Europe. The large black circular area in the photo is Mount Vesuvius. The coastline of the eastern Mediterranean Sea, including the major population centres of Tel Aviv in Israel, Amman in Jordan, and Beirut in Lebanon. Other light clusters include the Nile Delta in Egypt, and a nearby thin string of lights revealing the Suez Canal. The more scattered lights of the Turkish coastline and the country’s mountainous interior arc from top left to top centre. Few lights appear in vast portions of Saudi Arabia (right), Syria (top centre) and Iraq (top right). Images such as this also show the hints of conflict. In Syria, darkness now reigns along a 300km stretch where lights use to line the Euphrates River in the east of the country. Part of Lake Winnipeg in the Canadian province of Manitoba, with Reindeer Island visible in the lower-right part of the image. Smaller islands can be seen along the edges of the image, while the swirling shades of green in the waters is an algal bloom. Although algae grows naturally in the lake, high levels of phosphorus seeping into the water from fertilisers and common household products have caused a steady surge of toxic cyanobacteria, or blue–green algae, posing a threat to ecology and human health. On August 14 2017, more than 1,141 people died and 3,000 people lost their homes in a mudslide near Freetown, Sierra Leone, when a hillside in Regent, a mountainous town 15 miles east of the capital, collapsed in the early hours following heavy rains. Sustained downpours were the immediate trigger for the landslide, but decades of rapid urbanisation in landslide-prone areas, as well as construction along streams where flooding was common, set the stage for the disaster. This pair of images illustrates the extent of the changes: forested areas appear red, urban areas are grey, and landslide debris is tan. In 1986, most of the development was in low-lying, coastal areas. By 2017, development had spread widely into mountainous areas.

At about 3,000 sq km, it is the world’s third largest salt flat as well as one of the largest active sources of lithium. From evaporation ponds like the ones pictured here, lithium bicarbonate is isolated from salt brine. Lithium is used in the manufacturing of batteries, and the increasing demand has significantly increased its value in recent years – especially for the production of electric-car batteries.

Frank Field, the chair of the work and pensions select committee, accused the Financial Conduct Authority of failing to protect steelworkers who were part of the British Steel Pension Scheme (BSPS) amid concerns of a “feeding frenzy” by financial advisers. Tata was forced to offload the £15bn BSPS to pave the way for a 50-50 merger of its European operations with Germany’s ThyssenKrupp to create the second biggest steel producer in Europe after ArcelorMittal. But more than 2,000 steelworkers subsequently transferred out of their final-salary schemes after receiving allegedly unsuitable advice. The FCA is now broadening its probe into the pensions advice given to people leaving final salary-style pension schemes, demanding information from 45 advisory firms. But Field suggested that regulatory action had been too slow, despite considerable warning signals. He said the FCA ordered one financial adviser, Active Wealth, to cease advising on new pension business but the move was “14 months after it first started digging, and just weeks before the original deadline for BSPS members to make a decision on their pension”. He added that while Active Wealth was “already on their radar” the FCA first contacted the firm about pension scheme in November 2017 – two months after BBC investigators presented it with evidence they had uncovered. Active Wealth was one of two financial adviser firms that were called to appear in front of the committee but failed to attend. Information subsequently supplied reveals that Active Wealth handled transfers worth an average of nearly £400,000 for each steel worker, “representing upwards of £40m transferred out of BSPS on their advice alone”. Questions remain over how much the workers paid their advisers, said Field. “The highest and average fees paid to them so far [were] described as £1,500 and £1,443 respectively. The fees seem very small relative to the huge transfer values and it is unclear how many BSPS clients signed up to an ongoing adviser charge or what that might cost them ultimately in total.” Field said: “From their intervention in this affair it seems clear that the FCA’s actions still effectively protect these businesses’ ability to make money out of pension funds, rather than protecting pension savers. They must take care they are not sleepwalking into yet another huge misselling scandal.” A letter sent to Field by Megan Butler, the FCA’s head of supervision, promised to extend an earlier probe of 13 pension advisory firms where the evidence suggested that only half gave suitable advice. The regulator said in a statement: “The Financial Conduct Authority wholly rejects the conclusion of the committee about our actions on BSPS. The FCA strongly believes that we have taken all the appropriate action we can within our remit on this issue.” In its response to the committee, Active Wealth said it had fully complied with regulatory rules and that its “approach has been to act in the best interests of its clients and to provide advice which is tailored to meet the client’s investment objectives”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jan/12/the-guardian-view-on-tunisia-unrest-riots-redux","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-12T18:34:55Z","webTitle":"The Guardian view on Tunisia unrest: riots redux? | Editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jan/12/the-guardian-view-on-tunisia-unrest-riots-redux","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/jan/12/the-guardian-view-on-tunisia-unrest-riots-redux","fields":{"headline":"The Guardian view on Tunisia unrest: riots redux?","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Tunisia is starting to feel a lot like 2011. Then the self-immolation of a street vendor over repression and unemployment sparked an uprising that became the Arab spring, beginning with the fall of the Tunisian strongman Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali. Now, seven years after the dictator’s departure, Tunisians have taken to the streets over an austerity programme and rising prices. At least one demonstrator has been killed and hundreds arrested in sometimes violent confrontations. For some, Tunisia may be too small, too lacking in oil wealth or too lightly populated to warrant much attention. But since 2011 it has eclipsed all other Arab nations in building democratic institutions and adopting a liberal constitution. Civil society won a Nobel peace prize. Tunisia’s gains were not easily achieved; nor are they close to secure. Successive governments have failed to bring about the kind of revival Tunisians hoped for from elective government. The north African economy is lacklustre, unable to create enough jobs and with its foreign exchange earner – tourism – battered by terror attacks. It’s been forced to borrow $2.9bn from the IMF, in return for which unpopular price hikes and spending cuts are being pushed. Since 2011 the achievements have been political: bitter opponents have been reconciled and the Islamist party, Ennahda, mainstreamed. This is no small achievement in a country that for 22 years was a police state. Ennahda’s main goal is to survive. In 2013 it dissolved its ruling coalition in the wake of public anger over security lapses and economic instability – a step that prevented a confrontation with secular opponents. Now it is the secularists who are in charge and face protests. Ennahda, the largest party, has become part of a government playing with fire in the dry tinder of inequalities and graft. In Tunisia the Arab street ousted a dictator. It could also oust democrats."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"football/2018/jan/12/leroy-sane-interview-pep-guardiola-messi-manchester-city","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-12T22:30:41Z","webTitle":"Leroy Sané: ‘Pep told me to play like Messi – with freedom’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jan/12/leroy-sane-interview-pep-guardiola-messi-manchester-city","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/jan/12/leroy-sane-interview-pep-guardiola-messi-manchester-city","fields":{"headline":"Leroy Sané: ‘Pep told me to play like Messi – with freedom’","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Leroy Sané’s welcoming demeanour suggests a young footballer enjoying his stellar rise at Manchester City. There is an intelligence in his eyes and a willingness to discuss anything – including Alexis Sánchez’s possible arrival this month – as he relaxes in a chair at the club’s training complex. Sánchez’s regular berth is on the left of attack, the area from which Sané terrorises defences. Yet there is no concern should the Arsenal forward, the subject of a £20m bid, join City during the transfer window and threaten Sané’s place in the starting XI. “No, it doesn’t worry me personally,” the German says. “He’s a very good player. If he comes to us – I don’t know it will happen – he can help us. No player would say: ‘Oh I hope he doesn’t come.’ Every one of us is playing really well right now and everyone has confidence. But there are so many games – so everyone is going to get games. “If you don’t get challenged, then you can’t find out how good you are. Even if he is better, you can look up to him, learn and try to improve with him. That makes you a better player. Even if someone like that comes in and is in front of you – if he plays more – the target is to get in front of him in the first XI. So it makes you work harder.” City are at Liverpool on Sunday and Jürgen Klopp’s side know how good Sané can be. In September’s reverse fixture he produced one of his finest displays since joining from Schalke for £37m in the summer of 2016. After 57 minutes he replaced Gabriel Jesus. City were 3-0 ahead, Sadio Mané had been sent off for the visitors, and Sané was ruthless in killing off Liverpool, scoring twice to complete a 5-0 win. He says: “I try, like always, to help the team, and to score two goals was very good for the team and for me too.” City’s title challenge is a near-procession 22 matches in. Pep Guardiola’s team hold a 15-point lead over Manchester United and are a further three better off than Liverpool. Yet Sané knows the trip to Anfield will be a battle. “They have a very good team, good strikers,” he says. “[Roberto] Firmino, [Mo] Salah, Mané – quick players. They will look for mistakes from us and try to play counterattacks. That’s why it’s a tough game. It was an equal game at the start of the season because they also had chances to score the first goal. “They didn’t and then Mané was sent off, that was better for us. After we got the goal, we had much more confidence, they had a player less. The coach has also said it will be a tough game; it’s against Liverpool, they’re at Anfield and that’s why we are all looking forward to it.” Klopp is a long-time admirer of Sané. He had hoped to sign his countryman for Liverpool. “Yes, I was also talking with them,” says Sané, who made his senior debut for Schalke in April 2014. “Jürgen was calling me too, talking to me. That was before I joined City. He did a good job at [Borussia] Dortmund – I met him when he was there. He’s a good guy, nice guy – honest. He [has] worked well with Liverpool.” Klopp, who managed Dortmund from 2008 to 2015, wanted Sané to join the German club too. “Yes, there was a time when I was still in the academy that I could have gone there from Schalke but there was no thoughts at all to move to a rival,” he says. “I have no regrets at all. I’m very happy here. I have a lot of friends here, Raheem Sterling, John Stones, Kyle Walker. I really like it – everyone is a really good person, we have fun, a laugh.” City are flying in all four competitions. They are 90 minutes away from the Carabao Cup final at Wembley as they take a 2-1 lead to Bristol City for Tuesday week’s semi-final second leg. There is an FA Cup fourth-round date at the winner of the Cardiff City-Mansfield Town replay. And next month the Champions League challenge is resumed with a last-16 tie against Basel. Sané, who has nine Germany caps, can look forward to an exciting summer at international level too, when Joachim Löw’s team defend the World Cup in Russia. His eyes sparkle when the notion of a clean sweep with club and country is put to him. “I think I’d retire – at 22,” he says and laughs. “One season and four titles with City and then the World Cup – that would be enough. If it happened, it would be an amazing year, but I don’t think it will happen. I hope but I don’t think so.” Sané’s haul of nine goals means he has equalled last term’s tally. He is City’s fastest player and the sight of him burning away from defenders is a joy of watching this Guardiola team. What fascinates most is how good Sané may become. He is a first choice but City’s manager speaks of how much Sané can improve. He agrees. “No player at the beginning of his career knows how good he can be,” he says. “It’s exciting and for me it’s a challenge to see how good I can be, how I can get to the best level. It’s really nice to see how it will go.” Guardiola is harnessing his talent, making Sané a far finer footballer than on arrival. It is a feat the manager has achieved with virtually all of his squad and a key to why City are so dominant. Sané says: “He improves me a lot since day one that I was here. My complete game – how I play, how I have to move, in the space, when I don’t have the ball, when I have the ball. It’s quite impressive how he can help you to improve – it’s very good for the player and for the team. “I played against his Bayern Munich and I could see how they could play. It was amazing; it was not so comfortable to play against them.” Sané struggled initially after joining City until a discussion with Guardiola. “I needed a little time to settle, to know the Premier League, the people here, how they are and to know the players. I had to find my confidence. Pep told me to play with freedom like [Lionel] Messi, not like Messi – it’s impossible,” says Sané, laughing again. “Be free like Messi, have fun, do things like he wants from a striker like the end of the space [near goal] – take the option to shoot or give an assist.” Sané mentions “fun” more than once, and it is refreshing to hear an elite player talk of revelling in his high-pressure existence. “Of course I enjoy it,” he says. “Sometimes you’re so focused that you don’t even think about it. But you get confidence if you play well. When there’s a goal you’re happy, you celebrate. And through these things you feel much more like you’re having fun and so try to do more things, maybe score or make an assist – you feel the fun.” Sané’s sporting parents have been crucial to his mental approach. Souleymane, his father, played for Wattenscheid in the Bundesliga and for Senegal. Regina, his mother, was a gymnastics bronze medallist at the 1984 Olympics for West Germany. “They helped me a lot – they know the different sides of sport,” he says. “They could help me with different issues, special issues which they see similar [to their own experience] and could give me an example. It helped me to solve problems.” But there is nothing troubling Sané and City at the moment. Instead, there is a buzz around the club. “We feel we can win some trophies so it feels special,” he says. “That’s why it’s special when you come to training. The games come around and you want to work hard, win the games. We’ve had a very good season so far. Many things can still happen and we won’t relax at all. To relax in the Premier League is not good.” While taking nothing for granted Sané would love to help City claim the title and then retain it, a feat only United and Chelsea have achieved in the Premier League era. “We always say we want to keep going on – we want to go as far as we can,” he says. “The final of the Carabao Cup, the final of the FA Cup, the Premier League; we want to go through and also to be in Kiev for the Champions League final. “It’s a dream for everyone. That’s why we are all working so hard. It’s very good for the team – everyone wants to win titles and improve.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"us-news/2018/jan/15/trump-voters-one-year-on-panorma-bleak-verdict","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-15T21:00:06Z","webTitle":"The South Bank Show 40th Anniversary review: a punchy celebration of the agenda-setting arts show","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jan/15/trump-voters-one-year-on-panorma-bleak-verdict","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/jan/15/trump-voters-one-year-on-panorma-bleak-verdict","fields":{"headline":"Trump Voters – One Year On review: the president’s people offer a bleak vision of the new America","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Why would a Muslim vote for Donald Trump? Panorama: Trump Voters – One Year On offers an answer to that question and many others by interviewing the people who turned the once far-fetched notion of President Trump into a stark and troubling reality. As the election proved, and as the rise of populism continues to indicate, it is easy to exist within an echo chamber of politically similar views. But it is much more difficult to challenge those views by listening to those who sit on the other side of the fence. This documentary allowed Trump voters not only to explain why they supported him, but to give their opinion on his first year in office, and whether he is delivering on the promises he made to them. In the context of The Fire and the Fury debacle and Trump’s unprecedented racist remarks about “shithole” nations, and a never-ending series of ante-upping transgressions, taking it back to Trump supporters is a necessarily grounding reminder of why this is happening in the first place. At first, it is predictable. Travis, the first supporter we meet, says it as he sees it. He wears a bright red T-shirt emblazoned with the slogan, “I’m not lazy, I just really enjoy doing nothing”, and rails against changes to his community in Lone Star, Texas. He doesn’t like to be told he needs to wear a seatbelt. He thinks corporal punishment at school did him no harm. He believes the notion of Russian collusion in the election is “a witch-hunt” made up by the Democrats or the media or both. He also seems to relish Trump’s lack of what another voter, Stacey, politely calls “decorum”. Stacey is by far the most intriguing character here. A coalminer from Gillette, Wyoming, and usually a Democrat, she voted for Trump to inject life back into the industry that supported her as a single mother. In her assessment, Trump is delivering what he promised, and demand for coal is up. But this personal pact with her conscience has left her shaken, and she is the only one of the interviewees who would not vote for him again. She is baffled that he continues to campaign, having already won. She would like him to be more presidential. “He’s the president so that, therefore, is presidential,” reasons Lynn, a slightly frantic PR from Florida (if you can call that reason). Dotted throughout are sobering statistics from a recent YouGov survey: 83% of Trump voters are not concerned about possible Russian involvement in the election; 92% think he is doing a good job with the economy. Staggeringly, 76% of those who voted for him believe he has the temperament to be president. These results speak to why this documentary is so frustrating, and so bleak. They lay bare the simple fact that, well, facts aren’t what they used to be. As one of the political analysts points out, Trump’s paranoid blustering safeguards him from criticism. If something goes well, he takes the credit; if it fails, he blames the media, or Congress. It is a crude tactic, but effective in shoring up support. At 30 minutes, this was, of course, more character-driven than analytical. For a more far-reaching exploration of similar issues, track down a recent two-part instalment of the This American Life podcast, Our Town, which is an astounding feat of journalism, exploring the effects of immigration over five decades on a small town in Alabama. For those not sufficiently despairing, Active Shooter: America Under Fire (Sky Atlantic) is a deeply distressing examination of the most notorious mass shootings in recent US history, beginning with the attack on a cinema in Aurora, Colorado, in 2012. It allows witnesses to tell their stories and we hear from survivors, police officers, paramedics, nurses and surgeons, many of whom are still shellshocked by what they experienced. Their testimonies are emotional, moving and even funny. At times. Farrah Soudani, who was horribly wounded, breezily declares that she has her own name for her attacker: “Personally, I call the shooter Fuckface.” Caren and Tom Teves lost their son in the shooting. This eloquent couple now campaign for more responsible reporting of such crimes, pressing for guidelines, such as naming the perpetrator only once in an attempt to lessen the glorification of such massacres. Unfortunately, there’s the difficulty: in discussing such horrors in detail, I wonder how much Active Shooter manages to avoid those pitfalls itself. Tragically, this is the first of eight episodes. No doubt there will be plenty more to follow this series, too."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"news/2018/jan/12/corrections-and-clarifications","type":"article","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-12T21:00:39Z","webTitle":"Corrections and clarifications","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/jan/12/corrections-and-clarifications","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/2018/jan/12/corrections-and-clarifications","fields":{"headline":"Corrections and clarifications","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"• A Lost in Showbiz column referred to a 1996 lawsuit against Richard Branson which accused him of sexual harassment, but omitted to say that the allegations were dismissed by a US judge (12 January, page 2, G2). • Readers have been in touch to say that as the green peppercorn and lemongrass coconut broth recipe in last Saturday’s vegan Cook supplement included the use of honey as sweetener, it wasn’t vegan.

A 2-2 draw in Slovenia last October saw Scotland maintain its exceptional record of successfully avoiding the final stages of global competitions. When the World Cup commences in Russia this summer, 20 years will have elapsed since Scotland last competed at the business end of a serious football tournament. An entire generation of Scots now dreams about the World Cup as the Israelites once dreamt of the promised land. Our international millionaire footballers are adept at discovering new ways of body-swerving World Cups and European Championships. Last year, Scotland took it to the wire and were actually less than 90 minutes away from qualifying for Russia 2018 when they took an early lead in Slovenia. That goal was scored by Leigh Griffiths, the nation’s most deadly finisher. Inexplicably though, the Scotland manager chose to omit Griffiths from the crucial early games of the qualifying stage. Thus a fresh way had been discovered to ensure non-qualification. Previous attempts at qualifying had foundered on traditional Scottish failings such as tactical ineptitude, managerial favouritism, rank incompetence and our eternal absence of basic skills. Now we were courageously defying the international footballing convention that dictates you always field your best striker. While our men’s team slipped out of the side door of international football, it was left to our women’s team to remind the nation what a Scottish XI looks like in the final stages of a major tournament. No full-time, professional women’s player exists in Scotland, yet our international team overcame that handicap to qualify for the women’s European Championships that took place in Holland. Although they failed to get much further, they gave a decent account of themselves against nations where well-paid professional women’s football has been established for decades. It was a triumph just to get there. And if recent results by our women’s team are an indication, it looks like they are improving all the time. Scotland’s women ended their European Championship campaign with an excellent 1-0 win over Spain and have opened their World Cup group with two wins out of two. This is a watershed moment for women’s football in Scotland. A lot of hard work, heroic levels of dedication and thousands of unpaid hours have brought women’s football in Scotland to this stage. Scotland as a nation must now decide if it is serious about backing the development of women’s football. In many other countries, notably England, Germany, Scandinavia and the US, professional women’s football is well established and fully supported by the authorities that administer the game in these countries. In Scotland, though, despite the emergence of a well-organised league structure, the attitudes of the almost entirely all-male Scottish Football Association and our senior professional clubs remain unenlightened. In this they are reverting to the traditional Scottish male football authorities’ attitudes to women’s football. Women began playing organised football in Scotland to a high standard in the late 19th century and one of the first recorded women’s internationals took place between Scotland and England in 1881. During the First World War, crowds of up to 50,000 watched women’s football before the SFA ordered a clampdown and outlawed it. A few clubs sought permission to host women’s games but were forbidden to. As the decades passed and other countries began to acknowledge the wide participation of women and girls in football, Uefa, the game’s governing body in Europe, moved to bring women’s football into the fold. In 1971, 31 countries voted to endorse this. Only one nation voted against it: Scotland. That women’s football in Scotland is currently in a state of good health is in spite of Scotland’s medieval attitude towards it. And lest anyone think that the SFA was fostering the men’s game throughout this time, think again. Between 1930 and 1954, the governing body kept Scotland out of the World Cup, a period during which we were producing some of the planet’s finest players. In those early years, Scotland would have had an outstanding chance of winning the trophy. That’s what happens, though, when you permit a bewhiskered assortment of village bowling club presidents and masonic lodge devotees to run your national sport. If the SFA and our most senior clubs, many of whom are happy to take money from their many female followers, are serious about developing women’s football in Scotland they must act as though they mean it. Last week, the chair of Scottish Women’s Football, Vivienne MacLaren, expressed a degree of optimism. “My dream is that in three years the SWPL is at least semi-professional, if not professional,” she said. Scotland’s top clubs are required to fulfil a number of obligations if they want to be members of the elite Scottish Premier League. Among these are all-seater stadiums and heated pitches as well as being financially solvent. The SFA should demand that these clubs employ a set number of full-time women’s professionals as players and coaches to meet the demand of the increasing number of girls seeking to play football. BBC Scotland could help here too. It is struggling to produce original content for the launch of its digital stations later this year. Its coverage of men’s football on radio and television is a national joke. A weekly magazine programme devoted to women’s football and footage of the top matches would inject some much-needed originality into its tired and predictable schedules. The sports desks of our national newspapers could also take the game seriously by sending their main football writers to some of these games and to include interviews with players and managers. Women’s football is free of the sectarianism, violence and drinking culture long associated with men’s football. When the SFA is scrabbling about for sponsors, it ought to be pointing this out and encouraging its commercial partners to support women’s football.

So, a couple of hours after she first felt twinges, cramps and contractions, she and her husband set off for a hospital in central London, but when she arrived, the midwife who examined her told her she wasn’t in labour. “I knew that not to be true,” she says. “I knew I was in labour.” They were told to go home for a few hours; Hines asked if she could stay, but was told she couldn’t unless she wanted to wait in the corridor. Her husband booked them into a nearby hotel to wait it out, and they walked around the corner, with Hines, wearing pyjamas and a coat, steadying herself against the walls of the building with each contraction. It was 7am. “We checked in at the hotel and I was probably there all of about 15 to 20 minutes when I said to my husband, ‘I’m having the baby. This is happening.’ I couldn’t really talk to him, but I could feel this was imminent. He said: ‘No, I’m going to get you [to hospital], we can’t do this here.’” He carried her across the road, and as another contraction came, Hines sat down on the street. “Apparently I let out a huge noise, but I don’t remember that at all. People came over, and I do remember ankles starting to appear around me.” Then, she says, her son Louis “came out, and I remember feeling every limb fly out of my body and on to the floor and into my pyjamas. Someone in the crowd reassured me, saying, ‘Don’t worry, we’re going to get to the hospital, you’re going to be fine’. I said: ‘No, he’s here.’ They opened my pyjamas and saw him red and squirming, attached to me with the umbilical cord. He wasn’t screaming at first. Someone said put him against you so I lifted up my T-shirt and put him against me.” She doesn’t remember much of what happened next, but last month she pieced her son’s birth together after a post she put on Facebook to search for the strangers who helped the family in December 2016 went viral. People have told her that her waters were running down the street, that someone in the crowd had tried to film her giving birth and a fight broke out to stop them. She didn’t even know when Louis was born – she was told it was 7.30am. The temperature was zero degrees. Some people in the crowd who helped her worked at the hospital. Hines and her newborn were taken there, using a wheelchair. She had a few stitches but all was well, and they went home that afternoon. It was, she says, “a wonderful experience. He was healthy, I felt physically and mentally good about it, and I felt really joyful – I think the hormones were a huge part of that.” But, she adds: “There is also the thought that there was a misjudgment there.” It was a straightforward birth. “I feel very fortunate,” she says. “He didn’t have the cord round his neck or any immediate problems.” Michelle Booth had a similar experience in 2013 with the birth of her son George, her first baby, who arrived in a hotel bathroom across the road from the hospital she had been turned away from a few hours earlier. She had been told she wasn’t dilated at all, and to go home. “The really stressful thing about it was I felt I was really on top of it, and then all of a sudden people were telling me I wasn’t in labour. When you haven’t had a baby before you don’t know. It freaked me out – if this wasn’t labour then what was it going to be like?” Nearly three hours later, she called the hospital for advice and to ask if she should come in, but they told her to take a paracetamol. Soon afterwards, she gave birth in the hotel room. Like Hines, she says, it was a “really positive experience”, but she puts that down to being very prepared before the birth, having practised hypnobirthing and reading a lot about the birth process. “I think if I hadn’t done that, and had that experience, it would have been really scary.” She did, however, lose a lot of blood, and she and George were taken to hospital by ambulance quickly afterwards. It was frustrating not to have been listened to, she says. “You’re having an experience and someone is telling you that it isn’t the experience you’re having. If you’ve never had a baby before, you’re reliant on the professionals giving you advice. I suppose what I’ve learned is the whole thing about birth is based on data.” Being turned away in early labour, only to give birth soon afterwards, is “a symptom of something that affects women in maternity care a lot, which is not being listened to,” says Rebecca Schiller, chief executive of the charity Birthrights. “One of the problems we’re keen to address is changing culture in maternity care, so that women’s perceptions, experiences and information about their own bodies, own pregnancies and own labour is taken seriously. It’s something that’s important from a safety point of view. It’s been shown that some women who have had serious problems like stillbirths have reported worries and concerns, turned up to their maternity unit several times and been ignored, and gone to have tragic consequences.” It can also be distressing to be told that you are not in labour when you feel you are, she says. “We know that how women feel giving birth can have an impact on their emotional wellbeing for quite a long time. It’s important for safety, and it’s important for women’s entry into motherhood and how they go on to feel about themselves and their experience of birth that they’re listened to.” For Antonia Kennedy, who lives in the north-east, the birth of her fourth child, Oscar, in December 2016, was distressing. “Once you’ve had three other children, you know when you’re in labour,” she says. “[The midwife] said I was 1cm dilated and I should maybe go shopping – there was a shopping centre not far from the hospital – for a couple of hours.” She asked if she could stay at the hospital, but “they were adamant that I couldn’t. I said I really didn’t want to go back home. I felt ‘thank god we’re here’ but they said they wouldn’t let us stay.” By then, she had been having contractions for a couple of hours, and at the hospital they were so strong, she couldn’t move. Her partner drove them the 15 minutes home, where they stayed for five minutes, before heading back to hospital. She made it through the doors, but gave birth to her son in the hospital lift. Her partner caught him. There were people watching and she says she felt really embarrassed. Since then, she has been plagued by thoughts about what might have happened if her partner had not caught the baby, if he’d hit the floor, and she believes the experience has contributed to the anxiety she has felt since the birth.Labour is unpredictable, acknowledges Schiller. “In my second labour, I went suddenly from not really feeling I was in labour to having a baby 40 minutes later. Sometimes you can’t predict those things and there will be women who give birth very quickly, and won’t be able to make it to a unit in time. But I think if a woman is at a unit and that’s where she feels safe, and she says like she feels like she’s in labour, it’s important that medical professionals don’t just rely on their traditional observations and vaginal examinations. It can be very easy to reduce a woman’s labour to measurements and standards, but we’re individuals and our bodies don’t often play that game.” Early labour should be a time when women can feel safe, and while many women prefer to be at home, for some women, being in hospital might provide more reassurance, particularly if the hospital is not close to home, or an uncomfortable drive away. The Royal College of Midwives declined to comment, but some hospitals have invested in early labour care. At Chelsea and Westminster hospital, they have a room called the Nest, which opened in 2012 and can be used by women in the early stages of labour, before going on to the hospital’s midwifery-led unit, or the labour ward if they choose to. There is low lighting, comfortable seating, such as beanbags, and relaxing music. It is staffed by doulas, who support women at this stage, rather than (expensively) trained midwives. “There isn’t a lot of investment in maternity services at the moment,” says Schiller, but a simple, comfortable room might not be unreasonable to expect. “It’s a vulnerable time,” says Hines. “There is so much care taken by the NHS during pregnancy and after the birth, to such a high level of expertise, but for this splice of time in early labour, for maybe two hours or 10 hours, that doesn’t seem to be considered part of the care.” • Have you had a difficult experience going into labour?

But it taught me about loss","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"On Monday, I buried my mother. Or perhaps I should say that I watched as my brother put the casket of her ashes in the grave. At first, he told me later, the hole for her casket wasn’t big enough. It had cost £575 to dig, but it still wasn’t big enough. Luckily, he’s a gardener and had his tools in the car. He whipped out a spade before I arrived, and cut off an extra strip of earth. And then my mother’s vicar said some words, and my brother said some words, and we all sang “The day thou gavest, Lord, is ended”; and then my brother put the casket in the hole and I said a last goodbye to the human being I have always loved most. Actually, I had said goodbye before. I had said goodbye at the funeral, a year ago, when I stood in front of about 100 people who loved my mother, and talked about her gift for joy. I had said goodbye on the day I arrived at the hospital, after three hours in traffic, and bent to kiss her now-cold cheek. And I had said goodbye three weeks before that, when a patient in a nearby bed yelled, “She’s gone!”, and my brother called and I arrived to find her looking listless, and with eyes half-closed. When I clutched my mother’s hand and told her I loved her, she opened her eyes and smiled. I cried by the grave. Of course I cried by the grave. But then I went to the pub, with my brother and a few of my mother’s oldest friends, and we had a lovely time. All my life my mother’s death has been one of the things I have feared most. But actually, it has been fine. In her new book, With the End in Mind, palliative care consultant Kathryn Mannix describes a conversation that changed her life. It was between a patient, Sabine, and her consultant. Sabine was nearly 80 and was wearing full makeup and a kaftan. On that kaftan, she wore the medal she was given for her role in the French resistance during the war, to remind herself, as she waited for cancer to eat away at what was left of her liver, that she “too can be brave”. Her biggest fear, she confessed one day, was that she would die in agony. What followed, says Mannix, “has lived with me, as if on a cinema reel, for the rest of my career”. What followed was a conversation in which the consultant told Sabine, in calm, clear detail, exactly what she could expect. And at the end of it, Sabine picked up the consultant’s hand and drew it “to her lips”. Mannix’s wonderful book is full of stories of people at the end of their lives. Some are young. Some are old. Most are scared of dying. But in the end, for most of them, death is not the painful end they fear. It is desperately hard, of course, for those who are left behind. But it often isn’t quite as hard as they fear. There’s a famous study, now 40 years old, of lottery winners and people who had been in life-changing accidents. You’d expect the lottery winners to be ecstatic. You’d expect the people who lost the use of their limbs to be desperately depressed. The shock in the study is this: a year after their life-changing incidents, the accident victims reported slightly higher levels of happiness in their everyday activities than the lottery winners. The high of becoming a lottery winner didn’t last, but nor did the despair of becoming a paraplegic. It’s what psychologist Jonathan Haidt calls “the adaptation principle”. We humans, in other words, are an awful lot stronger than we think. I’ve had cancer twice. It was horrible, but I’m alive. I’m strong. My neighbour is going through chemotherapy at the moment. She is, she told me over a cup of tea last week, enjoying the time off work. Every time I see her, she’s sporting a different, magnificent hat. Brexit? Oh my God, Brexit. Trump? Oh my God, Trump. Who’s in, who’s out, who just resigned because of nasty tweets; who should have resigned because of crazy tweets; who just got shunted to a lesser, boring job? Does it matter? Sure, it matters, but sometimes it’s good just to take a step back and raise a glass to the damn fine humans we know, while they – and we – are still here. • Christina Patterson is a writer, broadcaster and columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jan/15/five-principles-guardian-editor-readers-open-door","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-15T06:00:48Z","webTitle":"Five principles for a new Guardian era | Open door","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jan/15/five-principles-guardian-editor-readers-open-door","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/jan/15/five-principles-guardian-editor-readers-open-door","fields":{"headline":"Five principles for a new Guardian era","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Late last year the Guardian editor-in-chief, Katharine Viner, gave a speech containing commitments that readers are entitled to pursue. A sample of both tone and content: “We believe in the value of the public sphere; that there is such a thing as the public interest, and the common good; that we are all of equal worth; that the world should be free and fair.” As I watched Viner deliver “A mission for journalism in a time of crisis” in an auditorium in London – and via the web to colleagues in the US and Australia – I thought about how it would become part of the role of readers’ editors in future to ask her how the mission was going. The first step is to raise awareness of a speech that, in a time of challenge to institutional media, repays its reading time. With the paper Guardian changing shape and design again, it feels like the right occasion to draw your attention to it. The speech is a manifesto from an editor-in-chief early in her time in a role in which her two immediate predecessors served 20 years each, and the most famous Guardian editor, CP Scott, served 57 (1872-1929). In this speech Viner stands on the rock of the Guardian’s past, surveys the present and points to where she wants to lead a journalism organisation that is now both print and digital, UK and world. Viner traces the emergence of the newspaper in Manchester in 1821 from the movement for more representative democracy. She itemises some leaps forward and slides backward during the Guardian’s rich history. By reference to the founders’ prospectus – “a wholly uncynical and unsnobbish document” – and other landmark statements, she reaffirms guiding values including honesty, integrity, courage, fairness, and a sense of duty to reader and community. Partisans note: she repeats the founders’ promise that the Guardian will support policies not parties. The threats to journalism’s economic model in a new communications environment are described, but so are the opportunities those technologies offer for more collaborative journalism and a sustainable future. Viner acknowledges the farsightedness of her predecessor Alan Rusbridger. The large international audience, gathered through bold steps in digital, significantly strengthens the membership strategy now under way and Viner reminds us that: “The Guardian is now funded more by our readers than by our advertisers.” The overarching theme is of hope – “authentic hope”, says one of her sources – in answer to a longing. “Our lives are increasingly atomised,” Viner says, “but you can see the pleasure that comes from communal or civic participation. People long to help each other, to be together, to share experiences, to be part of a community, to influence the powers that control their lives.” The motivating force is that the Guardian can contribute to rebuilding the social capital that neoliberalism’s ascendancy has sapped. As it did at its beginnings in Manchester, the Guardian today should catch the mood of the people, says Viner, and I take her to mean the Guardian’s whole audience, UK and international. As in the tumultuous early 19th century so now, she argues, the Guardian should not try to deny what is happening but acknowledge it, contextualise it, analyse it, try to understand it and, in the words of the prospectus, “turn it to beneficial account”. As to promises, Viner commits the Guardian to follow five principles: • Develop ideas that help to improve the world, not just critique it. • Collaborate with readers and others to have greater impact. • Diversify, to have richer reporting from a representative newsroom. • Be meaningful in all our work. • Report fairly on people as well as power and find things out. This underpins all of the above. Every now and then, in some of the myriad contexts that practising journalism generates, we will come back to this list. • Paul Chadwick is the Guardian’s readers’ editor"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"football/2018/jan/12/crystal-palace-burnley-match-preview","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-12T16:41:08Z","webTitle":"Crystal Palace v Burnley: match preview","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jan/12/crystal-palace-burnley-match-preview","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/jan/12/crystal-palace-burnley-match-preview","fields":{"headline":"Crystal Palace v Burnley: match preview","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Roy Hodgson must be wondering what he has done to deserve such rotten luck.

Even when invitations came from the Paris Opera Ballet, the fashion designer worried about being reduced to the status of “costume department”. But in 2009, he broke his rule – for Eonnagata, a poetic piece of dance theatre about the Chevalier d’Éon, a notorious 18th-century cross-dressing French spy. “This male-female character was so up my strasse,” McQueen told me. As well as the “dark psychosis” of the work’s subject, McQueen was also lured by the opportunity to dress Sylvie Guillem, the most physically extraordinary dancer of her generation. Guillem recalled how McQueen, suddenly deciding a costume looked too bland during a fitting session, cut another one “right in front of our eyes. It took about three minutes. It was so fast – and so completely right.” McQueen’s designs were as ravishing as they were transgressive: a fantastical fusion of military uniform, kabuki and crinolines that gave Russell Maliphant, dancing the role of the spy, a touch of female padding around the hips and Guillem “a little bit of something between the legs”. McQueen had conjured a visual world for Eonnagata that allowed its story to morph elegantly between gender, time and place. Eonnagata’s success reflects what designer Gareth Pugh has called “a natural synergy between dance and fashion” stemming from “their shared element of fantasy and suspension of disbelief”. Both effect a magical heightening of the everyday. Just as dancing bodies spin metaphor and meaning out of human locomotion, so couture can beautifully reinvent the logic of a dress or a shirt. And when the two worlds successfully mesh – in the punk platform shoes and buttock-exposing tights BodyMap created for Michael Clark, or in the gorgeously colour-coded minimalism of Dries Van Noten’s designs for Anne Teresa de Keersmaeker – it can be impossible to separate the costumes from the choreography. British choreographer Christopher Wheeldon has long embraced this cross-pollination, collaborating with such designers as Narciso Rodriguez – whose detailed take on traditional dancewear, featuring shell pink tights and beautifully stitched leotards, lit up Wheeldon’s Fools Paradise. For the choreographer’s new work, to be staged at the Royal Opera House and set to music by Leonard Bernstein, he has chosen to collaborate with Erdem Moralioglu, the designer best known for his experimental textiles (in one show, he used embroidered plastic). “Erdem plays with very theatrical influences in his clothes,” says Wheeldon. “He uses big prints and intricate embroidery. These work really well with Bernstein’s music. I’m using three short scores, which range from the very pure to the very theatrical. This will give Erdem three opportunities to say something different with the clothing.” For Moralioglu, participating in another artist’s project has been a revelation. “When I’m working on my collections, I’m on my own. But here, it is fascinating to be inspired by his vision, his movement and Bernstein’s music.” Moralioglu has rooted his designs in the 1950s but emphasises that the ballet won’t simply be a period piece: “Christopher and I are undoing the 50s to look at what lies beneath. We’re unpicking ideas about the dressed and the undressed, the finished and the imperfect.” Though the costumes will include some retro garments, these will be deconstructed to expose the dancers’ underwear – and the “purity of their skin”. Dance is a peculiarly porous art form: its costumes have always reflected trends in the outside world. “As soon as someone sews a seam in a dance garment,” says theatre designer and former dancer Jean-Marc Puissant, “whether it’s an 18th-century blouse or a 1980s Lycra leotard, you are, at a basic level, talking about fashion.” The drifting white tulle dresses worn by ballerinas in the 1830s and 40s are an early example of fashion’s impact on dance. The design was a reflection of that era’s obsession with supernatural heroines, its Romantic yearning for the ethereal and sublime. In practical terms, this garment had been made possible by changes precipitated by the French revolution, when the opulent attire of the ancien régime was superseded by a vogue for light, loose-fitting frocks. As liberating as these politically correct garments had been for ordinary women, they had a revolutionary impact on dancers, who were able to jump, bend and lift their legs with a dramatically enlarged range of motion. A similarly striking moment occurred in the 1920s, when flappers and their androgynous silhouettes opened the way for sporty, body-hugging garments, exemplified by the leotard. This was a fantastically cheap and practical form of costume, but its uncluttered design also had a tangible effect on the art form, helping to drive it away from the decorative story ballets of the 19th century towards a more abstract, modernist aesthetic. Fashion has not only influenced the language of dance, but also its economics. During the early 20th century – as ballet migrated away from court- and state-funded theatres, and the fledgling art of modern dance appeared on stage – companies had to invent new marketing strategies. Fashion, meanwhile, was developing into a global, branded industry. It was during this period that the most box office-savvy dance companies grasped the selling power of style. Sergei Diaghilev, entrepreneurial arts genius and director of the Ballets Russes, hired Coco Chanel to create the costumes for his satirical lifestyle ballet, Le Train Bleu. This 1924 work was set on the French Riviera and, because Chanel had practically created the vogue for suntans and beachwear, she was the ideal choice of designer. Yet if Chanel proved a magnet for the sophisticated, moneyed audience on whom Diaghilev depended, the collaboration was no less useful to the designer herself. At this stage, Chanel was still perceived as a tradeswoman, excluded from the privileged gratin of Parisian society. By associating with Diaghilev and his elite circle of painters and princesses she was able to inch herself closer to social acceptance. After Chanel, many designers opted to bask in the glow of a high-profile dance collaboration. The American couturier Roy Halston Frowick, known as Halston, profited greatly from his association with modern dance legend Martha Graham, although purists objected to the excess of gold lamé; while Christian Lacroix has forged a second career adapting his intensely decorative designs for such prestigious companies as Paris Opera Ballet and American Ballet Theatre. In 2015, Prada collaborated with dancers from Tanztheater Wuppertal on a haunting series of duets for an online video project. Other designers have simply rifled through dance to find imagery for their own collect-ions: Paul Poiret borrowed from the brilliant exoticism of Diaghilev’s early work, while Christian Dior’s 1950 1950 Cygne Noir gown channelled the roman-tic mystique of Swan Lake. Moralioglu is convinced that collaborating on the Bernstein ballet with Wheeldon has freed him to create “a whole new body of work”. The Belgian designer Dries Van Noten highlights a similar sense of freedom when discussing his own dance projects, especially the costumes he created for Anne Teresa de Keersmaeker’s 2001 masterpiece Rain. These were much less overtly theatrical than Moralioglu’s: a series of camisoles, trousers and shirts that fulfilled De Keersmaeker’s request for garments “credible and rooted in the ordinary”. But Van Noten’s creations were far from pedestrian, not only coloured in an exquisite palette of pinks, crimsons and silvery greys but cut so they floated, shimmied and draped around the dancers’ bodies in a choreography of their own. “When one designs prêt-à-porter collections,” he says, “one can feel deprived of witnessing how garments are worn in the real world.” Designing for De Keersmaeker gave Van Noten a much more “direct and visceral relationship with the body in motion”. That relationship has persisted, notably in the sensuous, form-revealing menswear collection of 2015 that he describes as an homage to the “feline, confident athleticism and virility of the male classical dancer”. Working with dance, however, can bring constraints. Costumes have to function within strict parameters: their colours and fabric have to look good under powerful stage lighting; their details need to be legible, even from the back of the stalls; and above all they need to give wearers unimpeded motion. Moralioglu was surprised to discover how much this last requirement involved: “I had to think about skirts moving in a certain way, about armholes being large enough, about the waistline of a dress allowing the men to partner the women safely.”Sometimes choreographers break those rules, as in the deliberately unflattering “fat suits” that Maguy Marin used for her sardonic work Groosland. Such cases are more routine in contemporary dance, where choreographers play with a wide and sometimes transgressive variety of body languages. They are far less common in classical ballet, which, as Puissant points out, has evolved “from a very clear perspective of the Apollonian ideal, from specific ideas about the proportions of the body and how we want to see it”. Having been a dancer, Puissant knows how precisely costumes need to be cut to flatter that classical ideal. Yet even in ballet there are no hard and fast rules. When Wayne McGregor invited Gareth Pugh to collaborate on his 2012 ballet Carbon Life, he asked the designer to think in terms of Oskar Schlemmer, the Bauhaus artist-turned-choreographer whose encased his dancers in cumbersome geometric costumes, which reduced them to “mechanistic figurines”. Although McGregor was not about to sacrifice the mercurial dazzle of his own choreography, Pugh recalls he nevertheless wanted costumes “that weren’t conventionally dancer-friendly. He wanted something to react against in his choreography, a kind of barrier to navigate.” Pugh’s own fashion aesthetic has a Schlemmer-like quality in its playful distortions of proportion and silhouette. The designs he created for McGregor worked a similarly transformative effect. Created out of a stiffened carbon-black fabric, they featured rigid tubular bodices, towering pointed hats and a kind of booted male pointe shoe that extended the line of the leg as if it were a dagger. The Royal Ballet insisted the shoes be rigorously tested to ensure the safety of its dancers, but Pugh was happy to accommodate these concerns. Like Moralioglu, he relished everything this novel creative process threw at him, including McGregor’s unnervingly generous openness. “Wayne didn’t give me a brief. He let me respond to his ideas in my own way. And the work kept changing – it felt like hurtling along a motorway at over 100mph. It was incredibly challenging and incredibly freeing.” When a dialogue feels so charged, its effects can continue long after the final curtain. “Designers are very hungry,” says Moralioglu. “We crave stimulus, and a collaboration can’t help but shape everything we do afterwards.” For Pugh, the consequences were career-defining: working with McGregor gave him a liberating respite from the hectic, commercialised pace of fashion. “As a designer, you’re always second-guessing yourself,” he says. “You’re always under pressure to do something new. Carbon Life gave me the space to think about what I was already doing. It gave me the confidence to go into that more deeply.” The ballet also inspired him to bring a more dancerly element to his fashion shows. Opting to use film rather than a live catwalk, Pugh has now begun to mix dancers – choreographed by McGregor – in among his models. “My end goal has always been designing clothes to be seen in movement. A conventional catwalk show is too much like a tennis match – just going back and forth. But with dancers, you can be working with these incredible machines, with such an incredible range of movement. With dance, you can make fashion so much more of a performance.” • Christopher Wheeldon’s new work is at the Royal Opera House, London, 15 March-9 April.

People take notice. They read to the end. They share it with their friends. They create rare pools of wellbeing on social media. They write to thank you. Eighteen months ago, the Guardian launched a pilot project to see how readers would respond if we deliberately sought out the good things happening in the world. More than 150 pieces of journalism later – in which we have examined the relative merits of everything from dog turds to ketamine, the blockchain to microhouses, and gardening to exoskeletons – we have proof of concept. Reader numbers for this kind of journalism have proven remarkably robust throughout the project, with almost one in 10 readers on average sharing stories on social media. News doesn’t have to be bad. The planet is complex. Away from the horror and conflict, the shouting and the skulduggery, away from the tragedy, disaster and zero-sum misanthropy, there is a wide world of answers and improvements, of win-win and mutual support, of selflessness and curiosity, of movements and innovations. And when you write about it, people tend to respond positively. They do so because while audiences have always been riveted by bad news (it serves as both an early warning system and a reassurance about the comfort of their own lives), they are tired of the avalanche of awfulness. They are switching off. That is a bad thing. If people just shrug at news because they feel there is little they can do, nothing will change. Journalists in the US, Europe and the UK are waking up to this by publishing what is variously described as constructive journalism, solutions journalism or, somewhat misleadingly, positive news. Now the Guardian is deepening its commitment to this type of work. Our new series, The Upside, launched this week with support from the Skoll foundation and a sprightly determination to show readers all of humanity, not just the bad bits. This does not mean we will reduce our efforts to uncover wrongdoing, to hold the powerful to account. It does mean that, in addition, we will be looking for pioneers, trailblazers, best practice, unsung heroes, ideas that work, ideas that might, innovations whose time might have come. As our editor-in-chief, Katharine Viner, promised in a speech on the future of the Guardian recently, “we will develop ideas that help improve the world, not just critique it. Despair is just another form of denial. People long to feel hopeful again – and young people, especially, yearn to feel the hope that previous generations once had.” It is something our readers and members consistently ask for. Our request this week for ideas from readers resulted in more than 1,000 responses and suggestions from more than two dozen countries. “You are on the right track - we need more articles like this,” said Marti Mahoney of Albuquerque, in response to Jon Henley’s article on why Finland always seems to have answers to modern social problems. “More about kindness, discoveries and innovations that are improving society, please,” wrote Lorraine Simpson, from Edinburgh. “Some positive reflections on data trends too; for example I read yesterday that war and violence have decreased across the globe over the past century, which was a pleasant surprise.” Nick Marchant, from Dublin, wrote in: “I really support your intention to publish positive stories, I’ve been looking for it for a long time. I find a lot of news coverage very negative, and it makes me switch off various issues.” “Recently I have been thinking about the psychological aspect of being bombarded by negative news stories and although they are important I feel that without optimistic news stories to contrast them you leave readers feeling punch-drunk and depressed about the world,” Simon Taylor wrote. “I understand there are some positive news stories on the Guardian site but it would be brilliant to have a dedicated section for moments of ‘oh god show me something to be happy about!’” Perhaps curious is a better word than happy. Not everything we cover will necessarily change the world for the better, but it will offer the promise of doing so.There are some ground rules. We won’t jump at every piece of puff and PR that comes our way. We will set a high bar, looking for things that appear replicable, robust and confront the big challenges of our times – the environment, health (particularly mental), atomised communities, flagging democracy, gender discrimination and technology. We will attempt to find the communities trying to solve some of these problems and, ideally, this will take us to places we rarely visit, broadening our reach and our understanding. And we are encouraging readers to take part. Let us know what you want to see from this series, where you see the hope.

In a powerful essay for New York magazine, Donegan explained the impetus behind the list, how it expanded and spread far beyond what she anticipated - and just how nervous that made her. For those of us who have seen the list and found it simultaneously exhilaratingly radical and terrifyingly unaccountable, Donegan’s accounting is cathartic. It captures our own appetite for a public reckoning about abusive men, tempered by our discomfort with the medium, its diffuseness and anonymity, and the nature of a small minority of the accusations. But even this moment is a fraught one. I’m glad Donegan wrote her piece. I applaud her bravery and honesty and her willingness to grapple with the many complications of the list she created. But the circumstances under which she came forward are shameful. And even in a media universe increasingly responsive to #MeToo claims, I worry she’s going to have a hard time working in this industry again. Donegan wrote her piece because she suspected Harper’s Magazine was about to out her in a piece written by long-time feminism critic Katie Roiphe. A Harper’s fact-checker contacted Donegan to ask whether she was the list creator – an odd move given that it’s typically a reporter’s job to report foundational facts of a piece before they’re double-checked. Roiphe says she had the fact-checker do this crucial bit of reporting for her because Donegan “refused” to talk to her. According to Donegan, Roiphe contacted her once via email, asking to speak to her about a piece she was writing on the “feminist movement,” with no specific mention of Donegan’s role in the list creation. Donegan declined, only to be blindsided much later by the fact checker’s inquiry. Roiphe, it’s relevant to note, has made a long career of questioning women’s accounts of their own lives. Decades ago she wrote a book about sexual assault on college campuses, more or less claiming that hysterical feminists encouraged young women to exaggerate normal if awkward sexual interactions into rape claims. That she was reporting this Harper’s piece understandably gave many women pause; numerous feminists familiar with her work simply don’t trust her motives, her reporting or her commitment to intellectual honesty. That Roiphe might be outing the woman who created a list to help women identify potentially abusive, manipulative and exploitative men spurned immediate rage. Now, the outing question is moot. Whatever Roiphe’s piece ends up saying, it will not be the final word on the roiling debates about the list and the related onslaught of #MeToo claims. How do we balance what’s at stake when we weigh the words of women versus those of men? It’s women’s safety and our potential for career success (so often stymied when we are harassed or humiliated) versus men’s reputations and their immediate right to maintain the jobs they hold. In the court of public opinion – or an HR office – what’s the evidentiary standard for holding an accused person accountable? What bad acts are bad enough to merit which punishments? And where is the sweet spot between believing women – so that we may have equal access to safe and professional workplaces – and protecting the rights of the accused? These are all valuable inquiries. But the toughest and most pressing one is the same question that gnawed at Donegan before she created the list in the first place: what else are women supposed to do? Many of the incidents detailed on the list are serious physical assaults. But their nature – in private, between people who know each other – make them unlikely to be pursued by law enforcement. That they often involve a powerful man and a woman who has a lot to lose creates a steep cost to publicly complaining. HR departments, if they even exist – and at smaller media companies they often don’t – can be more concerned with protecting management than female employees. Women who complain risk being seen as problem employees. Filing a civil harassment or assault complaint is also a challenge. There are a lot of hoops women have to jump through, it’s expensive to hire a lawyer, and there’s a high legal bar to clear to triumph in court. And of course, some of these incidents involve men who are not necessarily a boss or co-worker but someone powerful in an industry a woman works in. So women talk to each other. It’s clearly not enough, given the ubiquity of workplace harassment and even assault. The media men list was an imperfect response. But as we are detailing our discomfort and tearing down the idea of an anonymous crowd-sourced list, it’s worth also thinking about what we can build instead. Our current institutions are not working, and neither are more anti-feminist magazine articles that are heavy on finger-wagging critique and light on fresh ideas to combat a real problem.

The 44-year-old had 500 followers and no great taste for social media: her work with survivors of sexual violence, mainly young women of colour, didn’t lend itself to public pronouncement. Twelve years earlier she had set up Me Too, an activist group that she thought, in her wildest dreams, might one day amount to a Me Too bumper sticker on somebody’s car – a kind of bat signal between survivors of sexual violence – but that on most days had no public presence at all. For her kind of work to be done right, she believed, most of it needed to be done in the dark. What she saw on Twitter therefore made Burke jump out of her skin. Ten days earlier, Harvey Weinstein had been spectacularly exposed by the New York Times as the subject of multiple accusations of sexual assault, and there on screen, carrying the hashtag #MeToo, other women had begun sharing their stories. Burke didn’t know that the actor Alyssa Milano had stumbled on the phrase, unaware of its origins, and urged survivors of sexual aggression to use it. Nor could she know that, in the coming weeks, the Me Too hashtag would be used more than 12 million times, resulting in an extraordinary outpouring of pain, and a handful of high-profile men losing their jobs. All she knew that night was that someone was using her slogan and this wasn’t good. “Social media,” she says, laughing at the understatement, “is not a safe space. I thought: this is going to be a fucking disaster.” Burke and I are in the offices of Girls for Gender Equity, a non-profit organisation in downtown Brooklyn where she is the senior director. “Congratulations Tarana!” reads a homemade poster on her office door, alongside a photocopy of Time magazine’s Person of the Year cover, featuring the “silence breakers” of #MeToo (fruit picker Isabel Pascual, lobbyist Adama Iwu, actor Ashley Judd, software engineer Susan Fowler, Taylor Swift and an anonymous hospital worker are pictured, while Burke was honoured on the inside pages). Burke has just returned from LA after attending the Golden Globes with Michelle Williams; as she talks she is trying to eat a quesadilla from a polystyrene container while keeping an eye on her phone. This is one of the busiest times of year for the organisation, she says. “The world doesn’t realise I have a regular job!” The idea of attending the Golden Globes was a challenge. “When Michelle called me and said: ‘I would love to take you to the Golden Globes,’ I said: ‘Why? I’m trying very hard not to be the black woman who is trotted out when you all need to validate your work.’” Ouch. “Well, Michelle is very thoughtful and she said: ‘That’s not what I want to do.’” Instead, the two of them came up with the idea of “flooding the red carpet with women activists – I know some badass women activists from around the country, across the spectrum, all races and classes, different issues – and we wondered what it would look like if we used the time usually allotted to [red-carpet trivia] for our issues.” There were eight activists in the end, a smaller number than they had originally wanted but a signal, she says, of “how women have historically supported each other”. It is possible that Burke’s use of the term “safe space” has already annoyed you; it’s a term that, like “trigger warning”, “micro-aggression” and “rape culture”, has come to act on some people with the force of a hostile ideology – either that or make them glaze over. Last week in Le Monde, Catherine Deneuve signed an open letter denouncing the #MeToo movement as totalitarian, and a similar piece ran in the New York Times grumbling that it reduced women to the level of “Victorian housewives”. No one used the term snowflake, but that is the implication: that #MeToo is driven by the same people who think books should be banned and pieces of art they don’t like taken down from museums. Burke, it must be said, is not this person. She is open to criticism. She allows that in a movement so large and fast-moving there are inevitable and considerable shortcomings. “Sexual violence happens on a spectrum so accountability has to happen on a spectrum,” she says. “I don’t think that every single case of sexual harassment has to result in someone being fired; the consequences should vary. But we need a shift in culture so that every single instance of sexual harassment is investigated and dealt with. That’s just basic common sense.” Burke’s prediction that Me Too, in its latest iteration, would be a disaster was not because innocent men might suffer, or because the difference between assault and harassment might be lost, but because victims of sexual violence might be poorly served by the publicity. For two decades, Burke has done the grinding, unglamorous, financially ruinous work of setting up programmes to help victims of abuse, and that didn’t tend to include sharing their status online. As it turns out, she thinks the de-stigmatising effect of #MeToo represents a greater gain than the anticipated risks, and if she is unmoved by the accusation that we are in the midst of an overcorrection, it is because she has seen what the alternative – doing nothing – looks like. She is also aware of the numbers. At one of the first Me Too workshops Burke ran, for high school-age girls in Tuskegee, Alabama, she asked the girls to fill in a worksheet noting three things they hadn’t known before they came, adding that if they needed help, they should write “Me Too” on the paper. “Doing it that way, it wasn’t like: raise your hand if you want a Me Too sheet!” she says. “We weren’t asking people to out themselves.” At the end of the event, she and her colleague collected the sheets. “I’ll never forget,” says Burke. “There had been 30 or so girls in the room and we expected around five or six Me Toos.” There were 20. “And we looked at these things and said: ‘Oh, shit.’” The work that grew out of that is almost too subtle for the volatility of the current moment to bear, but it is the basis of what Burke hopes Me Too will become; use the hashtag, she says, “but let’s talk about why, and let’s talk about what happens after”. For Burke, that means confidence-building which is to say , establishing the difference between self-esteem and self-worth. “I think a lot of girl-centred programmes are like: ‘We want to build your self-esteem by telling you that you’re beautiful, and asking you to tell yourself you’re beautiful every single day!’ That rang false to me. Because I can tell you that if you live in a world that devalues you, there is nothing to support that message. I want girls to feel worthy just for existing, because for black and brown girls – and actually just for girls – it’s ‘You’re worthy if’; so, if you’re the smartest girl, or if you’re the prettiest girl, or if you run the fastest. There has to be something attached to it to add value to your life and that can become something you become consumed with – ‘I have to have this thing; I have to be beautiful’. So, for me, it was like, ‘Let me teach you what the world thinks about us, and let me teach you what we’ve seen the world do to girls who look like us. And let me teach you why they’re wrong.’” Burke is, of course, not immune to the forces she is teaching the girls to resist, although, as she points out, she is also a single mother of a 20-year-old daughter and has a badass attitude and a lot of life experience. Still, when she logs on to social media and isn’t quick enough to filter the comments, there it is: the thing from which all women are supposed effortlessly to move on, because to do otherwise is to be a Victorian. “Oh, every day,” she says cheerfully, of being attacked by trolls. What do they say? She smiles. “They say: ‘You are too ugly to rape.’” It is possible that, thanks to #MeToo, some women who might usefully have shrugged off a minor grievance may decide to pursue it. They may – in the language of the times – internalise an idea of themselves as victims. This is the argument running counter to Me Too and it’s one that, rightly I think, Burke laughs out of the room, not least because, even with the huge swell of #MeToo testimony, it is still not exactly cool to out yourself as a victim of sexual violence. What, I ask, of the argument that there will be collateral damage and some men will be overly punished for minor transgressions? “I hate that,” says Burke. “I don’t want that to be true. I’m sure it will be true, just as there is a small percentage of accusations of sexual assault that are just not true. But I tend to pivot away from that because people tend to blow that up and make it the main thing; ‘What if she’s lying?!’ OK. But it’s, like, a 3% chance.” She also won’t have it that sexual violence and sexual harassment are entirely unrelated things. “[People say:] ‘There’s sexual harassment over here and you shouldn’t conflate it with rape,’” she says. “Which is true; those are two very different things. But they’re on the same spectrum. Sexual harassment is like the gateway drug. It’s the entry point. ‘Nothing happens, so let’s go a little bit further.’” The greater threat is that Me Too is an invitation for women to whom nothing serious has happened to assume the status of victims. Burke fairly screams at this. “Of all the critiques – and I’m very open to critiques of this work – that one in particular makes me crazy. Because I think the women who are saying that don’t realise what they are doing. There is inherent strength in agency. And #MeToo, in a lot of ways, is about agency. It’s not about giving up your agency, it’s about claiming it.” What about the temptation to overstate minor transgressions? “There was a murky time – maybe it still exists – when people would say: ‘Well, this guy one time touched my boob; I don’t know if I can say #MeToo.’ And I’d say to people: ‘I cannot define how you or your body responds to things. I can’t tell you that’s not trauma.’ I’ve seen cases with young people and families where there is a child who has experienced some form of sexual violence and there areis one set of parents who say: ‘That’s just kids experimenting.’ And there are others who say: ‘I’m going to get my kid into therapy, this is traumatic.’ Some of that is based on the response of the child, and I think that happens in general. It’s what you respond to.” It is also the language in which you choose to respond. “When I first started Me Too, young people had no language to talk about this,” she says. “And that’s something I’ve seen change; young people have a way to talk about it now. Hearing the words ‘rape culture’ doesn’t seem foreign to them.” You can dislike the tone of this language; you can find it aggressive, or vague, or wide-reaching, but there is no doubt that to the person drenched in shame, hearing the words “rape culture” communicates at the most basic level: it isn’t your fault. Burke has been through this experience herself; as a child, she was assaulted by some boys in her neighbourhood, and it is one of the things that motivated her to become an activist. “I grew up in, not poverty – that sounds a bit Tiny Tim – but, you know, low-income, working-class family in a housing project in the Bronx. We didn’t have a ton of resources. But my mother was very determined – she had me in all sorts of programmes; anything she could put me in, she did. And I read a lot when I was young. Those were the things that helped change the trajectory of my life. And the first glimpses of healing, and understanding what had been happening to me as a child, came from the literature that I read. So I had this ‘out’ that I saw the girls I worked with did not have.” The process of healing is one that she would say is never complete, and part of Burke’s discomfort with the spotlight – “I’m uncomfortable being the face of this thing; I didn’t want to be a figurehead” – is that, she says, “I’m still dealing with my own stuff.” She is squeamish about what she calls, drily, her “15 minutes”, not least because people keep encouraging her to monetise it. “Ever since this went viral, people have been saying: ‘You should sell Me Too T-shirts! How do I get those T-shirts?!’ Everyone has a stream of income idea.” (In fact, there are Me Too T-shirts that Burke has, for years, barely been able to give away. Until recently, every time she wore one out of the house, guys would read the slogan on the front and say flirtatiously: “Oh, me too! Me too!” Then they would see the back, which read something like “end sexual violence now” and Burke would wait, amused, for the terrible silence. “The guys would be like: ‘Er, I’m so sorry.’” She laughs uproariously.) Anyway, she says, “We don’t sell the T-shirts because they are a gift. A lot of times I hand them out and say: ‘Whenever you’re ready.’” Between Time magazine and the Golden Globes, Burke’s profile is continuing to grow, and she is determined to rise to the demands. “Inherently, having privilege isn’t bad,” she says, “but it’s how you use it, and you have to use it in service of other people.” For what feels like the first time, the privilege she is referring to is her own, and it is the privilege of an extremely large audience. “Now that I have it, I’m trying to use it responsibly,” she says. “But if it hadn’t come along I would be right here, with my fucking Me Too shirt on, doing workshops and going to rape crisis centres.” She gives a huge laugh. “The work is the work.” • Tarana Burke will be speaking at the All About Women festival in Sydney, Australia on 4 March"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"environment/radical-conservation/2018/jan/16/biodiversity-extinction-tipping-point-planetary-boundary","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-16T08:43:20Z","webTitle":"Could biodiversity destruction lead to a global tipping point?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/radical-conservation/2018/jan/16/biodiversity-extinction-tipping-point-planetary-boundary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/radical-conservation/2018/jan/16/biodiversity-extinction-tipping-point-planetary-boundary","fields":{"headline":"Could biodiversity destruction lead to a global tipping point?","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Just over 250 million years ago, the planet suffered what may be described as its greatest holocaust: ninety-six percent of marine genera (plural of genus) and seventy percent of land vertebrate vanished for good. Even insects suffered a mass extinction – the only time before or since. Entire classes of animals – like trilobites – went out like a match in the wind. But what’s arguably most fascinating about this event – known as the Permian-Triassic extinction or more poetically, the Great Dying – is the fact that anything survived at all. Life, it seems, is so ridiculously adaptable that not only did thousands of species make it through whatever killed off nearly everything (no one knows for certain though theories abound) but, somehow, after millions of years life even recovered and went on to write new tales. Even as the Permian-Triassic extinction event shows the fragility of life, it also proves its resilience in the long-term. The lessons of such mass extinctions – five to date and arguably a sixth happening as I write – inform science today. Given that extinction levels are currently 1,000 (some even say 10,000) times the background rate, researchers have long worried about our current destruction of biodiversity – and what that may mean for our future Earth and ourselves. In 2009, a group of researchers identified nine global boundaries for the planet that if passed could theoretically push the Earth into an uninhabitable state for our species. These global boundaries include climate change, freshwater use, ocean acidification and, yes, biodiversity loss (among others). The group has since updated the terminology surrounding biodiversity, now calling it “biosphere integrity,” but that hasn’t spared it from critique. A paper last year in Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution scathingly attacked the idea of any global biodiversity boundary. “It makes no sense that there exists a tipping point of biodiversity loss beyond which the Earth will collapse,” said co-author and ecologist, José Montoya, with Paul Sabatier Univeristy in France. “There is no rationale for this.” Montoya wrote the paper along with Ian Donohue, an ecologist at Trinity College in Ireland and Stuart Pimm, one of the world’s leading experts on extinctions, with Duke University in the US. Montoya, Donohue and Pimm argue that there isn’t evidence of a point at which loss of species leads to ecosystem collapse, globally or even locally. If the planet didn’t collapse after the Permian-Triassic extinction event, it won’t collapse now – though our descendants may well curse us for the damage we’ve done. Instead, according to the researchers, every loss of species counts. But the damage is gradual and incremental, not a sudden plunge. Ecosystems, according to them, slowly degrade but never fail outright. “Of more than 600 experiments of biodiversity effects on various functions, none showed a collapse,” Montoya said. “In general, the loss of species has a detrimental effect on ecosystem functions...We progressively lose pollination services, water quality, plant biomass, and many other important functions as we lose species. But we never observe a critical level of biodiversity over which functions collapse.” This doesn’t mean we shouldn’t be deeply concerned about biodiversity, according to the researchers. Instead, we should worry about every species lost and not focus on a theoretical line in the sand. “It is in fact the planetary boundary argument that implies that there is a lot of biodiversity that has no value. There is no problem with losing a small number of species, the argument goes,” Montoya said. “We argue that even small losses of biodiversity have important consequences for ecosystem function and service provisioning.” In other words, extinction of species may not result in a total collapse of our ecosystems – but the more we lose, the less productive, efficient, and healthy our environment will be. And the more at risk we put ourselves. Boundary scientists fire back But, the Stockholm Resilience Centre recently published a long response to Montoya’s paper in the usual way of scientific sparring – publications going back and forth like boxers exchanging blows. Johan Rockström the executive director of the Stockholm Resilience Centre and one of the leading researchers on planetary boundaries, said that Montoya’s critique didn’t stand up to scrutiny because its authors misunderstood the definitions built around the “biosphere integrity planetary boundary.” Rockström agrees that there is no evidence of a planetary tipping point when it comes to biodiversity. According to Rockström, biodiversity decline does not have a hard planetary boundary like, say, climate change. Instead he describes biodiversity as a variable that operates “under the hood of the planetary system” because it influences the stability of our climate, ozone layer and oceans – all of which Rockström contends have very clear planetary boundaries. “We have never suggested a planetary scale biodiversity tipping point...” Rockström said. “Instead, the rational for biodiversity as a planetary boundary is that the composition of trees, plants, microbes in soils, phytoplankton in oceans, top predators in ecosystems…together constitute a fundamental core contributor to regulating the state of the planet.” According to Rockström, biodiversity is one of the pillars supporting our planet – and if too much biodiversity is lost we risk “triggering a tipping point” in our climate or oceans, which in turn could risk pushing the planet into a new state. “Without biodiversity, no ecosystems. No ecosystems, no biomes. No biomes, no living regulator of all the cycles of carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, carbon dioxide and water,” he added. Rockström says biodiversity loss could risk the “safe operating space” for humans, leaving us in an alien world increasingly hostile to our own survival. For example, life would still survive under apocalyptic climate change – but we may not. While ecosystems may not fully collapse, scientists have found that some ecosystems can undergo what they are called “regime shifts.” Coral reefs, overheated by climate change, will shift to a much less productive, much less biodiverse algae-based ecosystem. Climate change, or alternatively humans with chainsaws and fire, can shift forest ecosystems to grasslands. While none of these ecosystems may wholly collapse, they will look nothing like they did after the shift occurs. Montoya admits that such regime shifts “do actually happen” and is “well established” for some ecosystems – like forests, coral reefs and Arctic sea ice – though “unclear” if it happens in all ecosystems or only a few. And he adds, perhaps most importantly, that “the mechanisms [of regime shifts] have nothing to do with biodiversity loss.” Instead, they have been driven by climate change or human actions – such as clear-cutting. Debating definitions It may be that unclear or shifting definitions are at the root of the dispute. “Fatally, the boundaries framework lacks clear definitions, or it has too many conflicting definitions, does not specify units, and fails to define terms operationally, thus prohibiting application by those who set policy,” Montoya, Donohut and Pimm write in the paper. But Rockström contends that when understood correctly the planetary boundary framework holds up to scientific scrutiny. He says planetary boundaries do not mean that humanity can just destroy and upend all the way up to a red line without consequences. “This is of course just nonsense,” he noted, arguing that the planetary boundary for biosphere integrity is magnitudes more ambitious than the Aichi Targets from the Convention on Biological Diversity, an international agreement set on preserving biodiversity – though already several goals have not been met. “If the world is able to reduce biodiversity loss below the planetary boundary this would not only require major conservation efforts across the world,” he said, adding that “once inside the safe operating space, we would of course have to continue on a sustainable pathway.” Rockström said that he believes the disputing researchers have much more in common than their infighting would imply. “We are [all] working to safeguard biodiversity for sustainable development. We are [all] in the same camp. Complementing each other, they at the ecosystem level, us at the planetary level.” But Montoya and his group stand by their criticism and are working on a second paper responding to Rockström and his team. While Montoya’s paper does not critique the other eight planetary boundaries in their paper, Montoya told me that each of the boundaries – even the physical ones – have faced “a lot of controversy.” “They all suffer from the tipping-point problem,” he said, “which we argue promotes a business-as-usual ethos and distracts us from taking the action that is urgently needed.” In many ways one could argue that the planetary boundary is an easy and simple way to explain environmental impacts to world leaders – few of whom have any education on ecology or the environment – and the public. But Montoya argues that the planetary boundaries concept is doing more harm than good. “Poor or ill-founded science ultimately brings about ineffectual policies at best – and potentially highly damaging ones – and erodes trust in scientists,” he said. And this can have real world impacts: Montoya and colleagues point to forest policy in Europe as one example. “The assumption that there is a critical biodiversity level below which forest functioning will collapse prompted managers [to] plant resilient tree species to climate change, pests, and disease,” Montoya explained, adding, “this was recommended to avoid reaching a tipping point in forest service provisioning, primarily timber production.” But the recommendations have resulted in endangered old growth forests and native species, according to Montoya. While the on-going debate over planetary boundaries is deeply academic and wonky, it is not without importance to the public. How we communicate environmental crises – and the accuracy of the science that underpins that communication – proves more important with every passing year, as the world walks into climate and ecological uncertainty. Yes, life itself survived the Permian-Triassic mass extinction event – but most species did not. Believe me, humans probably wouldn’t have survived the tens-of-millions of years that followed the Great Dying: oxygen levels were dangerously low, food would have been scarce, and the world would have looked largely barren and wasted even as some species and ecosystems managed to survive. Outside the moral dilemma of extinction, there is no question that if humans push more-and-more species into oblivion there will be impacts on our society – and they could become catastrophic. Humans evolved 248 million years later in an Earth that was far more biodiverse and rich, a kind of Eden of abundance and diversity. But our current actions risk all that – and perhaps ourselves."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2018/jan/12/theological-guidance-for-tim-farron-on-gay-sex","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-12T18:23:04Z","webTitle":"Theological guidance for Farron on gay sex | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jan/12/theological-guidance-for-tim-farron-on-gay-sex","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/jan/12/theological-guidance-for-tim-farron-on-gay-sex","fields":{"headline":"Theological guidance for Tim Farron on gay sex","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Tim Farron needs better theological education and spiritual direction (Farron: I misled voters on gay sex, 11 January).

Theologically, sin is not so much a breach of law (which would be dealt with by punishment) but rather a breach of grace (dealt with, thank God, by forgiveness). It isn’t really about what is done, but what is meant by what is done. Thus it is possible to be sinful while sharing heterosexual love (for example), and yet sinless while sharing homosexual love.

Tom Brady? Nope, he was third. Dak Prescott? Guess again, he was fourth. Matt Ryan? Uh-uh, only fifth. Then it must be Drew Brees or Russell Wilson, right? Not even close. They were ninth and 10th. OK, to all those in Minnesota with their hands up, the answer is, of course, Casey Austin Keenum, signal-caller for the Vikings in 15 of their 16 games this season. Yes, the same Case Keenum who had already bounced around three teams in five years before arriving in Minneapolis as the epitome of a journeyman last March. The same Keenum who boasted a career record of just nine wins in 26 games with the Houston Texans, then-St Louis Rams and then the Texans again, including eight defeats out of eight for Houston in 2013 and nine of 16 after returning to the Rams in 2015 and ‘16. And the same undrafted quarterback with a less-than-stellar line of 24 touchdowns and 20 interceptions in his 26 outings prior to this year, and who finished the 2016 campaign dead last in total quarterback rating, as measured by ESPN, at a miserable 37.5. This year? His rating is a whopping 69.8, ahead of Brady (67.4), Prescott (66.3) and Ryan (63.7), or, to put it another way, the best of any quarterback left in the playoffs, including New Orleans veteran Brees (59.1), who will be on the opposite sideline at US Bank Stadium for Sunday’s NFC divisional playoff game with the Saints. His 22-7 touchdown-to-interception ratio is also better than each of Wilson, Prescott, Ryan and Ben Roethlisberger. Yet he arrived in Minnesota as the third-choice passer, the emergency back-up to Sam Bradford if Teddy Bridgewater didn’t recover in time from his off-season knee surgery. He looked like it, too, as he completed just 33 of 48 passes, with two touchdowns, in three pre-season games and then lost two of three starts when Bradford’s knee problems sidelined him after the opening week win over New Orleans. It seemed the 2-2 Vikings’ promising season was well and truly doomed in Week 5 when the gimpy Bradford was pressed back into service for the game at Chicago and lasted just the first half, forcing Keenum back under center. A fan base held its breath, crossed its fingers – and watched the unprepossessing back-up lead a fourth-quarter comeback en route to a 20-17 win. Seven games later Mike Zimmer’s men were 10-2, firmly on the way to the NFC’s second seed, and Keenum was the undisputed starter, even when Bridgewater returned to fitness. The journeyman had become simply The Man as far as the Vikings were concerned, and head coach Zimmer looked positively prescient for the one-year, $2m deal he signed Keenum to in the off-season. So what, exactly, did Zimmer see in the sixth-year pro that no one had seen much sign of since the Houston Cougar had completed his college career as the Football Bowl Subdivision’s all-time leader in total offense (20,114 yards) and touchdown passes (155), but with zero offers from NFL teams? Exactly that, according to Zimmer. A quarterback with terrific potential who had yet to find his feet in the league. Someone who just needed the right situation, with the right level of understanding, to light the blue touch-paper of quarterback pyrotechnics. “Our guys upstairs do a great job of finding the right kind of guys to bring in here,” the head coach insists. “I think we have a great locker room, a great bunch of guys that know how to be team guys, play together, work together. I think that’s really important. Case is really no different. He’s a kid that is smart, understands his ability and where he’s at and understands the offense. He’s quick, he’s energetic, he’s got excitement to him when he comes in there. He calls the plays well, he see things. He’s been through it before.” There was one surprise, though. “[The one thing] I didn’t know was that he could move around like he does,” Zimmer says. “I think that’s part of the things opposition teams have started to have to prepare for now, the possibility of him running.” True, Keenum had been improving steadily, if unspectacularly, in his four full seasons, going from 5.6 yards per attempt in 2014 to 6.8 last year, and winning four games for a Rams team that looked hopeless for most of the season, but there was little sign of the meteoric jump from career back-up to commanding starter prior to that watershed game in Chicago in early October. Since then he has won shootouts (38-30 at Washington), dogfights (14-9 at Atlanta) and marquee matchups (24-7 against the Rams and both games against Green Bay). The one difference: he has had time to learn under inventive first-year offensive coordinator Pat Shurmur, who has looked increasingly confident of his own abilities after shedding the interim tag from 2016. Under Shurmur, Keenum has averaged a career-best 7.4 yards per attempt and failed to throw a touchdown only once. He has committed just eight turnovers in the 12 games since regaining the reins full time, and, more importantly, he has earned the respect of his team-mates. The Vikings’ only defeat in the final 12 games was on the road at Carolina, where Keenum was sacked a season-high six times (he is the sixth-best protected QB otherwise), but they are unlikely to have to travel again during these playoffs, unless Philadelphia somehow find some offensive mojo without the injured Wentz. Tight end Kyle Rudolph is in no doubt about who has been the key to the team’s scorching run into the playoffs. “[Case] has been huge. Our team is built with an incredible offensive line, two running backs that can run the football and a bunch of playmakers on the outside, and Case just kind of lit that fire for us. He makes plays happen [both] with his legs and throwing the ball.” Indeed, Keenum has added 160 yards on the ground, and a touchdown, to go with his career-best 3,547 passing yards and 68% pass completion rate, which is behind only the metronomic Brees of all 32 league starters this season. He is also second in passer rating against the blitz, staying light on his feet to take advantage of Shurmur’s schemes. “Number one, people [now] think of his ability to extend plays,” Shurmur explains. “I think it’s super important that you move the pocket for the quarterback. There are various ways to do that and we try to employ many of them. I think he moves in the pocket well, where he clears his sight lines, where he can make a throw. Those are all the elements of mobility. At some point when it breaks down and he has to take off, he’s done a good job of getting positive yardage. Typically, if you’re going to drive the ball against good defenses, a quarterback has got to do something with his feet. He’s been able to do that.” It is that running dimension to Keenum’s game that is the X-factor to Minnesota’s Super Bowl hopes, a fact acknowledged by guard Joe Berger. “It’s great to have a quarterback who’s mobile back there, who can extend the play and get the ball down the field,” he insists. “A lot of times he’s extending the play because something broke down. He’s making it right by fixing something you screwed up.” Zimmer has seen enough to know his quarterback’s value is underpinned by other attributes, too. After the 24-7 Week 11 triumph over the in-form Rams, the head coach made headlines with his comment, “The thing I like the most about Case is he’s got big balls. He’s not afraid. He’s going to pull the trigger and he’s going to play like that, so, you know, that’s a good thing.” By the same token – albeit with less colorful language – Atlanta head coach Dan Quinn praised Keenum for his “fearlessness” ahead of the Week 13 defeat of his Falcons. The 29-year-old himself remains on the same level-headed plane as his stats. Nothing too gaudy, nothing too extravagant, and plenty of down-to-earth realism. “13-3 has a nice ring to it,” he says. “At the same time, we have a lot ahead of us and we’re really excited about what’s coming up.” This season has definitely been a magic carpet ride, though, and he doesn’t mind admitting it. “It’s been a blast,” Keenum adds. “I don’t know if I can put into words how much fun it’s been. I always try to have passion. I always try to be in attack mode, and I always try to trust – my offensive line, my receivers, the play call, my preparation. “I like to think quarterback play is a craft that different people have. I think there’s a lot of different ways to play quarterback. You see it every Sunday from game to game. There are a lot of different skill sets, a lot of different ways to get first downs, to get touchdowns and to win games. So for me, I’ve worked on that craft my entire life. And it’s worked well.” He is still quick to deflect praise for the second-best season in franchise history. “I think it’s [down to] every guy in the locker room right now, every coach that’s in there. It’s all those people put together and we not only respect each other, but we like each other, too, and that goes a long way. Outside of the Xs and Os, we fight for each other. You go up and down the row in there and everybody feels the same. I think that’s pretty rare.” Rare or not, the ultimate irony is that Keenum could help Minnesota become the first team to play a Super Bowl on their own turf, and then depart for pastures new. He is a free agent come March and there will be no room on the roster for three highly-paid quarterbacks. The journeyman will command top dollar in free agency and, while the Vikings could still open up their coffers to keep him, the likes of Cleveland, Denver, Arizona and both New York teams will all be looking for a reliable signal-caller this year, and will have the money to back up their need. So, Keenum may not necessarily be back in purple come the start of the 2018 season. But he will be starting somewhere."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2018/jan/13/crystal-palace-burnley-premier-league-report","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-13T17:07:18Z","webTitle":"Crystal Palace revival continues as Bakary Sako strikes against Burnley","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jan/13/crystal-palace-burnley-premier-league-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/jan/13/crystal-palace-burnley-premier-league-report","fields":{"headline":"Crystal Palace revival continues as Bakary Sako strikes against Burnley","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"It says something about the change Roy Hodgson has effected on Crystal Palace that it is difficult to imagine quite how they could be relegated this season. Make no mistake, Hodgson himself is clear the challenge remains the same as it was when he took over in September and the club was rock bottom, breaking all kinds of the wrong records. “When I came, I said I was only concerned about the final day of May and being one place above the relegation zone,” he said. But after his scratch Palace side matched Sean Dyche’s Burnley in the gritty part of the game, and won it with the pretty side, their current position of 12th in the table would seem a more likely outcome. Bakary Sako scored the only goal of the match midway through the first half, drifting wide to collect Christian Benteke’s looped pass before driving into the box and punching a low shot through Nick Pope. The forward is a symbol of the Hodgson revival, the former Wolves man finally delivering performances that make the best of his combined skill, speed and strength. His total of five goals so far this season is Sako’s best return in his three years in south London, and this was just his second start. “I don’t know quite how many chances he’s had in the past, but he’s not done well enough to force his way in,” said Hodgson of Sako. “But he’s done really well for us. He would have played today given the injuries we had, but he played on merit and chipped in with a good goal. “In the second half, he and Benteke worked hard to disturb the centre-halves and help make sure we held on to our lead.” Palace were without at least seven first-team players for this match. Not only was Sako summoned up front, but James McArthur – “outstanding again”, according to Hodgson – was forced into an unfamiliar position at left wing. In midfield, Frank de Boer’s former Ajax protege Jaïro Riedewald also made a rare appearance and applied himself assiduously. There were impressive performances all over the park. This was particularly the case in the first half. The goal, celebrated with a collective puffing out of the chest, inspired Palace to kick on. A minute after the restart, Charlie Taylor’s back-pass header was seized upon by Wilfried Zaha, who spun it across an open goal, only for Ben Mee to get his body in front of it just in time. Benteke should have scored shortly afterwards from a Luka Milivojevic corner, but his header looped on to the roof of the net. As the period drew to a close, Zaha forced Pope into a one-handed save with a cheeky flick and the now purring Sako flashed a left-foot volley inches past the far post from Timothy Fosu-Mensah’s cross. Burnley were better in the second half, upping the combativeness and the crosses without ever quite finding the imagination necessary to unpick Palace’s well-drilled resolve. Their best opportunity arrived in the 83rd minute, when a missed clearance by James Tomkins let in Ashley Barnes, only for Wayne Hennessey to rush out and smother the shot at his feet. Sean Dyche knows there is no need to be flustered, despite a run that means Burnley are without a league win in six matches. They are still in seventh place in the table after all. “The second half was at least decent,” he said afterwards. “We probably deserved to scratch a draw. The margins were tight earlier in the season and they continue to be tight now. But it’s clear that we’ve really moved on from last season.” Dyche was asked about his thoughts on Hodgson’s achievements and the younger Englishman did not hold back in his praise of the 70-year-old. “He’s doing terrific,” he said. “We met for a coffee before the game. We were chewing the fat over the realities and the non-realities of the modern game. Sometimes Roy gets mixed reviews, but the levels he’s worked at, the things he’s achieved, he gets nothing but respect from me. “He’s settled it down nicely here, but it’s not a surprise to me; it is down to Roy and his staff putting in the work.“"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jan/15/alexa-whos-in-charge-of-my-life-rhik-samadder","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-15T06:45:48Z","webTitle":"Dear Alexa, who‘s in charge of my life, me or you? | Rhik Samadder","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jan/15/alexa-whos-in-charge-of-my-life-rhik-samadder","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/jan/15/alexa-whos-in-charge-of-my-life-rhik-samadder","fields":{"headline":"Alexa, who’s in charge of my life – me or you?","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Got an Amazon Echo for Christmas, just like every other basic-issue human.

There’s clearly Stasi-like potential to a networked machine that is always listening to you, yet it’s also clear we’ll put up with any sinister technology – if it’s cool enough. It also has to work, though, and Alexa users have reported a few problems. Such as her randomly crying out in the night, like a ghostly child. Or autonomously flirting with the voice of Google’s electronic domestic, like a confusing, modern version of Upstairs Downstairs. Or adding “cancer” to one woman’s shopping reminders, instead of Pampers. Of the ways to receive bad news, that has to be near the top of the list. My Alexa and I have had our share of run-ins, like any two people who share a cell. I know smart assistants are still learning. That’s clear from her voice-recognition abilities, which are both incredibly impressive, yet also comically inept. “Play Woke Up New by the Mountain Goats,” I yell, before she starts blasting out Woke Up in a New Bugatti by Ace Hood, featuring Rick Ross. I spend 20 minutes convincing her “marmoreal” and “memorial” are different words (don’t ask how she did with “formication”). “Alexa, what year was Alphabet Street by Prince released?” I ask. “Here is Elmo’s Rap Alphabet,” she replies, inexplicably pleased with herself. Training machines to communicate meaningfully with us is a long way off. They first have to develop what philosophers call a theory of mind, involving contextual interpretation, sensitivity to emotional and social cues and self-consciousness. None of the smart assistants on the market would pass the Turing test, and convince an observer they were having an intelligent conversation. Although, depending on the time of day, I’m not sure I would either. Right, guys, I need that coffee! Don’t talk to me in the morning! Or the afternoon! I can report a horrific twist. Over the past few weeks I’ve started communicating differently. At a recent gathering, where a few people were talking at once, I slightly raised my voice, and immediately a familiar cadence entered it. “KATE,” I said to my friend Kate. “BRING ME SOME MALTESERS. MALTESERS.” I’d got used to barking blunt requests, as if perpetually on speakerphone with an automated cinema-booking system, or ordering a beer in France. It wasn’t the best way to talk to her, Kate replied, in her own words, using a bit of volume herself. Still, things will get better. An Amazon executive recently noted, in glowing terms, that since far-field microphones had been introduced to Fire TV, users were starting to speak in entire sentences, and asking her different questions. “They are starting to express a lot more intent.” He’s not talking about the machine, he’s talking about you. That’s where the current wave of AI is leading us. We’re not training Alexa. She is training us. My Kodak moment? I no longer understand the news Saw some interesting news recently – OK, I’m lying. I saw some news. It was this: “Kodak company shares soaring after jumping on crypto currency craze.” First, that’s not news. At best, it’s a mediocre tongue-twister. It’s also a sequence of words that couldn’t be more mysterious to me if they’d been scrawled in Aramaic and stuffed in a buried chest. I assume it means Kodak have decided to make their own money; understandable, as they’ve been losing it for years. But I didn’t know companies could just reinvent themselves like Madonna. It’s a disorienting world, where Microsoft might suddenly focus on selling secondhand cellos, or Bonne Maman start manufacturing arms. What about the cryptocurrencies bit? That’s easier: cryptocurrencies are decentralised digital assets, built from blocks, which are released acyclically, from block-lattice nodes. These can be mined by investors, who digitally shrink themselves and enter the internet, to harvest them in special caps, while avoiding anyone in a suit played by the actor Hugo Weaving. The Kodak story isn’t just an absolute porcupine to get your head around, it’s probably also important, being news of the tectonic, economy-shifting kind that explains why in 15 months we’ll be fighting foxes for chicken wings and drinking from puddles. But it’s also boring. Civilisation will be dust before I understand cryptocurrency. It turns out what I actually like are simple, arguably banal ideas. Like Kodak, a company that makes camera film. Or used to. I should say that I am horrified by this attitude. For years, I’ve been on the lookout for a tell-tale sign I’ve suddenly grown old: a decisive physical falter, clusters of Werther’s Originals sprouting in my pockets. But the more I think about it, the more I realise this is it: I’ve reached a point where not only do I not understand the news, I don’t even want to. Is this what they call a Kodak moment?

Several of these lawmakers suggested lifting restrictions for immigrants from Haiti, El Salvador, and various African countries.” Colbert went on: “Trump reportedly said, ‘Why are we having all these people from shithole countries come here?” “Sir, they’re not shithole countries,” the host replied. “For one, Donald Trump isn’t their president.” Colbert then further discussed the president’s remarks, in which he also reportedly suggested the United States bring in immigrants from Norway instead. “You know what I’m saying?” Colbert said, impersonating Trump. “Norwegian people? People with blonde hair who need a lot of sunscreen. Do you get what I’m saying? I’m saying I’m a racist.” Trevor Noah of Comedy Central also addressed the president’s remark, which caused an outcry and even earned the derision of Republican lawmakers such as Mia Love and Carlos Curbelo. “Today, we were planning to talk about how South Korea’s president credited Donald Trump’s aggressive rhetoric for getting North Korea to the negotiating table,” Noah said. “And I was going to be like, ‘Wow, Donald Trump, looks like you did something right.’ And then he did something Trump.” Showing news coverage of Trump’s “shithole” quote, Noah responded: “Guys, I don’t know how to break this to you, but I think the president might be racist. Personally, as someone from South Shithole, I’m offended, Mr President.” “Not only does he think brown countries are shitholes, he thinks we’re never going to know what he said?” Noah continued. “Don’t get me wrong, it might take a few weeks, but as soon as the news donkey reaches our village we’ll be so mad.” “I know that everyone’s focusing on him calling countries shitholes,” the host went on. “I’m like, ‘Whatever, you can say whatever you want.’ You know what part really put it over the line for me? Norway. When he said where he wanted immigrants to come from, he didn’t just name a white country; he named the whitest country.” Noah then joked that Norwegians wear “moon-screen,” adding that Trump’s meeting on Wednesday with the country’s prime minister may have contributed to his remark: “It’s almost like yesterday, when Trump met with the prime minister of Norway, he was like, ‘What do you guys do with your black people?’ And she was like, ‘Oh, we don’t have any.’ And he was like, ‘Wow!’” Finally, Jimmy Kimmel also dedicated his monologue to Trump’s racist comments, and also a new Quinnipiac poll the president cited in a tweet. “The president had another preposterous day today,” Kimmel said. “On Twitter this morning, he did something very, very Trumpy. He tweeted: ‘In a new Quinnipiac poll, 66% of people feel the economy is ‘excellent or good.’ That is the highest number ever recorded by this poll.’” “True,” Kimmel replied. “The part of the poll he didn’t mention is far more of the people polled believe President Obama is responsible for this strong economy, 49 to 40%. And not only that, 63% of those polled said president Trump is not honest, and 56% give him an F or D grade for his first year in office. The same poll that he tweeted!” Kimmel then moved onto the bipartisan negotiations over Daca, the program which protects young immigrants brought to the United States as children. A deal was put in front of the president on Thursday, but he rejected it. “Apparently, what Trump objected to in the bipartisan plan was the senators from both sides who wanted to restore protections for immigrants from Haiti, El Salvador, and a handful of African countries that had to be rescued from difficult situations,” Kimmel explained, adding a disclaimer before noting the expletive Trump used. “Before I share what specifically he said, I want you to keep in mind this is an actual quote from the actual president of the United States,” Kimmel said, reading the comments aloud. “Listen, I’m sure the fact that the countries he described as shitholes are mostly populated by people of color, and the immigrants he wants from Norway are not, is a coincidence,” Kimmel said sarcastically. “If it wasn’t, it would mean we voted for a racist, like a real one, and we’d have to get pitchforks and chase him out of office.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2018/jan/14/are-we-heading-for-another-developing-world-debt-crisis","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-14T11:30:12Z","webTitle":"Are we heading for another developing world debt crisis? | Larry Elliott","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jan/14/are-we-heading-for-another-developing-world-debt-crisis","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jan/14/are-we-heading-for-another-developing-world-debt-crisis","fields":{"headline":"Are we heading for another developing world debt crisis?","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Global interest rates are rising. Poor countries are finding it tough to pay back money borrowed from banks in anticipation of a commodity windfall that never materialised. Stir in some dirty dealing that has seen funds stolen and what do you have? That’s right: the makings of another debt crisis. Poor country debt was supposed to have been sorted back in 2005, the year the Guardian changed from a broadsheet to its Berliner format. Now, 13 years later, we are changing format again and debt is back albeit in a different form. Last time, the focus was on public debt, money that poor-country governments owed to the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and individual rich nations – and which was mostly forgiven as a result of the Gleneagles G8 agreement in 2005. These days, the issue is private-sector debt and while as yet only a handful of countries – mostly in sub-Saharan Africa – are in serious trouble, the warning signs are there. The IMF and the World Bank both know it. Africa needs more private-sector investment because debt relief and western aid have not been enough on their own to bring about economic modernisation. And in the years immediately after the 2008 financial crisis investing in Africa was attractive. Debt relief and better financial management meant African countries looked more stable. The money creation process known as quantitative easing meant western banks and other financial institutions were awash with funds. Ultra-low interest rates in the developed world meant investors were scouring the world for higher yields than they could obtain at home. Many African countries were also exporters of commodities that were in high demand due to China’s rapid growth. Deals were done in which western banks lent money for projects in African countries, with the debt to be paid off by the proceeds of rising commodity prices. That was the theory. In practice, some ropey deals were done, of which a prime example is the one made in London five years ago between Credit Suisse and Russia’s VTB bank to lend $2bn to two companies in Mozambique backed by the government in Maputo. The money was supposed to be for a tuna fishing fleet and for a navy to protect the boats operating in Mozambique’s territorial waters. Credit Suisse and VTB trousered $200m between them in fees, but the loans were never revealed to the Mozambique parliament, the IMF, the financial markets or the Mozambique people. A report into the deal by the corporate investigations company Kroll concluded that the two companies were inadequately managed and had generated no meaningful revenue. At least a quarter of the money is unaccounted for, with some suspicion that it was spent on military equipment. Jamie Drummond, the director of the development campaign group One says that it is not clear the money ever turned up in Mozambique after being sent to two offshore companies in Abu Dhabi. For sure, though, not a single tuna has been landed. Mozambique has paid a heavy price for defaulting on the debt, which has been sold on to vulture funds. The IMF, miffed at being lied to, has suspended its programme and the loss of financial support has meant public services are being cut. The scandal has rightly attracted the attention of the FBI, which is investigating whether the banks facilitated corruption. Although this is a particularly egregious example of a deal that has gone badly wrong, Mozambique is not the only country in difficulty. The Jubilee Debt Campaign said that at the end of 2017, 28 countries were rated as in debt distress or at high risk of debt distress, up from 22 at the end of 2016, and 15 in 2013. The number of countries classified as low risk has more than halved – from 24 in 2013 to 11 currently. This is not yet a full-blown debt crisis but it could easily become one. The commodity boom is over, China is growing less rapidly and the cost of servicing loans taken out in foreign currencies is becoming more expensive as interest rates rise in the developed world. To lessen the threat of a rerun of what happened during the debt crisis of the early 1980s (when the windfall gains from oil producing countries were recycled into loans to Latin America) action should be taken now. At the international level, there needs to be better monitoring of how vulnerable countries are to rising debt. There is a certain complacency about the fact that most of the current debt is owed to the private sector; history shows that ultimately it will end up as public debt. For years, there has been a campaign for a bankruptcy system that would treat countries like companies. This, though, has been relentlessly opposed by countries such as the US and the UK, where the powerful financial sectors make money out of bad debts. Not only should western governments back a sovereign debt bankruptcy scheme, the should also insist that all new debt include clauses that offer protection from vulture funds, companies that seek to make a profit on debt they have bought on the cheap. Developing countries need to do more – a lot more in some cases – to tackle corruption, but so do the banks. One idea is a Transparent Lending Covenant, under which banks would make the full details of loans public. Interestingly, the idea is being pushed by Tidjane Thiam, who took over as chief executive of Credit Suisse after the Mozambique loan was agreed. It’s not hard to see why. The tuna deal stank in every way. It was bad for Mozambique, bad for the City and bad for Credit Suisse. • Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2017/dec/28/alastair-cook-ashes-century-australia","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-28T00:08:44Z","webTitle":"Alastair Cook savours Ashes century but rues not hitting form much earlier","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/dec/28/alastair-cook-ashes-century-australia","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/dec/28/alastair-cook-ashes-century-australia","fields":{"headline":"Alastair Cook savours Ashes century but rues not hitting form much earlier","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Alastair Cook was left with feelings of relief and frustration after his unbeaten century on the second day in Melbourne – the 32nd of his Test career – had ended a personal drought with the bat but came with the Ashes already in Australian hands. The former England captain had averaged 13 in the series up to this point, giving rise to questions about how long the left-hander’s 151-Test career might continue beyond the current tour, despite having only turned 33 on Christmas Day. But in reaching close of play on day two at 104 not out – bringing up three figures in the final over when smashing a Steve Smith long-hop to the rope – he ended a career-worst run of 11 innings without a score of 50 or more and capped the best day of a disappointing campaign for Joe Root’s side. “It was an amazing moment personally after my well-documented struggles,” said Cook, who had registered his seventh Ashes century and a first since his bumper 2010-11 series. “It’s frustrating it has come after the series is done, which hurts me even more in one sense, but there is a relief that when it got really tough I managed to dig in and score some runs.” Cook was not the only senior member of the England side to prove a point. Stuart Broad followed figures of none for 142 in Perth – when the Ashes were lost – with four for 51 on the second morning as Australia collapsed to 327 all out, losing their final seven wickets for 67. Cook and Root, 49 not out, then led the side to 192 for two by stumps. Broad insisted after play that international cricketers are always playing for their places by the very nature of their profession. It was something Cook concurred with when speaking to ECB TV before the third day, revealing his mindset as he went on to become the first England batsman to score centuries at the five major Australian grounds. Cook said: “When you’re averaging [13] there is no point in dying wondering – what is the worst that can happen? You can get a low score and get left out, I suppose. But it’s amazing what can then happen; you get more crisp footwork, more intent and suddenly you get away. “You can forget that when batting, the first 30 minutes can feel like the longest time, then the next minute you’ve been batting for four hours. It’s a strange sport and probably why it drives you mad. “You never – apart from [Australia’s captain] Steve Smith – cruise through a career and just keep scoring runs. There are times when it is tough because you are playing the best cricketers in the world constantly under some pressure and some days it is their day. When I went to bed I was proud because a couple of times in my career I have been questioned and been able to respond with some runs. “There’s a huge amount to play for because you are playing an Ashes series – we don’t want to go down 5-0 again.” On his own struggles, Broad added: “It was one of those weeks where you get your tin hat on and duck down. You have to go to that place as a sportsman, find something within yourself, get support from people around you and build yourself back up. “I was not as competitive as I should have been in Perth. I wanted to improve that. At the Waca I fell into the trap of looking to not to concede runs, instead of looking to take wickets. It’s a small mental change but quite a big thing for me as a cricketer. I’ve run in well here thinking about how I would get batsmen out.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"society/2017/dec/28/children-increasingly-used-as-weapons-of-war-unicef-warns","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-28T00:20:03Z","webTitle":"Children increasingly used as weapons of war, Unicef warns","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/dec/28/children-increasingly-used-as-weapons-of-war-unicef-warns","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2017/dec/28/children-increasingly-used-as-weapons-of-war-unicef-warns","fields":{"headline":"Children increasingly used as weapons of war, Unicef warns","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Children caught in war zones are increasingly being used as weapons of war – recruited to fight, forced to act as suicide bombers, and used as human shields – the United Nations children’s agency has warned. In a statement summarising 2017 as a brutal year for children caught in conflict, Unicef said parties to conflicts were blatantly disregarding international humanitarian law and children were routinely coming under attack. Rape, forced marriage, abduction and enslavement had become standard tactics in conflicts across Iraq, Syria and Yemen, as well as in Nigeria, South Sudan and Myanmar. Some children, abducted by extremist groups, are abused again by security forces when they are released. Others are indirectly harmed by fighting, through malnutrition and disease, as access to food, water and sanitation are denied or restricted. Some 27 million children in conflict zones have been forced out of school. “Children are being targeted and exposed to attacks and brutal violence in their homes, schools and playgrounds,” said Manuel Fontaine, Unicef’s director of emergency programmes. “As these attacks continue year after year, we cannot become numb. Such brutality cannot be the new normal.” Much of the fighting affecting children occurred in long-running conflicts in Africa. Across 2017: Boko Haram, the militant jihadist organisation active across Nigeria, Chad, Niger and Cameroon, forced at least 135 children to act as suicide bombers, nearly five times the number in 2016. Children have been raped, killed and forcibly recruited in the Central African Republic, after a surge in the sectarian conflict that has seized the country since a coup in 2013. Political and militia violence has driven more than 850,000 children from their homes in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, while more than 200 health centres and 400 schools have been deliberately attacked. In Somalia nearly 1,800 children were recruited to fight in the first 10 months of 2017, while in South Sudan more than 19,000 children have been recruited into armed groups since 2013. In Yemen three years of fighting has left at least 5,000 children dead or injured and 1.8 million are suffering from malnutrition. “2017 was a horrible year for the children of Yemen,” Unicef’s Meritxell Relaño said from Sana’a. Children have also been affected by conflict in the Middle East and in central and south-east Asia. In Iraq and Syria children have reportedly been used as human shields, trapped under siege and targeted by snipers, while in Afghanistan nearly 700 children were killed in fighting in the first nine months of the year. Rohingya children in Myanmar were subject to systematic violence and driven from their homes. More than half of the 650,000 Rohingya forced over the border into Bangladesh are under 18. Unicef has called on all parties in conflicts to respect international humanitarian law and immediately end violations against children and the targeting of civilian infrastructure, including schools and hospitals. The agency also called on states with influence over non-state parties to conflict to use their influence to protect children. Pope Francis, in his traditional Christmas message, drew attention to the plight of children in war zones. “We see Jesus in the children worldwide wherever peace and security are threatened by the danger of tensions and new conflicts,” he said, citing Syria, Iraq, Yemen and several African states."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2017/dec/28/missing-a-beat-half-of-population-never-see-a-uniformed-police-officer","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-28T00:56:33Z","webTitle":"Missing a beat: half of population never see a uniformed police officer","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/dec/28/missing-a-beat-half-of-population-never-see-a-uniformed-police-officer","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2017/dec/28/missing-a-beat-half-of-population-never-see-a-uniformed-police-officer","fields":{"headline":"Missing a beat: half of population never see a uniformed police officer","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Almost half of people living in England and Wales have not seen a uniformed police or community support officer on foot in their area in the past year, a study has found, raising concerns over the erosion of neighbourhood policing. The proportion who said they had not seen a uniformed officer in their area was 44% this year – up from 41% in 2016 and 36% in 2015. More than 80% of people questioned felt it was important to have a regular uniformed police presence in their area, but only 17% believed they had this locally. The results were part of a survey to gauge perceptions of crime, safety and local policing carried out by for HM Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire &amp; Rescue Services (HMICFRS). Of the 12,662 people asked, 25% said the service provided by local police had worsened in the last year, an increase from 20% in 2016. Despite the findings, most participants said they associated policing with positive attributes, while twice as many who expressed a view would speak highly about their local force as would be critical. Andy Fittes, general secretary of the Police Federation of England and Wales, said: “The findings of the survey are disappointing but come as no surprise. “There is no getting away from the fact that we simply do not have the resources to patrol as we once would have done. “Police chiefs are having to make tough choices and to prioritise things like terrorism and public order events and ensure that the critical incidents such as responding to 999 calls are dealt with. “All these have to take priority over walking the beat and carrying out the sort of proactive policing that the public wants.” But Richard Garside, director of the Centre for Crime and Justice Studies, said cuts to police officer numbers have resulted in a reduction in unnecessary patrols. He said: “Mere visibility is not a useful measure of effective and accountable policing.” The research also found a marked increase in confidence in the police to provide protection during a terrorist attack. More than half (55%) said they would be “very” or “fairly” confident in police dealing with such an incident, compared with 46% in 2016. The percentage saying they had not seen uniformed personnel in a vehicle in the past year was 12%. Matt Parr, an inspector at HMICFRS, said: “After a year in which the emergency services have faced some of the most challenging incidents in recent times, it is encouraging to see that the public’s confidence in the police to protect them against terrorism has increased markedly.” He added that the importance of visible local policing “continues to resonate with the public”. Sara Thornton, chair of the National Police Chiefs’ Council, said increased confidence in the police service is “a real testament to the courage and professionalism of all of our officers and staff”. She added: “We know that local policing is absolutely crucial to countering terrorist plots, disrupting serious and organised crime networks and safeguarding the most vulnerable in society, so all chief constables are working hard to ensure the service is as visible and approachable as possible.” A Home Office spokesman said: “Effective local policing has always been about more than just officers’ visibility – never more so than now, with crime increasingly taking place behind closed doors and online.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2017/dec/27/harry-kane-scoring-record-spurs","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-27T22:30:29Z","webTitle":"Harry Kane says scoring is great but Tottenham trophies would be better","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/dec/27/harry-kane-scoring-record-spurs","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/dec/27/harry-kane-scoring-record-spurs","fields":{"headline":"Harry Kane says scoring is great but Tottenham trophies would be better","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Harry Kane stated his ambition to add trophies with Tottenham Hotspur to the individual accolades he has accumulated as he reflected on a record‑breaking 2017. It started for the striker with two goals at Watford on New Year’s Day and finished with the hat‑trick against Southampton at Wembley on Boxing Day. The numbers have been breathtaking. Kane’s return of 39 Premier League goals from 36 matches in the calendar year has set a record in the competition, eclipsing Alan Shearer’s mark from 1995 with Blackburn Rovers, while the Spurs striker’s tally of 56 for club and country since 1 January has made him the leading scorer in Europe. Barcelona’s Lionel Messi finished with 54; Real Madrid’s Cristiano Ronaldo 53. When Kane broke through in 2014‑15, scoring 31 goals in all competitions, he was dismissed in some quarters as a one‑season wonder. The Tottenham supporters chanted that during the Southampton game while Kane’s team‑mate, Jan Vertonghen, would refer to it in a tongue‑in-cheek tweet. Kane said that it had been a motivation to prove he was no flash in the pan. “It’s probably something that’s always in the back of my mind,” Kane said. “I’ve always said that when people doubt me I want to prove them wrong – from a young age until now. That’s just my mindset. I’ll keep trying to improve. It’s a funny song for the home fans to sing. Hopefully I can keep doing it for nine or 10 seasons in a row. “I’ve always said that team trophies are what I want to achieve. We’ve got the FA Cup to look at, a competition we’ve got a good chance to win. In the Champions League we’ve shown we can beat the best and we’ve just got to see how far we can go in that. In the Premier League we’ve got to fight for the top four and see how high we can get. For me, it’s about winning trophies – that’s always the aim.” Kane has previously said that he wants to build a room at his house to display the match-balls he has claimed for his hat‑tricks. He has 11 in total – eight of them have come in 2017. “I still haven’t got anywhere,” Kane said. “I’ll have to boss my missus about and get a room somewhere. At the minute, they’re stored away in their bags. I’ll have to get them out before the end of the year and have a picture with them. I’m sure that will be a good one. “It’s just been a great year, with the birth of my daughter as well. The records are great. I grew up watching Shearer score goals and he’s been a role model of mine. To break his record is something I’m very proud of while the club and country one is great, too. It shows I’m doing it on all levels. “When you look at names like Messi and Ronaldo, I’ve still got a long way to go before I can be compared to them but this is a start and, hopefully, I can keep on improving and be up there one day. It’s always been the goal to be up there with the best players in the world. “To nick ahead of Messi and Ronaldo is something I’m proud of and it’s just the start. I want to be doing it year in, year out. That’s what they’ve done for seven, eight, nine years.” Kane has promised to treat his club-mates to a meal out in order to thank them for the service they have provided and Hugo Lloris, the Tottenham captain, joked that it ought to be somewhere expensive. “I bet he did,” Kane said, with a smile. More seriously, Lloris says that “the most difficult part is coming” for Kane, given that “the perception of him from outside is different now”. Lloris, however, has no doubt that his team-mate will be able to cope. “I’ve played with a lot of top strikers and, probably, he is the best,” the French goalkeeper said. “He never gives up and his mentality is very strong. If he scores once in a game, he wants two or three. He’s a goal machine.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2017/dec/28/liverpool-rhian-brewster-racial-abuse-england-uefa","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-28T16:28:00Z","webTitle":"Liverpool’s Rhian Brewster: ‘When I’m racially abused, I just want to be left alone’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/dec/28/liverpool-rhian-brewster-racial-abuse-england-uefa","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/dec/28/liverpool-rhian-brewster-racial-abuse-england-uefa","fields":{"headline":"Liverpool’s Rhian Brewster: ‘When I’m racially abused, I just want to be left alone’","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"In different circumstances there would be so much else to discuss when Rhian Brewster pulls up his seat for the first major interview of what promises to be a thrilling career. The young man – or boy, really – sitting here is not short of highlights when he looks back on 2017. He is a World Cup winner with England’s Under-17s, as well as being the owner of the golden boot trophy from the same tournament, and there will be plenty of other opportunities, almost certainly, in the future to talk about the star qualities that have established him as one of the rising young hopes of English football. Yet we are here, on his request, because he wants to talk about his other experiences over the past year and go through a story, at the age of 17, that can make you despair. He is speaking with a courage that goes beyond his years and he hopes, in the process, that what he says can go all the way to the top of the sport – if, that is, the relevant people are willing to listen. And, frankly, he could probably be forgiven for having a few doubts. Uefa, in particular, needs to pay attention because this is a cry for help and it all feels so desperately wrong that over the course of an hour a teenage footballer, still to make his professional debut, can recall seven occasions when he says he has been racially abused or witnessed the same happening to a team-mate. Five of the alleged incidents are from the past seven months. Two have been while playing for England and one occurred in the World Cup final when, amid all the golden memories of beating Spain’s Under-17s, Brewster says he can vividly remember one of his team-mates being called a “monkey” by an opposition player. To speak out takes courage because it cannot be easy for any player, especially one of his age, to go through the more excruciating details. Yet it is also clear that Brewster has been thinking about going public for some time and, importantly, that he has a strong support network in place. Mike Gordon, Liverpool’s co-owner, has been personally involved, ringing Brewster several times to let him know he has the backing of the people at the top of the club. Jürgen Klopp, the manager, is aware of this interview and full of admiration for what the teenager is trying to do. Steven Gerrard, one of Brewster’s mentors at the club’s academy, is the same. Troy Townsend, Kick it Out’s education manager, is in regular contact and Alex Inglethorpe, Liverpool’s academy director, is here to offer his support, sitting in the next seat as Brewster explains why he feels compelled to speak out. Liverpool, very understandably, are proud of what their player is doing. “I said to them that I wanted to do it,” Brewster explains. “They said I should speak to my parents before doing anything and see what my mum and dad think. My mum and dad are unnerved because this is not the first time. They’re angry and they don’t want it to keep happening. And they’re angry because nothing has been done about it.” Behind his polite smile and quietly spoken demeanour, he is angry, too, and the reasons quickly become clear when he explains, in uncensored form, what prompted Liverpool to submit an official complaint after playing Spartak Moscow in a Uefa Youth League tie at Prenton Park, home of Tranmere Rovers, three weeks ago. “I got fouled,” Brewster says. “I was on the floor and I had the ball in my hands. One of their players started saying stuff in Russian to the ref. I said: ‘It’s a foul, man, what you playing at?’ I was still sitting down at this stage. Then their player leaned over me, right down to my face and said: ‘Suck my dick, you nigger, you negro.’ “I jumped to my feet and the ref came running over because obviously he realised something had been said. He [the referee] said to me he couldn’t do anything because he hadn’t heard it and ‘the only thing I can do is report it’. I said: ‘Come on, then – let’s go and report it.’ He started doing something else and I said: ‘No, now.’ We went over to the fourth official and told him. I told Steven [Gerrard] what had happened and we made a complaint there.” It is jarring, to say the least, to hear the words that were allegedly used. But this, Brewster says, is only the latest in a long line of incidents where he has been targeted this year, starting with England’s encounter against Ukraine during the European Under-17 Championship in Croatia in May. England won that game 4-0, with Brewster scoring the second goal. Yet the striker also angered one of the Ukraine players after chasing a ball into the penalty area and colliding with the goalkeeper. “I didn’t mean to hurt the goalkeeper and I said sorry – just left it there. But then there was an incident [with the same outfield player] later in the match. It was a bad challenge and I pushed him. We got into an argument and he called me a nigger.” The Football Association lodged an official complaint but Uefa, with no video footage, concluded there was not enough evidence for disciplinary action. Nobody, however, has ever informed Brewster of that decision. To the teenager, it feels like the case “disappeared”. The next incident happened in September when Liverpool’s Under-19s, managed by Gerrard, had a Uefa Youth League tie at home against Sevilla. “We were on a break,” Brewster says. “A ball came down the left. I was trying to get up with play when one of their players started running across me, trying to block my line and stop me running. I grabbed him and he fell over, theatrically. He’s come back and said something to me in Spanish. We were arguing and then he said it.” The N-word again? “Yeah, and I’ve reacted. I was going to walk off the pitch and go straight down the tunnel, I was that angry. Steven grabbed me and said: ‘What’s happened?’ Obviously he realised something was wrong and he put his arm round me. I told them [Liverpool’s coaching staff] and they told the fourth official. But the fourth official told the ref their player had been accused of bullying. He [the referee] went to the player to say he had been accused of bullying and the player looked like he didn’t know what was happening.” The Sevilla player denied any wrongdoing and Uefa eventually ruled there was insufficient evidence to take disciplinary action. Liverpool, however, have understandable concerns about the apparent lack of investigation once the club had submitted a complaint. None of their staff was interviewed to establish if there were witnesses or why, as Brewster says, “a few challenges went flying in from our players” throughout the rest of the match. Brewster was never contacted for a follow-up interview and Liverpool’s belief is that neither were the match officials. It seems remarkable and it is easy to understand why Liverpool, and the player at the heart of this story, have doubts about the processes Uefa employs and the effort, or lack of it, that goes into establishing the truth. Two weeks later, Liverpool had another game in the same competition, this time flying to Russia to play Spartak Moscow, and Brewster was being substituted when his replacement, the Nigeria-born Bobby Adekanye, aged 18, ran on to monkey chants from the crowd. Brewster’s first thought was to support his team-mate “because I know how he feels and I didn’t want him to think he was on his own”. Uefa subsequently ordered Spartak to close 500 seats of their academy stadium for the next match and display a banner – “Equal Game” – in that section of the ground. But was that enough? “It’s not really a punishment, is it?” Brewster says. “It was nothing really, a slap on the wrist. They weren’t even using those seats. It would be like us being asked to close 500 seats at Prenton Park in a stand that was already empty. It should have been more severe – a whole stadium ban.” As for the incident in the World Cup final, that relates to Morgan Gibbs-White, a 17-year-old from Wolverhampton Wanderers, and maybe explains why there were a number of flashpoints later in the match. “Something happened in the box,” Brewster says. “As Morgan was running away, he [a Spain player] has called him a monkey. It was a goal-kick and I was getting into position. ‘Morgan,’ I said, ‘did you hear that?’ He said: ‘Yeah, yeah, I thought I was the only one.’” In the final minutes of that 5-2 victory, Brewster became embroiled in an argument with one of his opponents. “They were telling us to win respectfully. I started laughing. I said: ‘How can you tell us to win respectfully when one of your players has been racist? What about your team-mate being respectful to us?’” What has gone under the radar until now is that the FA reported the incident to Fifa in the hope that sanctions would follow. The FA followed that up last month with further evidence but, as yet, has not been informed whether or not any action will be taken. On the face of it, Brewster has shown impressive restraint not to have taken matters into his own hands. That, however, has not been easy and when it comes to the latest incident, involving the Spartak player, the London-born teenager had to be held back at the final whistle. That was the closest, he says, he has come to seeking personal retribution. “I remember a goal-kick coming up and going up for a header. I just jumped into him. They got a foul and the ref told me to be careful. After the game my team-mates were trying to grab me and calm me down. Alex and Steven tried to stop me. But I was so upset. “I didn’t even want to put in a complaint. ‘Nothing’s going to happen,’ that was my attitude. I was walking down the tunnel after the match and I was just swearing – ‘Fuck the system, it’s not going to do anything’, stuff like that. Obviously you have to do it [make a complaint]. But if something is ever done about it, that’s another story.” Brewster’s reaction that night led to newspaper headlines and Liverpool’s second complaint about Spartak in 10 weeks and, though he would like to be mistaken, he cannot help wonder whether Uefa is “only taking it seriously because of the way I reacted. If I’d have knocked him out, I would have been banned, 100%. Nothing has happened to him yet, and nothing might happen. I hope something happens and he gets banned but I don’t know if anything will.” Uefa has directed the matter to its control, ethics and disciplinary body but no date has been set for the hearing. The player in question is the 19-year-old Spartak captain, Leonid Mironov, who denies the allegations. His agent has described the complaint as “built on guesses” and “quite absurd”. For Brewster, the emphasis is on trying to remain positive and remember one piece of advice in particular when it comes to the people who have targeted him. “I’ve spoken to my dad and he says: ‘They’re only doing it because they can’t get to you – they have no other way. They’ve tried to tackle you and it’s not working so the only thing they can do is try to get into your head.’ I just think they’re haters. They’re doing it because I’m better than them.” It has still been a harrowing experience and the frequency with which it has happened, he says, does not make it any easier. Brewster is a resilient kid but he has clearly suffered. “On the day it happens, that night my head won’t be there. I just want to be left alone. I want to be by myself and left to think. The next day I’ll still be thinking about it.” It does not help, either, that there has been only one occasion when an opposition player has been punished, relating to a youth tournament with Liverpool in the Czech Republic in 2015. “He admitted he had said it and they banned him from the rest of the tournament,” Brewster recalls. “After the game he tried to apologise but I wouldn’t shake his hand.” Brewster was 15 at the time and even younger on the first occasion he was targeted, going back to his days in Chelsea’s junior system and a tournament in Russia. “I was warming up with a couple of team-mates. We were all coloured and there were monkey chants. There were about 10 of them doing it. I didn’t know what to do. It had never happened to me before. I told my coach and he went mad. The game was still playing and he went straight to the organisers to tell them what had happened and get the people who were doing it kicked out. I was 12.” The only small ray of light, perhaps, is that Brewster has never experienced anything of this nature from another English player. “If someone in my team said something like that [to an opponent] I’d pull them up myself: ‘Well, if you’re saying that to him, you’re basically calling me that as well.’ But it’s different in England. We have different players from different races, even in the lower leagues. They don’t have that in some places abroad. Every time it’s happened to me I don’t remember a single black player being on their team.” He nods in agreement when Inglethorpe talks about the solution being better education and again when Liverpool’s academy director says the first-team players from the relevant clubs should help that process. What Brewster would also like, however, is hard evidence that Uefa is doing more than merely paying lip-service to the problem. “Everyone stands behind the anti-racism banners. You have the adverts for Champions League games saying ‘no to racism’ in all the different languages. Idols of the game take part – but it still happens. “Before the last Spartak game I was talking to [Liverpool team-mate] Ben Woodburn and I said to him: ‘This doesn’t mean anything, I don’t know why I’m standing behind this banner anyway.’ We started laughing. It was a case of: ‘Just stand behind it, get your picture done and walk away.’ We did it against Sevilla and it still happened, we did it against Spartak away and we did it in the Euros. I’m thinking to myself: ‘Well, I’m standing behind a banner but does it really stop them from saying it?’ To be honest, I don’t think there is any point. It needs more severe punishments. “I love the game. I’m never going to stop loving it. It’s just disappointing to know it’s still in the game. If it wasn’t in the game, it would be so much better. You wouldn’t have to worry about playing abroad, worrying about what the fans are going to say, or what another player is going to say. I wouldn’t have to worry that if I score they are going to call me all types of names.” All he can do is try to effect change and hope, without any real experience of these matters, that the voice of a 17-year-old may be heard. He has done his bit, speaking with clarity and distinction, and though it was not ever his intention he has also shown a strength of personality that makes it clear why the people at Anfield think so highly of him. Now, more than anything, he hopes he can be proven wrong. “I don’t think Uefa take this thing seriously. They don’t really care. That is how it feels anyway, like it has been brushed under the carpet.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"politics/2017/dec/27/michael-heseltine-theresa-may-urged-withdraw-tory-whip-brexit-comments","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-27T19:43:17Z","webTitle":"Theresa May urged to withdraw Tory whip from Michael Heseltine","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/dec/27/michael-heseltine-theresa-may-urged-withdraw-tory-whip-brexit-comments","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/dec/27/michael-heseltine-theresa-may-urged-withdraw-tory-whip-brexit-comments","fields":{"headline":"Theresa May urged to withdraw Tory whip from Michael Heseltine","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Theresa May has been urged by leading Brexit supporters to withdraw the Conservative whip from Michael Heseltine over his “unprecedented” comments suggesting a Jeremy Corbyn government might be preferable to leaving the EU. Norman Tebbit, the former cabinet minister and arch-Brexiter, questioned his former colleague’s loyalty to his country and said the peer should be banned from the Tory benches in the Lords. “I think it is unprecedented for a man in receipt of the Conservative whip to suggest that a Corbyn government would be preferable to a British government governing the UK, given that the alternative he is advocating is Brussels,” he said. “It must call into question whether his loyalty is to the UK or a foreign power.” The Bow Group, a rightwing Conservative pressure group whose patrons include Norman Lamont and John Redwood, said: “Heseltine has made clear it is his aim to prevent Brexit at all costs, including the sabotage of his own party and nation. “The Conservative party must therefore withdraw the whip and end the inevitable continuation of his sniping from inside the tent.” Tebbit, a former Conservative cabinet minister, said the Bow Group was “absolutely right to make this call”. Another Brexit supporter, the Tory MP Nigel Evans, told the Sun: “Only a Euro fanatic of the pedigree of Michael Heseltine could believe that a Venezuela-loving Corbyn government would be preferable to leaving his beloved EU. “A run on the pound and a return to the damaging, state-controlled industries of the 60s would inflict immense damage on the UK.” Lord Heseltine incurred the wrath of his colleagues after the Guardian reported that he told the Limehouse podcast that a Labour government led by Corbyn could cause less damage than Brexit. The longstanding pro-EU politician signalled that he still views a Labour government as having a negative effect on the country but said leaving the EU could be worse in the long term. He also suggested Labour would eventually turn against Brexit and the Conservatives would be “left holding the baby”, as leaving the EU grows more unpopular. Asked what could happen under five years of a Corbyn government, he said: “Well, we have survived Labour governments before. Their damage tends to be short-term and capable of rectification. “Brexit is not short-term and is not easily capable of rectification. There will be those who question whether the short-term pain justifies the avoidance of the long-term disaster.” Heseltine argued public opinion was already beginning to move against Brexit and Labour would end up changing its current position to one in favour of the EU, which could put the Conservatives in trouble with their pro-remain voters. “If you look at the polls there is probably a bigger majority against Brexit than the referendum secured, but that, I think, will continue to happen and it will become more and more unpopular as people realise what it’s all about,” he said in the podcast, named after the declaration that gave rise to the Social Democratic party and hosted by the activist William Porteous. “When that happens, the Labour party will move, and the present government will be left holding the baby. “But then you have got to realise the present government is supported by large numbers of people as opposed to Brexit as I am. How long will they remain within the tribe and loyal to the party?” Asked about his comments, Heseltine told ITV News that if supporting a Labour government would bring a halt to Brexit he would find his loyalties divided. Peers cannot vote in general elections but Heseltine said he would hypothetically be “torn, because I realise the enormous damage that both these options [Labour and Brexit] represent. If there is a point at which we have to put party loyalty on one side and national interest and our own convictions on the other, then the national interest is going to win.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2017/dec/28/amazon-dumpster-death-homeless-man-frank-ryan","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-28T12:00:16Z","webTitle":"Death in an Amazon dumpster","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/dec/28/amazon-dumpster-death-homeless-man-frank-ryan","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/dec/28/amazon-dumpster-death-homeless-man-frank-ryan","fields":{"headline":"Death in an Amazon dumpster","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The day before last year’s presidential election, a hungry homeless man named Jonathan Manley stopped at a dumpster outside a warehouse in San Francisco. Unmarked on the outside, the building was occupied by Amazon. For those able to tolerate the grime and the smell, and who had no other choice but to risk eating expired or rotting food, the large dumpsters stationed there could be bountiful. Visitors say they have found ice cream, bananas, strawberries, grapes and frozen pizzas, not to mention cans and packaging that can be sold for pennies at recycling centers. The lid was too high and too heavy for Manley to flip open from the sidewalk, so he climbed the side, pulled the lid back and dropped into the trash. It was full of things to eat. “That’s when I noticed him,” Manley said. At the front, on all fours as if he was struggling to stand up, was a middle-aged man wearing a T-shirt, pants and boots. He had a graying mustache and beard, his hands were caked with dirt and there was blood around his nose. Manley tried to wake him but could not. He tried to lift him, but the man weighed too much and was too stiff. Poking his head out of the dumpster, Manley saw two passersby walking a dog across the street and yelled for them to call 911. When the paramedics arrived, they determined that the man was beyond resuscitation. ••• Dumpsters can be life-sustaining for people surviving on the streets. But a Guardian investigation has found that they are also implicated in dozens of homeless deaths. This has added resonance in San Francisco, where the economy hinges on the noncorporeal – algorithms, the cloud and the flows of venture capital – yet some 4,500 people sleeping outdoors still struggle each night for the basic physical necessities of existence. They subsist in the interstices of the new paradigm, or in some cases off its waste. Just inside the Amazon warehouse, visitors are confronted by shelves stacked with food, everything from peanut butter to tabasco sauce, Oreos, teabags and jello. The dumpsters outside of an Amazon warehouse in San Francisco, where the homeless man’s body was found. Photo: Talia Herman for the Guardian The view inside a dumpster at the warehouse. Photo: Talia Herman for the Guardian. In another room, staff hurriedly prepare bags of shopping. When they are ready, delivery people dispatch this abundance to the inhabitants of San Francisco. The garbage receptacles outside are not the first tech dumpsters to have attracted the attention of homeless locals. A few years ago, they responded with wonder and bemusement to a dumpster by a nearby Google warehouse. It “had every kind of food you can imagine”, said a resident named Michael Mundy. “They just threw it away, thousands of dollars’ worth.” But the warehouse closed down, and people had to look elsewhere. “All of a sudden,” said a woman who only gave her first name, Renee, “they started talking about Amazon”. ••• For about a week after stumbling on the body, Manley went through the encampments of south-eastern San Francisco, trying to find somebody who was missing someone. Thousands of homeless people die in American cities each year to little fanfare, and the Amazon incident barely made the news. Neither the man’s name nor the occupant of the warehouse appear to have ever been reported. At an encampment underneath a highway, he came across a woman who had strung up dried flowers around her tent and cultivated succulents. Cheryl Iversen, 49, had riotous, flaming orange hair, a personality to match and, fittingly, went by the name of Tygrr, pronounced “Tiger”. Manley told her what he had discovered, and she felt the burden of not knowing what had happened to Frank Ryan lifted. “I said ‘thank you’,” she recalled. “He held me when I cried.” Iversen, whose boyfriend Frank Ryan died in a dumpster outside Amazon, at her home on the streets of San Francisco. Photo: Talia Herman for the Guardian. An abusive childhood had led Iversen to run away at 12, and then to exotic dancing, a bad marriage and a heroin addiction. She calls herself a “functional junkie”. Over a decade ago she met Ryan, whose own origins are unclear. His friends said he was the son of a gold-miner. One suggested he had been sexually abused. He had lived in RVs in the Bay Area since at least the 1990s, making a living by scavenging scrap metal. On occasion he could earn thousands of dollars per haul, with which he subsidized meth and marijuana habits. He was never seen without a jug of milk in his hands and obsessively collected rocks that he hoped were meteorites. Iversen vividly remembers the day they got together. They were wading by a pier in San Francisco Bay, gathering stones that they could sell and placing them on a plastic float. As the tide rose, they sat on the float, and had to lie down when their heads started to bump on the pier above. He brushed her hair from her cheek and they kissed. A few days later, Iversen wrote a poem about it that she still remembers by heart. Cheryl Iversen’s poem, written for Frank. Photo: Alastair Gee for the Guardian. “He had such a beautiful soul, he was so smart,” she said. “He never once made me feel stupid for not knowing something.” Although they were not monogamous – Iversen described herself dismissively as a “side-piece” – towards the end Ryan had told her he wanted to settle down with her in a warehouse squat. When she last saw him he said he was going to look for ice cream. ••• For those so inclined, living out of dumpsters can occasion philosophy. “Almost everything I have now has already been cast out at least once, proving that what I own is valueless to someone,” Lars Eighner wrote in his treatise On Dumpster Diving. Eighner’s experiences were distinct from those of people who dumpster-dive as a lifestyle choice – he began when he was struggling to pay rent, and the day-to-day realities were brutal. “No matter how careful I am I still get dysentery at least once a month, oftener in warm weather,” he said. A Guardian review of news reports from the last decade has found at least 50 cases of dumpster-related homeless deaths and serious injuries. In some instances, the dumpster is simply the bleak setting. On Christmas Day last year, a Wichita, Kansas, man was found in a dumpster outside a bakery, and while a preliminary autopsy suggested he died of natural causes, his relatives could not fathom what had prompted him to get inside. In other examples, it is the act of trash collection itself that is fatal. A man in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, was tipped out of a dumpster and then run over by a garbage truck. In Forth Worth, Texas, a screaming man had a heart attack after the dumpster he was inside was picked up. More common are situations in which homeless people, sleeping in dumpsters or sheltering from the elements, are collected by garbage or recycling trucks and compacted along with the trash. This is why ruined bodies sometimes end up at the dump. In 2003, a woman sued a waste-management company for more than $10m after her brother was suffocated in this way in Portland, Oregon, alleging “reckless and outrageous indifference” to homeless lives. In an interview, her lawyer, Greg Kafoury, recalled the testimony of a garbage worker, who said that after picking up dumpsters with his truck he shook them in order to wake anyone sleeping inside, and taught his colleagues to do the same. Kafoury also remembers hypothesizing before the jury that, because six people had died in similar circumstances over the course of several years in Oregon, a state with a little over 1% of the US population, as many as 600 could have been killed in the country as a whole. The lawsuit “was a chance to save untold numbers of lives”, he said – but he lost. “Somebody needs to take one of these cases and go the distance with it because the case can be won.” On occasion, though, there are survivors. In November 2016, about two weeks after Ryan climbed into the dumpster, Marcus Baldwin did the same thing in Mount Clemens, just north of Detroit. Alcoholism had led to the breakdown of his marriage and to homelessness. Finally he found a job in demolition, but he still had nowhere to stay, and after work on a cold and wet night a dumpster beckoned. It was filled with cardboard and seemed clean. He fell asleep. Marcus Baldwin, who survived being compacted inside a garbage truck. Photo: Garrett MacLean for the Guardian. At around 5.30am, he awoke to “this beeping noise”, Baldwin said. “The next thing I knew, I was going up into the air.” Falling on his head, he was disoriented and in pain, and he had the sensation of having been dropped into a sewer. It was greasy and filled with rotten food, old clothes and construction materials. He screamed for the driver to no avail. About 15 minutes after Baldwin was picked up, the compacting process began. A contraption that reminded him of a snow shovel began to move along the length of the vehicle and pinned Marcus to an interior wall. “I could just hear my bones breaking,” Baldwin said. “It was just going through my legs like a hot knife through butter.” Both were shattered. Baldwin thinks he was compacted another five times, every quarter-hour or so. He tried to protect himself with a shopping cart. Eventually the driver noticed him and he was rescued, but owing to a bad infection doctors had to amputate his right leg below the knee. ••• The life expectancy of homeless people is only around 50; when he died, Ryan was 55 or so. His autopsy report gave the verdict of a methamphetamine overdose. At his wake, his friends poured some of his ashes into the bay along with jugs of milk and some buds of weed. His dog was adopted, and Iversen planted a garden of succulents and cacti near her tent in his memory. “I’ve never felt so right in my life,” she said of her time with Ryan, “and nothing has been right since. It probably never will be, and what can I expect? Such a big piece of me is gone.” In a statement, Amazon, which recently announced that it would host a homeless shelter in one of its new buildings in Seattle, called the death a “sad event”. Surprisingly, considering that Ryan appears to have dropped off the map long ago, the impact of his passing has reverberated far beyond a small homeless community in an obscure part of San Francisco. In the vicinity of Spokane, Washington, for instance, there lives a 34-year-old who is also called Frank Ryan. He is the late Frank Ryan’s long-lost son. Iversen at the memorial garden she made for Frank Ryan: ‘Such a big piece of me is gone.’ Photo: Talia Herman for the Guardian. In the late 1980s, when he was six or seven, he lived with his father, as well as with his father’s new wife and her daughter from a previous relationship. The younger Ryan remembers little of his father beyond a birthday when he was given a bike and shown how to assemble it. The two Frank Ryans were separated when the son was, as he describes it, spirited away by his mother. “Even if he was looking as hard as he could he probably wouldn’t have been able to find me due to the measures my mother had taken,” Ryan said in an interview recently. “I never harbored any ill will.” During an itinerant period in the western US with his mother, he said he lived in a van and slept on blankets on the ground and obtained food from churches and food banks. Now he has a young family and works in security for the federal government. Several months before his father’s death, the older Ryan re-established contact via Facebook, and they made plans to meet for the first time in three decades. These plans were interrupted because Ryan Sr accidentally shot himself in the groin while trying to remove the rust from a discarded handgun, leaving him hobbling and unable to work or pay for travel. He died before the meeting could take place. “The fact that he was hungry enough to crawl into a dumpster definitely was the hardest part,” the younger Ryan said. It “stirred up” his own experiences of homelessness. When the younger Ryan was taken away by his mother, he also lost contact with the little girl who was residing with them. Today Danielle Lent, who goes by the name Avalon, is 37 and lives in a town an hour north of San Francisco. Her memories of her stepsibling are warm, though the relationship between the adults was anything but harmonious. The older Ryan only seemed to care about the drugs he was taking. And one night, she said, he entered Lent’s room and sexually abused her, the first of several occasions. Lent remembers herself “just staring at the alarm clock, saying ‘when is this going to be over?’” Afterwards her mother did not believe her. Indeed, when the older Ryan became homeless, Lent’s mother took food and money to him. “My mom was so in love with him and he did all these bad things to both of us. I still have night terrors over all of this. I’m on anxiety medication.” Danielle Lent, Frank Ryan’s former stepdaughter, at her home in Vacaville, California. Photo: Talia Herman for the Guardian. The importance of finding her stepsibling was impressed on Lent by her mother. “On her deathbed she told me, ‘Danielle Marie, I have three wishes,’ and this is the last wish that she asked for.” For Lent herself, the relationship seemed like one of the best things from that time. At Lent’s request, and with Ryan’s permission, the Guardian put them in touch with one another, and on Christmas Day they spoke for the first time since they were children. “He said he’s not stopped looking for me,” Lent told a reporter afterwards. “And I never stopped looking for him.” “It seems more than a coincidence that out of the millions of homeless Americans that you could do a story on, it would be my father,” said Ryan. ••• The Amazon dumpsters continue to provide. On a Saturday morning earlier this year, a brown-haired young man wearing a varsity jacket cycled up and climbed inside in full view of passing cars and pedestrians. At that moment, the gate of the warehouse loading dock rose to reveal a staffer clutching some white trash bags. He moved to throw the bags into the open dumpster when he caught sight of the visitor. They locked eyes. The employee gently tossed the bags to the dumpster-diver, who opened them. A few minutes later, the homeless man got on to the bike, balanced a few items on the handlebars and unsteadily rode off. Do you have an experience of homelessness to share with the Guardian?

The painting, on an apartment building on Broome Street in the Lower East Side, was commissioned by a local street art foundation and made by a Swedish artist, Carolina Falkholt, as a companion to a similarly vast if more abstract vagina, further east on Pike Street. Falkholt told the Guardian her work was often about “not feeling ashamed of your body and who you are as a sexual being”. “I usually paint giant vaginas, pussies and cunts,” she said, “and since I had just finished one on the side of a five-storey building, I felt like a dick was needed. The wall space on Broome was a perfect fit for it. To paraphrase [the artist] Judith Bernstein, if a dick can go into a woman, it can go up on a wall.” On Broome Street on Wednesday afternoon, opinions were mixed. A laundry owner in the mainly Chinese neighbourhood, who declined to offer his name, said the image had made residents uncomfortable. “We don’t like it, and we hope they take it down,” he said. Avery Plewis, who was visiting from Toronto, wondered if the painting constituted a kind of visual sexual harassment. “It’s weird, because it’s so phallic that it’s beyond sexual harassment,” she said. “Harassment is often secretive but this is totally in-your-face.” For others, the phallus provided amusement on a bitterly cold day. Some noted the neighbourhood’s long association with street art and graffiti, including work by Jean-Michel Basquiat, Keith Haring and Richard Hambleton. “The colors make it very artistic,” said Lauren Deutsch, from Los Angeles. “I’d laugh about it but I wouldn’t want it myself. We don’t see anything like that in LA.” Three doors down, at Spring Studio, George Petridis was leaving a drawing class where he had been studying Leonardo Da Vinci and anatomy. “Walking out and seeing this is a massive contrast,” he said. “That’s what some people think of as art right now. It doesn’t offend me, but it doesn’t bother me either, and I’m not going to spend a lot of time thinking about it.” It turned out he would not need to. An NYC building inspector who had been called out to photograph the image and who did not wish to give their name said “after my superiors look at this, it might be out of our hands. It’s a decision for higher-ups.” But Katie Grinero, a building manager elsewhere in the city, indicated the likely fate of the painting when she said she considered the image to constitute property damage. “Imagine if somebody put that on your house without permission,” she said. “I wouldn’t like that. You can [have] it in your own studio, but I don’t think it’s appropriate for the streets with all the kids. It doesn’t teach anything.” According to the Low-Down NY, the blog that first reported on the installation, community leaders called for the painting to be removed as soon as it was finished. Naomi Pena, the district 1 community education council president, reportedly wrote to Baby Brasa, a Peruvian restaurant that runs street art foundation The New Allen, which commissioned the work, calling for the painting to be removed.

Thousands of people appealed on social media over the Christmas break to find Mariusz, a Polish construction worker, who left his £600 wages on the floor in the Alexandra pub in Wimbledon, south London, on 21 December. His first name, which was written at the top of the envelope, had been the only clue to his identity. Mariusz, who did not tell pub staff his second name, claimed the money on Wednesday afternoon after he correctly described the envelope and named the amount of money inside. Pub management then double-checked his identity on CCTV. “It was quite anticlimactic after all that searching. He just walked into the pub and said, ‘I’m Mariusz and I think you’ve got my money.’ Apparently he went back to Poland over Christmas, but he didn’t tell his wife he’d lost his paycheck,” pub manager Mick Dore told the Guardian. “He was a lovely bloke and he had tears in his eyes when he came in. Mariusz said his son had seen a photo of the envelope on social media and asked if it was him,” he added. Dore, who runs the pub with his wife, Sarah, tweeted last Friday: The appeal went viral after Harry Potter author, JK Rowling, and entertainer Alan Carr retweeted the post to their millions of followers. After claiming the money on Wednesday afternoon, Mariusz left a £50 tip for the waiter who found the pay packet on the floor of the pub last Thursday."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2017/dec/28/uk-economy-boosted-wage-growth-rising-output-adzuna-cbi-surveys","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-28T00:01:31Z","webTitle":"UK economy boosted by wage growth and rising output, two surveys say","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/dec/28/uk-economy-boosted-wage-growth-rising-output-adzuna-cbi-surveys","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2017/dec/28/uk-economy-boosted-wage-growth-rising-output-adzuna-cbi-surveys","fields":{"headline":"UK economy boosted by wage growth and rising output, two surveys say","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The British economy has received a double boost from reports showing signs of modest wage growth and accelerating output from businesses. According to a study by the jobs search engine Adzuna, the average salary for vacancies advertised online in November was 1.2% higher than the same month a year before – the first annual increase recorded by the website since June 2015. Meanwhile, a survey by the business group the CBI found firms reporting a rise in economic output. The studies are likely to reassure the Bank of England that the UK can cope with last month’s rise in interest rates – the first in a decade – when the central bank increased the cost of borrowing from 0.25% to 0.5%. The evidence of pay growth could also help it to raise rates again next year because higher wages could lead to firms hiking the cost of their goods and services to accommodate paying staff more money. The CBI survey – based on 642 responses across the distribution, manufacturing and service sectors – showed the balance of firms reporting a rise in economic output at +19% in the three months to December, compared with a balance of +6% in the three months to November. Growth was broad-based, with all sectors reporting robust volume growth at a pace above their long-run averages. However, the lobby group, which represents 190,000 businesses, warned that growth will probably slip to a more moribund pace over the coming months, stalling in the service sector and slowing elsewhere. Anna Leach, the CBI’s head of economic intelligence, said: “Private-sector firms are enjoying healthy activity levels as we approach the year end, but mediocre expectations for growth underline the ongoing challenges facing companies.” Adzuna said the average advertised annual salary in November was £32,598 across the UK. It said salaries had increased at a rate of 2.2% from a year before in London to stand at £39,457, while there was a decrease of 12.2% for graduates. Average pay for graduates was £21,814. However, the growth in wages still trails the consumer price index (CPI) measure of inflation, which rose at an annual rate of 3.1% last month. The Resolution Foundation thinktank said this week that earnings growth when accounting for inflation is expected to be zero over the course of 2018 as a whole, meaning the pressure on living standards is set to continue. So far, prices have been rising almost entirely as a consequence of the pound’s weakness since the EU referendum in June 2016, due to the higher cost of importing food and fuel to Britain. While the Bank’s first rate hike last month will help curb further price growth, it still expects the CPI to be above its target rate of 2% over the next three years. The Bank also believes the growth potential of the economy before prices begin to spiral has been lowered since the Brexit vote, meaning signals of accelerating economic growth could also push up the CPI."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"higher-education-network/2018/jan/09/university-awards-2018-the-judges","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-09T10:30:03Z","webTitle":"University Awards 2018: the judges","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/2018/jan/09/university-awards-2018-the-judges","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/higher-education-network/2018/jan/09/university-awards-2018-the-judges","fields":{"headline":"University Awards 2018: the judges","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Judging the 2018 awards will be specialists from within the Guardian and across the higher education sector in the UK.

Just how much hardship these cuts have caused in the past five years has been made plain in new figures from the Ministry of Justice. In the first nine months of this year, 3,234 alleged victims faced at least one family court hearing without representation – more than double the number in 2012. The situation had become so clearly awful that campaigners succeeded in getting some restrictions lifted. As of January, evidence of abuse occurring after five years have passed will be admissible, and the evidence of support groups will be allowed. Also, a wider review was launched in October into the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act of 2012 – legislation that removed more than £350m from the legal aid budget, leading to what Amnesty has described as a “two-tier justice system”. The idea that you can litigate in person, armed only with the simple sword of truth, is a romantic one. The reality is that legal processes are highly formalised, with amateur involvement inevitably causing expensive adjournments, foreseeable delays and multiple returns to court. Inadequate representation burns money and time. Inching back towards the status quo is not enough, especially in those cases involving domestic abuse. Even in 2012, an alarming 1,309 people were representing themselves, sometimes for the incredibly frustrating reason that the financial assets of the relationship they wished to escape looked healthy but in reality were still controlled by the partner who was allegedly abusing. It’s often said that it’s hard for victims of domestic abuse to represent themselves because they risk coming face to face with their abuser. It’s easy to understand why someone would be afraid to be in a room with a person who has hit and physically abused them. But that’s only part of the story. Physical violence is, in the majority of cases, preceded by psychological and emotional abuse. It’s in that period that the victim is primed to stay, even when the relationship becomes violent. Even if it never does become violent, psychological abuse can be more debilitating than physical abuse – and even harder to prove. The grooming is hard to shake off too. It fosters guilt and shame in the victim. She – though it’s by no means always a she – assumes a feeling of responsibility for the aggressor’s behaviour. But the really crucial thing to understand is that the primary motivation of the abuse is not even to make the victim feel bad. It’s to make the aggressor feel good, and in a remarkably creepy way. Not only does the victim assume responsibility, the aggressor also absolves himself of responsibility. His projection works both ways. She feels guilt. He feels innocence. He is not only able to make himself out as the victim, but he truly believes that he is. In a courtroom, for this reason, he can be every bit as convincing as he has been to his victim in the past. He burns with the injustice of it all. He wants his day in court. Abusive people are often arrogant and attention-seeking. Attention, positive or negative, fills the void they feel from their endless, exhausting flight from their own ruined nature. Courtrooms are great for that. Successful abusers tend to be the stars of the film of their own life. The idea of dazzling the professionals while subjecting their victim to abuse? It is a delicious prospect. They lie without guilt or remorse. They are not, very often, even aware that they are lying. So, there you have it. That’s why all victims of domestic abuse need legal aid and third party representation. What they fear most is standing in that courtroom and discovering that the trauma bonds still hold, the grooming still activates, and they start to feel compassion for the creature who is murdering their soul. A victim can leave a courtroom thrumming again with the idea that she asked for it. No one should ever be put through that alone. • Deborah Orr is a Guardian columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2017/dec/27/john-oliver-on-his-clash-with-dustin-hoffman-the-whole-thing-made-me-feel-sad","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-27T18:33:36Z","webTitle":"John Oliver on his clash with Dustin Hoffman: 'The whole thing made me feel sad'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/dec/27/john-oliver-on-his-clash-with-dustin-hoffman-the-whole-thing-made-me-feel-sad","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2017/dec/27/john-oliver-on-his-clash-with-dustin-hoffman-the-whole-thing-made-me-feel-sad","fields":{"headline":"John Oliver on his clash with Dustin Hoffman: 'The whole thing made me feel sad'","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"John Oliver has expressed regret over his handling of a public discussion in which he confronted Dustin Hoffman over claims of sexual misconduct. In an interview on Sky One’s The Russell Howard Hour, the host of HBO’s Last Week Tonight with John Oliver said he felt the dialogue had “failed”. “It wasn’t ideal but it became such a big story,” he said. “But it became about my questions rather than his answers. “The questions weren’t particularly remarkable, but his answers were … not great. That was the point of it. But it didn’t really go anywhere constructive, so the whole thing just made me feel sad.” In November, Hoffman was accused of sexual harassment by Anna Graham Hunter, who at 17 was a production assistant on the set of a 1985 TV movie, Death of a Salesman. Other allegations followed. Hoffman, who denies all allegations against him, issued a statement in response to Graham Hunter in which he said he was sorry if “anything I might have done could have put her in an uncomfortable situation”. Earlier in December, at the 92nd Street Y in New York City, the actor appeared with co-star Robert De Niro, director Barry Levinson and producer Jane Rosenthal for a panel discussion marking the 20th anniversary of the satirical film Wag the Dog. Oliver moderated the session. In an awkward exchange first reported by the Washington Post, Oliver raised the subject of the allegations and Hoffman’s response to them. The actor accused Oliver of putting him “on display here”. Hoffman also said: “You have indicted me … That’s not innocent until proven guilty.” According to the Post, the confrontation created a “testy” atmosphere in which audience members “argued volubly”. One attendee was reported to have shouted: “Move on. Let it go. Move on.” Another reportedly thanked Oliver for “believing women”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"}]}}
