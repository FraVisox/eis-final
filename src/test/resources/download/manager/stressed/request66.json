The Congressional Prayer Caucus Foundation (CPCF), which claims more than 600 politicians as members across state legislatures, is using the banner of “religious freedom” to impose Christianity on American public, political and cultural life. Sound familiar? The In Australia, the Human Rights Commission had been asked to investigate the National School Chaplaincy Programme (NSCP) earlier this year, but declined on the grounds Philip Ruddock was already reviewing the country’s religious freedoms for the government. In October 2006, the Howard government established NSCP to provide $20,000 grants for schools to employ chaplains. The Abbott government review of the national curriculum by conservatives Kevin Donnelly and Ken Wiltshire found that the Australian curriculum does not properly recognise the impact and significance of western civilisation and Australia’s Judeo-Christian heritage, values and beliefs. While the NSCP is formally not religion-specific, 99% of chaplains are Christian while only 52% of Australians identified as Christian in the 2016 census. Who runs the chaplaincy programs? How are they selected? In 2014, the Abbott government removed the provision to fund secular student wellbeing officers introduced by the previous Labor government, meaning all chaplains had to be affiliated with a religion. Following the invalidation of NSCP by the high court in June 2014, the government redesigned NSCP, with funding now being delivered via states and territories rather than directly to schools In 2018, there were 3,288 chaplains employed under NSCP in public and private schools so far costing the taxpayer almost $1b. Chaplains are sourced by and from various Christian church groups. These all have a Christian mission. Scripture Union Queensland, for instance, the largest provider of school chaplains in Australia, proclaims that “Our MISSION is to bring God’s love, hope and good news to children and young people”. Critics of the NSCP argue that chaplains are seriously under-qualified to deal with vulnerable young people, that it is not appropriate to have a religious worker in a public school, and that the money spent on the programme is better needed elsewhere, such as to help children with disabilities. The Australian Psychological Society has repeatedly criticised the NSCP. The director of the Black Dog Institute has expressed concern at the funding of chaplaincy over programmes backed by scientific evidence. Associate professor Andrea Reupert, director of Monash University’s mental health in schools’ project, described a chaplain’s comments to a student suffering from an eating disorder that she was “hungering for the word of the Lord” as inappropriate and appalling. Even the vice chancellor of the School of Divinity questions its propriety. What are chaplains not meant to do? The NSCP is clear that chaplains must not take advantage of their privileged position to proselytise, evangelise or advocate for a religious view or belief or perform professional or other services for which they are not qualified. They may not conduct religious services or ceremonies or lead students or staff in religious observances or deliver special religious instruction. There is considerable evidence that at least some chaplains are in breach of this directive. Parents must give their prior consent to the provision of chaplaincy services to their child. There is much anecdotal evidence to suggest that this is often not the case. What are the outcomes of the NSCP? A review of the NSCP was undertaken on behalf of the federal Education Department in 2016 with a low participation rate of only 477 (15%) of principals, 1,038 parents and a meagre 134 students from state, Catholic and independent schools. While the report suggests that “overall, there is a positive sentiment towards the NSCP and the programme was described with positive regard”, 61% of respondents were from non-government schools that are overwhelming religious in orientation. The review states that students were also supportive of the program but 49% were also from non-government schools. The report indicates that 9% of parents had experienced negative issues with the school’s chaplaincy activities/services. Further 42% of parents in public schools felt that having a chaplain in their school was disadvantageous. Hardly a positive appraisal. School chaplains or professional counsellors: If schools only had a choice 89% of school chaplains are employed in lower SES state schools. These under-resourced schools are glad to have any extra assistance. The websites of the various state education departments are quite clear about their duties. Schools engage chaplains to support the educational, social and emotional wellbeing of students. According to a review by the National School Chaplaincy Association the issues that chaplains were confronted with more frequently included “behaviour management issues”, “peer relationships and loneliness”, “student-family relationship issues” and “grief and loss”. These are undoubtedly serious issues that students require help with. The question is: Should it be chaplains providing that help? Chaplains deal with extremely serious issues for which they are not required to hold any relevant tertiary qualifications. This is concerning. Religious commitment does not equate to counselling competence. Money that is currently spent on employing those with sometimes little more than devout religious belief should be spent on employing individuals with university qualifications in counselling or psychology and relevant experience. Your child has appendicitis. If given a choice between an unqualified but very empathetic and dedicated first-aider, and a fully qualified doctor, who would you choose to operate on your child? As Professor Dennis Altman wrote, “our secular society is being eroded – one school child at a time”. We should either remake school chaplaincy as a proper welfare program or scrap it. • Dr David Zyngier is senior lecturer of education at Monash University"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"environment/2018/jun/19/endangered-australian-parrot-relies-on-government-deal-with-german-charity","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-18T22:19:54Z","webTitle":"Foreign donations prop up Australia's endangered parrot response","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jun/19/endangered-australian-parrot-relies-on-government-deal-with-german-charity","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/jun/19/endangered-australian-parrot-relies-on-government-deal-with-german-charity","fields":{"headline":"Foreign donations prop up Australia's endangered parrot response","bodyText":"The Turnbull government helped broker a $200,000 agreement for a German not-for-profit to fund conservation work for a critically endangered Australian parrot, bolstering criticism it is shifting the cost of protecting threatened species to community and philanthropic organisations. The western ground parrot is one of only three ground nesting parrots found in Australia and is one of 20 birds the government has committed to helping as part of its threatened species strategy. • Sign up to receive the top stories every morning But the parrot is receiving just $80,000 in species-specific funding from the federal government through its threatened species recovery fund to construct new facilities for “a captive breeding trial at Perth zoo”. The environment department says additional money to support the birds is coming from a $1.7m feral cat baiting program in WA and an agreement it “brokered” with a German parrot association for $200,000 for a western ground parrot project. The Association for the Conservation of Threatened Parrots, a Berlin-based not for profit, agreed to provide the funds in 2017 for work by the WA Department of Biodiversity, Conservation and Attractions to increase feral animal control, “monitor existing populations and enhance captive breeding methods”, an environment and energy spokeswoman said. Conservation groups say the international donation is an example of the government increasingly trying to move the cost of threatened species work onto volunteers and charities and at a time when it has been trying to stop not-for-profits from accepting overseas donations for political advocacy work. “Governments are increasingly trying to shift the cost of threatened species conservation onto communities and philanthropic organisations by touting the value of ‘partnerships’,” said Jenny Lau, the acting head of conservation at Birdlife Australia. “Under current levels of government funding, the ‘partnership approach’ is like government turning up to a bushfire with a garden hose expecting the community and philanthropics to bring the water bombers.” She said the lion’s share of the cost of threatened species recovery should still be taken on by the government, and there was a multimillion-dollar gap between what was needed for the western ground parrot and what had been made available. The parrot is one of the government’s targeted species and its own threatened species prospectus states $3m over three years is needed for projects. Lau said funding through the feral cat program was welcome, but it was difficult to tell how much of the $1.7m was aiding specific species like the western ground parrot, which is found in a single location in WA. Additionally, the government said the $80,000 it provided for work at Perth zoo would support a “captive breeding trial”, but both the zoo and the WA government told Guardian Australia there was currently no captive breeding program in place. Rather, the project, called the western ground parrot breeding program, was researching the reproductive biology of the birds to try to determine if a captive breeding program was viable. Three males and an older female are in captivity and breeding attempts have not resulted in viable eggs. It’s estimated less than 150 of the parrots remain in the wild after fire ripped through their habitat in 2015. The species’ only known location is in Western Australia’s Cape Arid national park and adjacent areas of Nuytsland nature reserve. Volunteers working with the species say the bird urgently needs funding for a translocation study to see if an alternative wild population can be established in another part of WA to try to save it from extinction. Paul Wettin, vice-chair of Friends of the Western Ground Parrot, said an application for federal funding for studies that would aid translocation work had been rejected by the government last year. The group is donating $30,000 to try to help fund this work. “If we have another wildfire like 2015, that population is gone, so finding an alternative location is absolutely critical,” he said. Wettin said federal funding for rangers doing monitoring work had also been reduced last year. Similar calls for assistance were made for the bramble cay melomys, an Australian island rodent that went extinct after officials failed to move some of the population to another location in time. James Trezise, policy analyst at the Australian Conservation Foundation, said the western ground parrot case showed the need for a thorough independent audit of Australian threatened species funding and its effectiveness. Earlier this year, Guardian Australia revealed some threatened species funding was not supporting projects that help threatened species. “It’s funny that as the government is clamping down on foreign donations it’s just facilitated a foreign donation for this species,” Trezise said. “This demonstrates once again that the government isn’t investing enough in the protection of threatened species. We need a massive increase in investment if the government is to be credible on addressing Australia’s extinction crisis.” A WA Department of Biodiversity, Conservation and Attractions spokesperson said the western ground parrot recovery team “is actively assessing potential translocation sites” and the department “is committed to the ongoing conservation and implementation of the recovery program for the western ground parrot.” “Recovery actions, including fox and feral cat baiting, surveying and monitoring, remain an ongoing priority. The assistance of volunteers, including the Friends of the Western Ground Parrot, will continue to be vital in helping to deliver these and additional recovery actions,” the spokesperson said.

Like a local, Abdul Ghafar Ghulami refers to the city as “Luhvul” and points out that aside from thoroughbred horse racing and Kentucky whisky, Louisville’s claims to fame are as the home of Muhammad Ali and Colonel Sanders. Ghulami, 24, is proudly driving an older model car. He smoothly navigates the sharp turns of the city’s overhead highway maze. The GPS tracker he consults is the only outward indication that he is not yet entirely at home in this city. Ghulami had never heard of Louisville until nine months ago. It probably would never have been on the Afghani man’s radar except for his inclusion in the first group of refugees from Papua New Guinea’s Manus Island to be transferred to the US under a refugee swap deal with Australia. The Australian government negotiated with the Obama administration for the US to take up to 1,250 refugees detained by Australia on Manus Island and Nauru. Ghulami was a computer science student when he fled Kabul because it was too dangerous to return home. The Taliban beheaded Hazara on the highway to his parent’s home in Maidan Wardak province, he says. He arrived by boat on Christmas Island and was transferred to Manus on 10 September 2013. He was recognised as a refugee in 2014, but nothing changed: “2015, 2016, 2017 as a refugee but same place, same detention centre, same bed, same restrictions. I live the same as a non-refugee, as asylum seekers,” he says. “All of us were hopeless and helpless, we thought we’d never get out.” In the last year he fell into a “deep depression”. ‘At first I didn’t believe it’ Suddenly, last September, Ghulami was given a few days’ notice that he was among those going to the US. “At first, I didn’t believe it,” he says. The first airlift of refugees happened with such haste, they were given all the necessary vaccination pills at once, leaving him dizzy. On arrival, he says, “I was just like in shock and I didn’t know where I am, how I’m doing.” When his regained his bearings, “I felt like I am just born now because after very long time in detention, I got my freedom so I feel very good. That was a great time for me”. A Pakistani refugee from Manus was also sent to Louisville. They were met at the airport by caseworkers from the Kentucky Refugee Ministries, a non-profit organisation. “Before we even arrived, they already took an apartment for us,” Ghulami says. “They pre-arranged everything so we came directly to our own house and started living.” The apartment was furnished with secondhand furniture, the fridge was stocked with food and they were given new clothes. Medicals were organised. They received US$350 a month for the first three months. Six weeks into his relocation, Ghulami asked the Ministries’ employment section to help him find a job. A Swedish-owned company producing cooking oils took him on. Working five or six nights a week as a machine operator has enabled him to move from the apartment where he was first placed. “It was not in a good area,” he says. For the first two years on Manus, Ghulami had attended English classes, but after that, he says, the detainees had no energy to study. One reminder he kept from Manus is a large dictionary he was given. He plans to study English again when he can afford to reduce his work hours. His caseworkers speak clearly and he can understand them, “but it is a little bit hard for me to understand local people”. After four years of incessant heat on Manus, a severe winter that brought snow was a shock and another challenge. “Last winter I had a really hard time in here without a car. I went to work by bus and came home by bus.” A couple of times bus delays made him late for work and his pay was docked. He decided a car was a necessity and took on extra shifts. His caseworkers organised driving lessons. Ghulami’s new apartment is in an older prefabricated two-storey row of flats in a leafy outer neighbourhood. It has carpets and a mismatch of furniture provided by the Ministries. There is no television. He shares with an Afghan migrant he met in Louisville. “We live very simply here,” he says apologetically. ‘I lost those years for nothing’ The years of being left in limbo on Manus have left an imprint. “That experience I think will always remain in the back of my mind. I can’t forget it even if I want, because we had a really hard time,” he says. No one in Louisville knows the Manus story, even the Refugee Ministries. They are shocked by his descriptions of his time there, he says. For the first few months in America, he found it hard to leave Manus behind. “When I was asleep, I feel like I am still there because I was sleeping in this one bed for four years, the same thing repeatedly, repeatedly.” He sought help and was given sleeping tablets and antidepressants, but the insomnia that plagued him on Manus returns intermittently. He still flinches and feels scared at sudden noise, a legacy of “the attacks from locals, from police, not one or two or three times but a lot of times”. He recounts seeing Australian guards taking away “trouble-makers” and beating them. In February 2014, the slightly built Ghulami was with a group of detainees who sought refuge in the corner of a compound as police and locals burst in and started savagely beating detainees, resulting in the death of Reza Barati. “A lot of firing of gunshots happened. A lot of people were injured and one Iranian guy died,” Ghulami says. Even now, he says, he jumps when he hears shouting, fearing something terrible is about to engulf him. “I am scared always, all the time.” How does he feel about the Australian government? “I don’t have any feeling about them. I am trying to forget them,” he says in a rising voice. “They are treating people unfairly. They are using people like a human wall to stop the boats. They are doing the same as people smugglers. “I feel very bad that I lost those years for nothing.” The land of opportunity The Pakistani refugee who arrived in Louisville with Ghulami went his own way. “It was hard at first because I didn’t have anyone to show me what to do, what not to do, from my own community I mean, just the agency and the little bit of English that I know.” He can speak his own language with a young student he met, also an ethnic Hazara from Afghanistan, who lives nearby with his family. Communications with his own family in Afghanistan are difficult, but he can speak to them by phone and for them, he says, the most important consideration is that he is safe. He also has phone contact with other Afghan refugees from Manus who have since been resettled in the US. He says he is “happy to have a normal life”. He hopes to resume his computer studies and looks forward with optimism in the US, “the land of opportunity to do what you like”. A tangible benefit of his new life is being able to cook and eat when he wants to. “It is a big pleasure,” he says. On Manus, meal times were fixed, and in any case, the food was mostly undercooked rice and overcooked meat. “Sometime when I am cooking, I get memories … the food was tasteless, it was just to feed people.” Now, he says, eating “completely belongs to me”. “No one can interfere with my life.’’"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/jun/18/ivan-duque-wins-election-to-become-colombias-president","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-18T10:20:15Z","webTitle":"Iván Duque wins election to become Colombia's president","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/18/ivan-duque-wins-election-to-become-colombias-president","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/18/ivan-duque-wins-election-to-become-colombias-president","fields":{"headline":"Iván Duque wins election to become Colombia's president","bodyText":"Colombia has chosen Iván Duque, a conservative neophyte, to be its next president after a long and divisive campaign that often centred on a controversial peace process with leftist rebels the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Farc). Duque, who opposes the peace deal, won in a second round runoff election on Sunday with 53.9% of the vote. His vanquished opponent, Bogotá’s former mayor Gustavo Petro – once a leftist militant himself – defends the peace process. Despite being the first leftist in the conservative country’s history to come so close to the presidency, he lost on the night, taking 41.8% of the vote. Many now worry about the fate of the fragile peace deal signed with the Farc in 2016, which formally ended 52 years of civil war that left 220,000 dead and seven million displaced. That deal initially failed to pass a referendum with voters outraged by its guarantees of softer sentencing for rebel leaders and guaranteed seats in congress. It was later amended and ratified by lawmakers, a move some viewed as undemocratic. Sunday gave them another chance to voice their disquiet. Farc’s wartime leader, Rodrigo Londoño, tweeted after the result: “We have lived the quietest elections of the last decades, the peace process bears fruit. It is a moment of greatness and reconciliation, we respect the decision of the majorities and we congratulate the new president. Now to work, the roads of hope are open.” Duque promised on the campaign trail to modify the deal’s most contentious components, something that resonated with voters. On a clear Sunday morning in Bogotá’s central Ciudad Jardín neighbourhood, voters filed into a school repurposed as a voting station when polls opened at 8am. “I am voting for Ívan Duque,” said Marcelo Rodríguez, dressed in a Colombian football shirt. “I want peace but we can’t have it without justice.” Others at the poll station were less convinced. “Amending a deal is the same as tearing it up,” said Andrea Gómez, a student. “Some people in Colombia won’t be happy without war.” Duque – who will turn 42 just before taking office on 8 August – will be Colombia’s youngest ever president, though his party, Democratic Center, has a coalition in Congress. He also has the backing of several industry leaders and, perhaps most importantly, ex-president Alvaro Uribe, still an immensely powerful – if divisive – figure in Colombian politics. Uribe, who dealt severe military blows to the Farc during his tenure from 2002 to 2010, led the campaign against the peace deal in 2016’s referendum. He was Duque’s earliest champion for president, having persuaded his protege to leave a job at the Inter-American Development Bank in Washington DC to fill a party senate seat in 2014. Duque’s opponents say is little more to than Uribe’s puppet, a charge particularly worrying given the hardline svengali’s authoritarian tendencies. While president, a state intelligence agency was shut down after Uribe used it to spy on the opposition, journalists and members of the supreme court. His military campaign against the rebels was marked by grave human rights abuses: thousands of civilians were murdered in order to falsely inflate combat statistics. Both men denied the charge, and accused Petro of being the real threat to democracy. Uribe, after voting in Bogotá’s historic Plaza de Bolívar, said that Duque was the only bulwark against Petro’s “destructive socialism” – the same force he said has mired neighbouring Venezuela in economic and political turmoil. Petro was reluctant on the campaign trail to distance himself from Venezuela’s late president Hugo Chávez, and with 1 million Venezuelans having fled to Colombia, many here worry that Petro could bring a similar fate. Duque’s market-friendly economic policies appealed to voters near the Venezuelan border, though younger and more moderate voters worry about his conservative social policies from drug policy and crime to abortion. The campaign was long and ugly, with stark polarisation revealed in the first round when Duque and Petro eliminated a handful of more moderate rivals. Now, Duque’s job will be build bridges between Colombians divided on ideology and the peace process, with the worst outcome being another flare up of civil war. “Polarisation is common in politics around the world,” Pedro Piedrahita Bustamente, a political science professor at the University of Medellín previously told the Guardian. “But here, where there is a history of internal armed conflict, it could be a dangerous thing.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"global-development/2018/jun/22/support-key-for-teachers-and-children-alike-in-kenyas-largest-slum-kibera","type":"article","sectionId":"global-development","sectionName":"Global development","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-22T13:00:23Z","webTitle":"Support proves key for teachers and children alike in Kenya’s largest slum","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2018/jun/22/support-key-for-teachers-and-children-alike-in-kenyas-largest-slum-kibera","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2018/jun/22/support-key-for-teachers-and-children-alike-in-kenyas-largest-slum-kibera","fields":{"headline":"Support proves key for teachers and children alike in Kenya’s largest slum","bodyText":"Three-year-old Joy and her sister Lavine, four, are surrounded by kitchen pots, soft toys and an old wellington boot. It’s mid-morning at Kidogo’s nursery and preschool, and the sisters are playing in the dramatic centre, a place set aside for children to invent their own games. Each corner of the room is dedicated to a different activity: music, stories, art or a quiet space for reading. The centre is one of the few quality childcare facilities in Kibera, an overcrowded informal settlement in Nairobi that houses 170,070 people, according to a 2009 national census (although other estimates have put the number significantly higher). Most centres are found in cramped rooms or homes, with one woman responsible for 20 or so children. Ventilation is poor and there are reports of babies being given sleeping pills to knock them out for the day, or children being locked in dark rooms. There’s rarely space to play. Joy and Lavine’s mum, Shammim Kenyatta, had to search hard for somewhere safe to take her two daughters. She found teachers in some centres were busy and didn’t notice the children. “It was still the morning and it was cold, but the kids didn’t have sweaters or jackets on,” says Kenyatta, who also noticed that children were dirty. Children at such centres are not just at risk of physical harm, but are missing out on stimulation and play at a crucial time for their development. But, says Lynette Okengo, executive director of the Africa Early Childhood Network, parents, particularly in informal settlements, have to make very difficult choices. “Poverty levels in informal settlements are really high. They really must go out to work,” she says. The women running Nairobi’s 3,000 informal childcare centres also face an impossible situation. Parents depend on precarious casual work, which means their income is irregular and they can’t always afford the fees. “Today somebody has gone to wash someone’s clothes, tomorrow the work is not there,” says Violet K Omweno, who trains women running centres through Kidogo, a social enterprise that aims to improve the quality of early years care and education. “It doesn’t mean that because the work has stopped the parent will stay in the house. The parent will say: ‘Please, have my child while I look for something to do.’” The legacy of NGOs offering free services in the local areas – along with a general lack of respect for women who run centres – makes it even tougher to break even, adds Omweno. Many cram in extra children in the hope of making additional money, leaving them completely overwhelmed. Omweno believes the training scheme will improve the quality of care and education the women provide, and help them to better manage their businesses. Women learn about the importance of play, responsive caregiving, and how to maximise their space and engage parents. Kidogo also runs its own, larger childcare centres and preschools, known as hubs, which in Kibera cost 1,500 shillings (less than £4) a month.Teachers in Kenya’s preschools – for ages four to six – are expected to have a formal qualification, but this isn’t always enforced. Critics say that, in any case, the training available is too theoretical and provides little preparation for the classroom. Those caring for children aged three or under require no official qualifications and centres are unregulated. This could be about to change. In Nairobi, the county government has passed a bill requiring all childcare centres to be registered, and is developing minimum standards and guidelines. A new national curriculum for preschools, which places a greater emphasis on play-based learning, has also been introduced. Early years experts welcome attempts to improve the regulations, but say enforcing the policies will require investment. “They will [actually] have to go out to 3,000 daycare centres and explain what needs to happen and visit them again to see if they’re meeting standards,” says Afzal Habib, co-founder of Kidogo. Regulations also need to be realistic. In Tanzania, where policies were introduced, it was decided that all schools must have three acres of land. “That’s completely infeasible if you’re working in an informal settlement,” he added. Authorities need to support women to improve their services, rather than clamp down harshly on those that do not meet standards, says Habib. Dr Teresa Mwoma, senior lecturer at the department of early childhood studies at Kenyatta University, recently conducted a study of daycare centres in informal settlements. She identified a number of problems relating to hygiene and nutrition but found these improved dramatically after operators had offered guidance. “Initially, having potties for babies, cleaning them after use, keeping them away from children’s reach, was a challenge. In fact, some centres didn’t have potties. But after the implementation of the [policy] project, 100% of the daycare centres had potties and had a special place to keep them.” The study only involved a small number of centres, she added, and support needs to be offered on a wider basis. Childminders need more community backing, and recognition, says Okengo. “They are providing a service under very difficult circumstances, they often don’t have the training that they need, the support that they need, even the resources they need. The county government needs to come in and recognise this is an avenue through which we can support our children.” Many parents and politicians aren’t aware of the crucial link between children’s early years and their later development. “You will find parents saying: ‘You are doing nothing here.’ You have to tell them we have to go step by step with these kids, because when we push them we are destroying their development,” says Pauline Ngina, headteacher of Kidogo’s hub in Kibera. “They [parents] want everything academic,” she says. “They say: ‘Wow, teacher you are just playing with us’. But I tell them we are doing the best for their child.” She adds: “Some of the kids are so dull when they come here because of their situation at home – maybe the mother has no time to interact with the child, to play. These small kids need attention.” Many parents work night shifts, or juggle more than one job. But parents who stick with the hub see the results. Children who arrived underweight a year ago now have chubby cheeks, those who were shy or withdrawn now happily play with others. Kenyatta’s daughters have grown up fast, she says: “[Lavine] was lonely at home. When she came here she learned how to socialise.” “The place [Kibera] that we are staying is not that nice a place,” she adds, but she knows that Lavine has a strong character. When Lavine saw another, older child push over a younger girl, she intervened. “She goes there and picks her up and says: ‘Sorry, sorry.’ And she walks up to the bigger child and tells him: ‘Stop, that is bad, don’t do that again.’ She is four years old.

People have been leaving tributes to the 22-year-old in the park since then, where thousands of people are preparing to attend a vigil on Monday night. • Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning A Victoria police spokesman said police had found the paint during routine patrols of the park about 3.50am on Monday morning. A number of items were seized from the scene and the police dog squad has been through the area. Fire crews had to use high-pressure hoses to remove offensive graffiti painted next to the tributes. “Police will ensure the markings are removed as soon as possible and the investigation is ongoing,” the spokesman said. On Monday afternoon assistant police commissioner Stephen Leane told reporters police were throwing intensive resources towards finding the vandals, and that a number of items had been seized. “It would be my joy to see these people charged and brought before the courts,” he said. “We will keep keep our cards close to our chest but we want to solve this.” Vigils will be held on Monday night and throughout the week across the country in tribute to Dixon, including in Perth, Sydney, Adelaide, Hobart and Launceston. Organisers of Melbourne’s Reclaim Princes Park event said all women should be able to walk home, “whenever we want, wherever we want, and assume we will make it home safe”. “Our bodies are not there for taking,” organisers wrote on the Facebook page for the event. “It is not up to us to keep ourselves safe when we know it’s up to men to choose not to inflict violence upon us.” People were angered by comments made by police after the discovery of Dixon’s body that women should have “situational awareness” and be “aware of your surroundings”. Leane said police would attend the event to support the community but that he did not want police to be front and centre at the event and that he wanted it to be for the community and Dixon’s family. Early on Monday morning the police commissioner, Graham Ashton, placed flowers at the makeshift memorial. “I just wanted to personally pay my respects and I felt tonight is a time for the community to be there … [I] we didn’t want to gatecrash that,” he said. On Sunday police issued a statement “to reassure the community that they can go about their usual business”. “People should be able to walk home at night without being in fear,” acting commander David Clayton said. “And offenders need to be held to account for their behaviour.” Jaymes Todd, 19, handed himself into police on Wednesday night after a police and media campaign, and he was charged with Dixon’s rape and murder. He has been remanded in custody and will next appear in court in October. The City of Melbourne, the state government and police met on Monday morning to discuss community safety. Afterwards the lord mayor of Melbourne, Sally Capp, told reporters that the state government was investing in additional and upgraded CCTV cameras around the city. The premier, Daniel Andrews, had also asked that the Melbourne Town Hall building be lit in the colour orange between 5.30pm and 7.30pm, the same time as Monday night’s vigil, Capp said. Orange is the colour used by the United Nations to symbolise a future free from violence against women and girls."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/jun/10/north-of-england-hit-by-39-magnitude-earthquake","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-10T12:30:15Z","webTitle":"North of England hit by 3.9-magnitude earthquake","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jun/10/north-of-england-hit-by-39-magnitude-earthquake","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/jun/10/north-of-england-hit-by-39-magnitude-earthquake","fields":{"headline":"North of England hit by 3.9-magnitude earthquake","bodyText":"Lincolnshire residents kept calm and carried on after a 3.9-magnitude earthquake with its epicentre in Grimsby struck on Saturday night. People used the hashtag #HullEarthquake on Twitter to share their experiences. “Picture fell off daughter’s wall around 11:15 and frame broke. Glad to know it wasn’t my DIY skills to blame,” one wrote. “Make sure to mark yourself safe on Facebook,” quipped another. “2018, things are bad right now, had to break out emergency rations ... Water running out ( ... of taps while I fill kettle for a cuppa),” wrote Twitter user Rich Peall, with a picture of some field rations. Yorkshire Tea issued a tongue-in-cheek alert on social media: “We’re hearing reports of minor tea spillages after last night’s #earthquake in Grimsby. Stay safe out there, people!” The British Geological Survey (BSG) said the seismic event took place at 11.14pm at a depth of 18 kilometres (11 miles), with its epicentre in the north-east Lincolnshire seaside town. No serious damage is thought to have been caused. The European-Mediterranean Seismological Centre (EMSC), an independent earthquake monitoring organisation, said it had received reports from more than 600 witnesses as far as 60 miles (100km) from the epicentre. The organisation also said it had seen a spike in the number of visits to its websites in the minutes following the tremor from areas as far away as Liverpool and Middlesbrough. The quake came nearly a decade after a 5.2-magnitude earthquake in Market Rasen, Lincolnshire, was felt across England and Wales. The largest earthquake this year took place in Cwmllynfell in south Wales on 17 February and registered a magnitude of 4.6. Despite the excited reactions online, the BSG said earthquakes of similar magnitude occur about every two years in the UK, with 8,000 larger earthquakes annually around the world. Glen Ford, a BGS seismologist, said: “It is of the size we would expect people to start reporting it to us, but it is actually much smaller than the one 10 years ago at Market Rasen, 30km from this earthquake, that was 90 times bigger.” Witness reports to the BGS included “the whole house shook for a couple of seconds”, “heard a rumble with a simultaneous trembling”, “the bed started to shake”, “the radiator jolted” and “thought it was a lorry crashing outside”. One witness from Walkington, near Hull, told the EMSC: “I felt the Market Rasen earthquake eight years ago. Today at 11.15pm I heard a low, weird rumbling seeming to come from the street outside, a quiet cul de sac, at about the pitch of a lorry, like a dustcart or gritter. It lasted about five seconds. “It was followed immediately by a cracking sound, like roof timbers settling in our eaves cupboard to the side of the upstairs bedroom where I was sitting. Quite scary and within a couple of seconds my first reaction was ‘earthquake!’”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"crosswords/cryptic/27542","type":"crossword","sectionId":"crosswords","sectionName":"Crosswords","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-21T23:00:11Z","webTitle":"Cryptic crossword No 27,542","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/cryptic/27542","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/crosswords/cryptic/27542","fields":{"headline":"Cryptic crossword No 27,542","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/jun/11/sainsburys-to-sell-vegan-fake-meats-next-to-real-thing-in-trial","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-10T23:01:05Z","webTitle":"Sainsbury's to sell vegan 'fake meats' next to real thing in trial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jun/11/sainsburys-to-sell-vegan-fake-meats-next-to-real-thing-in-trial","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jun/11/sainsburys-to-sell-vegan-fake-meats-next-to-real-thing-in-trial","fields":{"headline":"Sainsbury's to sell vegan 'fake meats' next to real thing in trial","bodyText":"British shoppers will soon be able to find “fake” meats – including burgers that ooze lookalike “blood” when cut open – in the chiller section alongside real meats, as Sainsbury’s announced its new vegan-friendly range would go on sale this month. As more people drop meat from their diet, shops are catering to consumers’ changing eating habits. Sainsbury’s is hoping to capitalise not only on the burgeoning vegan market but also the UK’s estimated 22 million “flexitarians”, who enjoy meat but want to reduce their meat consumption. In the US, the cult brand Beyond Meat’s plant-based patties are routinely stocked alongside meat products, which is central to the vision of the company – founded by Ethan Brown and backed by Bill Gates and Twitter co-founder Biz Stone – as it plans to expand across 50 countries and six continents this summer. Tesco is expected to start selling frozen Beyond Burger patties – made up of 20g of pea protein – by August 2018. It also recently launched the UK’s first plant-based steak in 400 stores, in a year-long deal with Vivera, a Dutch supplier. The trial by Sainsbury’s – in 400 of its larger stores – is a first for the UK where products such as Quorn are traditionally stocked in the veggie sections. Last week, Waitrose became the first UK supermarket to add dedicated vegan sections to 125 of its stores, offering 50 new vegan products as the grocer increased its plant-based range by 60%. The “lookalike” burgers and mince making their UK debut in Sainsbury’s on 27 June are made by the Danish manufacturer Naturli’ Foods – a leading developer of plant-based foods since 1988 – which says it has struggled to keep up with demand since their January launch in Denmark. The Naturli products are not designed to taste like beef, but have an underlying “meatiness” thanks to the umami flavour of almonds, tomatoes and porcini mushrooms. The burgers contain beetroot, which helps recreate the colour of raw, medium and well-done meat as it cooks, as well as adding a realistic meat “juice” when bitten into. “Our goal is to contribute to restore the balance between nature and man,” said Henrik Lund, the chief executive officer of Naturli Foods. “We’ve developed this product assuming that many people want to eat plants instead of animals, but are afraid of compromising on flavour and maybe even missing out on their favourite dishes such as lasagne or burger patties.” The range goes on sale after a major study claimed that avoiding meat and dairy products was the single biggest way to reduce consumers’ environmental impact on the planet. The implications of the proliferation of lookalike meats for the global food industry are enormous. The US beef industry has filed a petition to exclude non-animal products from the definition of meat, while in France a law bans vegetarian companies from calling their products sausages, mince or bacon. “It is absolutely incredible that supermarkets feel the need to try and replicate the great British beef burger with a ‘fake’ vegan replica which has beetroot juice as an ingredient to give the impression of fake blood once cooked,” said the butcher Stewart Collins, whose Muirhead business recently won the accolade of best beef burger at the Scottish Craft Butcher awards. “All our burgers are what they should be, 100% Scottish, 100% meat with no imitation or fake ingredients to confuse the consumer.” The Food Standards Agency, meanwhile, has launched an investigation into allegations by the Daily Telegraph that traces of pork were found in Sainsbury’s own-brand “meat-free” meatballs, and traces of turkey were detected in a Tesco macaroni ready meal, part of its new vegan foods line."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"environment/2018/jun/11/chris-packham-springwatch-warns-of-ecological-apocalypse-britain","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-11T05:00:11Z","webTitle":"Chris Packham warns of 'ecological apocalypse' in Britain","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jun/11/chris-packham-springwatch-warns-of-ecological-apocalypse-britain","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/jun/11/chris-packham-springwatch-warns-of-ecological-apocalypse-britain","fields":{"headline":"Chris Packham warns of 'ecological apocalypse' in Britain","bodyText":"He’s currently enjoying a great bounty of nature, from tree-climbing slugs to blackbird-gobbling little owls on this year’s Springwatch, but Chris Packham warns that we are presiding over “an ecological apocalypse” and Britain is increasingly “a green and unpleasant land”. The naturalist and broadcaster is urging people to join him next month on a 10-day “bioblitz”, visiting road verges, farmland, parks, allotments and community nature reserves across the country to record what wildlife remains – from butterflies to bryophytes, linnets to lichens. According to Packham, British people have normalised a “national catastrophe” and only see a wealth of wildlife in nature reserves, with the wider countryside bereft of life. “Nature reserves are becoming natural art installations,” he said. “It’s just like looking at your favourite Constable or Rothko. We go there, muse over it, and feel good because we’ve seen a bittern or some avocets or orchids. But on the journey home there’s nothing – only wood pigeons and non-native pheasants and dead badgers on the side of the road. “It’s catastrophic and that’s what we’ve forgotten – our generation is presiding over an ecological apocalypse and we’ve somehow or other normalised it.” Packham said he looked at the rolling hills beyond this year’s setting for Springwatch on the National Trust’s Sherborne estate in the Cotswolds and despaired. “How many wildflowers can we see? None. Where’s the pink of ragged robin? Where’s the yellow of flag iris? The other colours are not there. It’s not green and pleasant – it’s green and unpleasant.” Packham’s recent tweets have gone viral after he commented on the absence of insects during a weekend at his home in the middle of the New Forest national park. He did not see a single butterfly in his garden and said he sleeps with his windows open but rarely finds craneflies or moths in his room in the morning whereas they were commonplace when he was a boy. Since Packham first became passionate about birds, in 1970, Britain has lost 90 million wild birds, with turtle doves (down 95% since 1990) hurtling towards extinction. The State of Nature 2016 report (pdf) described Britain as being “among the most nature-depleted countries in the world”, with scientific data from more than 50 conservation and research organisations revealing that 40% of all species are in moderate or steep decline. Germany was revealed to have lost 76% of all flying insects since 1989. Packham said decades of losses were finally visible. Birdwatchers have noticed the skies are particularly lacking swifts this year, a summer migrant that is declining at an increasing rate – 51% over 20 years but 25% in the five years to 2015. Swifts are usually seen in 38% of the bird sightings logged with the British Trust for Ornithology in early June. This year they account for just 31%. Next week, Britain will become the first country in the world to dedicate a national week to helping swifts and Packham said Britain was home to more amateur naturalists than any other. The naturalist hopes his bioblitz will showcase their expertise as well as inspiring newcomers to nature – and farmers. “There are a lot of good farmers out there and we are going to celebrate their work as well,” he said. Strict BBC rules on impartiality mean Packham does not make “political” statements during live broadcasts such as Springwatch, which continues until the end of next week, but he vowed he would campaign against the forces that are destroying nature as soon as he could and criticised conservation charities for not doing more to stop pesticides and bird persecution. He added: “We need a peaceful public uprising. We need people to say we’ve had enough. We do that every time there’s a terror attack. We need a similar movement for nature. We need people to stand up and say we want action now. We have the ability to fix our countryside.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/jun/11/questions-remain-over-composition-of-socceroos-world-cup-midfield","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-10T18:00:10Z","webTitle":"Questions remain over composition of Socceroos' World Cup midfield | Ante Jukic","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jun/11/questions-remain-over-composition-of-socceroos-world-cup-midfield","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/jun/11/questions-remain-over-composition-of-socceroos-world-cup-midfield","fields":{"headline":"Questions remain over composition of Socceroos' World Cup midfield","bodyText":"Aside from the arguably flattering result, a number of talking points emerged from Australia’s 3-2 defeat to an experimental Germany side at last year’s Confederations Cup. Plenty of noise surrounded the tournament: from questions of its worth, to calls for the Socceroos to revert to a four-man defence. Lost amongst the chaos, however, was the performance of Aaron Mooy in the midfield. Having cemented himself as the Socceroos’ deep-lying creator, then coach Ange Postecoglou started Mooy as the most advanced midfielder – and it was a frighteningly palpable failure. Bert van Marwijk has since taken over but, with Australia’s World Cup opener against France on Saturday in mind, a differing tactical plan does not make Mooy’s deployment and performance in that game irrelevant. On the contrary, it highlights a critical issue for this current Australian squad, which is maximising what Mooy does provide and – more importantly – mitigating his flaws. To his credit, the 27-year-old is a player who always wants the ball and it is a trait that should be encouraged. Yet, from a technical standpoint, he strikes as a knock-off version of Toni Kroos. Like the German creator, Mooy’s prevailing attribute is his passing. Though ball dominant, however, he is not a particularly explosive dribbler, and, considering his laissez-faire attitude to defending, coaches must weigh up how important his distribution is. A fundamental principle in football is that where one receives the ball impacts what they can do with it. With Mooy, his movement minimises his options in possession. Where Kroos’ intelligent movement allows him greater possibilities to eliminate defenders with his passing, Mooy’s movement is apprehensive in comparison. He then must needlessly force passes when he elects to play forward. With Kroos and Mooy, selection around them has to be complementary in both attacking and defensive senses. Following the Socceroos’ final warm-up against Hungary on Saturday, there are more questions than answers with respect to the Socceroos’ midfield. Providing cover for Mooy in Budapest, Massimo Luongo played a largely defensive role, which meant his own assertive movement in possession was nullified. With Mooy also moving towards the ball in initial phases of play, this was exacerbated, creating static ball movement. Aside from struggling to incorporate Tom Rogić due to untenable space between them, 41.5% of the pair’s total passes for the match went to Trent Sainsbury and Mark Milligan. A further 18.3% went to Aziz Behich and Josh Risdon, with possession remaining in front of a compact Hungarian defence. Evidently, passing options and the consequent ability to penetrate defensive lines was largely hampered by their inert movement off the ball. In particular, Mooy’s pass map over the 90 minutes was characterised by lateral distribution. When one considers Rogić’s tendency to drift in and out of games at international level, this is a crucial factor. Coming back to that experiment against Germany in Sochi last year, Mooy’s continuous retreat to deeper positions, erratic receiving of possession under pressure and defensive lapse in Lars Stindl’s opening goal proved he is better suited to playing deeper in midfield. Yet, his defensive passivity and lack of recovery pace can also be exposed deeper in midfield, as evidenced with Leon Goretzka’s goal in that second half. In the World Cup qualification phase, goals conceded against Thailand, Saudi Arabia and Japan showed the susceptibility of Mooy and captain Mile Jedinak as the central midfield pairing. Meanwhile, it increasingly appears as though Jackson Irvine will be used as the substitute for Rogić, despite potentially being the best possible partner for Mooy in this squad. In essence, Mooy needs a breaker of opposition play next to him, but Van Marwijk is short on compatible choices. Despite psychological benefits to the Socceroos’ 2-1 triumph in Hungary, the win has failed to mask this tactical imbalance, which is critical irrespective of whether they are the active or reactive team in Russia. Nassim Taleb once wrote that abundance is harder for us to handle than scarcity, and it can ultimately reflect Group C as a whole, which has the potential to descend into a giant game of cat and mouse. All four teams in the group are undoubtedly more functional with the ball in transitional scenarios, and progression to the Round of 16 can be whittled down to which of Australia, Denmark and Peru assume the role of the reactive. The first group game is almost always key. Van Marwijk’s likelihood to implement a compact and reactive plan against Les Bleus in Kazan only amplifies the importance of finding a relative balance in midfield. When one weighs up what Aaron Mooy provides both in and out of possession with this in context, is starting him the best option for Australia?"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"technology/2018/jun/10/a-great-item-to-have-flamethrowers-sell-like-hot-cakes-at-elon-musk-sale","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-10T03:07:46Z","webTitle":"'A great item to have': flamethrowers sell like hot cakes at Elon Musk sale","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/jun/10/a-great-item-to-have-flamethrowers-sell-like-hot-cakes-at-elon-musk-sale","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2018/jun/10/a-great-item-to-have-flamethrowers-sell-like-hot-cakes-at-elon-musk-sale","fields":{"headline":"'A great item to have': flamethrowers sell like hot cakes at Elon Musk sale","bodyText":"Some may think it the worst idea in the history of capitalism, an irresponsible stunt by a pyromaniac Willy Wonka, but for Earle Tabula there was no better feeling than buying a flamethrower. “I love fire. I play with torches and gasoline all the time so this is the ultimate toy that I’ll play with for all my life,” he beamed, gripping his purchase. “I’ve bought a bunch of wood. I’m ready.” Tabula, 28, an IT company owner, was among approximately a thousand buyers who gathered in Los Angeles on Saturday for a “pick-up party” thrown by Elon Musk. The tech billionaire initially proposed selling flamethrowers as a joke, yet here they were, in rectangular white boxes, priced at $500, with a queue of buyers snaking around SpaceX’s headquarters pondering things to burn. A mariachi band played while customers received instructions in an industrial yard. Then they took turns shooting flames four feet (1.2 metres) long, reducing impaled marshmallows to blackened cinders. “Mind-blowing. I couldn’t believe I really had one in my arms,” said Tabula. He planned to ignite a beach bonfire. Jeremy Cross, 31, a film set caterer, said he felt bliss when he pulled the trigger. “I was freaking out. I was like, aaaaaaargh.” The Boring Company – Musk’s tunneling enterprise – offered 20,000 flamethrowers for sale in January. They sold out within days despite sceptics calling them just fancy blowtorches. A thousand customers were invited to the company’s HQ, opposite SpaceX, to personally collect the first batch. The remaining 19,000 will be shipped. It is all legal, though to avoid shipping or customs snags, Musk has renamed the device “not-a-flamethrower”. “My friends and family don’t believe I spent my wedding money on this,” said Stephanie Carrillo, 31, a physical therapist, who dipped into cash gifts from her recent nuptials. “I thought it would be a really great item to have in the house.” Wind blew her hair close to the nozzle during the test firing, she said. “I’ll pull my hair back when I do it in the future.” Her husband, Joe Carillo, 31, an executive recruiter, said he would use the device to toast sandwiches in their yard. “We’ll have to tie the dog up so he doesn’t get in the way.” A wind-driven brush fire erupted north of Los Angeles, shutting freeways and prompting evacuations in a stark reminder that much of California is tinder-box dry and ripe for another devastating wildfire season. That didn’t dent the Santa’s grotto atmosphere around SpaceX. Some people had flown in from Canada, others had driven for days from across the US to be part of what many considered libertarian-tinged whimsy. Musk played that up in a series of tweets which included a Dr Seuss-inspired ditty about terms and conditions: “I will not use this in a house, I will not point this at my spouse, I will not use this in an unsafe way, the best use is creme brulee.” The 10-page manual had additional tips: “Do not touch the not-a-flamethrower nozzle during or after use, as it could burn you. Wait at least two hours or until the not-a-flamethrower nozzle is cool before touching the nozzle. Do not point the not-a-flamethrower toward face, people, animals, or flammable objects. Always have a fire extinguisher and a bucket of water nearby.” For Musk fans, the flamethrower is further evidence of business genius: the svengali of reusable rockets and Tesla electric cars has found an innovative way to raise funds for a company that wants to tunnel under LA to create a subterranean transit network. Many planned to resell the flamethrowers, which are already fetching more than $2,000 on eBay. “Anything Elon Musk does is a collector’s item,” said Alex Shame, 52, an engineer. Tudor Melville, 62, who owns an electrical company, drove his Tesla from Arizona to collect 10 flamethrowers, nine of which he plans to sell. Children probably should not use them, he said. “Well, as long as they point in the air, it’s fine.” He added: “My family thinks I’m nuts.” Some misuse is inevitable, said buyers. “No doubt there’ll be some bad eggs out there who do something stupid,” said Carrillo. Tabula, the fire-loving entrepreneur, said he had “a bad feeling” about abuses. That might explain, he said, why the Boring Company told customers to not open the boxes “until we were way off the premises”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/jun/11/dying-refugee-on-nauru-barred-from-coming-to-australia-for-palliative-care","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-10T18:00:10Z","webTitle":"Dying refugee on Nauru barred from coming to Australia for palliative care","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/jun/11/dying-refugee-on-nauru-barred-from-coming-to-australia-for-palliative-care","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/jun/11/dying-refugee-on-nauru-barred-from-coming-to-australia-for-palliative-care","fields":{"headline":"Dying refugee on Nauru barred from coming to Australia for palliative care","bodyText":"A dying Afghan refugee held on Nauru will not be allowed to come to Australia for palliative care. The Australian Border Force has told 63-year-old Ali*, who is suffering advanced lung cancer, he is deemed to have “refused treatment” because he declined to be moved to Taiwan to die. He told the ABF he did not want to go to Taiwan because he did not know anybody there, was concerned there would be no translator from his language, Hazaraghi, and that there would be no one to perform the Shia Muslim rituals and ceremonies on his body when he died. • Sign up to receive the top stories every morning The ABF has told Ali he will not be moved to Australia to die. The ABF has also offered Ali $25,000 to return home to Afghanistan. Ali is a member of the persecuted Hazara minority and has been formally recognised as a refugee – he faces a well-founded fear of persecution in Afghanistan and cannot be forcibly returned there. Australia is legally obliged to protect him. Ali will stay on Nauru, where he is currently being held in the regional processing centre. Doctors have described the situation there as “totally inadequate” for a person requiring advanced palliative care. Doctors familiar with his case say his prognosis is “dire”, and his life expectancy is “a matter of months”. An on-island report seen by the ABF says: “He states that he is very scared and feels alone and isolated and that this will be made worse if he goes to Taiwan as he will have no supports other than the IHMS and ABF liaison with whom he is not able to communicate with. He feels that his case is hopeless and he is giving up.” Ali, who has a wife and children in Afghanistan, previously worked in construction during his five years held on Nauru but his illness has left him requiring around-the-clock care. “His health condition is getting worse, very dangerous every day,” a member of the Afghan Hazara community held on Nauru told Guardian Australia. “He is losing weight, it seems like he is going to die very soon.” Another community member said friends had pleaded with Australian officials for assistance. “But the ABF totally rejected his request: they said go to Taiwan for medical help; second option, go back to Afghanistan; third option is to stay here for as long as you are alive. “He is very angry, he is very upset as well. He said these people do not have a human heart.” Nauru sources say ABF staff on the island are concerned about the reaction of the refugee and asylum seeker community if Ali dies on the island. On-island ABF staff have made repeated requests to Canberra for intervention in his case. Sources inside the regional processing centre confirmed that high-profile or politically-sensitive medical cases were decided not by the ABF but by executive-level officials of the Department of Home Affairs: in some cases as high as the secretary of the department or the minister for home affairs. ABF recommendations from Nauru were often overruled at executive level inside the Department of Home Affairs. The decision to offer Taiwan as a medical transfer can only be made by senior home affairs department staff. IHMS, the Australian government’s contracted health provider on Nauru, refused to answer questions about when it had become aware of Ali’s critical health needs, when it first requested he be moved, or how many transfer requests it had made. The Department of Home Affairs, which oversees the ABF, said it would not comment on individual cases, but that medical transfer decisions “occur on a case-by-case basis according to clinical need, in consultation with the contracted health services provider and the government of Nauru … [and] with the permission of the individual”. “Australia has provided significant funding and support over a number of years to improve health infrastructure in Nauru.” On Nauru, the situation among the refugee population is already tense. The large cohort of Iranian refugees has been effectively excluded from the US resettlement deal by the presidential travel ban. There is also an acute and growing issue around child mental health. Australian courts have ordered acutely unwell children – some of whom are as young as 10 and who have attempted suicide repeatedly – to be moved to Australia. The deaths of refugees and asylum seekers who die in Australia from injuries and illnesses sustained in offshore detention are routinely investigated by the coroner. The death of Hamid Kehazaei, who died from sepsis after his medical transfer was refused and then delayed by bureaucrats in Canberra, has been before a Brisbane coroner, due to report later this year.

The 12ft 6in alligator involved was captured and killed. In a statement, the Florida fish and wildlife conservation commission said: “The victim of this tragic incident has been identified as Shizuka Matsuki, 47 years of age, of Plantation, Florida. This tragedy is heartbreaking for everyone involved, and our sincere condolences go out to the family and friends of the victim at this time.” A necropsy on the alligator that was captured in Silver Lakes Rotary nature park in Davie on Friday found a human arm in its stomach, the Sun-Sentinel reported. Search teams were then able to enter the lake and locate Matsuki’s body. A Davie police detective, Vivian Gallinal, told reporters a witness had seen Matsuki walking her dogs near the water on Friday morning. An alert was sounded after the witness called police to say they had seen Matsuki walking the dogs and then saw the dogs alone and barking. One of the dogs, a pitbull, was wounded in the attack. The dogs are now in the possession of the Broward county animal care and adoption. Residents told the Sun-Sentinel they had complained about alligators at the park. Davie’s assistant director of parks, Jeff Polhman, told the newspaper trappers had been hired in the past 18 to 24 months to capture the alligator, without success. Some residents said they had lost pets that wandered too close to the lake."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/jun/09/tommy-robinson-supporters-arrested-after-clash-with-police","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-09T19:22:06Z","webTitle":"Tommy Robinson supporters arrested after London protest","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/09/tommy-robinson-supporters-arrested-after-clash-with-police","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/09/tommy-robinson-supporters-arrested-after-clash-with-police","fields":{"headline":"Tommy Robinson supporters arrested after London protest","bodyText":"A group of Tommy Robinson supporters has blocked off a major road in central London in a tense stand-off with police, who made several arrests. Hundreds of demonstrators descended on the capital and blocked off the road around Trafalgar Square. Rows of riot police blocked the gate down the Mall leading to Buckingham Palace, where the Royal Family has gathered on the balcony after celebrating Trooping the Colour just hours earlier. The protest on Saturday afternoon was the latest in what appears to be a bid to secure the release from jail of the former leader of the English Defence League (EDL). Supporters chanted “Free Tommy Robinson” and hurled missiles and smoke bombs at police. Hundreds of supporters crowded on to an open-top sightseeing bus, waving union flags, while one supporter posed on the roof in a Donald Trump mask. By 6pm, officers had removed protesters from the bus and had kettled many of the remaining protesters on the traffic island overhead. Other Robinson supporters crowded on to the steps of Nelson’s Column and continued to chant slogans. A spokesperson for megasightseeing.com said: “Our London sightseeing bus was on its normal route when it got caught up in the demonstrations. The bus was stormed by demonstrators, and the driver and a small number of customers got off. “The demonstrators have caused a significant amount of damage to the bus, which meant it had to be towed away. We have reported this to the police, and will help them with any investigations.” Videos posted on social media appeared to show police being significantly outnumbered by demonstrators. The Met said that as of 6.30pm, one person had been arrested for possession of an offensive weapon, two for assault on a police officer, a fourth for possession of a flare and a fifth for criminal damage to a bus. The Met will now look at CCTV footage of the demonstration. Robinson was jailed for contempt of court after he used social media to broadcast details of a trial which is subject to blanket reporting restrictions. Leeds crown court heard how Robinson filmed himself and people involved in the case, in footage that was watched around 250,000 times within hours of being posted on Facebook. Robinson, who was listed by his real name Stephen Christopher Yaxley-Lennon on court documents, was sentenced to 13 months in jail on the same day as his arrest. He was given 10 months in jail for contempt of court, and an additional three months for breaching a previous suspended sentence."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"crosswords/cryptic/27540","type":"crossword","sectionId":"crosswords","sectionName":"Crosswords","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-19T23:00:24Z","webTitle":"Cryptic crossword No 27,540","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/cryptic/27540","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/crosswords/cryptic/27540","fields":{"headline":"Cryptic crossword No 27,540","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"politics/2018/jun/10/keir-starmer-urges-tory-remainers-to-vote-with-labour-on-brexit","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-10T11:16:44Z","webTitle":"Keir Starmer urges Tory remainers to vote with Labour on Brexit","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jun/10/keir-starmer-urges-tory-remainers-to-vote-with-labour-on-brexit","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/jun/10/keir-starmer-urges-tory-remainers-to-vote-with-labour-on-brexit","fields":{"headline":"Keir Starmer urges Tory remainers to vote with Labour on Brexit","bodyText":"Keir Starmer has urged Conservative MPs who want Britain to remain in the EU to vote with Labour on a series of crucial Brexit amendments that come before the House of Commons this week. As the Commons enters a momentous week, several votes – including on the customs union and the role of parliament in approving the final deal, known as the meaningful vote – remain close. Opposition MPs need only a dozen or so Tories to join them to disrupt Theresa May’s Brexit plans. Speaking on the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show on Sunday, Starmer denied Labour had let the Tories off the hook by refusing to seek membership of the European Economic Union. “We have pushed the PM all the way on the really big issues. The two really important ones for this week are the customs union and the meaningful vote,” he said. “And if – and I urge Tory MPs who care about this to vote for those amendments – if Tory MPs who care about those amendments vote with us, there is a real chance for parliament to change the course of the Brexit negotiations and bring some order where there is real chaos,” he said. Labour’s hopes of striking another blow to May’s plans faded a little on Saturday night when the prominent Tory remainer Amber Rudd urged her party’s MPs to back the government in the votes, which are due to take place on Tuesday and Wednesday. In a joint article with the Brexiter Iain Duncan Smith, the former home secretary warned that defeat could lead the government to fall. “Jeremy Corbyn will do everything he can to stop us. That includes cynically trying to frustrate the Brexit process for his own political ends, as he will try to do next week when the Commons votes again on the EU [Withdrawal] Bill,” they wrote in the Sunday Telegraph. They said that voting to overturn or water down a series of amendments inserted by the lords should be a “no brainer”. “It behoves us all to demonstrate discipline and unity of purpose in support of the prime minister. We cannot allow ourselves to become divided and risk losing the precious chance to go on implementing policies that transform lives.” With the government dependent on the Democratic Unionist party for its majority, Tory whips are expected to increase the pressure on potential rebels to ensure they have the numbers when it comes to the divisions. They may be boosted by the support of a handful of pro-Brexit Labour MPs. In further evidence of internal Tory party struggles, however, the Cabinet Office minister, David Lidington, defended the chancellor, Philip Hammond, following criticisms from Boris Johnson that the Treasury was “the heart of remain”. “I have worked with Philip for quite a few years in government now. He’s somebody who has accepted the verdict of the British people in the referendum,” he told Marr. The foreign secretary’s comments were recorded at a private dinner last week, where he also suggested that Donald Trump would do a better job of negotiating Brexit than May. Lidington, who is often said to effectively be the deputy prime minister, defended May’s handling of the negotiationsand confirmed that the Brexit white paper would be released in July. May, who is in Quebec for the G7 summit, criticised peers for passing the amendments and accused them of going far beyond their role as a revising chamber. “Let’s remember what the withdrawal bill is for. It’s about delivering a statute book that is ready for Brexit day,” she said. “Of course, the Lords has a revising role to play, but some of the amendments that were passed and the comments that were made went far beyond that. “You had peers talking about stopping Brexit or trying to tie the government’s hands in the negotiations. This government is delivering on the decision made by the country in the referendum to leave the EU, and we will not accept anything that prevents us from taking back control of our money, laws and borders.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/jun/11/lack-of-data-hampers-theresa-mays-efforts-on-racial-inequality","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-10T23:01:05Z","webTitle":"Lack of data hampers Theresa May's efforts on racial inequality","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/11/lack-of-data-hampers-theresa-mays-efforts-on-racial-inequality","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/11/lack-of-data-hampers-theresa-mays-efforts-on-racial-inequality","fields":{"headline":"Lack of data hampers Theresa May's efforts on racial inequality","bodyText":"Theresa May’s efforts to tackle racial disparity in public services are being hampered by poor data-gathering in Whitehall, MPs have warned. The House of Commons’ women and equalities committee welcomed the launch of the prime minister’s groundbreaking race disparity audit after she entered Downing Street in 2016, but said that without robust ethnicity data, government departments would remain ignorant of the “uncomfortable truths” they were supposed to be addressing. Among the findings of its first report, published in October 2017, were that: • Chinese and Asian secondary school pupils outperformed their white and black counterparts; • Black men were more than three times as likely to be arrested as white men; • The unemployment rate for black, Asian and minority ethnic people was nearly double that of white British adults. However, the committee said that without consistent data departments would struggle to develop the policies needed to address such inequalities. “It is clear that public services are not currently collecting ethnicity data in a streamlined fashion and that some agencies are not collecting data at all,” it said. “Clear and measurable plans are needed for improving the consistency and robustness of the data and turning it into a set of cross-government priorities for action to reduce the disparities shown by the audit.” The committee’s chair, Maria Miller, said: “We strongly commend the principle and sound intentions of the race disparity audit. As the prime minister has said herself, it has helped expose many uncomfortable truths. “However, the picture at present is that data collection across different areas of government and public services is inconsistent, not properly joined up and in some cases just isn’t happening. That isn’t good enough.” A Cabinet Office spokeswoman said: “This government is determined to build a society that works for everyone and we have not shied away from exposing uncomfortable truths that need to be addressed. It is encouraging that the committee has recognised the race disparity audit as an exemplary programme for tackling injustices. “The government has already taken action to address disparities it highlighted, and will set out in its response to the committee how it will continue to do so as we build a fairer society for everyone.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/live/2018/jun/10/rafael-nadal-v-dominic-thiem-french-open-2018-mens-final-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-10T16:13:22Z","webTitle":"French Open 2018: Rafael Nadal beats Dominic Thiem in men's final – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2018/jun/10/rafael-nadal-v-dominic-thiem-french-open-2018-mens-final-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/live/2018/jun/10/rafael-nadal-v-dominic-thiem-french-open-2018-mens-final-live","fields":{"headline":"French Open 2018: Rafael Nadal beats Dominic Thiem in men's final – as it happened","bodyText":"Rafael Nadal walks up to collect the trophy from Ken Rosewall. It’s his 11th French Open title and it still feels sweet. The tears trickle down his cheeks and he isn’t finished yet. It’s his 17th grand slam title, taking him three behind Roger Federer, who’ll have designs on extending the gap at Wimbledon next month. That’s all from me. The 2018 French Open is over. Rafael Nadal is the men’s champion. What’s new? Thanks for reading and emailing over the past fortnight. See you at SW19! Bye. It’s the first time since 1992 that the top seeds have won the men’s and the women’s singles. Jim Courier and Monica Seles were the victorious pair 26 years ago, the Rafa Nadal and Simona Halep of their day. Ken Rosewall, the great Australian champion, will present the trophy to Nadal today. “I was first here as a 17-year-old. Sixty-three years later I’m here to present the trophy. I’m very pleased I’m not playing today. The players of today are exceptional athletes and tennis players. No words can express what we feel about Rafa’s game and what he has done for tennis. The match today? We would have liked to see a few more sets but Rafa was too good and I think Dominic was a little disappointed with his own game today.” More from Rafa Nadal, speaking in halting French before switching to English: “It was the best match tournament of me. It was important because Dominic is a very aggressive player. I had a tough moment in the third set when I got cramp in my hand. I was very scared. But that is sport. It is very humid and I was against a tough player who pushes you to the end.” Rafael Nadal briefly left the court but he’s reappeared for his interview. “It is incredible. I am very happy. Well played to Dominic. He has played great. He is a good friend, one of these players that the tour needs. I am sure you will win here in the next couple of years.” Here’s an instant match report. Nadal has more treatment on his aching left wrist before this game. He only needs it to function enough for him to claim four more points, though, and then this is all over. He quickly makes it 15-0. Thiem sends a backhand wide. 30-0. A big serve from Nadal makes it 40-0. This damp squib of a final is almost done, although Nadal has to wait a bit longer after missing a backhand down the line. Then Thiem reads a drop shot and pushes a clever forehand past Nadal for 40-30. Hmm. Maybe he does get nervous. The third championship point comes and goes, a backhand drifting wide, the game moving to deuce. Thiem goes on the attack. But he can’t break Nadal down. A poor forehand flies long and Nadal has a fourth championship point. He cracks a backhand wide, though. Nadal looks like he’s playing within himself now. He’s very contained. Yet Thiem’s still wayward. He can’t take advantage of his stricken opponent, firing a forehand wide to bring up a fifth championship point. Nadal serves wide and he can finally smile and hold his arms in the air when Thiem sends his backhand long! That’s it! It’s all over! Rafael Nadal has beaten cramp and Dominic Thiem to win his 11th French Open title! Third set: Nadal 6-4, 6-3, 5-2 Thiem* (*denotes server): A frustrated Thiem makes the most of Nadal’s cramping left hand by, er, gifting the Spaniard a 0-30 lead. An ace makes it 15-30 but Nadal earns two break points thanks to a drop shot. He converts it. He will serve for his 11th French Open title. As you do. Maybe I’ll be good at tennis if I cramp more. Third set: Nadal* 6-4, 6-3, 4-2 Thiem (*denotes server): Nadal seems to be coping just fine, judging by the way he tears a couple of forehands past Thiem for 30-0. He holds to love. He is preposterous. Third set: Nadal 6-4, 6-3, 3-2 Thiem* (*denotes server): Thiem wins the first three points to lead 40-0. Nadal whips a forehand past him to make it 40-15. But Thiem holds. Will Nadal call for the trainer again? Third set: Nadal* 6-4, 6-3, 3-1 Thiem (*denotes server): At 30-0, Nadal has the trainer on. He removes the tape covering the wristband on his left wrist. He’s fiddling with his fingers and his wrist. The trainer massages him a bit. On ITV, Jim Courier thinks that Nadal’s cramping in the humidity. That’s just speculation, though. Nadal takes a big gulp from an energy drink and eventually play resumes. No longer wearing the tape, Nadal loses the next point and chunters at his box. This is all very strange. But while the speed of Nadal’s serve has dipped, he still holds to 15. Third set: Nadal 6-4, 6-3, 2-1 Thiem* (*denotes server): At 30-all, Nadal crushes a forehand away to earn a break point. Thiem forces deuce with a canny drop shot. An ace gives him a point for the game. Nadal won’t stop pestering him, though, and he eventually breaks when he forces Thiem to swipe a slice wide. Third set: Nadal* 6-4, 6-3, 1-1 Thiem (*denotes server): Nadal races through a stress-free hold. Third set: Nadal 6-4, 6-3, 0-1 Thiem* (*denotes server): The final third set begins after a short break and Nadal has three break points when Thiem, the fighting sapping from his body, nets a forehand. Thiem saves them all, though, and then he wipes out a fourth. He’s earned this hold: he seals it with a rasping backhand. “I’m not sure if this match will end up going down as a classic, but one thing’s for sure,” says Peter Oh. “The grunting is top, top notch.” It’s not long before Nadal has two set points. He bounces the ball. He misses a first serve. The second’s in and he just has to wait for Thiem to loop a backhand wide. Second set: Nadal 6-4, 5-3 Thiem* (*denotes server): Thiem holds to 30. Nadal will serve for the set. Second set: Nadal* 6-4, 5-2 Thiem (*denotes server): Thiem pumps his fist after belting a forehand past Nadal for 0-15. But Nadal makes it 15-all, kissing the line with a spinning, snarling forehand. An incredulous Thiem looks at the ball in astonishment. Somehow, though, he finds the will to move to 30-40, earning a break point with a skilled drop shot. Nadal’s been given a code violation for taking too long to serve. There’s a bit more tension now. Thiem has a look at a second serve but Nadal takes control of the rally with a drop shot, eventually winning it by ramming a backhand into the open court. Nadal holds, moving a game away from a two-set lead. Second set: Nadal 6-4, 4-2 Thiem* (*denotes server): Thiem holds to love. At least he’s still fighting. Second set: Nadal* 6-4, 4-1 Thiem (*denotes server): There’s a frisson of excitement when Nadal falls to 0-30. The game even goes to deuce. But Nadal holds. How are you meant to beat him here? Second set: Nadal 6-4, 3-1 Thiem* (*denotes server): Thiem holds to love. Maybe he’s going to do a Halep. Second set: Nadal* 6-4, 3-0 Thiem (*denotes server): Nadal consolidates the break, holding to 15. Thiem is beaten. They can start getting the trophy presentation ready. Second set: Nadal 6-4, 2-0 Thiem* (*denotes server): Nadal charges forward to punch a volley away for two break points. Thiem saves them both and a third chance for Nadal goes begging when he sends a forehand long. Nadal carves out a fourth chance but Thiem whacks a forehand past him. But Thiem’s too erratic. Facing a fifth break point, he blooters a backhand long. Ah well. The competitiveness was nice while it lasted. Second set: Nadal* 6-4, 1-0 Thiem (*denotes server): Everyone watching this is now very, very glad not to be Dominic Thiem, who’s probably in for two sets of pure torture. Nadal holds to 30. Thiem should win the first point. Instead, he dumps a volley into the net. Uh oh. You can’t do that against Nadal. Not here. Thiem’s wobbling. He misses a forehand for 0-30. Then he nets one to gift Nadal three break points. Thiem’s unravelled. He’s furious with himself and there’s an inevitability about the ragged forehand that flies miles past the baseline, handing Nadal the set. You sense that might be that. It’s been a highly competitive match but Nadal doesn’t let leads go. First set: Nadal* 5-4 Thiem (*denotes server): The first two points are shared. Nadal glares at his racket for a moment. Then he wins the next two points. He holds. Thiem will serve to keep the set alive. First set: Nadal 4-4 Thiem* (*denotes server): Zinedine Zidane and Youri Djorkaeff are in the crowd. Like Nadal, they know what it means to rule Paris. As for today, they’ll surely be impressed with what they’re seeing from Thiem, who allows himself another quiet fist pump after spraying a backhand past Nadal for 30-0. Soon it’s 40-0 and Thiem seals his first comfortable hold by hammering a forehand down the line. First set: Nadal* 4-3 Thiem (*denotes server): This set has already been going for 40 minutes. But Nadal races through this game, holding to 15 comfortably enough. First set: Nadal 3-3 Thiem* (*denotes server): Thiem’s spanking the ball hard but the accuracy isn’t always there. This game goes to 30-all. But Thiem is brave enough to keep going for it with his forehand and he eventually makes space for a missile down the line. That one’s not coming back. 40-30. Then comes a moment of controversy, though. Thiem sees a Nadal shot drop wide and leaves it. Yet the umpire runs down to check the mark, decides that it was in and awards the point to Nadal because Thiem left it. Hawkeye suggests the umpire’s wrong. Thiem gets on with it. What else can he do? The problem, though, is that Nadal’s not going to let him off easily and he has a break point when Thiem overcooks a forehand. These are nervy times for Thiem but he stays cool, duking it out with Nadal from the baseline and drawing the error from the Spaniard by moving him around a bit. Yet his second serve’s under pressure and Thiem gifts Nadal a second break point when he sends a backhand long. This game is taking for ever. Nadal prolongs it when he misses a forehand down the line. Deuce again. Thiem’s going to have to be magnificent. He chops a drop shot over the net and clenches his fist after outwitting Nadal at the net. Nadal misses a backhand return and, after an eternity, Thiem holds. First set: Nadal* 3-2 Thiem (*denotes server): At 15-all, Nadal produces a gorgeous lob to leave Thiem stranded. Soon it’s 40-15. The game’s got away from Thiem pretty quickly. Nadal holds to 30 when Thiem nets a forehand return. “Come on!” Nadal cries, geeing himself up. First set: Nadal 2-2 Thiem* (*denotes server): The fans roar as Thiem spanks another forehand past Nadal. They want a contest. But a double-fault lets Nadal back in and the Spaniard makes it 15-30 with a lovely forehand winner. Thiem needs to switch on. Though he moves to 40-30, another double-fault takes it to deuce and Nadal has a break point after yet another error from Thiem. He survives, though, and eventually holds for the first time. First set: Nadal* 2-1 Thiem (*denotes server): A couple of errors from Nadal give Thiem some hope at 15-30. A marathon rally ensues and Thiem earns two break points, letting rip with a crosscourt forehand. This is better from the Austrian. He can’t take the first but he claims the second when a mishit from Nadal allows him to come forward and slap a forehand into the right corner. There goes the break! First set: Nadal 2-0 Thiem* (*denotes server): You feel that Thiem, who has no experience of playing matches as big as this, needs to start well. Even at this early stage this has the smell of a vital game for him and there’s a little murmur from the crowd when he balloons a backhand to make it 0-15. He could do with winning a point. Nadal isn’t in the mood to let him have one, though, and he takes advantage of Thiem’s deep position by making it 0-30 with a drop shot. Thiem’s under pressure and he’s facing two break points when he pushes a backhand long. He nets a forehand and Nadal’s already in front. Oh dear. First set: Nadal* 1-0 Thiem (*denotes server): The men’s final opens with Rafa Nadal, the king of clay and dressed in blue, serving and snorting and marching into a 30-0 lead. Dominic Thiem, the young pretender, is standing near the baseline as he prepares to receive. That’s a change: his return position has been notably deep throughout this tournament. But it doesn’t help him much in this game, which flies by in a flash, Nadal holding to love with some solid play at the net. Time! The final will begin imminently. Tok! Tok! Tok! They’re knocking up. Dominic Thiem wins the toss and chooses to serve. Rafa Nadal leads the head-to-head 6-3. But Dominic Thiem has three wins over Nadal on clay. Here come the players. Dominic Thiem, the lower ranked player, is first out and he’s closely followed by Rafa Nadal, who’s done this plenty of times before. It’s bright but cloudy in Paris today. Let’s hope there’s no rain. For Dominic Thiem, this could be a breakthrough moment. He’ll be a star if he can somehow summon the inspiration to achieve one of the toughest challenges in sport: subduing Rafa Nadal in a best-of-five match on clay. The Austrian is one of the leaders of the generation hoping to topple the Big Five supremacy in the men’s game and it does seem likely that he won’t have to wait too long for his first grand slam title, even if it doesn’t come today. Thiem has a powerful game and his coach, Gunter Bresnik, has told the New York Times that his player has benefited from playing in a low-level event in Lyon the week before Paris: Everybody calls me an idiot, maybe even for good reason. But I like this. And I’m really happy to prove the people wrong, because all the guys who practiced the week or 10 days before Roland Garros, they are already at home for a week. Dominic played four matches in Lyon, came here Saturday late at night with the train, practiced the next day and played on Monday. People said: ‘It’s stupid. He’s not going to last.’ But my idea behind this is that to prepare people for handling high pressure, physically and mentally, you have to put them under pressure, well dosed, not too much and not too little, but under pressure.” Rafa Nadal has been in 10 French Open finals. He’s yet to lose one. He beat Mariano Puerto for his first in 2005 and since then he’s seen off Roger Federer four times, Novak Djokovic twice and Robin Soderling, David Ferrer and Stan Wawrinka, who was no match for him last year. Put it that way and you can be forgiven for feeling that Dominic Thiem might be better off staying in the locker room. A Nadal win today would see him equal Margaret Court’s record of 11 titles at one grand slam – the Australian’s came in the Australian Open and bridged the amateur and professional eras. Pre-match reading Rafa Nadal has made it this far after beating Simone Bolelli, Guido Pella, Richard Gasquet, Max Marterer, Diego Schwartzman and Juan Martin Del Potro. Dominic Thiem has made it this far after beating Ilya Ivashka, Stefanos Tsitsipas, Matteo Berrettini, Kei Nishikori, Alexander Zverev and Marco Cecchinato. Hello. It’s getting to the point where Rafael Nadal’s dominance of the French Open is going to have to feature in guidebooks to Paris. Forget about going up the Eiffel Tower, taking a boat down the Seine, walking along the Champs-Elysées, queuing for Notre-Dame and looking out over the city from Montmartre – if you really want to understand Parisian life, take a trip to Roland Garros to witness one of sport’s most crushing inevitabilities: Nadal grinding some poor guy into the Parisian clay. He brings an imposing 85-2 record into this afternoon’s final and, if there is to be an upset, then Austria’s Dominic Thiem must produce the performance of his life. That’s not entirely unthinkable given that the seventh-seeded 24-year-old has beaten Nadal twice on clay in the past two years, most recently when they met in the quarter-finals in Madrid last month, and can take encouragement from the fact that the Spaniard has wobbled a little in the past fortnight. Yet history suggests that the chances of Nadal losing this one are slimmer than them running out of baguettes in Paris. Only two men have beaten Nadal at the French Open – Robin Soderling in 2009 and Novak Djokovic in 2015 (a wrist injury also got the better of him in 2016) – and the 32-year-old is searching for his 11th title after ending his quest for La Decima last year. It’s hard to see him being denied. Thiem might be the world’s second best player on clay but this is his debut in a grand slam final and he’s up against a player who has a 16-7 winning record in these marquee occasions. The facts are cold and unforgiving. Of course, Thiem shouldn’t be too pessimistic. Otherwise there’d be no point in him even turning up. He has the weapons, power and swagger to cause problems and he’ll surely have noted that it hasn’t all been plain sailing for Nadal at this tournament. Simone Bolelli inconvenienced him in the first round, Diego Schwartzman led by a set and a break before rain interrupted in the quarters and Nadal he had to save six break points in his semi-final against Juan Martin del Potro. But Nadal, who destroyed Thiem in the semis last year, is so remorseless here. This is his kingdom. Court Philippe-Chatrier is his palace. He’ll expect to reign supreme once more.

And we’ve seen 736 runs in a day. Jonny Bairstow played a scintillating knock, but, to be ultra-critical, it was a baby hundred when a daddy was required. And Alex Hales compounded the problem by stage-managing two dismissals, Joe Root’s and then his own. Moeen Ali and Liam Plunkett very nearly turned it round, but the force was with Kyle Coetzer, the captain with a ridiculous number of bowling changes. He set the tone this morning with the bat, set the stage for Calum MacLeod, and somehow got his team over the line in the field, helped by some canny bowling from Alasdair Evans and Mark Watt. It’s been a privilege to cover this. Thanks for your company. The last word goes to Jamie Argent. “Does this mean we win the World Cup?” It’s not far off. Edinburgh is rocking. There’s a crowd invasion, some bagpipes are playing, the players are exchanging hugs, and although England will be red-faced, they don’t seem to begrudge the Scots their triumph, which is right and proper. This is a famous, famous victory, and it makes a nonsense of Scotland’s absence from next year’s World Cup. Calum MacLeod, Mark Watt and co. have written themselves into Scottish sporting history. Wood is lbw Sharif, and Scotland beat England for the first time. They have thoroughly deserved it. Mid-49th over: England 364-9 (Plunkett 46, Wood 1) Wood receives a gift from Sharif, on his legs, but can only tuck it for a single. England need eight from nine. A review for run out against Rashid, as Plunkett calls for a tight two, and he’s gone! England need ten from 11. What a match. 48th over: England 361-8 (Plunkett 44, Rashid 5) These two batsmen share a dressing-room at Headingley and it shows as they scramble some quick singles. England need 11 from 12. And here’s the trusty Starbuck. “Answering Brian Withington’s question [46th over]: Ball probably trumps Plunkett, though not so euphonious.” Hmmm. It does if we’re playing nominative determinism, but I thought we were playing onomatopoeia? 47th over: England 356-8 (Plunkett 41, Rashid 3) Sharif bamboozles Rashid with a slower ball, a leg-cutter at 64mph, but strays on to Plunkett’s legs and gives him a comfy four. Sharif recovers with a fine yorker, swinging in, but Plunkett, seeing it big now, digs it out for a single to long-off. England are favourites again, just. 46th over: England 348-8 (Plunkett 35, Rashid 1) Just when I’m thinking Scotland should have a Test-match field here, they take a much-needed wicket by sticking to the one-day way. Moeen, usually such a good timer of the ball, found the bottom of the bat that time. Watt finishes with 3-55, and he’s only 21, although he looks older. And bowls older. England need a run a ball. “Is Plunkett,” wonders Withington, “the most onomatopoeic English cricketer in recent memory?” Just when it was looking easy again for England, Moeen makes a game of it by chipping to long-on. 45th over: England 346-7 (Ali 46, Plunkett 34) Moeen at his best: a front-foot pull for four, first ball of the over, followed by a lofted off-drive for six that threatens to take the word languid away from David Gower for evermore. Plunkett, taking the hint, thwacks a six of his own, not languid at all, but bottom-handed and straight back past the bowler. And there’s a missed stumping as Cross goes up for a catch behind. Eighteen from the over, which tips the scales in England’s favour. They need 26 off five. 44th over: England 328-7 (Ali 35, Plunkett 27) Moeen capitalises on Plunkett’s six with a crunching four off Watt’s first ball, slammed through extra cover. The 50 partnership comes up, off 43 balls: it’s been just what England needed. They now require 44 from the last 36 balls. 43rd over: England 321-7 (Ali 29, Plunkett 26) Sharif replaces Sole in the 536th bowling change of the innings. It goes well at first, but then Liam Plunkett spots a half-tracker and pulls it for six. What a temperament he’s got. 42nd over: England 312-7 (Ali 27, Plunkett 19) Coetzer, still mixing things up, summons Watt, who bowls a full length and concedes only four singles. Scotland’s finest hour is still beckoning to them. 41st over: England 308-7 (Ali 25, Plunkett 17) Plunkett flashes hard at a short one from Sole and gets four to third man. England need 64 off nine, so the rate remains reasonable. “Just get the feeling they’re ready to party,” says Ian Ward, as the camera picks out some particularly impassive spectators. To my eye, they look equally ready to go to evensong. 40th over: England 300-7 (Ali 24, Plunkett 11) Moeen gets a wide full toss from Sharif and bisects the two men at backward point. These two have added 24 off 21, much better than the Ali-Billings partnership (18 off 24). Brian Withington is back, with a tinge of regret. “Not so much a frolicking formality, more like a fumbling fiasco. Pass the humble pie and haggis ... in Plunkett we trust.” 39th over: England 292-7 (Ali 18, Plunkett 9) Chris Sole is back, and almost in business first ball as Plunkett offers a thick snick and Matt Cross can’t quite get there with his dive. It would be worth having a slip in just to save runs like that, which can be so demoralising. Plunkett has now faced 12 balls in this innings, four times as many as he faced in this year’s IPL. An email from Robin Hazlehurst. “Scotland beat England at rugby this year for the first time in a while, now they’re doing at cricket. This is starting to look like a pattern. We’re not playing them at football or tiddlywinks or anything anytime soon are we?” 38th over: England 286-7 (Ali 18, Plunkett 3) Moeen, who is nothing is not unflappable, hits a languid six over extra cover – and is well caught by the man in the lilac shirt in hospitality. His sunglasses don’t even fall off the top of his head. 37th over: England 277-7 (Ali 11, Plunkett 1) Willey plays a creamy off-push for four and a spanking pull for two, only to toe-end another pull. The Scots have done so well to drag themselves back into this. Another one! Willey, after starting superbly, nicks an attempted pull. Scotland are now firm favourites. 36th over: England 270-6 (Ali 11, Willey 1) Moeen is shaping to play the anchor when he sees a half-volley and eases it over square leg. That’s gone into the fish-and-chip van and out again. England still need 102. Another full toss, and Billings clips it straight to midwicket, where Coetzer takes another sharp catch. Scotland are probably favourites now. 35th over: England 263-5 (Billings 12, Ali 5) Desperate for a four, England get one as Evans tries a yorker to Billings which comes out as a juicy full toss. Seven from the over, England’s best since Morgan departed. And Guy Hornsby is back to continue his bromance with John Starbuck. “That’s a good shout Mr Starbuck. We must get half a point for Federer, surely @TimdeLisle, given how good he looks in whites (but let’s forget that blazer nonsense, eh).” 34th over: England 256-5 (Billings 6, Ali 4) England need a boundary or two, and Scotland are not in a mood to oblige. That’s drinks, with the scales almost even. 33rd over: England 251-5 (Billings 3, Ali 2) Moeen plays another of his sleepy wafts at thin air, when he needs to switch on and play the Buttler. The required rate has sneaked up to seven. England are unlikely to run out of overs, thanks to Bairstow’s fireworks, but they could well run out of wickets. 32nd over: England 247-5 (Billings 1, Ali 1) Moeen, feeling the hot breath of the keeper down his neck, opens with a play-and-a-miss at Berrington. Moeen is in form, but Billings is not. And England’s top order have just given three wickets away. This could go to the wire now. When we find ourselves in times of trouble, we reach for football references. “Cricket,” says Brian Withington, “bloody hell.” “Having watched far too many England ‘clattering of the wicket’ collapses,” adds Andrew Chappell, “I can only imagine someone in the Scotland dressing room just now saying, encouragingly, ‘Lads, it’s England.’” It is game on! Hales, needing to see England through after running Root out, slaps the very next ball to backward point. Goliath is reeling. 31st over: England 245-3 (Hales 52, Billings 0) Testing stuff from Alasdair Evans, conceding only three and then taking the wicket. He has a very respectable 5-1-32-1. In other news, Rafael Nadal has won his 11th French Open. Can’t they just give it to him for good now? The short ball, which should be cannon fodder, surprises Morgan, who chips a catch to his opposite number, diving to his right at midwicket. That’s not game on, is it...? 30th over: England 243-3 (Hales 51, Morgan 19) Berrington’s over goes for only five, a little triumph. Apparently Nasser is being teased on Twitter about his pronunciation of Edinburgh. Bumble teases him some more by saying he is pronouncing it Ednbruh, when it should, of course, be Ednbruh. 29th over: England 238-3 (Hales 50, Morgan 15) Hales goes to a rather sheepish fifty, and the camera homes in on Root in the England tent, hoping for a scowl – but finding only a brisk round of applause. Morgan swings a six over midwicket. He has 15 off seven. Here’s Brian Withington. “Why indeed?” says his subject line, picking up on Root’s parting shot. ““Am I alone in thinking that Alex Hales called the Test captain for a doomed single like a man who has retired from the red ball team?” 28th over: England 228-3 (Hales 48, Morgan 7) Eoin Morgan, always confident, always trusting in himself and his men, comes in and guides a half-volley from Sharif through the covers for four. The required rate is six and a half, and Morgan has seen that several hundred times. But still, Scotland have a sliver of a chance. 27th over: England 220-3 (Hales 47, Morgan 0) Leask is back, brave man. Root sweeps for four, then slog-sweeps for six, then perishes at the hands of his partner, who calls for an unnecessary single when he (Root) was pinned in his crease. John Starbuck, who doesn’t miss much, has spotted Guy Hornsby’s question from the 22nd over. “Tim (not Tom, curse you autocorrect), in answer to Guy Hornsby’s question if the Greatest ever played cricket? 1. Sir Don Bradman: yes 2. AB de Villiers: yes 3. Sir Garfield Sobers : yes 3. Roger Federer: probably not 4. Muhammed Ali : probably not 5. Red Rum: almost certainly not. Joe Root is sawn off by Hales! He doesn’t wait for the third umpire’s decision, and goes off mouthing “Why?” Good for the game though... 26th over: England 209-2 (Hales 46, Root 19) Like a grandfather surrounded by small children, cricket can go to sleep in any conditions. And you can always feel it, even when you’re 300 miles away. The last five overs have gone for only 26. Come on Halesy, time to go mental. 25th over: England 206-2 (Hales 44, Root 18) Watt pins Hales on his pad, the verdict is not out, and Scotland think long and hard about a review – so long that the review is disallowed. It would have been out! Apparently Kyle Coetzer took 19 seconds, rather than the allotted 15, but still, you’ve got to feel for him. It’s an unfunny game sometimes. 24th over: England 204-2 (Hales 43, Root 17) Sharif returns, sticks one down leg side, and appeals for caught behind against Hales in a bid to distract the umpire, which fails. Just when it seems as if England are going easy on their hosts, Hales comes up with a thump for six over mid-off, to bring up the 200. 23rd over: England 194-2 (Hales 35, Root 16) Coetzer brings back Watt and even hands him a slip, but Watt drifts one on with the arm and Root helps himself to a lap for four like a well-travelled businessman at the breakfast buffet. Still, Watt is now the first Scot to concede fewer than seven an over – and only Moeen managed it for England. 22nd over: England 189-2 (Hales 35, Root 11) The Scots keeper, Matt Cross, is standing up to Berrington’s seamers, and it almost pays off as Root survives an appeal for a stumping. Then Berrington offers Hales a long hop outside off, which is smacked for four. “In response to John Starbuck,” says Guy Hornsby, referring to 15:11, which seems several weeks ago now, “I’m aware of racing’s epithet but as I know nothing about it, and worship at the supreme willow and leather altar of glory/disappointment, I’m justifying claiming it from the turf. Does anyone know if The Greatest played cricket?” 21st over: England 183-2 (Hales 31, Root 10) Sole tries a bouncer to Hales, which induces an imperious pull and an entertaining throwback as Nasser Hussain slips back into his martinet-at-mid-off mode: “No! Not there! Not on this pitch!” Sole now knows how a whole generation of England bowlers felt. 20th over: England 176-2 (Hales 26, Root 8) The batsmen milk Berrington’s medium pace, and the target is below 200 now. It should be a walk in The Grange, but you never know. Scotland’s most economical bowlers, Sharif and Watt, have gone for seven an over. 19th over: England 171-2 (Hales 24, Root 5) So who would you like to see coming in once you’ve removed both openers? Ah yes, England’s most elegant and consistent batsman in decades. Joe Root gets off the mark with a dreamy glide for four off poor old Sole. 18th over: England 165-2 (Hales 23, Root 0) So Bairstow departs, after going down a gear from his peak of 84 off 39 – his last 21 runs occupied 20 balls, which, on this surface, is frankly rather sluggish. A pat on the back too for Kyle Coetzer, whose policy of changing the bowling every two minutes finally paid off. And that’s drinks. Irn-Bru all round, I take it. And Brian Withington is back for more. “Whilst my par score calculator recovers in the freezer, and at the risk of an excess of hubris inducing presumption, would this be the first time that a 372 run chase could be described as a frolicking formality?” Either that, or the collapse is on. That’s the one Scotland wanted. Bairstow looks to loft another six over mid-off and mistimes it, giving Munsey plenty of time to think about how embarrassing it would be to drop him – and he doesn’t. Well caught, well bowled, and very well batted. 17th over: England 159-1 (Bairstow 101, Hales 21) Back comes Chris Sole, and it all goes even more horribly wrong. Hales, who has been biding his time, decides it’s time to pepper the crowd, and hits two sixes. Here comes yet another bowling change, the seventh. 16th over: England 141-1 (Bairstow 100, Hales 4) Evans, building on his maiden, concedes a string of singles, but can’t stop Bairstow clipping to midwicket to reach a fabulous hundred. He has gone at a personal tempo of six an over: if he keeps it up all the way to the target, he will get about 265. And it’s a record-breaker, not quite for speed (54 balls), but because it’s Jonny Bairstow’s third in a row, the first time that has been done for England. Imagine what he’d be like in Tests if he didn’t have to keep wicket. 15th over: England 136-1 (Bairstow 98, Hales 1) Bored of blasting it, Bairstow subjects Watt to the finest of paddles for four. Undaunted, Watt has a good shout for LBW as Bairstow sweeps and misses; Scotland might have reviewed if they had more than one card to play with, but it was just sliding down, according to Hawkeye. Bairstow then slogs a couple, not far from the man at midwicket. He’s only human after all. 14th over: England 130-1 (Bairstow 92, Hales 1) Evans manages a few dots, gold dust on a day like this, then beats Hales outside off and completes a maiden over. Give him the Man of the Match award now. “Now that 10 overs have passed,” says Brian Withington, “I find that my par score calculator has melted in the presence of the Bairstow barrage. Good job Jos Buttler has been rested.” 13th over: England 130-1 (Bairstow 92, Hales 1) Coetzer does another U-turn, heading back to Watt, who manages to get the ball past Bairstow’s bat and lodge an LBW appeal (going down), before removing Roy with a very KP-ish dismissal. Buttler’s record is safe, as Bairstow has now faced 45 balls, and even he is unlikely to hit an eight. Ah, well played Mark Watt. He gets the ball to stick in this true surface and Roy pops a simple catch back to him. 12th over: England 128-0 (Roy 34, Bairstow 91) Roy picks up a two and a one, then Bairstow swats a short one for six, very nearly into the confectionery stall and out again. Happily Mike Atherton, the closest thing to Benaud these days, is on duty, so he utters these very words. England now have a third of the runs in a quarter of the overs. Early finish, anyone? 11th over: England 118-0 (Roy 31, Bairstow 84) Richie Berrington comes on, so instead of spin from both ends, it’s now military medium from both ends. I’m not sure that’s wise, although you can’t blame Coetzer for panicking – this is, as Woody says in Toy Story, the perfect time to panic. Bairstow adds two fours to his collection with a sweep and a biff. The record for England’s fastest hundred is held by the absent Jos Buttler, with 46 balls, so Bairstow needs 16 off six to beat it. 10th over: England 107-0 (Roy 29, Bairstow 75) The beleaguered Coetzer turns to Alasdair Evans, but the result is the same: Bairstow blitzes 6-4-4 off successive balls, to cruise to 75 off 35. He’s making Roy look like Chris Tavare. The definition of courage in cricket is now a Scotsman doing stretches to catch the captain’s eye. 9th over: England 92-0 (Roy 28, Bairstow 61) Poor old Leask is leaking runs as Bairstow goes ballistic: the over goes for 25 – and we go ball-by-ball, 466.3w6. The second six gives Bairstow fifty off 27 balls, the sixth-fastest by an England player in 47 years of one-day internationals. He may get to a hundred in about five minutes. 8th over: England 67-0 (Roy 28, Bairstow 39) Bairstow almost gives a chance off Watt, flapping into the covers, but instantly reasserts himself with a lofted off drive for the first six of the innings. 7th over: England 55-0 (Roy 27, Bairstow 28) Spin from both ends! Michael Leask comes on with his offbreaks and concedes only aingles, which constitutes a triumph today. And look who’s here. I wonder if he was consulted on the Stones’ latest piece of merchandise, a Gray Nicolls bat with a tongue logo, yours for just £999. 6th over: England 51-0 (Roy 25, Bairstow 26) Coetzer, in a tight corner, turns to spin – slow left-arm from Mark Watt. Roy, unperturbed, cuts for three, with a hand from a misfield. Bairstow trots down the track and lofts four over extra cover, even though he didn’t quite get there. 5th over: England 43-0 (Roy 22, Bairstow 21) Bairstow goes forward to punch through the covers, then rocks back to late-cut past third man. He’s only faced 13 balls, and his eye is right in. Here’s Brian Withington, striking a note of caution. “They say you don’t know the par score until the second team have faced ten overs or so. One thing I would venture at this stage is that the Grange groundsperson knows how to prepare a decent firm surface with consistent bounce. Any chance he (or she) might venture south and show a few others how it’s done?” 4th over: England 32-0 (Roy 20, Bairstow 12) Bairstow, facing Sole, offers a catchable edge to the slips, but there aren’t any. Kyle Coetzer, who set the tone so well with the bat, has been a bit anxious with his fields, fiddling when he could be showing faith in his bowlers. Roy cashes in with a comfy cover drive for four, and Bairstow adds a blazing square drive for four more. England are on top, but there’s a long way to go. 3rd over: England 22-0 (Roy 15, Bairstow 7) Bairstow comes to the party with an upright guide through the covers for four more. The pitch is so true, it could be a story by Carole Cadwalladr. “Is it foolish,” asks Andrew Benton, “to liken today’s game to battles past? Will it be a Bannockburn, or a Flodden? And where are the French? (their coach, it says on the net, is a Tim de Leede...)” Ah yes, Tim Nice But Good at Cricket. 2nd over: England 15-0 (Roy 13, Bairstow 2) Chris Sole takes the new ball, and “he looks an athlete,” says Bumble. But he strays towards the pads, so Roy helps himself to two twos and two fours, the second a rasping pull. His timing is in good working order, and they are up with the required rate. “Rob,” says Michael Keane. I’ve had worse. “Anyone who knows royal history knows that the actual Sport of Kings is real tennis. Henry VIII played while one of his wives was beheaded...2 french kings died on court...there are courts at Hampton Court Palace, Falkland Palace, Fontainebleau and of course Lord’s. Oh, and the, um, Queens Club. “I’ve been working at a Lord’s today,” he adds, “wearing my tartan tie while doing tours. No Scottish visitors. I guess they’re all watching TV.” 1st over: England 3-0 (Roy 1, Bairstow 2) Jason Roy is already living dangerously, flapping Saatyan Sharif’s second ball just short of backward point. Jonny Bairstow survives a half-hearted appeal for caught down the leg side, then picks up a hard-run two with a push into a mysteriously empty leg side. Just 369 more to get. The players are coming out, to be greeted by a ripple of hubbub. The crowd can sniff history: can Davey beat Goliath? One thing in Scotland’s favour is that the man best equipped to see England over the line, Jos Buttler, isn’t here. “Well,” says William Hargreaves, “I think we should just take the ball away and be done with it. If they can’t play our sport properly, then it’s a poor show. Fancy spoiling it like that.” Afternoon everyone and thanks Rob. This game couldn’t be better set up: it’s either going to be a famous victory or a fabulous run chase. Either way, there will be plenty of exclamation marks. The only thing missing is an email from John Starbuck. And here he comes,. off his long run. “Tom,” he begins, a little unpromisingly. “Re Guy Hornsby’s claim (over 47) that cricket is the Sport of Kings, this isn’t quite right. The Sport of Kings is generally acknowledged to be horse-racing. Cricket is the Greatest Game; football is the Beautiful Game; tennis is Anyone’s Game; boxing is the Noble Art; rugby is for hooligans and darts is just Arrers.” I’m going for a walk to try to make sense of what we’ve just seen. Tim de Lisle will talk you through England’s run-chase - you can email him here. Bye! Calum MacLeod ends the innings on 140 not out from 96 balls, a staggering innings that has given Scotland a chance of an even more staggering victory. If England reach their target of 372, it will equal the second-highest runchase in ODI history. Astonishing stuff. 50th over: Scotland 371-5 (MacLeod 140, Leask 10) Hahahaha. Michael Leask walks to the crease and waves his first ball nonchalantly over long off! Whatever happens in the second innings, Scotland fans will be talking about this batting performance forever. They have pulverised the No1 team in the world. England need 372 to win. Budge is cleaned up by a terrific full-length delivery from Wood. Five deliveries to go. 49th over: Scotland 360-4 (MacLeod 140, Budge 11) The penultimate over, bowled by Plunkett, disappears for 18. MacLeod hits consecutive boundaries, a roundhouse pull followed by an improvised clip over short fine leg, and then Budge dumps a short ball to cow corner. This is preposterous stuff! 48th over: Scotland 342-4 (MacLeod 127, Budge 6) A short ball from Wood is pinged sweetly into the crowd by MacLeod, his third six. Nine from the over, and this is now Scotland’s record ODI total. 47th over: Scotland 333-4 (MacLeod 119, Budge 5) Willey has bowled well at the death, using the wide yorker effectively, and his last over costs only six. He ends with figures of 10-0-72-0. “I feel Simon McMahon’s pain at the denial of a deserved World Cup place for Scotland,” says Brian Withington. “As for travel problems, what would have been wrong with dusting off the old 1978 submarine charter plan and arriving up the Thames in style for an amphibious assault on the Oval or Lord’s?” 46th over: Scotland 327-4 (MacLeod 115, Budge 3) MacLeod hoicks Rashid for another boundary, this time to cow corner. The new batsman Budge - who scored 600 runs in a week at the end of May - is sensibly giving him the strike at every opportunity. “Well, this is a rum do, Rob,” says Guy Hornsby. “This England team is hardly a bunch of dirt-trackers, and the Scotland team neither a side of superstars, but then isn’t this why cricket is the sport of kings? (Or at least mild alcoholics.) Surely this impending and unlikely shock victory is the Auld Enemy’s perfect way to puncture English self-confidence just as we embark on our glorious world soccer champion cup tour in the USSR?” 45th over: Scotland 318-4 (MacLeod 109, Budge 0) Willey is bowling wide yorkers to the right-handers. MacLeod reaches a long way outside off stump to slice one delivery over third man for four and then walks across to clout the ball over square leg. Willey responds well with three consecutive dot balls. 44th over: Scotland 310-4 (MacLeod 101, Budge 0) Calum MacLeod becomes the first Scotland player to score an ODI hundred against England! He reached three figures by working Rashid to leg for two. It’s been a spectacular innings, made from just 70 balls, and it’s his seventh hundred in ODIs. His celebration is modest, even muted, which is a surprise because that might be the innings of his life. “Just to remind you that ‘England’s world record’ in ODI’s isn’t under threat,” says Ruth Ramsden. “New Zealand women currently hold the honour over 50 overs - 490. Good luck Scotland getting past that!” Yes, fair point. I think important people are currently reviewing the Guardian style guide regarding men’s/women’s cricket. I can see both sides of that particular argument. Munsey works Rashid for two to reach a punishing half-century from 49 balls, his first in ODIs, and rewards himself with yet another lofted reverse sweep for four. The next delivery is his last, a top-edged slog sweep that is taken by Wood at short fine leg. 43rd over: Scotland 300-3 (MacLeod 97, Munsey 49) Willey, who took some tap earlier in the day, returns with a good over – five singles from it. “I know I said I was over it, but WHY AREN’T SCOTLAND AT THE WORLD CUP???!!!” weeps Simon McMahon. “Ach well, It’s not as if any of their fans could get to the host country easily, I suppose.” 42nd over: Scotland 295-3 (MacLeod 94, Munsey 47) Rashid returns to the attack. He has three overs remaining and England really need him to take a wicket or three in that time. MacLeod drags a very slow delivery - 38mph - through midwicket for four and slog-sweeps six to move into the nineties! What an innings this is: 94 from 64 balls! 41st over: Scotland 281-3 (MacLeod 82, Munsey 45) A short ball from Plunkett is pulled mightily for six by Munsey. Pick that out! Fifteen from the over. This is an outrageous performance from Scotland, who are hurtling towards their highest ODI score. Their best at the moment is 341 for nine against Canada in 2014. More importantly, they have a real chance of an astonishing victory. 40th over: Scotland 266-3 (MacLeod 78, Munsey 38) Wood ruins a good over with a poor last delivery that is clipped for four by MacLeod. Scotland have an unbelievable platform for the last 10 overs. 39th over: Scotland 258-3 (MacLeod 73, Munsey 36) England need a wicket to slow Scotland down going into the death overs. Instead, Munsey muscles Plunkett over wide mid-on for four, another emphatic stroke. This has been such a thrilling batting performance from Scotland: in 39 overs we’ve had 34 fours and four sixes. 38th over: Scotland 250-3 (MacLeod 70, Munsey 31) As Mike Atherton says on Sky, Rashid’s last three overs are key here. If Scotland get after him, England could be in serious trouble. “Where’s Buttler?” asks Robin Bextor. He’s been rested for this game. 37th over: Scotland 245-3 (MacLeod 67, Munsey 28) Another reverse sweep for four from Munsey, and Moeen ends with figures of 10-0-66-0. England look resigned to chasing in excess of 350+. 36th over: Scotland 237-3 (MacLeod 66, Munsey 22) Mark Wood is back, and the extra pace allows MacLeod to ping a cut to the fence. Munsey helps another boundary to fine leg. England are being smashed all round the park! 35th over: Scotland 227-3 (MacLeod 61, Munsey 17) A good over from Moeen; two from it. Scotland need 115 from the last 15 overs to make their highest ever ODI score. 34th over: Scotland 225-3 (MacLeod 60, Munsey 16) Oof. Munsey thumps Plunkett contemptuously over mid-off for a one-bounce four. England are in a bit of trouble here. The pitch and the short boundaries are in their favour, and in that sense even 350 should not worry them. But the mind can do funny things when defeat is unthinkable. 33rd over: Scotland 218-3 (MacLeod 59, Munsey 11) For the second time in as many overs, Munsey reverse sweeps Moeen over backward point for four. This is now Scotland’s highest score against England. Is something brilliant happening? 32nd over: Scotland 211-3 (MacLeod 57, Munsey 6) MacLeod gets up on his toes to back cut Plunkett for four, another extremely good stroke. “Rob,” says John Starbuck. “Going round the Grange’ is a snappy phrase, and one you should keep in reserve for future cases of a bowler’s efforts being smashed about.” But what would they mean for our old favourite, ‘haemmorhaging runs’? 31st over: Scotland 205-3 (MacLeod 52, Munsey 5) The new batsman is the left-handed George Munsey, and  he gets off the mark with a jaunty reverse sweep for four . “They say when you’ve got wickets in hand you should double your score at 30 overs,” says Habit Butt. “We’re midway through the 30th over and Scotland are 200 with wickets in hand so they are on course for 400 plus. England’s world record is at risk isn’t it?” I wouldn’t go that far, but they could get 350. 30th over: Scotland 200-2 (MacLeod 52, Munsey 0) “The question about the England batsman with three 150+ scores in ODIs - is the answer something brilliant like Ronnie Irani?” says Eamonn Maloney. “If not, can you devise a question (perhaps using some sort of Jeopardy-style reverse function on statsguru) to which the answer is, brilliantly, Ronnie Irani?” Sadly, I already know the question: when England left Robin Smith out of the Test team for the final time in 1996, who replaced him? Plunkett returns to the attack and takes his second wicket. Berrington drove high towards long off, where Root took a calm running catch. 29th over: Scotland 196-2 (MacLeod 53, Berrington 34) MacLeod dances down to chip Moeen over midwicket for a one-bounce four – and then brings up a sizzling 36-ball fifty with a fast-handed sweep for six! Never mind 300, Scotland should be eyeing their highest ODI title: 341 for nine against Canada in 2014. This is getting serious for England, who have been unusually sluggish all day. 28th over: Scotland 183-2 (MacLeod 41, Berrington 33) MacLeod spanks Willey through the covers for four more. The absence of Ben Stokes means England only have five bowlers plus Joe Root. I would get Root on here because Willey is going round the Grange. 27th over: Scotland 176-2 (MacLeod 36, Berrington 32) Berrington charges Moeen and belts him straight for a one-bounce four. That’s a cracking stroke. Scotland have been really impressive and should make at least 300. Something might be happening here. 26th over: Scotland 167-2 (MacLeod 35, Berrington 24) Scotland have targeted Willey with great success. His six overs have gone from 48, including eight from that last one. Berrington hit his first four, a classy drive down the ground. “I have a few reservations about the England bowling line-up in general and was a bit surprised by Morgan’s comment that we don’t need Archer as there’s a long queue of bowlers fighting for selection,” says Tom van der Gucht. “However, I’m not so sure. Our trump card in one-day cricket is a batting unit that feels confident at chasing down any total, but we could do with a couple more wicket-taking options to reduce some of those big targets in the first place. Ball just seems to remain a bit fast-medium right arm and doesn’t seem to threaten, or offer, as much as a genuine quick.” I think the first choice attack of Wood, Woakes, Plunkett, Stokes, Rashid and Moeen is pretty strong, but the depth keeps me awake most night. I hope Tom Curran gets some games this summer. If they fast-track Archer I think he’ll be in the World Cup squad, despite Morgan’s comments the other day. 25th over: Scotland 160-2 (MacLeod 34, Berrington 18) MacLeod, who looks in excellent touch, sweeps Moeen for consecutive boundaries – and it would have been three but for some brilliant fielding by Willey. MacLeod is a dangerous player, with three ODI scores in excess of 150. Not many players have managed that. Actually, here’s a quiz question: who is the only England batsman with three ODI scores of 150+? 24th over: Scotland 148-2 (MacLeod 23, Berrington 17) David Willey replaces the excellent Rashid (7-0-39-1), who has three overs left to bowl later in the innings. Five from an entirely forgettable over. 23rd over: Scotland 143-2 (MacLeod 21, Berrington 14) Berrington is struggling to keep pace with the other batsmen, despite that six off Rashid. A single off Moeen’s fifth ball takes him to 15 from 30 deliveries. Everyone else has scored at more than a run a ball. 22nd over: Scotland 141-2 (MacLeod 20, Berrington 14) A low full toss from Rashid is swept for four by MacLeod, who has quietly moved to 20 from 19 balls. Scotland are still on course for 300. MacLeod survives an optimistic LBW appeal from a googly later in the over. 21st over: Scotland 131-2 (MacLeod 10, Berrington 13) Moeen’s second over is milked for five. What more is there to say? 20th over: Scotland 126-2 (MacLeod 8, Berrington 11) Berrington, with the minimum of fuss, dumps Rashid’s first ball over long-on for six. That’s followed by five dot balls, with Rashid demonstrating all his variations. He’s bowled a lot of googlies today. 19th over: Scotland 120-2 (MacLeod 8, Berrington 5) Moeen Ali comes on to replace Plunkett (4-0-29-1). He’s out of the Test team but is an almost irreplaceable member of the ODI side. He has an unsuccessful LBW against MacLeod, who is hit in the stomach when he misses a sweep; he was outside the line of off stump. England have frittered their review anyway. Four runs from the over. 18th over: Scotland 116-2 (MacLeod 6, Berrington 3) Berrington is dropped off Rashid, a really sharp low chance to Root at slip. It was another good delivery from Rashid, a googly that took the edge of Berrington’s attempted drive. “Morning Rob,” says Simon McMahon. “As a follower and supporter of the England cricket team for over 30 years now, I’ve got mixed feelings today. What’s wrong with me, it’s Scotland v England for goodness sake!! It should be simple, but cricket’s never that, is it? Can it be a tie? And though I’m over the West Indies heartache, imagine if this was in the World Cup...” 17th over: Scotland 112-2 (MacLeod 4, Berrington 1) It’s much more sedate now, as you’d expect with two new batsmen at the crease, and Plunkett gets through an over that costs just four. “It was hard to miss S Sub’s Brexit comments!” says Tom Bowtell. “Of course I disagree with his position, but I also find it refreshing for a sportsman to share something other than beige platitudes with the world. For me, he’s the definition of a mystery spinner and we need him to play.” I’m still uneasy about the fact he spent March in the clinic for smartphone addiction. We’ll be looking for a key wicket in a World Cup final and he’ll be all over the place because of Pinterest cravings. 16th over: Scotland 108-2 (MacLeod 1, Berrington 0) That was almost a third wicket. MacLeod took a nervous single to Bairstow at mid-on and would have been short with a direct hit. Another good over from Rashid, who has changed the mood of this match; he is a serious one-day bowler now. 15th over: Scotland 107-2 (MacLeod 0, Berrington 0) That was the last ball of the over. I wouldn’t say are back in the game, as they were never exactly out of it, but those two wickets are very welcome. Another one gone. Cross tries to glide Plunkett through the vacant slip area but gets it too fine and Billings moved smartly to his right to take a good catch. Cross played some beautiful strokes in his 39-ball 49. 14th over: Scotland 103-1 (Cross 44, MacLeod 0) “Glancing at the team on the Guardian scorecard, I see that after all the press furore, S Sub wasn’t picked for his debut after all,” laments Tom Bowtell. “Really hope that as a left arm-wrist spinner and right handed scoop specialist batsman they blood him sooner rather than later. Do you think he has what it takes?” I think he’s got the talent but I’m worried about his character. Did you see his tweets about Brexit? Boy did England need that wicket. Two balls after being launched miles over long off for six by Coetzer, Rashid skidded one through to hit the pad in front of off and middle. He went up for LBW, though it turned out Coetzer was caught behind after an inside edge onto pad. Either way it ends a spectacular tone-setting innings: 58 from 49 balls with eight fours and two sixes. 13th over: Scotland 97-0 (Cross 44, Coetzer 52) A bit of width from Plunkett allows Coetzer to drive superbly between extra cover and mid off for four. The pitch is flat, it’s true, but Cross and Coetzer have played some glorious strokes. And there’s another! Coetzer launches Plunkett over long-off for six to bring up a quite brilliant fifty from just 44 balls. Another high-class cover drive from Cross makes it 15 from the over. This is great stuff. “I hope we didn’t pick Willey (who has been disappointing for a while now) on the back of his recent ton,” says Robert Taylor. “With Stokes out of the team we’re already a bowler light and we don’t want to have to rely on Root to bowl a few. Maybe Ball would have been a better shout?” I’m not sure about Ball; he’s had some grim bowling figures in the last year. Back-up seam bowling is probably England’s biggest worry ahead of next year. 12th over: Scotland 82-0 (Cross 40, Coetzer 41) For the first time in a while, England get through an over without conceding a boundary. Rashid already looks like a key man today. “I can see why England chose to bowl in this game - they like chasing a target - but it’s asking a lot of Bairstow to keep all of one innings then open the next,” says John Starbuck. “Does this never enter into consideration?” It does – which is why Sam Billings is keeping wicket. I think that’s a sensible approach. 11th over: Scotland 76-0 (Cross 38, Coetzer 37) Liam Plunkett, England’s middle-overs enforcer, comes into the attack. England need him to restore some order – but Scotland get their one boundary for the over when Coetzer slices high over backward point. England won’t be panicking yet. 10th over: Scotland 70-0 (Cross 37, Coetzer 32) In fact, Adil Rashid is coming on for the last over of the Powerplay. He has a big LBW appeal against Cross first ball – it’s turned down by Marais Erasmus but England decide to review. It was a googly from Rashid which seemed to be turning past leg stump. Replays confirm that was indeed the case, so England lose their only review. That, as Ian Ward says on Sky, was a bit of a desperate review from England. After a couple of nervous prods, Cross sweeps firmly round the corner for yet another boundary. He has 37 from 28 balls and has played beautifully. 9th over: Scotland 64-0 (Cross 32, Coetzer 31) Coetzer gets his fifth boundary, and the 12th of the innings, with a majestic back-foot drive off Wood. A swipe over mid-on goes for four more, and England look pretty clueless at the moment. I’m sure we’ll see some spin once the Powerplay has finished. 8th over: Scotland 56-0 (Cross 32, Coetzer 23) Willey is mowed over midwicket for four by Coetzer. When the ball doesn’t swing he looks fairly ordinary, certainly in comparison to Chris Woakes, and Cross puts him away for three consecutive boundaries later in the over to take Scotland past fifty. A steer to third man was followed by a withering pull round the corner and a lovely push-drive through extra cover. Willey’s four overs have disappeared for 36. 7th over: Scotland 39-0 (Cross 20, Coetzer 18) A short ball from Wood is back cut to the short boundary by Cross, another accomplished shot. They have batted excellently on what looks a belting pitch. 6th over: Scotland 35-0 (Cross 16, Coetzer 18) Scotland will be looking for a big total on this pitch, maybe 300. Coetzer continues their fine start with a muscular drive over mid-off for four off Willey. The ball is making a beautiful sound of the bat this morning – almost as good as this. 5th over: Scotland 31-0 (Cross 16, Coetzer 14) For somebody who feels integral to this team, Wood has a surprisingly mediocre ODI record: 27 wickets at 46 apiece. He almost gets his 28th wicket when Cross, beaten for pace, top-edges a hook that just beats the man running back from square leg. 4th over: Scotland 28-0 (Cross 14, Coetzer 13) A wide half-volley from Willey is square-driven nicely for four by Cross, who then plays a gorgeous back-foot push-drive that races to the cover boundary. That was a beautiful stroke. 3rd over: Scotland 20-0 (Cross 6, Coetzer 13) Coetzer pulls Wood over the top for a couple. He was slightly beaten for pace but got enough on it to clear square leg comfortably. Coetzer gets his first boundary later in the over, driving handsomely through the covers. It’s been a good start for Scotland and Coetzer gets four more with a risky on-drive that just beats the diving Willey at mid-on. 2nd over: Scotland 8-0 (Cross 6, Coetzer 1) A poor ball from Willey, short and wide, is belted emphatically to the cover boundary by Cross. No early swing for Willey, and this looks a decent pitch as well. 1st over: Scotland 1-0 (Cross 1, Coetzer 0) Mark Wood starts the innings with an excellent over, in which he beats the outside edges of both Matt Cross and Kyle Coetzer. The captain Coetzer is the key wicket for England – he has a superb ODI record. “Morning Rob,” says Phil Sawyer. “Am I the only one who would quite like England to lose today? Not because I want England to lose, but because I want Scotland to stick two great big fingers up to the ICC and the power brokers who could only think about securing their own pieces of the pie and shrinking the World Cup so that the very idea that it’s a World Cup becomes laughable. Unexpectedly angry and serious one up from me for starters. Normal larking about will be resumed later.” I just want cricket to be the winner. I’m torn on this. I agree that some associate nations should be in the World Cup - otherwise, what’s the point - but equally it should remain an elite tournament. There is surely a better way, though, even if I don’t know what it is. Ideally there should be at least 12 teams, probably 14. After a stirring bagpipe rendition of Flower of Scotland, the players are ready to go. There’s plenty of other cricket going on today. You can follow all the county action with our live blog. Dylan Budge makes his ODI debut for Scotland. England have a few players missing – Stokes, Woakes, Buttler – but still look very strong. Scotland Coetzer (c), Cross (wk), MacLeod, Berrington, Munsey, Budge, Leask, Sharif, Watt, Sole, Evans. England Bairstow, Roy, Hales, Root, Morgan (c), Billings (wk), Ali, Willey, Plunkett, Rashid, Wood. Eoin Morgan says it looks like a good wicket; we know that England like to chase. Kyle Coetzer says he’d have been happy to bat or bowl first. A bit of pre-match reading A bit of news on Jimmy Anderson (from an ECB press release) England and Lancashire seamer Jimmy Anderson will take a six-week period of rehabilitation on a long-standing right shoulder injury. He will miss Lancashire’s next two County Championship matches against Worcestershire at Blackfinch New Road (June 20) and the match against Hampshire on June 25. “We have five Tests against India in a six-week period from August 1, which will be an intense and challenging period for all our bowlers, and therefore it’s vital that we ensure Jimmy goes into that series in the best possible condition,” said Trevor Bayliss, the England coach. “Jimmy has to manage the issue with his right shoulder, and we’ve been advised that the best way for him to prepare for the India series is to take a six-week break from cricket now, initially to rest it and then to work slowly back to cricket. “That six-week period covers Lancashire’s two Championship matches over the next three weeks. We will then monitor to see where Jimmy is at and ensuring he is ready for the India series.” Hello. Strange times are these in which we live. Donald Trump is US president, grown adults communicate in hashtags and emojis. And strangest of all – you know exactly where this is going, don’t you - England are the best ODI side in the world. Over the next few weeks they will hope to confirm that status, and their concomitant position as favourites for next year’s World Cup. They have series against Australia (five matches) and India (three matches) to come, but their white-ball summer starts with this one-off ODI against Scotland in Edinburgh. Scotland have improved massively in recent times, and were desperately unfortunate not to qualify for the World Cup. But it would still be mighty strange if they beat England for the first time in their history. Play starts at 11am."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2018/jun/11/crimea-football-russia-annexation-divided-tavria-simferopol","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-11T16:07:09Z","webTitle":"Football in Crimea: the club split in two by Russia's invasion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/11/crimea-football-russia-annexation-divided-tavria-simferopol","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/11/crimea-football-russia-annexation-divided-tavria-simferopol","fields":{"headline":"Football in Crimea: the club split in two by Russia's invasion","bodyText":"When Russia won the right to host this year’s World Cup in 2010, Tavria Simferopol were in Ukraine’s top division. The club’s “ultras” – hardcore fans – sang patriotic songs, and nursed fond memories of Tavria’s biggest triumph: when the club won independent Ukraine’s first Premier League title in 1992. Eight years later, as the World Cup gets under way, there are two teams called Tavria: one still plays in Simferopol, the capital of Russian-annexed Crimea, and one plays across the newly drawn border in mainland Ukraine.Russia is hosting the world’s biggest sporting event with relations between Moscow and the west at their lowest point since the cold war. Its annexation of Crimea in 2014 led to sanctions, counter-sanctions and a reappraisal of the threat from Russia in the west. For Tavria, the annexation split the fanbase along political lines: many of Tavria’s ultras fled to Ukraine, while pro-Russian fans stayed behind to support the newly named TSK-Tavria. But due to international sanctions, the team has been banned from playing in the Russian league. It now plies its trade in an eight-team local Crimean league. Football in Crimea is a reflection of the broader situation in the peninsula, which has been fully severed from Ukraine but not fully integrated with Russia due to international sanctions. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, opened a bridge joining Crimea to mainland Russia last month amid much fanfare, and a huge, modern new airport has recently replaced the boxy Soviet terminal that had previously served the region. But the only planes landing at Simferopol international airport come from Russia, because only a handful of nations, including North Korea and Syria, recognise the Russian takeover as legitimate. International sim cards and credit cards do not work, and almost all foreign business is banned due to sanctions. After the annexation, the Russian Football Union admitted Tavria, as well as two other Crimean clubs, into the Russian league for the 2014-15 season, but Uefa, European football’s governing body, said it would not allow the situation after the Ukrainian football authorities complained Russia had “stolen” three clubs. “I don’t know how sport can be affected by sanctions, it’s absolute nonsense,” complained Sergei Borodkin, the president of TSK-Tavria, the new Simferopol-based club, and also the vice-president of Crimea’s football governing body. “Crimean Football Union (with special status)” is embossed on the sign outside the union’s headquarters in Simferopol, reflecting the uneasy compromise between Russian football and Uefa over the status of the region. After Kosovo and Gibraltar were granted full Uefa member status in 2016, Crimea is now the only football federation with this special status. This gives the Crimean league recognition, but bans its teams from taking part in Russia-wide competitions. “Professional football has basically died in Crimea,” said Sergei Portnykh, a 31-year-old Tavria fan who has set up after-school football training for three- to seven-year-olds. “With the younger kids it’s more about physical and psychological development than actual football, but when they get to nine or 10 it’s important for them to have role models.” Younger children who were not registered in any youth setup prior to 2014 may still be able to join the youth academies of Russian teams. Older players have Uefa registration documents marking them as Ukrainian players, which makes transfers to other countries tricky, though Borodkin said a compromise has been found. That still leaves the problem of the dubious standards in the Crimea-only league. “It’s just not the same any more. You go to the stadium, and there’s such a small crowd, and there are just empty feelings and sadness instead of all the old emotions,” said one Tavria fan who went to every game before the Russian takeover. He asked to remain anonymous because he said the Russian security service, the FSB, monitored fans for signs of potential violence or pro-Ukraine views. Tavria fans had fought and died on both sides in the war in eastern Ukraine, he said. He is still in touch with some friends who had pro-Ukraine views and left Crimea in the aftermath of the annexation, but they tried to restrict their conversations to football, and not politics. Tavria fans who moved to Ukraine set up a new club in Beryslav, a small town in south Ukraine. The club plays in the Ukrainian second division as Tavria Simferopol, despite it being no longer based in the Crimean city. “We have a problem taking players actually from Crimea, because we can’t have any players with a pro-Russian position,” said Oleh Komuniar, a Tavria fan who now lives in Kiev, and is the vice-president of the Crimean football federation in exile. The team finished this year’s season with an impressive 9-0 victory, but draws crowds of just a few hundred and struggles for finances. Backers of the two Tavrias like to dismiss the other as an irrelevance, claiming not to follow or be interested in the other. They also have differing attitudes to the World Cup being in Russia. During the tournament, unlike in most other Russian cities, there will be no official fan zone in Simferopol, because Fifa sponsors cannot operate in Crimea. “It would be nice to have a fan zone, but it’s not a problem, we will set up a ‘zone of collective viewing’ instead so everyone here can enjoy the World Cup,” said Borodkin. Komuniar, speaking from Kiev, was not sure he would watch the World Cup iat all. “Holding a tournament there when they’re killing people in Ukraine is disgusting. If I do watch, I’m going to be supporting all the teams who play against Russia,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2018/jun/11/anti-adani-protesters-target-construction-firm-wagners-over-30m-contract","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-10T18:00:10Z","webTitle":"Anti-Adani protesters target construction firm Wagners over $30m contract","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jun/11/anti-adani-protesters-target-construction-firm-wagners-over-30m-contract","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/jun/11/anti-adani-protesters-target-construction-firm-wagners-over-30m-contract","fields":{"headline":"Anti-Adani protesters target construction firm Wagners over $30m contract","bodyText":"Anti-Adani activists say they have launched an escalating disruption campaign against Queensland construction company Wagners, which is being targeted over a $30m contract to build an airstrip for the Carmichael coalmine. Members of the group Galilee Blockade entered a Wagners industrial site at Pinkenba near the Port of Brisbane on Sunday afternoon, dressed as superheroes, as a precursor to further protests. The company, which listed on the stock exchange in December, has previously said it would not be “intimidated” by activists if targeted for its role in the Adani Carmichael mine. Galilee Blockade has previously targeted contractors working with Adani on the project, and claims success for the decision by Downer EDI last year to back out of a $2.6bn construction deal. The fresh protest action marks the resumption of those tactics by the anti-Adani group, and comes after a quiet few months in which the Indian conglomerate has made few public statements while attempting to finance the project. There are increasing signs Adani is baulking at any further financial commitment to the project while it searches for an investor. Those signs include a recent decision by Townsville council to extend negotiations over a deal to part-fund the airport. The Townsville mayor, Jenny Hill, said the deal would not be signed off until Adani “can guarantee the project will go ahead”. • Sign up to receive the top stories every morning Wagners has the contract to build the airport, in total worth about $30m. The activists say the financial cost of their disruption campaign would quickly cancel out any profit Wagners would make from the Adani contract. “Any large contractor willing to threaten our future by working with Adani is bound to be targeted by citizen activists,” Galilee Blockade spokesman Ben Pennings said. “Australians clearly don’t want the Adani mine and will act decisively when governments fail to.” “These citizens are not just disguised as superheroes, they are superheroes. Risking arrest for the wellbeing of your fellow citizens is both courageous and, seemingly, necessary.” “It’s not acceptable for any company to threaten massive environmental damage against the will of traditional owners and the Australian people. We will disrupt and blockade Wagners’ industrial sites till they get out of bed with Adani.” On Sunday the activists handed out flyers to Wagners staff asking for anonymous information about the Pinkenba site. Guardian Australia has contacted Wagners for comment."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/jun/10/barnaby-joyce-in-street-altercation-with-photographer-after-leaving-church","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-10T06:08:00Z","webTitle":"Barnaby Joyce in street altercation with photographer after leaving church","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/jun/10/barnaby-joyce-in-street-altercation-with-photographer-after-leaving-church","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/jun/10/barnaby-joyce-in-street-altercation-with-photographer-after-leaving-church","fields":{"headline":"Barnaby Joyce in street altercation with photographer after leaving church","bodyText":"Barnaby Joyce has posted videos of himself confronting a photographer on the street, saying he cannot even go to church without being harassed. “Coming out of church, guess who is hiding in the bushes taking photos, yet won’t give his name or who he works for,” Joyce tweeted. “We did the Sunday program to stop this, this is why we need a tort of privacy.” The ugly confrontation comes after Joyce, who applied for medical leave from parliament last month, admitted to lobbying New South Wales Nationals MPs recently to oppose a bill implementing 150m “safe access zones” around abortion clinics in NSW to prevent protesters from harassing women who are trying to enter the clinics. In the videos Joyce posted to Twitter, he repeatedly demands to know the photographer’s name and the media outlet he works for but the photographer won’t tell him. In one video, the photographer accuses Joyce of behaving in an intimidating fashion, telling Joyce he should go back to his regular job “as a bouncer”. “How can you seriously come out of church and size someone up to punch them?” the photographer says. “I didn’t size you up to punch you,” Joyce replies. “Yes you did, you pulled your right hand back and if I hadn’t actually walked away you would have clubbed me,” the photographer says. In the same video a local man on the street takes Joyce’s side in the argument, accusing the photographer of hiding behind a tree “like a rotten snake, mate”. “Can’t he just even come to church to pray to God without you [here]?” the man says. “What are you doin’ mate? Leave us alone.” Joyce has repeatedly complained in recent months about being harassed by the media, saying drones have been flying over his house and paparazzi have been waiting at the airport for him. He said he agreed to a controversial $150,000 tell-all interview with his partner, Vikki Campion, to try to make the media interest in their relationship die down. During that interview with Channel Seven, he revealed he had campaigned to hold the seat of New England for the government during last year’s byelection while knowing he would soon have to stand down as leader of the National party and deputy prime minister because Campion had fallen pregnant. During the interview the couple refused to answer questions about precisely when their relationship started, and he shut down questions about a public confrontation between Campion and his former wife of two decades, Natalie."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/jun/10/australian-sas-under-scrutiny-after-allegations-unarmed-afghan-men-killed","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-10T01:19:35Z","webTitle":"Australian SAS under scrutiny after allegations unarmed Afghan men killed","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/jun/10/australian-sas-under-scrutiny-after-allegations-unarmed-afghan-men-killed","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/jun/10/australian-sas-under-scrutiny-after-allegations-unarmed-afghan-men-killed","fields":{"headline":"Australian SAS under scrutiny after allegations unarmed Afghan men killed","bodyText":"Australia’s elite special forces (SAS) are under renewed scrutiny after serious new allegations surfaced over the weekend of executions of unarmed Afghan men during raids. The new allegations, which are understood to be under investigation by an internal inquiry, have troubled soldiers who have spoken out about the events. They raise new questions about the chain of command within the SAS and the behaviour of Australia’s most highly trained forces. The ABC has revealed that three Afghan men were killed by SAS forces during a raid on the southern Afghanistan town of Darwan on 11 September 2012, in circumstances that raise questions about whether Australian troops “crossed the line.” Soldiers present have spoken about the incident, which the ABC says are under investigation by the special internal inquiry headed by the New South Wales supreme court judge Major General Paul Brereton. According to the ABC, about 50 Australian SAS forces arrived by helicopter near the town, searching for Australia’s No 1 target in Afghanistan – a rogue Afghan soldier named Hekmatullah. Hekmatullah murdered three Australian soldiers – Corporal Stjepan Milosevic, Private Robert Poate and Sapper James Martin – as they played cards at a patrol base called Wahab, then fled the base. Australian military sources described a fevered period in which special forces soldiers were sent out on mission after mission, hunting the fugitive Afghan soldier. One source told the ABC “things did get a bit heavy-handed”, while another said “things went a bit sideways there”. According to Afghans who were rounded up in Darwan, three soldiers made them sit and began asking questions about Hekmatullah. The soldiers said through an interpreter that somebody in the nearby village of Nawjay had seen Hekmatullah on a wanted leaflet and phoned the security forces to say Mohammad Gul’s family was sheltering the fugitive. They accused the men of being Taliban sympathisers, of sheltering Hekmatullah and of having taken him by motorbike to meet with the Taliban. Soon afterwards, according to Sayed Hamid Khan, the soldiers made two men, Haji Nazar Gul and Yaro Mama Faqir, stand up, and took them into a room where they stored almonds. It was the last time the two of them were seen alive. “There were almonds in the room, a noise started in the almonds. With the noise, shots were fired,” one of the Afghani witnesses interviewed by the ABC says. The men say no one saw what happened in the almond room but later that day Yaro Mama Faqir and Haji Nazar Gul were found dead. They say the men were unarmed and under detention when they were taken into the almond room. However, the ABC understands that at the post-mission debrief, the Australian soldiers involved reportedly said that the two men were armed, so any shootings were justified. Another man also died that day. Ali Jan Faqir had his donkeys loaded up and when interrogated by the soldiers told them he was returning to the mountains where his house was. Then, they say, Ali Jan Faqir was led away by the soldiers. Hours later he was dead. The ABC could not locate any eyewitnesses to Ali Jan Faqir’s death or the events immediately preceding it but a number of accounts circulating in the village have him being kicked or thrown from a high earth bank, or wall, into a ditch. The Sun-Herald also reported on a separate incident in 2009 in which an SAS regiment trooper, who was on his first mission, was pressured to execute an unarmed elderly detainee, as part of a “blooding” ritual. On the same mission in 2009, the Herald said, one SAS soldier referred to as Leonidis had pushed a a bound prisonor off a small cliff, severely injuring his face in the fall. As he lay there, Leonidis was part of a decision to “get him out of his misery” by machine-gunning him. His prosthetic leg was souvenired and used as a drinking vessel at SAS headquarters in Perth, the Fairfax paper said. The ABC said the events at Darwan are a subject of significant interest to a closed-doors inquiry currently being carried out into the conduct of Australia’s special forces in Afghanistan. The inquiry, headed by Brereton, is expected to report before the end of the year. The inquiry was commissioned by the then chief of army, Lieutenant General Angus Campbell, who is soon to become chief of the defence force. The inquiry follows a scoping study by conducted by academic Dr Samantha Crompvoets. Crompvoet’s report is said to detail “unsanctioned and illegal application of violence on operations” and “a complete lack of accountability” involving Australia’s elite special forces."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2018/jun/10/vernon-bogdanor-brexit-amendment-government-survival-risk","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-10T06:01:43Z","webTitle":"One Brexit amendment that puts the government’s survival at risk","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jun/10/vernon-bogdanor-brexit-amendment-government-survival-risk","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/jun/10/vernon-bogdanor-brexit-amendment-government-survival-risk","fields":{"headline":"One Brexit amendment that puts the government’s survival at risk","bodyText":"The House of Commons will this week on Tuesday and Wednesday consider whether or not to accept the fundamental amendments made by the House of Lords to the EU withdrawal bill. Some have likened the significance of the debates to the Norway debate of May 1940, which displaced Neville Chamberlain replacing him with Winston Churchill. The government will probably secure reversal of the most radical of the Lords amendments – committing Britain to retain the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights after Brexit and to remain in the European Economic Area with Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein. It may be defeated on the amendment requiring it to “inform Parliament of the steps it has taken to negotiate British participation in a customs union”, but it can live with that, since the amendment does not commit the government actually to remain in the customs union. But the most dangerous amendment, from the government’s point of view, is that proposed by Lord Hailsham, which would require both houses to approve the agreement by 30 November 2018, and to pass an act providing for the implementation of the agreement by 31 January 2019. This seemingly innocuous amendment would give the House of Lords, around 80% of whose members support Remain, a veto over Brexit. The Lords have the power to refuse to consider a motion to approve the withdrawal agreement; they could delay passage of the bill providing for its implementation. The amendment would also allow parliament to refuse to accept any agreement. In consequence, Britain would remain a member of the European Union in defiance of the outcome of the referendum. More fundamentally, the Hailsham amendment would substitute parliament for government in the negotiating process. If parliament refused to approve the agreement, it would require the government to return to the negotiating table to secure a better one. That is a constitutional absurdity. Parliament’s role is to scrutinise legislation and policy; 650 MPs, still less 800 peers, cannot themselves negotiate. In international affairs, Britain must be represented by the government, not by parliament, which has never, in all our history, negotiated a treaty. Only those directly involved in the negotiation can judge what is attainable and what is not. They cannot make these judgments if they lack the authority to decide. The Hailsham amendment would weaken the position of British negotiators, once it became known that any agreement concluded could be overturned by a parliament in which Remainers predominate. The government has accepted that parliament, like the European Parliament, must have a meaningful vote on the withdrawal agreement. But just as the European Parliament does not seek to bind the commission, so also parliament must not seek to bind the hands of ministers. The government’s position is that if the withdrawal agreement is defeated by parliament, then instead of re-negotiation, Britain will exit from the European Union on 29 March 2019 without a deal. But it is difficult to believe that the government could survive such a defeat. Indeed the Commons, in a hung parliament, could at any time, throw the government out, as it did the Callaghan government in March 1979. The consequence, were that to happen would, under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act, be either a weak minority Corbyn government or a general election. The Hailsham amendment, therefore, lights a powder keg that threatens both Britain’s negotiating position with the EU and the survival of the government. But it does draw attention to the fundamental problem facing the government, which is seeking to implement an instruction from the British people in the Brexit referendum to which the majority of MPs and peers are opposed. For the first time in British constitutional history, parliament is passing legislation in which it does not believe. But what has been decided by the people can be undone only by the people. It cannot be undone by parliament. All that parliament can do is to give the people a chance to decide on the deal. Speaking in Berlin on Thursday, Sir Alan Duncan, the Foreign Office minister, said: “It would just be possible to ask the people in a referendum if they liked the exit deal or not.” That is, indeed, the only way in which the conflict between parliament and government, and indeed the conflict within the Conservative party, can be resolved.

A report by prosecutors in Rome, compiled earlier this year and obtained by the Guardian, said the allegations of harassment and groping against Carlo Tavecchio were likely to be accurate, but that the case was not pursued because it had been reported too late to authorities. However, the prosecutors outlined further reasons for their decision not to pursue the allegations against Tavecchio, made by Elisabetta Cortani, the president of the Lazio Women’s football club, who was 50 at the time. The report said that Cortani’s age and the fact she had dealt with Tavecchio in the past, meant she would not have been in a state of fear or subjugation. Tavecchio’s controversial tenure as head of Italy’s football federation ended in November. He resigned after the men’s national team – four-time winners of the World Cup – failed to qualify for this year’s tournament. Tavecchio had also been frequently criticised for a series of racist remarks. According to the prosecutors’ report, Cortani’s complaint, filed on 24 November 2017, was based on two incidents reported to authorities.. Tavecchio has denied that the incidents occurred. In one allegation, Cortani describes going to Tavecchio’s office in May 2015 to ask him about some sports clubs joining the football federation. According to Cortani, Tavecchio approached and began touching her breasts and said: ‘You look good! You have great tits there!’ while trying to kiss her on her lips. Cortani, the report alleged, said she was shocked by his behaviour, pretended to ignore him, and left the room. In August 2016, Cortani wore a hidden camera to a meeting with Tavecchio about a team’s application to a regional championship. According to the complaint, Tavecchio, closed the door behind him and began talking to her in a vulgar way, using an expletive to ask whether she had a lot of sex. He tried to push her on the couch and began kissing her, Cortani said, and began to grope her breasts; this action turned the camera off, though the audio continued. She wriggled away from him. Cortani told the Guardian: “Italian women are sometimes afraid to press charges, but I want tell all the women out there in Italy that it is always worth it. No matter if you are believed or not, we need to to demand respect. We need to fight! I hadn’t spoken until now because I believe in justice….Maybe I am old for them, and I could have defended myself. But I can assure that I felt in a position of inferiority, I felt afraid. Because being in that room meant being in the heart of Italian football. And in that room inferiority and fear have no age.” Her lawyer, Domenico Mariani, said he would file an objection to the prosecutor’s request to dismiss the complaint. “Too many things are not clear in the result of their investigation,’’ he said. Vittoria Pisa, Tavecchio’s lawyer, said Tavecchio knew about the prosecutor’s motion to dismiss the complaint and had always denied the accusations. In 2014, Tavecchio was suspended for six months by Uefa for a racist comment made during his election campaign; the comment referred to bananas when discussing the presence of foreign players in Italy. In 2017, Tavecchio floated the idea that football stadiums could be used as lap dancing venues."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/blog/2018/jun/09/england-south-africa","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-09T18:50:32Z","webTitle":"Change of pace leaves England at a loss and clubs playing catch-up | Paul Rees","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2018/jun/09/england-south-africa","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/blog/2018/jun/09/england-south-africa","fields":{"headline":"Change of pace leaves England at a loss and clubs playing catch-up","bodyText":"When the Premiership clubs raise the issue of Eddie Jones’s national squad training sessions this summer, bristling at a high attrition rate, Twickenham should show a video of England’s latest defeat against a nascent South Africa side who were able to recover from an appalling start because of an ability, honed in Super Rugby, to play at sustained pace. It was a Premiership player, the Sale scrum-half Faf de Klerk, who was his side’s catalyst, but the difference was at forward, where the Springboks retained their shape in the loose when a crazy game was at its most frenetic. England took an early 24-3 lead through the passing ability of George Ford that exploited a narrow, naive defence, but once the home side got hold of the ball, the failings that addled this year’s Six Nations campaign surfaced. England struggled at the breakdown collectively and their discipline melted. They conceded eight penalties at the breakdown, six in the first half and, having dominated possession and territory in the opening quarter, had by the hour mark had the ball for only 33% of the match. Jones had picked a side to play a fast game, sacrificing scrummaging and lineout options, which he reduced further after 35 minutes when he took off a second-row, Nick Isiekwe, and brought on a back‑rower, Brad Shields, who had only been with the squad for a week, in an attempt to plug the breakdown and constrict De Klerk by slowing down South Africa’s possession. His decision to pull Luther Burrell early in the opening Test in Australia two years ago after a slow start worked but Shields had little impact. He was better equipped than his team-mates to deal with the relentless pace of the game, having played Super Rugby for four months, but alone he could not recalibrate the team’s disorientation. International rugby has changed in the past 18 months, as has the game in the European Champions Cup. It is more fluid, faster and places less reliance on set pieces. Jones’s training sessions are regarded as brutal not because he has players smashing into each other, although a judo session in Brighton yielded a few casualties. Everything is done at pace and when players are blowing he does not allow them respite, pushing them to the limits of their endurance and beyond. He has to because the Premiership does not condition players for Test rugby. It has developed considerably as a tournament in its 20 years in terms of facilities and the interest it attracts from spectators and sponsors but it is self-contained in a way the Pro 14 and Super Rugby are not. Those who declaim Jones’s methods tend to be club owners rather than coaches, interested in the bottom line, but this season’s Champions Cup should have shown them how the game is moving. Instead of seeking conflict with England and trying to get Jones to change his training methods, which will not happen, they should be aligning their clubs with the national side, as South Africa have done with their Super Rugby franchises. Just as England lost a game they should have won in Johannesburg, so the Premiership clubs had the playing resources to have made a far greater impact on Europe last season. The elite player agreement between the RFU and the clubs has worked to a point but its value to owners tends to be financial. It is a partnership only in the loose sense of the word and the professional game as a whole should reflect on Saturday’s defeat – only once before had a tier-one nation recovered from a deficit greater than 21 points to win, Wales in Argentina in 1999 – and devise a way of moving forward together. It was only last year that Jones was talking about England overhauling New Zealand at the top of the rankings before the start of next year’s World Cup. Two more defeats in South Africa could see them slip to fifth, with the All Blacks arriving at Twickenham in November. Jones has to look at selection, with Mike Brown playing like a full-back and Elliot Daly an outside back, but the different way matches are refereed in the Premiership and at Test level leaves much of his influence on the training field where, alone, only so much can be achieved."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"politics/2018/jun/09/fewer-leave-voters-back-tories-handling-of-brexit-poll","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-09T18:30:49Z","webTitle":"Leave voters losing faith in Tories' handling of Brexit, poll suggests","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jun/09/fewer-leave-voters-back-tories-handling-of-brexit-poll","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/jun/09/fewer-leave-voters-back-tories-handling-of-brexit-poll","fields":{"headline":"Leave voters losing faith in Tories' handling of Brexit, poll suggests","bodyText":"Leave supporters are losing faith in the Conservatives to lead the Brexit negotiations, according to the latest Opinium poll for the Observer. With Brexiters in the cabinet also fearing that the issue is being mishandled by Downing Street, the poll showed that only 41% of leave voters trust the Tories most to lead the negotiations – the lowest level since January 2017. Overall, 32% of voters trust the Conservatives most to handle the Brexit negotiations, compared with 21% who think Labour would do a better job. The Conservative lead of 11 points on this issue is the lowest recorded by the pollster so far this year. There have been growing complaints among pro-Brexit supporters that Theresa May has set a course for a soft Brexit that could see Britain stay close to EU customs arrangements and regulations. In terms of overall voting intention, the Conservative lead has been cut to two points from the four-point lead it enjoyed last month. The Tories are on 42% of the vote, with Labour on 40%. The Liberal Democrats record 7% support. Jeremy Corbyn’s personal ratings have improved slightly, from -18% last week to -13%. May’s lead over Corbyn on who would make the best prime minister has dropped from 13 points to 10 points. The poll shows the public is shifting towards wanting to stay in the EU’s single market. Currently 38% would prefer to stay in the single market even if it means allowing free movement of Labour, while 34% would prefer to end free movement of labour even if it means we leave the single market. However, the public remain unmoved on whether or not to have a new referendum. Asked if there should be another in-out referendum on the final deal, 38% said there should be, while 48% said there should not be. In terms of May’s future, if it looks unlikely that she can deliver Brexit by the original timeline of March 2019, half (50%) think she should resign as prime minister in favour of someone who has a greater chance of success.

The London mayor has issued a list of demands to Theresa May detailing concerns about delays in rehousing survivors, potential immigration enforcement against some of those affected and the make-up of the panel investigating the disaster. He says the government’s handling of the tragedy risks fuelling perception in some quarters that it is “institutionally indifferent to their continued suffering”. His intervention, which amounts to a call for a wholesale change of approach from government, comes as the inquiry faces calls to consider the role of “institutional racism” in the tragedy. It has already heard a list of serious safety breaches at the tower. In his letter, sent to No 10 yesterday, Khan writes: “As the families who lost relatives, friends and neighbours embark on the inquiry and attempt to rebuild their lives, they need to know that their government and council have the commitment and expertise required to support them. The treatment they have faced over the past year has been, at best, inconsistent and chaotic; and at worst, inhumane. “The process of healing and securing justice will take time but more can be done now to support and care for these families, to make their lives more manageable and ensure they are in a position to fully participate in the inquiry. “The institutional indifference these families have faced in the 12 months since the fire is simply unacceptable. Your government has failed to give the support so clearly required by the local authority as these families experienced repeated failures and broken promises from the government and Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea. It has become ever more apparent to me that your government is unwilling to step in and take responsibility for local response efforts.” Khan calls for communication with the survivors to be improved, for overseas relatives to be allowed to visit the UK to attend the inquiry, and for rehousing efforts to be properly resourced. He says he hasn’t the power to take the measures himself. He concludes that he sees “no evidence” that the Grenfell recovery effort is a national priority. “The scale of the tragedy and loss of life warrant closer attention and intervention from government,” he writes. “You must take the action that is needed to demonstrate that the authorities who have already failed the people are not institutionally indifferent to their continued suffering.” The mayor also called for a “more representative decision-making panel” as soon as possible. The government has already announced that it is adding two members to the inquiry panel who have the skills to examine the cultural and community reasons behind the fire. This followed pressure from survivors and the families of victims. However, they will join the panel only for its second phase: examining why the fire happened. Downing Street strongly disputed the mayor’s criticisms. A spokesman said: “Following the unimaginable tragedy of Grenfell, the government has been working with survivors to support them as they rebuild their lives and to ensure they get the truth and justice they deserve. “One hundred and ninety-eight of 203 households from Grenfell Tower and Grenfell Walk – 98% of households – have now accepted temporary or permanent accommodation. “To assist those in need, the government has spent over £46m to support recovery following the Grenfell Tower fire and committed an additional £34m to support Grenfell recovery. We have provided £100,000 to support local businesses, made £3m available for community spaces and allocated £10m for ongoing mental and emotional support. “The prime minister is committed to helping the people of Grenfell Tower learn the facts about what happened, to see that lessons are learned and justice is done. Phase one of the independent public inquiry is already under way and the prime minister has confirmed that an extra two panel members will be appointed for phase two of the inquiry, to ensure it has the skills and expertise it requires.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2018/jun/10/may-versus-parliament-showdown-brexit","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-10T06:00:45Z","webTitle":"May versus parliament: a showdown over Brexit with her own party","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jun/10/may-versus-parliament-showdown-brexit","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/jun/10/may-versus-parliament-showdown-brexit","fields":{"headline":"May versus parliament: a showdown over Brexit with her own party","bodyText":"When Theresa May boarded an RAF Voyager plane at Heathrow last Thursday afternoon and headed for a two-day G7 summit in Quebec, she must have been hoping for at least a little respite from arguments with her cabinet over Brexit. She had, in any case, to use some time in the air to prepare for what promised to be a difficult meeting with fellow world leaders, in a number of respects. President Trump had reportedly been referring disparagingly to May’s “schoolmarm” style and political correctness in the run-up to the meeting. More serious arguments were also looming with the president, the most pressing being over his decision to impose steel tariffs on the US’s European and other allies, risking a trade war. But Brexit still stalked her all the way across the Atlantic. First there was the wash-up from a heated row with her Brexit secretary, David Davis, whom she had to talk out of resigning over a “backstop” deal on customs before she headed to Heathrow. That dominated a press briefing mid-flight. Then, as the plane was taxiing into the airport terminal at Bagotville airbase, near Quebec, news reached the UK contingent that the foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, had exploded another bomb under cabinet collective responsibility. Johnson had been secretly taped telling a private meeting that, under May’s leadership, Brexit negotiations were heading for “meltdown”. Trump, he said, would do a much better job. Journalists demanded an immediate response from the PM, who had heard nothing of Johnson’s outburst while in the air. Would she sack him? Did she still have full confidence in her foreign secretary? The questions were thrown at the prime minister’s aides as she switched planes onto a Canadian Air Force Hercules and headed to the summit at the Manoir Richelieu resort, leaving the press on the tarmac. As MPs prepare to vote in the Commons this week on crucial Brexit amendments passed in the House of Lords, and as an EU summit approaches that is supposed to agree a post-Brexit customs plans to solve the Irish border problem, any pretence of government unity has been abandoned. The two sides of the Tory Brexit war argue openly, whether they are rivals in cabinet or on the backbenches. It was not only Davis who was threatening to resign on Thursday but several other Brexit-supporting ministers too, among them Davis’s deputy Steve Baker. They – like Johnson – were furious that May’s latest customs plan did not put a time limit on the “backstop” proposal for keeping the UK aligned to the EU customs union if it fails to reach a deal. That omission looked to Brexiters like a ploy to tie the UK permanently into parts of the EU economic system, and a victory for Tory Remainers. May had invited Remain supporters including Anna Soubry and Ken Clarke into Downing Street earlier in the week to brief them on the backstop plan (with no end date). Unsurprisingly, they loved it. Davis’s reaction, equally inevitably, was precisely the reverse. He demanded to see May on Thursday morning and told her in no uncertain terms in two private meetings that she had to include an end date, or it would look like Brexit was never going to happen. “It was the most frank discussion they have ever had,” said a Davis ally. “They have not talked like that before. He made it clear that he had to be listened to if he was to carry on as Brexit secretary.” The PM and Davis then agreed a fudge that said the government “expects” the backstop to conclude at the end of 2021. As one middle-ranking minister put it that day: “All the PM’s energy goes on trying to keep the peace. She tells one side what it wants to hear, then reassures the other side. So we go nowhere.” The disputes run wider, into the heart of the Westminster machine, preventing the joined-up government that is essential in negotiations as complex as those about Brexit. Business leaders who meet ministers in Downing Street say they are listened to politely but never get clarity. Davis is said to see the hand of Olly Robbins, May’s chief Brexit adviser at No 10, behind a drift towards soft-Brexit thinking in Downing Street. Robbins was moved from Davis’s department last year, where he was permanent secretary, as the two never got on. The PM now leans on Robbins increasingly. The trouble for her is that there is increasing speculation in Whitehall that Robbins has had enough and is plotting a move to the private sector by the autumn. While this is denied by No 10, such gossip in high places does not inspire confidence that all is well. The big question now, with the executive in turmoil, is whether parliament will begin to take control – whether a legislature with a large Remain majority will start to seize the initiative in the Brexit process this week. On Tuesday and Wednesday, MPs will debate and vote on a string of amendments passed in the Lords, several of which would wreak havoc with May’s Brexit strategy and further damage her authority if passed in the Commons. They range from one which calls for the government to take steps to negotiate to stay in the customs union, to another which urges it to work towards membership of the European Economic Area (EEA), which would allow the UK to remain in the single market after Brexit. True Remainers want both outcomes, but on the Tory side there is much agonising about how best to get there and whether this week is the moment to strike. Both Tory and Labour MPs who oppose hard Brexit are furious that Jeremy Corbyn has decided to order his MPs to abstain rather than back the EEA amendment, when there were, possibly, enough Tory rebels to support it had Labour piled in. Hilary Benn, who is one of dozens of Labour MPs who will defy his own leader and vote for the EEA amendment, as well as for the customs unions plan (which Labour does support), says this is the moment. “It’s a chance for parliament to take control amid the evident chaos inside the cabinet, which is worrying business and undermining future investment in jobs and prosperity. If government can’t lead, then parliament must,” Benn says. On the customs union, pro-EU Tory rebels seem divided this weekend. Clarke and Soubry are likely to stand firm and rebel – voting against the government in favour of the customs union plan – and it is not impossible that enough others may join them for it to be passed. But at least 12 Tories would need to defy their own government, and the “rebel dozen” are split on tactics. If any fall by the wayside, the chance of defeating the government is gone. Some wonder whether defeating May now, when she is moving in their direction on wider Brexit thinking, might be self-defeating, as it would unleash leadership threats from the Brexiter hardliners just when Remainers had got May where they wanted her. “It is a political calculation,” said one leading Tory Remainer. “If we were to defeat her on that now, does that further weaken her and give the ERG [the hard-Brexit European Research Group, led by Jacob Rees-Mogg] more opportunities to stick their knife into her? And perhaps that is not where we want to be.” This group may decide that it would be better to vote for a stronger amendment on the customs union and on the EEA when the customs and trade bills return to the Commons in July – when it would be too close to the summer break (and Brexit day) to replace a leader. And by then, Labour might have shifted to a more pro-single-market position. There is also, on Tuesday, a vote on a potentially far-reaching amendment concerning what would happen if – and after – the government were to be defeated in a “meaningful vote” on the final deal Theresa May brings back from Brussels this autumn. This Lords amendment says parliament should then take control and instruct the executive through parliamentary motions how to proceed in further negotiations with Brussels. The government, seeing the huge constitutional significance of this, has put down its own counter-amendment to try to neuter its effect, saying that ministers would merely report back within 28 days. Benn says this is the most important vote of all in the coming week – one that could “ensure that parliament gets to decide what should happen when we come to the end of the negotiations”. After decades in which Eurosceptics have demanded curbs on the power of Brussels and a return to parliamentary sovereignty, this could, potentially, be a moment of supreme political irony – the moment when Remain MPs, if they muster the numbers, make that sovereignty a reality in order to stymie the ambitions of the Brexiters. Key flashpoints Customs union This would prevent the European Communities Act being repealed until the government had spelled out steps it has taken to negotiate UK participation in a customs union. The Tories will oppose it, but Labour will vote for it, as will the SNP and Lib Dems. Around a dozen Tories would need to rebel for it to be passed. Anna Soubry and Ken Clarke are likely to rebel but may hold fire and vote for a stronger customs union amendment on the trade or customs bills in July. European Economic Area The amendment would force the government to make remaining in the EEA, and therefore in the single market, a negotiating objective. While there are more than a dozen Tory MPs who would have defied their government and voted for it, Labour has decided not to whip in favour. As a result it is unlikely to pass. But there could still be big Tory and Labour rebellions, showing strength of feeling in both parties for staying in the single market. Meaningful vote This says parliament must approve the withdrawal agreement. But it also says that if the deal the PM brings back from Brussels is rejected by MPs, parliament should effectively take control. The Tories have tabled a counter-amendment to try to neuter it, but the other parties will back it. There may be enough Tory rebels for this to be passed, but not definitely. Environmental protections After fears that EU environmental protections would be seriously weakened after Brexit, the Lords passed an amendment ensuring they would stay in place. With a few tweaks from former cabinet minister Oliver Letwin, the principle of keeping protections in place looks set to be accepted by the government. But campaigners are concerned that the amendment does not go far enough to ensure a green Brexit."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/live/2018/jun/15/us-open-2018-second-round-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-15T23:11:04Z","webTitle":"US Open 2018: second round – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2018/jun/15/us-open-2018-second-round-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/live/2018/jun/15/us-open-2018-second-round-live","fields":{"headline":"US Open 2018: second round – as it happened","bodyText":"Here’s Ewan Murray’s report from the second round: So tomorrow Dustin Johnson will go out in the final group with one of the players who trailed in second after him at Oakmont two years ago: Scott Piercy. (Unless Micky DeMorat, making his professional and US Open debut this week, picks up three shots in his last four holes.) But this is how the top of the leader board looks as we wrap up this report. See you tomorrow for Moving Day! -4: D Johnson E: Piercy, Hoffman +1: Fleetwood, Stenson, Rose, Koepka, Poulter Hoffman’s chip up onto 18 threatens to topple all the way back down the fairway. It just about stays on the green but that was very nervy, and he’s left with a long, long par putt. He leaves it eight feet short. He rattles in the bogey putt. That’s a 69, and once again there’s only one man under par. Meanwhile it’s a 72 for Charles Howell: he’s +3. And it’s three putts from the back of 9 for Fitzpatrick; he slips to +3 but will be happy enough with today’s 70. Back on the 18th tee, Hoffman lashes his drive into the first cut down the right. He can only hack out, and will be doing well to save his par. See also: Matthew Fitzpatrick, who flies his second through the back of 9. This has been a wonderfully exciting afternoon of golf, as players jostle for position ahead of Moving Day, in the hope of launching a challenge at Dustin Johnson over the weekend. All In Good Nick Going Into The Weekend dept. Rickie Fowler comes up short with his second at 18, but chops his third up to eight feet. He can’t save his par, though, and signs for a 69. Still, he’s +2. A 70 for Hideki Matsuyama. He’s +5 overall. And a 69 for Marc Leishman, who is +3 and could be a dark horse for this title. Spieth hangs his head: his championship is almost certainly over. He pushes his par putt to the right. It’s never dropping, and that’s a bogey-bogey finish to follow those four straight birdies. What a sickener for the young Texan, who shot 71 today. But all the damage was done yesterday. He’s +9 ... and has the thousand-yard stare on. McIlroy pars. He’s back in 31, but it’s all way too late. He’s been nowhere near good enough this week, and at +10 he’s off home. He’s long known the jig was up, and doesn’t seem quite so distraught. A 70 today. Lefty survives, though, having shot a marvellous 69. He’s +6, and won’t have given up hope of completing that career slam this week yet. It’d just take one Dustin meltdown, after all. Charley Hoffman becomes only the second man under par! He curls in a big left-to-right breaker on 16 to move to -1. But there’s trouble for Spieth up on 18. He sends his second through the green, but instead of toppling into a bunker, it sticks in some long grass guarding the sand. He’s got a delicate chip coming back ... and he chunks it! His ball still dribbles down to six feet, but his shoulders drop immediately: he knows he’s now got to make that putt to be sure of staying here this weekend. He’s not going to undo all that great work, is he? The defending champion Brooks Koepka signs for a 66. The second of the day, after Tommy Fleetwood. Both men have catapulted themselves up the leader board to +1. Patrick Reed birdies 18 to sign for a 72: he’s +5. And heading the other way: Ian Poulter, who leaves his second into 9 short and left. He’s forced to blast out from sand, to 12 feet. He leaves the par putt short, and that’s a 7-5 finish. He cards a second-round 72. It’ll feel like an 82 right now, after the shenanigans at 8, but upon reflection he’ll realise he’s five shots off the lead going into the weekend of a US Open. Rickie Fowler had dropped one at 15, but he’s bounced straight back at the par-five 16th. He’s +1 again. Rory McIlroy meanwhile makes it four birdies on the back nine at 17, but this is way too late: he’s +10. And his partner Jordan Spieth ends his birdie blitz with a three-putt bogey; he slips to +8 and is dicing with that cut line again! The last hour or so has been positively trippy. Two putts from the back of the green, and that’s a triple bogey seven for Ian Poulter. I suppose if you’re going to suffer your widescreen disaster, it’s better to have it on Friday afternoon rather than Sunday. That’s the only way Poulter can look at that fiasco. Anyway, he’s back to level par now, and all of a sudden Dustin Johnson is four in the lead again. Only one player in the field under par! -4: D Johnson (F) E: Piercy (F), Poulter (17*), Hoffman (15) That was astonishing. Dustinesque. In further bad news for the English challenge, Rose leaks his drive at 9 into the rough, and is always chasing his par. He can’t make it, and that’s a bogey-bogey finish. A 70 for Rose, and he’s back where he started. Meanwhile up on 16, Jordan Spieth makes it four birdies on the bounce, and he’s +7. His weekend attendance looks almost guaranteed now. He was totally out of it an hour ago! He’s a force of nature when his back’s to the wall. Jordan Spieth, ladies and gentlemen! A rush of blood to Poulter’s head, and suddenly his round threatens to unravel! He dumps his second to the 8th into a greenside bunker ... then thins his third a good 40 yards over the other side of the green! His ball has landed on a patch of tatty grass, and he’s got to chip over a clump of fescue ... and he doesn’t commit to the shot at all, sending it bumping apologetically into the thick grass in front of him! This is disastrous. He’s hitting five out of the oomska ... and can only bundle the ball out of the filth and onto the fringe of the green. A total capitulation. Oh Poults! Beef’s been on a miserable run. He parred every hole on the back nine, but since turning he’s bogeyed 1, 2, 3 and 5. So a trundle in for birdie across 6 is most welcome. It may save his, er, bacon because he was beginning to flirt with that cut line. Bogey for Rickie Fowler at 15; he slips to +2, where he’s joined by Matt Fitzpatrick, who birdies 5. And it’s yet another birdie for the defending champ Brooks Koepka, this time at 8. Six birdies in ten holes! And he’s catapulted up the leader board to +1. Three-putt disaster for Justin Rose, who leaves a long birdie putt short at 8, then absent-mindedly lets the tiddler squirt past the cup. He’s back to level par. A short one missed by Paul Casey, too, on 16; that leads to double bogey. He’s really let his round go, shedding five shots since the turn. He’s +6. Poulter makes his birdie on 7, though, and suddenly there’s a bit of separation at the top of the leader board! -4: D Johnson (F) -3: Poulter (16*) E: Piercy (F), Rose (17*), Hoffman (14) Spieth makes his birdie, his third in a row! He’s +8, and there’s a par five coming up. Mickelson makes one as well: after picking up a shot at 10, he’s +6, well inside the cut line. Spare a thought for spare-part Rory, who can only par and at +12 - despite birdies at 11 and 13 - won’t be here for the weekend whatever happens. Birdie for Rickie Fowler on 14! He strokes in a 15-footer to move to +1, after a string of six pars. He’s +1. Ian Poulter fires his tee shot at 7 straight at the flag: he lands it six feet in front of the cup. That’s a great opportunity for birdie. And on that subject, Jordan Spieth arrows his approach at 15 to five feet. Where’s this Spieth been all week? Goodness knows, but at this rate, he’ll be making the cut. It’s a Homeric effort already. Boston firefighter and amateur golfer Matt Parziale birdies 18 to book his place for the weekend! A 73 today to go with yesterday’s 74, and at +7 he’s sure to make the cut! Marvellous scenes! He’ll join Will Grimmer, who finished at +5 today, in the battle for low amateur over the weekend. Luis Gagne and Tyler Strafa could both still make it: they’re at +7 but with plenty of holes left to play. Back-to-back birdies for Jordan Spieth, at 13 and 14, and suddenly surviving the cut doesn’t seem so much of a pipe dream! He’s +9, and the latest birdie putt, a 20-foot slider, was met with a huge eruption by the slightly soaked gallery. Charley Hoffman misses an eight-footer for birdie on 13; he stays at level par. And what an escape by Ian Poulter on 6: he’s hitting his third out of greenside sand, while crouching on the verge, his knees flexed. Soft hands whip the ball out to kick-in range. That’s some bunker shot. Par. Rose’s tee shot at 7 topples down the big bank at the back. He bumps up well to six feet, but it’ll be a tester on this undulating green. He rattles it straight into the middle of the cup. That’s a fine up and down. Meanwhile Casey drops another one, this time at 15, and he slips to +4. And now Poulter grabs second spot on his own! Two big crashes into the heart of the par-five 5th - some doing for one of the slightly shorter hitters out there - and he’s not far away with his 30-foot eagle effort. A tap-in for birdie will do. Back-to-back birds, and he’s just a couple behind Dustin now. -4: D Johnson (F) -2: Poulter (14*) -1: Rose (15*) Some proper belly laughs from the gallery as Paul Casey misses a par tiddler on 14. There’s no subtlety about it at all - a roaring baw haw haw haw hooo - so he does well to knock in the return. He’s thus able to depart the scene with dignity, albeit now at +3. Meanwhile on 9, Scott Piercy rolls in a 30-footer for birdie, and he’s signing for a 71. A fine round, if you factor out the three-putt from four feet. He ends the day at level par. Birdie for Charley Hoffman and Charles Howell at 12, too; they return to level and +1 respectively. All of which tightens things up at the top. -4: D Johnson (F) -1: Rose (14*), Poulter (13*) E: Piercy (F), Hoffman (12) +1: Fleetwood (F), Stenson (F), Howell (12) Another birdie for Brooks Koepka. He makes it on 5, the easiest hole on the course - which admittedly is not saying much. Anyway, that’s five birdies in seven holes, and it would be six had he given his putt on 4 a couple of joules’ worth more energy. The reigning champion is +2, and suddenly Curtis Strange will be wondering if his long-held record as last US Open winner to retain his title could go this week! Ian Poulter makes his putt! No more than that glorious approach deserved. And Justin Rose taps in on 5, as expected. Meanwhile a bogey for Scott Piercy on 8, and suddenly there’s a new look at the top of a leader board that suddenly looks quite healthy for European golf. (I mean, it looks pretty great from a US perspective too, but you get the general point.) -4: D Johnson (F) -1: Rose (14*), Poulter (13*) +1: Fleetwood (F), Stenson (F), Piercy (17*), Hoffman (11) A fine par save by Matthew Fitzpatrick on the par-three 2nd. Having dumped his tee shot in the bunker to the left, his lie was such that he was forced to play out sideways, onto the green but away from the hole. No matter, as he rakes in a 35-footer to stay at +3! Meanwhile on 4, Poulter arrows his approach straight at the flag from 200 yards, leaving himself an uphill eight-footer for birdie. While up on 5, Rose finds the middle of the green in two, then lags his long eagle putt to a couple of feet. In a minute, at least one of these chaps will join Dustin Johnson in the red. Mickelson couldn’t make it back-to-back birdies on 11 so there goes that charge. He stays at +7. Spieth can’t get up and down from the swale, so he’s +11 and suddenly in all sorts of trouble, unlikely to make the weekend. Also free tomorrow and Sunday: Rory McIlroy, though perhaps the birdie he’s made at 11 will give him a little bittersweet cheer. He’s +13. This group has been a complete shambles, all told. I wonder what odds you’d have got on the three being a cumulative 31 over par?! They’ve got 12 majors between them! But then that’s the beauty of golf, why we love it so, but also quite often considering depositing our clubs in the nearest skip. Beef started steadily today, covering his first nine holes in a style Nick Faldo would approve of: nine pars. But since turning for home, the gravy boat is in danger of running aground. Bogey at 1, and then he leaves a monster putt monster short at 2. It’s a really poor mistake, and he drops to +5. All of a sudden, a player looking to build a platform for a run up the leader board is now looking over his shoulder at the cut. Meanwhile on 4, Koepka is one turn of the ball away from making it five birdies in six holes. He stays at +3. A dreadful tee shot by Rose on 4, winged into the thick stuff down the right. He gets a reasonable lie, though, and though he takes a flyer through the green with his second, the 2013 champ gets up and down from the back to remain at level par. That’s some determined golf. Meanwhile Matthew Fitzpatrick has been pootling along quietly - eight pars and a bogey at 12 - but he’s now sent his second into 1 to kick-in distance; he’ll return to +3. Shot of the day by Jimmy Walker! He’s already got one eagle to his name today, and here comes another. From a bunker down the right of 4, he clips the ball cleanly off the sand, sending it cutting onto the green ... and rolling straight into the cup! That shot took a huge left to right turn, and he’s back up to +4! Huge celebrations for a very popular player. Mickelson whips his tee shot at the par-three 11th to 12 feet. He’s suddenly on a roll! McIlroy claps close too. But Spieth pulls his down the big bank to the left. He was in trouble down there yesterday, of course, running up a triple bogey. He’s coming off a double now, too, and at +10 really can’t afford a rerun if he’s to retain any hope whatsoever of staying here for the weekend. Birdie for Mickelson on 10. He’s fighting the cut at the moment - that moves him to +7 - but a strong finish today would get his large support’s interest, even if a realistic title bid is almost certainly beyond him. Meanwhile yet another birdie for the defending champ Koepka, this time at 3. That’s four birdies in five holes, and he’s making a serious statement here. One of the few players taking advantage of the fairly benign conditions right now. A double bogey for McIlroy on 9, a big slice from the tee costing him dear. He’s turned in 39, and at +14 he’s already toast. It’s been a thoroughly miserable performance from the get-go, when he set himself up for a birdie on the opening hole yesterday only to miss the chance and do very little of note afterwards. Rhythmically not dissimilar to his final round at the Masters, only even worse. He’ll need to have a good think before Carnoustie. It’s nine pars in a row for Ian Poulter now. He’s very unfortunate on 1, having gone for the pin and left himself a 15-footer for birdie, only for the resulting putt to somehow stay teetering on the edge of the cup. Still, pars are at a premium in a proper US Open such as this, and despite not really firing on all cylinders today, he’s still right in the mix. And it’s back-to-back birdies for Scott Piercy, at 4 and 5. He joins a suddenly burgeoning group in second place. But a bogey for Paul Casey on 1, the result of sending his tee shot into the rough, and flying his second over the back. He’s back to +2 again. -4: D Johnson (F) E: Piercy (14*), Rose (11*), Poulter (9*) +1: Fleetwood (F), Stenson (F), Hoffman (8) Rose knocks in his birdie putt on 2, and joins Poulter in second place. That’s two birdies in three holes, a fine response to a rather stodgy start to his round. Could he become only the third multiple US Open champion from Great Britain, and the first since Alex Smith of Carnoustie in 1910? The other is Willie Anderson, seeing you ask. More on that character here: The defending champion Brooks Koepka was flirting with the cut not so long ago. Birdies at 17, 18 and 1 have turned that situation round in an instant. He’s now +4, and the dream of becoming the first player to retain the title since Curtis Strange in 1989 is still alive! Ian Poulter sends his second at 18 pin high to 25 feet. The birdie effort dies off to the right. He’s been steady if not exactly spectacular this afternoon. He turns in 36, one over for his round and four shots off Dustin Johnson’s lead. Up on 2, Justin Rose whips a long iron into the centre of the 230-yard par-three. That’s such a sweet shot, and he’s left with an eight-foot birdie putt across the green. A fine chance to join Poulter in second place ... and he needs some company, because Charley Hoffman suffers a three-putt bogey on 7 to drop back to +1. A real nightmare for Hoffman, who missed one from 18 inches or so. These greens are making fools of a lot of pros this week. Paul Casey swishes a fine approach at 9 to eight feet, but lets the birdie putt slide by on the left. A bit tentative, and he looks the picture of irritation as he walks off the green. But he’s reached the turn in 33; he’s +1. Another birdie chance for Justin Rose, meanwhile, this time at 1, but it slips past on the right. He stays at +1 too. Rickie Fowler had dropped a shot at 6, but he’s picked it straight back up, putting from the fringe at 7. He’s +2. Behind him, Charley Hoffman wastes another chance to join Dustin Johnson under par, leaving a 15-footer a turn short at 6. Justin Rose finally gets a red number on the board today! He sends his second at 18 to 12 feet, then strokes in the birdie putt. That means he turns in a level-par 35, and he’s back to +1, looking a lot happier with life. Back on 17, Ian Poulter watches his 25-foot birdie putt turn left at the very last: he remains level. But more misery for Rory McIlroy, who will be going home tonight unless he finds something special in his bag of magic tricks. A poor tee shot at the par-three 7th leaves him with a 60-foot putt; he takes three to get down and he’s +12. The cut’s projected at +9; nothing this week suggests his game’s in a place where he can turn that round. Poulter wedges to 20 feet from 110 yards on the par-five 16th. But his putt is always sliding off to the right. Par. On the one other par five at Shinnecock, the 5th, Hoffman leaves an eagle putt from the front of the green well short. It costs him, as the 12-footer he leaves himself for birdie lips out. Both stay at level par. Dustin Johnson remains the only man under par at the moment. -4: D Johnson (F) E: Poulter (7*), Hoffman (5) +1: Fleetwood (F), Stenson (F), Casey (8), Howell (5) +2: Henley (F), Piercy (12*), Rose (8*), Fowler (5) +3: Beef (6*), Naegel (3), DeMorat (3*) The 2016 PGA champion Jimmy Walker follows up an eagle at 16 by nearly holing in one at the par-three 17th. A couple of inches to the right, and that was hopping into the hole. Instead he’ll be tidying up for a birdie that’ll take him to +5. His playing partner Justin Rose watches his birdie effort shave the hole from 15 feet; he stays at +2. Branden Grace sends a delightful tee shot to six feet at 7, but there’s a ludicrous swing on the short putt, and he can’t be too annoyed for missing out on birdie. He remains at +5. And poor Beef watches in horror as a fine birdie effort on 15 slips by: he’s carded six pars in a row today, and stays at +3 after a very creditable opening-day 73. Charley Hoffman sends his second at 4 to ten feet, and strokes in the birdie putt. He joins Ian Poulter in second place at level par for the tournament. Birdies for Jordan Spieth and Phil Mickelson at the par-five 5th; they bounce back to +8 as they look to salvage their weekend. Rory McIlroy can’t make one, though, and remains at +11. And a weak chip from the back of the par-five 16th costs Justin Rose a birdie; he stays at +2. Mickey DeMorat is another player making his US Open debut this week. He’s also making his professional debut, having qualified as an amateur but since changed his status. His first round was quite the event: a wonderful 72, which would have been even better had he not been penalised on 14 for playing the wrong ball. And he’s started out in similarly entertaining style today, with bogey at 10 followed by a birdie at 11. The 23-year-old is +2. Rickie Fowler’s solid start continues. A birdie putt from 20 feet drifts half a ball wide at 4; he remains at +2. Patrick Reed birdies 5, the Masters champ arresting a slide that saw him bogey 2 and 4. He’s +4. And birdie on the opening hole for Chris Naegel, the result of a glorious second which screeched to a halt three feet from the cup. Naegel made it through sectional qualifying; playing his first US Open at the age of 35, he appears to be grasping his chance. A 73 yesterday, and so he’s currently +2 in a tie for seventh place! Poulter is made of the strong stuff, though. And he guides in a left-to-right slider to scramble an excellent par. He stays put at even for the championship. Poulter drives into the first cut down the left of 14. He does pretty well to power his second shot to within a short chip of the green. He doesn’t give his wedge in enough welly, though, and is very fortunate that his ball doesn’t topple back off the putting surface. It stays put, but he’s got a 15-footer to save his par. Dustin could be five clear very shortly. Rickie Fowler would perhaps be the most popular winner this week, given how close he’s come in the majors so often without reward. Can he go one better than the Masters in April? He’s been quietly going about his business this week, with a very creditable 73 yesterday. And now he’s just rolled in a 25-foot birdie putt across 3 to move to +2. Meanwhile another major-championship bridesmaid, Paul Casey, makes it up to +1 after flipping one out of the bunker at 5 to a couple of feet, and tidying up for his birdie. A couple of players there deciding they’ve had enough with the leader board’s state of suspended animation. Could one of them mount a charge at Dustin? The defending champion Brooks Koepka needs to arrest his decline if he’s to stay here for the weekend. He shot 75 yesterday, and has opened up today with bogeys at 12 and 13. He’s +7, cushioned from the cut at the moment, but can’t afford too many more errors. The 2016 Masters champ Danny Willett is heading the wrong way too: bogeys at 10 and 12 have him slipping back to +7 as well. Justin Rose becomes the latest player to slide backwards. He plays all down the left side of 14, never in control. Rough, bunker, 15 feet past the hole. He fails to make the putt coming back, and slips to +2. The top of this leader board is thinning out dramatically. Never mind feet up and cigars, Dustin Johnson will have the brandy out at this rate. Tommy Fleetwood and Henrik Stgenson won’t be too disappointed, either, to be fair. -4: D Johnson (F) E: Poulter (4*) +1: Fleetwood (F), Stenson (F), Howell (2), Hoffman (2) Trouble for Spieth down 3. He drives wildly down the right and can only send his second into sand. His bash out topples off the false front of the green, and though he gets up and down, that’s his first bogey of the day. He’s +9 and can’t afford many more mistakes if he’s to avoid this cut. Mickelson bogeys as well, partly the fault of a dreadful drive, partly the fault of a pulled short putt. That’s a second bogey today and he slips to +9. McIlroy pars and remains at +11. As things stand, Rory’s away home for the weekend. Jordan and Lefty are holding on by their fingernails. Thanks to Tom ... and commiserations to Scott Piercy, whose US Open bid is falling apart here. That three putt on 16 was from four feet, a couple of awful yips that turned birdie into his third bogey of the day. Absolutely nobody is making a move right now, save Paul Casey who has just birdied 4 to move to +2. Dustin Johnson will have his feet up and a cigar on, watching this unfold. “Oh that is just so bad,” moans Poulter as he skews his second shot on 12 out to the right of the fairway but his position isn’t irretrievable. And his third shot is excellent, ensuring a morale-boosting par-save. Patrick Reed, the Masters champion, drops a shot on 2 to slip to four over. Rose, meanwhile, finds the green on the 13th with a fine uphill drive into the wind. Spieth, meanwhile, having looked in decent nick on the 1st, finds the bunker with his tee shot on 2 but recovers for a par, There’s also a par for his partner Mickelson but another bogey for Rory, who imperils his weekend prospects further by three-putting for bogie. Also three-putting from a good position is Piercy, who drops back another shot on the 15th and is now two over. And with that, I’ll hand you back to a nourished Scott. -4: D Johnson (F) E: Poulter (3*) +1: Fleetwood (F), Stenson (F), Rose (4*), Howell, Hoffman McIlroy is agonisingly short of opening with a birdie, his downhill putt just running out of gas at the lip of the cup. Mickelson also overhits his second shot of the day, and he’s down the bottom of the hill on the other side of the 1st green. He pushes his third shot up the hill and past the pin but he’s given himself work to do for par, which he can’t quite manage. So he’s +1 for the day and +8 for the tournament. Spieth pars the hole thanks to a fine long putt from off the green. Poulter’s birdie putt on 11 falls too short too. Poulter begins with a bogey. The all-English group of Hatton, Willett and Poulter start at the 10th. Hatton’s down the middle, Willett skews his tee shot slightly to the right off the fairway, but Poulter finds its left-hand edge, giving him decent sight of the pin. But his second is overhit, dobbing back down the hill after landing on the edge of the green. He at least finds the green from a tricky position with his third, but he’s given himself to much to do for a par, and drops a shot straight off. His playing partner Hatton does rather better, beginning with a birdie, but Willett drops a shot on 10 too. On the par-three 11th, Rose again chips well to the green from the tee but can’t drain his birdie putt and it’s another par. Rory McIlroy meanwhile has just begun his round at the 1st, giving himself a decent position in the middle of the fairway with his tee-shot. Alongside him, Spieth pulls his shot too far to the left and into the gallery, while Mickelson’s firm drive down the middle earns enthusiastic whoops from the crowd. -4: D Johnson (F) E: Poulter (1*) +1: Fleetwood (F), Stenson (F), Piercy (5*), Rose (2*), Howell, Hoffman An excellent iron shot from Rose finds the green but he can’t quite nail his birdie putt. A par keeps him at +1. Dustin meanwhile declares himself very pleased with his round. “It was cool and wet early on and the ball wasn’t really going anywhere,” he admits. “But I played a really solid round, I got in trouble in some spots, but my short game was good and got out of trouble when I could. I’ve felt focused these first two rounds and just need to keep it up for the next two days. I enjoy it [in these conditions], it keeps me focused, you’ve got to make good aggressive swings and really commit to your shots.” Evening/afternoon everyone. Tom here to guide you through Scott’s scran break. So Johnson has laid down a clear marker for Ian Poulter to aim at when he tees off in 10 minutes or so, in improving, slightly less windy conditions, though it’s by no means a picnic. A couple of shots back, Justin Rose has just teed off confidently down the middle from the 10th. Par for Henrik Stenson at the last. For the second day running, he’s rescued a poor round coming home. He signs for a level-par 70, and will go into Saturday at +1. And with that, I’m going to hand over to Tom Davies. See you again in a wee while. -4: D Johnson (F) -1: Poulter E: Piercy (3*) +1: Fleetwood (F), Stenson (F), Pavon (3*), Rose, Howell, Hoffman Thomas lags up and taps in for par. He’s signing for a street-fighting 70; he goes into the weekend at +4. Not ideal, but not out of it either. Dustin rolls his to a couple of feet, and he’ll be signing for a 67 that looks mighty pretty next to yesterday’s 69. He’s currently three ahead of last night’s co-leader Ian Poulter at -4. Finally it’s Tiger, who confidently drills a right-to-left slider in for back-to-back birdies. That’s a 72. He’s +10. It probably won’t be enough to survive the cut, with the conditions improving this afternoon, and Fleetwood having demonstrated that a low score is out there. But you never know. Tiger gives himself half a chance, finding the centre of the 9th green with his second. DJ and JT are both on in regulation as well; all three will have a look at birdie from 30 feet or so. Birdie for Tiger at 8. Too little, too late? He’s +11 now, and will almost certainly need a birdie up the last ... and even then, that might not be enough to survive the cut. He’s sent his tee shot at 9 straight down the middle. He’ll be dreaming of holing out from the fairway; he needs that miracle if he’s to fall inside the current projected cut, which sends everyone at +10 and above home. But nothing’s certain with the afternoon rounds still stretching out ahead of us. Henrik Stenson moves himself into serious contention with an eagle on the par-five 16th. Two big hits and a straight putt up the green from 12 feet. No biggie. He’s +1 all of a sudden, and for a second day in a row, has set about salvaging his round after a godawful start. Magnificent. That astonishing par save on 14 looks really important now. And how about this on 9? Tommy Fleetwood rattles in a 25-footer for a third birdie in five holes! He’s back in 32, and signs for a 66 that, on this toughest of courses, is nothing much short of sensational! He came close last year at Erin Hills; could the European number one go three places better this year? Meanwhile Scott Piercy bogeys his opening hole, the 10th, and suddenly the leader board has a fresh new look! -4: D Johnson (16*) -1: Poulter E: Piercy (1*) +1: Fleetwood (F), Stenson (16), Pavon (1*), Rose, Howell, Hoffman What a putt by Dustin Johnson! His tee shot at 7 had nearly toppled down the swale to the right of the green, but his ball held the putting surface. Just. He’s left with a 46-footer. He strokes it hole-ward. It’s pretty straight, with a very small right to left break. For a while it doesn’t look as though he’s given it enough juice. Then it looks good. Then it slows again. And it’s surely going to run out of steam before it drops. But the ball heaves, one last turn, and it’s in! What a crowd-pleasing tease that putt was! DJ smiles broadly, and no wonder! He’s three in the lead now. JT tidies up for his birdie, and rises to +4, but that seems almost immaterial after that astonishing rake! -4: D Johnson (16*) -1: Piercy, Poulter Thomas goes straight at the flag on 7. He manages to outdo Fleetwood by launching his 9-iron to six feet. That’s a wonderful shot. Up on 8, Fleetwood makes a fuss-free par. He’s one more par away from a superb 67. Cabrera Bello signs for a 71 that promised so much more: he’d been out in 32. But he’s nicely placed for the weekend at +4. The sun’s streaming across Shinnecock Hills now. On 6, Dustin raps a fairly straight uphill birdie putt 32 feet towards the hole. Only problem is, he was 32 feet and five inches away. So close to a three-shot lead. Par will suffice; compare and contrast to his playing partner Tiger, who drops yet another shot, the result of finding the long grass with his drive and being forced to take his medicine and chip out. The three-time champion is now +12 and won’t be making the weekend unless he does something highly interesting over the closing three holes. Par for Thomas, incidentally: he stays at +5. -3: D Johnson (15*) -1: Piercy, Poulter +1: Pavon, Rose, Howell, Hoffman +2: Henley (F), Fleetwood (16*), Steele, Rodgers, DeMorat Tommy Fleetwood isn’t making the same mistake twice. He arrows his tee shot at the supposedly impossible par-three 7th to ten feet, then curls in the birdie putt to move to +2. He’s right in this! You’ll not see anyone play the hole better this week. Meanwhile trouble for Henley down the 9th. He sends his drive into the semi-rough down the left, and can only advance his ball to within 90 yards of the green. He loops his third into the heart of the green, but nowhere near the flag. He can’t make the long saver, and that’s a closing-hole bogey. He signs for a disappointing 73, having gone out in 34 but come back in 39. Still, he’s the clubhouse leader for now at +2. Tommy Fleetwood caresses a lovely approach at 6 to 12 feet. But he doesn’t hit the birdie putt, the ball dying off to the left. He remains at +3. Dustin Johnson pars 5 to stay in pole position at -3. And scrub those worries about Henrik Stenson: from up the bank to the right of 14, he punches out to four feet, even getting a bit of backspin so his ball screeches to a halt near the flag. That is outrageous from where he was. He’ll surely save his par now. Russell Henley three-putts on the par-three 7th. Bogey, and then he lets a very makeable 14-footer slip past the hole for birdie on 8. He remains at +1. Jason Dufner misses a tiddler on 3 to drop to +5; his putting makes Rory McIlroy look like Bobby Locke. And so much for Henrik Stenson’s comeback: he’s sent his second shot at 14 up a fescue-smothered bank, the ball coming off the toe of his iron and flying almost straight right. A bogey will be a result from there. Birdie for Dustin on 4, the reward for sending his second shot to eight feet. He’s two clear of Piercy and Poulter again. Tommy Fleetwood grabs back the shot he dropped at 4 with a 15-foot birdie putt on 5: he’s +3. And is Henrik Stenson about to launch another comeback? He’s just curled in a 20-footer for birdie on 13, to get back to +3. -3: D Johnson (13*) -1: Piercy, Poulter Dufner continues to move backwards at speed. A bogey at 1, his third in a row, and the 2013 PGA champion is in danger of playing himself out of contention. The weather has been drizzly all morning, but is beginning to brighten up a little, if you ignore the wind and the small cloud above the Somnambulist’s head. JT does extremely well to lag up from 60 feet, but he’s still tapping in for bogey. Suddenly he’s back down at +5, seven off the lead. No-nonsense pars for DJ and Tiger. Alex Noren birdies 4 to move back to +3 but his playing partner Tommy Fleetwood bogeys the hole to slip to +4. Of all the morning starters, there are only five players under par for their rounds right now: DJ, Fleetwood, Tony Finau, Gary Woodland and Haotong Li. Only the first three are in any sort of contention (Finau is, like Fleetwood, +4). A basic error by Thomas down 3. Having sent his tee shot into the deep stuff to the right, he tries to snatch too many yards with his second, punching out with a 9-iron and ending up in the first cut on the other side. A wedge might have been smarter. As it is, he’s lost control coming in with his third, and he’s left with a 60-footer to save his par. Russell Henley arrests his slide with birdie at the par-five 5th. He’s back to level par for the tournament. -2: D Johnson (11*) -1: Piercy, Poulter E: Henley (14*) Thomas, Johnson and Woods all fail to reach the 232-yard par-three 2nd with their tee shots. Justin leaves himself an awkward stance by the side of a bunker to the left, Tiger is in sand on the right, and Dustin leaves himself short. Nothing comes easy round Shinnecock. And only Dustin, who missed in the right place, can make the up and down. Thomas slips to +4 while Tiger drops to +11. Elsewhere, Jason Dufner’s slide down the leader board continues apace: bogey at 18, and he completes the back nine in 38. He’s +3 for both round and tournament. So having just said Dustin Johnson doesn’t look like making any mistakes, he drops his first stroke of the day. Pulitzer, please! He dumps his second at 1 into the sand, and can’t get up and down. He moves back to -2. Thomas, who pars quietly, is only five off the lead now. Meanwhile Rafa Cabrera Bello’s fine round has fallen apart: he’s followed up that bogey at 2 with a double at 3, the result of finding a bunker off the tee and not getting out with any great style. He’s back to where he started the day, at +3. Does the Spaniard’s travails remind you of anyone? Sergio’s seven over for his round through 12 today, incidentally: he’s +12 and almost certainly going home soon. Tiger took triple bogey on the 1st hole yesterday, and he’s not enjoying it now either. From the centre of the fairway, he’s sent his approach well right, into extremely thick nonsense. He’s got to get over a bunker, and there’s not a lot of green to play with. And sure enough, from a dreadfully tangled lie, he sends his ball flying through the green and down the bank on the other side. It only just avoids the tall grass. He bumps it back up onto the dancefloor, but a good 15 feet past the hole. That’s a double-bogey six. This hole has cost him five strokes in two days. He’s +10. Weekend participation is beginning to look like a pipe dream: the cut is the top 60 plus ties, which right now stands at +7. A long time to go, though, and it’s likely to move out. So there are now only three players under par for the tournament. Only one of them is out on the course right now, and that’s the leader Dustin Johnson. The big man doesn’t look in the mood to make a mistake right now, but well, y’know. I don’t think anybody in golf will be counting chickens yet. Still, of the chasing group, only Rafa Cabrera Bello has made a determined move in the right direction this morning, and even he’s just taken one step backwards. Russell Henley has just posted that triple, while Jason Dufner’s gone and dropped another at 17 to slip to +2. Links expert Tommy Fleetwood is coming up on the rail, mind: a birdie at 2 brings him up to +3. There’s a first blemish on Rafa Cabrera Bello’s card: he drops a stroke at 2 to slip back to +1. And he’s joined on that mark by Russell Henley, who crashes out of the lead after a triple-bogey disaster on 3, the result of sending his drive into deep trouble down the left and failing to extricate himself from the fescue. -3: D Johnson (9*) -1: Piercy, Poulter +1: Henley (12*), Cabrera Bello (11*), Dufner (7*), Pavon, Rose, Howell, Hoffman Thomas wedges close to secure a fine par. He was in trouble after that drive, faced with a steep bunker face, and did well to get so close to the green with his second. He’s scrambled well this morning. He turns in 34; he’s +3. Tiger’s long bunker shot whistles a good 40 feet past the hole. He then leaves his long par putt six feet short; he makes it, avoiding the double, but he’s still dropping back to +8. DJ splashes out to five feet, and completes another fine up and down. He reaches the turn in 33. And he’s taking control of this US Open, because ... A huge break for Tiger on 18. His drive is heading off into the tall fescue on the right. But there’s a glaikit spotter standing in the semi-rough, staring into the distance the wrong way, and he’s clattered on the legs by the bounding ball. It stops dead in the shorter stuff. But Tiger doesn’t take advantage, sending his second into sand well short of the green. Thomas is just off the front in two, having found a deep bunker with his tee shot. And finally the leader DJ, from a perfect position in the centre of the fairway, flies a wedge straight over the green and into the sand at the back. That’s an appalling miss. All three of this group are in a spot of bother. Passing JT the other way: Henrik Stenson. I was wondering whether the 2016 Open champion might be a good shout for this tournament, on account of his leading the driving accuracy rankings. Yesterday’s 71 suggested maybe, maybe. But he’s not making much of a case for himself today: bogeys already at 2 and 6, and now another at 7. He slips to +4. Having said all that, he started abysmally yesterday, too, only to revive his bid during the later stages of his round. Sweden will have its fingers crossed. Dustin isn’t plugged. That’s a break. The rain, firming up the bunkers, will have helped. And from the soft, wet sand, he tosses his ball next to the flag, very nearly holing out for birdie. He’ll escape with par. Tiger takes two putts from the front of the green for his par. And Thomas tidies up for a brilliant birdie: he’s +3, and after hanging on in there during the early stages of this round, the recently deposed world number one is slowly moving into contention. He’s only six off DJ’s lead, in a tie for 14th. And he notoriously picks up momentum through tournaments. The field will be taking notice. “Go hard! Go hard!” Dustin’s tee shot at the par-three 17th is sent miles into the air ... and slam-dunks into the bunker guarding front left. He’s shortsided, and possibly plugged. Justin Thomas doesn’t let the disappointment of the previous hole get to him, though, sending his effort to five feet, one of the shots of the day. But DJ knocks in his birdie putt, and he’s once more the sole leader of this tournament. Tiger follows him in to rise to +7. Meanwhile Rafa Cabrera Bello retains his status as the hottest player out on the course right now, creaming an iron from 190 yards to five feet on 18. A third birdie of the day, and he reaches the turn in 32. -3: D Johnson (7*) -2: Henley (11*) -1: Piercy, Poulter E: Cabrera Bello (9*) Tiger and Dustin lay up at 16, then knock their third shots to six feet. Both will have great chance of birdie. but Thomas goes for it, creaming a fairway wood in the hope of reaching in two. His ball looks like heading into a bunker front left, but snags in thick fescue guarding it, instead. That’s an unlucky break, and he’s fuming, stomping around in the hot manner. But good pros know how to compartmentalise their rage, and he simmers down, slashing a wonderfully judged wedge through the thick rough and up onto the green. He’s left with an uphill ten footer for birdie ... and he underhits it by one joule of energy. So close to an amazing up and down. But the rain’s softened the green, and you need to give them just a little extra oomph. Thomas stays at +4. The rain continues to fall. It’s getting heavier. Most refreshing. Tiger Woods, Dustin Johnson and Justin Thomas have all crashed their drives down 16, but play’s slowed up here. A lot of waiting around. Elsewhere, Henrik Stenson has dropped another stroke, this time at 6: he’s +3. Brandt Snedeker bogeys 11 to slip to +3. And back-to-back bogeys for Byeong Hun An at 2 and 3 send him down to +3 as well. The players won’t mind this shower, though. Anything that makes the greens a little more responsive. They’re happily prancing around with their umbrellas up. Two putts for Dustin, his birdie effort shaving the right edge, and he remains in a share of the lead at -2. His co-leader, Russell Henley, has just completed the back nine in 34 strokes. Pars for Tiger and JT at 15 too. The long par-five coming up. A little bit of drizzle falling at Shinnecock Hills. A lovely Open Championship atmosphere. Just a month to go until Carnoustie, folks. Can you wait? Us neither. Anyway, this rain isn’t likely to hang around. On 15, DJ clips a wedge from 140 yards to 15 feet or so. He’ll have a good look at birdie from there. Meanwhile Rafa Cabrera Bello joins the group at +1 with his second birdie of the day, at 16. Nobody’s playing better today than the talented 34-year-old Spaniard whose record in the majors - one top-five finish at last years’s Open apart - is surprisingly average. “Dammit, Tiger! Fuck!” At which point Woods tries to bury the hosel of his wedge into the turf. Bam! Bat! He’s really not happy with that third shot, viewing families of America. Thing is, the ball bites pin high, 20 feet from the cup. High standards, this dude, but then he has won 14 majors. Two putts, and that’s a bogey, all the fault of the wild drive. Johnson and Thomas get up and down for their pars. Meanwhile Dufner continues to go the wrong way: another problem from over the back of the green, this time at 13, leading to back-to-back bogeys. Just a little bit of separation at the top of the leader board now. -2: Henley (8*), D Johnson (5*) -1: Piercy, Poulter +1: Dufner (4*), Pavon, Rose, Howell, Hoffman Trouble for everyone down the long par-four 14th. Tiger’s in the deep stuff down the right, and can only hack back out onto the fairway. Dustin’s in the first cut on the other side, and was expecting his ball to come out hot, but he didn’t get a flyer and his second stops well short of the green. Thomas was in the middle of the fairway, but dumped his approach into the bunker front right. He’s still in the best nick of the three, though. Jason Dufner drops back to level par for the championship. His tee shot at 12 found the rough to the right, his second flew through the green, and you know how that usually pans out on this course by now. Young Sam Burns has completed the back nine in 36 strokes, improving on his slow start with birdie at 17: he’s back to +2. And Tommy Fleetwood is in credit today: birdie at 10, bogey at 11, and another birdie at 13 sees him nudge up the leader board to +4. Brought up on the links of Royal Birkdale, you’d think this set-up would favour a player with the European number one’s experience; he’s nicely placed, six off the lead. Big Dustin is one cool customer. Having hit a terrible wedge in, leaving himself quite the poser, he clips a crisp wedge over the sand to three feet. That’s such a lovely shot in the circumstances. He simply refused to let the initial mistake fluster him. He salvages his par. Meanwhile a two-putt par for Tiger; that’s two putts shaved off yesterday’s total on this hole. And finally a brilliant birdie for Thomas, who didn’t play a particularly good bunker shot, but curled in a confident right-to-left breaker from ten feet. He moves back to +4. A big mistake by DJ, whose wedge into 13 only just reaches the green, and topples back off, rolling behind the bunker Thomas is in. That’s an awful miss, and the co-leader’s going to have some work getting up and down for his par. Tiger leaves himself a 15-foot uphill putt for birdie; that one wild drive aside, he’s looked very solid today. To be fair, he looked very solid yesterday, if you factor out three rushes of blood that led to two double bogeys and a triple. But that’s golf for you. Some downtime on the 13th tee as the players wait for the green to be cleared. It’s a short par four, and Justin Thomas is going for it. He sends his drive into the bunker guarding the front right of the green; that’s the place to miss. Tiger and Dustin decide to take irons instead. Beforehand, up on the dancefloor, Pat Perez stroked in a 30-footer for a birdie that takes him to +2. Tiger wedges delicately to a couple of feet. That’s a wonderful par save. Then Thomas bumps his third up to three feet; he’ll escape with a par after a wild tee shot, too. Finally Dustin, who has a fairly straight 30-foot birdie putt. He tugs it a bit, but it’s perfectly judged for speed, so that’s three pars out of three on 12 for this group. Tiger is +7, Thomas +5, Johnson -2. Dustin finds his third green in regulation out of three. The benefit of being on the fairway. By comparison, Thomas flies his second through the back, facing an up and down from thick greenside rough, while Tiger can only hack his way out of the thick fescue and into the first cut on the other side of the fairway. He’s still got 70 yards to the green. Birdie meanwhile for Jason Dufner at 10; he immediately joins Scott Piercy and Ian Poulter, both out later this afternoon, at -1. Oh Sergio. The 2017 Masters champion (it’s nice to type that) wasn’t in the worst position after his opening round of 75, but he’s playing himself out of contention this morning. A bogey at 11 followed a double at 12, his putter letting him down badly. He crashes to +8. Meanwhile a bogey for Henrik Stenson at 2, and the handily placed Swede slips to +2. All change at the top! Russell Henley can’t get up and down from the side of 14, and drops back to -2. Meanwhile joining him in the lead is Big Dustin, who clipped his tee shot at 11 to five feet and then knocked in the birdie putt. He looks calm and controlled this week, coming off the back of victory at last week’s St Jude Classic, a win that returned him to world number one. He’s the only man in his group to crash his drive down the middle of 12, as well: Thomas wangs his right, while Tiger is in fescue on the other side. -2: Henley (5*), D Johnson (2*) -1: Piercy, Poulter Oh Justin. Disoriented after playing 10 so badly, Thomas pulls his tee shot at the par-three 11th down the swale to the left of the green. Jordan Spieth took a couple of attempts to chip up the bank from there yesterday, so Thomas elects to play a Scottish-style bump along the ground. The ball still slips 20 feet past the hole ... but oh Justin! He rattles in the putt coming back, and that’s a sensational up and down from a very difficult position. He stays at +5. I have no idea why more players aren’t employing links tactics when they get in trouble round here, the old-school course being what it is, but players insist on getting the lob wedges out regardless, like it’s a regular week on Tour or something. Anyway, Thomas appears to have learned his lesson. That was brilliant course management. He was staring double bogey in the face there. A birdie earlier for Rafa Cabrera Bello, at 10; he moves to +2. An eventful start for Alex Noren, who doubled 10 but birdied the par-three 11th; he’s +3. Brian Gay made 73 yesterday, briefly sharing the lead, but bogeys at 10, 12 and 15 see the veteran journeyman drop to +6. The 21-year-old Sam Burns, a hot prospect from Louisiana, shot a fine 71 yesterday but he’s bogeyed 12 and 15 today; he’s +3. And the equally promising Xander Schauffele is heading the wrong way, too: he’s dropped shots at 2 and 3, and slips to +4. Thomas is made to pay for that mistake off the tee. His chip up from the back is the best part of 40 feet short, and his par putt isn’t all that either. He’s got a seven-footer for bogey. He does very well to roll it in, and limit the damage. He’s +5. Par for Dustin, who remains at -1. Tiger nearly misses his short birdie putt, the ball skirting all the way round the lip before dropping, but it’s in, and he’s +7. He looks happy and relaxed today; here’s to his being one of many to embark on a charge up the leader board. That’s a chance for the overnight co-leader Dustin Johnson to close the gap at the top. Because Russell Henley was out very early, and he’s gone off like a train, arrowing approaches to the pin and 10 and 12 to tear off on his own. Here’s how that’s changed the toppermost of the leader board. -3: Henley (4*) -1: D Johnson, Piercy, Poulter E: Dufner. Good morning, Southampton! Will today play even tougher than yesterday? With the wind switching around all day, it’s possible. Then again, the hole placements are a little bit more accessible. So it’s swings and roundabouts. Either way, accuracy from the tee is still essential ... as immediately proved by Justin Thomas. The reigning PGA champion let his opening tee shot, an iron from 10, drift off to the left. From the semi-rough, he’s taken a flyer straight through the green and down the back. That’ll be a test coming back up. By comparison, his playing partners Dustin Johnson and Tiger Woods found the fairway, and have set up birdie chances with their approaches. Tiger’s is particularly special, to three or four feet. Welcome to the second round of the 2018 US Open at Shinnecock Hills, where the world’s greatest players are being put through quite the test. The three-time champion Tiger Woods shot 78 yesterday, as did 2015 winner Jordan Spieth; the 2011 champ Rory McIlroy couldn’t break 80; the 2014 champ Martin Kaymer, who carded 65 on his opening round at Pinehurst, signed for an 83. But, y’know, winning a US Open shouldn’t be easy. And you shouldn’t necessarily be under par. Only four players posted a red number yesterday; the USGA will argue that this is exactly how it should be. That 7th hole still looks like a poser too far, mind. But hey ho.

Beyond whatever memorial local people choose, there should be something more. A year ago many said the Grenfell fire would change politics – and it did rouse the conscience of the nation with its imagery of grotesque inequality within one borough. Look how long it has taken to find housing for all its occupants, where Kensington’s extreme wealth drives astronomical prices: to keep people nearby, the council is buying 307 homes at an average £765,500 each. At the same time, the borough’s voting roll has fallen due to so many mothballed properties being left empty by zillionaire foreign investors. Of all the many meanings of Grenfell, the strong political message is the calamitous state of Britain’s housing. If Theresa May’s second and better attempt to articulate her own feelings has any substance, then fulfilling her promises on the housing crisis should be Grenfell’s real memorial. A housing green paper is due shortly: let it be dedicated to Grenfell victims, with a pledge to build a surge of new social housing dubbed the Grenfell project. The poignancy of attaching that name would make it harder to escape. In 1974, Grenfell was a new hope for the future, built on the bulldozed remains of acres of squalid north London terraces let by slum landlords: read Alan Johnson’s autobiography for the most graphic descriptions of living there in the 1950s. Those moving into new Grenfell homes called it luxury. In past times a less wealthy country built social housing – none more than Harold Macmillan, reaching a peak of 350,000 homes a year. May called house-building her “personal mission”, setting a target of 300,000 a year. That is remarkably ambitious when the Resolution Foundation finds that there have only been six years since the second world war when so many were built. And it was only ever achieved by massive government direct investment. There is no chance whatever that private developers, with dwindling “affordable” quotas, can begin to approach these numbers. The last time 250,000 were built in a year, 40% were council homes. In his recent review, Oliver Letwin, by nature an Ayn Rand small-stater, warns that private developers will never build the necessary volume, as that lowers prices, so they sit on their land banks. Twisting language was a George Osborne speciality – above all his “affordable” rents and prices, set at 80% of market rates, that were utterly unaffordable to most who could have bought or rented in the past. The madness of housing finance sees us spend £24bn a year on housing benefit that flows mainly to private landlords, instead of building more housing for genuinely social rents. Councils and housing associations borrowing to build get the money back from social rents within the timescale of a normal mortgage – so May must let them build as many as they can borrow for, on that rock-solid security. Only Treasury dogma stops them investing in the same way that any family does if they can raise the deposit. To do that, right-to-buy would have to stop: Osborne’s £100,000 discount designed to end council ownership by bribing tenants to buy destroys lenders’ security. Only 1,102 homes were built for social rent in the entire country last year. Dominic Raab is the seventh housing minister since 2010. It augers badly that he blames immigration for the housing shortage: he’s right that immigrants are responsible for a 20% rise in prices in the past 25 years, says the Resolution Foundation – but that’s a mighty small fraction of the 320% price rise in that time. Ambitious for the highest office, this populist rabble-rousing suggests housing will just be a brief stepping stone for him too. But let’s hope house-building really is May’s “personal mission”. The good news is that it has shot up to near the top of public concerns. The housing green paper will indicate where May and the Treasury really put it as a priority. But attaching the Grenfell name to whatever it promises would push it up the Treasury’s long list of urgent needs for public spending. A Grenfell promise would be a fitting bricks and mortar memorial to help the bereaved feel something good came out of such horror. • Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2018/jun/14/the-trouble-with-women-with-anne-robinson-review","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-14T21:02:09Z","webTitle":"The Trouble With Women With Anne Robinson review – borderline farcical","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/jun/14/the-trouble-with-women-with-anne-robinson-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2018/jun/14/the-trouble-with-women-with-anne-robinson-review","fields":{"headline":"The Trouble With Women With Anne Robinson review – borderline farcical","bodyText":"The problem with women, if not the world, is that we are not all Anne Robinson. This is the firm opinion of Legendary Fleet Street Journalist Anne Robinson (to give her her full title). We have not all grown up in a domestic matriarchy, inherited our mother’s business savvy and ambition and fought our way in the man’s world of newspaper production from the 60s onwards, demanding pay rises, netting promotions, becoming the first female assistant editor (of the Daily Mirror), ignoring obstacles and sloughing off sexual harassment on our way to journalistic glory and a successful presenting career. As a result, ran the working hypothesis of last night’s documentary The Trouble With Women, presented by Robinson, today’s generation is full of timid, fragile little things who blame men for their every problem and who start online campaigns against harassment instead of just jamming the perpetrators’ balls in the photocopier and going off for a pint with his mates. I paraphrase. But not by much. The hour was divided into five unedifying and uninstructive parts in which Robinson mostly went from wholly contemptuous of the issue under examination to slightly less contemptuous when offered a personal point of identification. In the first, Anne was Disappointed By Children and Their Parents, when she asked them to draw pictures of a surgeon, a firefighter and an engineer and they all drew men. She really thought she had, by being a Legendary Fleet Street Journalist for so long, taught them better than that. Then she was taken round a toy shop and shown how divided the marketing is for boys and girls. It makes her think of her grandson, who likes ballet, and now she understands it is wrong to market things differently for boys and girls. In the second, Anne is Disappointed by Feminists, because they got Formula One grid girls banned, which is no different from sexy dancing and why shouldn’t women make money from their looks, and, anyway, Robinson had a facelift 14 years ago for herself, no one else, and it was her money to spend, and feminism is the right of women to do, say and dress however they want – the end. And what’s all this nonsense about #MeToo? She talks to a group of millennials that includes a young family friend she evidently cares for and hears how she gets rubbed up against by men on the tube and was masturbated over at 14. Robinson seems genuinely shocked that, despite the fact that she was Legendary Assistant Fleet Street of the Daily Mirror 14 years ago, this kind of thing is still going on now. #MeToo is now OK, carry on. Part three: Anne is Amazed, Appalled Then Grudgingly Impressed by a Househusband and His Breadwinning Wife. But still, does he not worry that his testicles will fall off? No. Then his wife is very lucky to have him, but Robinson can’t really see this sort of thing taking off, because most women will always find it too hard not to be the one their crying child comes to first. Next! Part four: Anne Tackles Her Favourite Subject: Money. Women need to stop being lazy and earn more money and stop being cowards and ask for pay rises. Anne always did and it was easy – that’s how she became a Legendary Editor of the Daily Fleet Street – but now she despairs, because no one is. In the finale, she meets the only people to meet with her wholehearted approval, a group of care assistants in Glasgow who have successfully sued the council for paying them less than the rates paid for male-dominated municipal jobs such as bin collection and gravedigging. These are what she is looking for! Tough broads fighting The Man, like Anne Robinson sort of did to become Legendary Street Mirror Fleet Journalist Editor Woman. It was borderline farcical. There was no insight, no consideration of anything deeper than Anne’s ill-informed opinion, no attempt to challenge her assumptions (why do we consider a woman “lucky” to have a husband who shares childcare?), no attempt to situate individual experience within a systemic problem. No nothing, really, except the occasional tinkle of a single scale falling reluctantly from a contemptuous eye. Glasgow council has still not paid up, by the way. Presumably Legendary Journalist Anne Robinson will remain on the case until it does."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"science/2018/jun/14/spacewatch-japans-new-spy-cam-cuts-through-the-clouds","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-14T20:30:08Z","webTitle":"Spacewatch: Japan's new 'spy cam' cuts through the clouds","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/jun/14/spacewatch-japans-new-spy-cam-cuts-through-the-clouds","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2018/jun/14/spacewatch-japans-new-spy-cam-cuts-through-the-clouds","fields":{"headline":"Spacewatch: Japan's new 'spy cam' cuts through the clouds","bodyText":"This month Japan launched the 16th mission in its spy satellites programme, using the IGS Radar 6 spacecraft, part of the information gathering satellite scheme run by the country’s intelligence agency.

While the standoff between the chancellor and her interior minister, Horst Seehofer, continued on Thursday, the French president, Emmanuel Macron, and Italy’s new prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, said they would discuss “new initiatives” on immigration this week in Paris. A day after the Austrian chancellor, Sebastian Kurz, called on an “axis of the willing” to tackle the EU’s migration impasse, Pope Francis also weighed in to the debate, demanding more international cooperation on refugees and a “change of mindset” from politicians everywhere. Merkel and Seehofer spoke for two-and-a-half hours on Wednesday night without reaching agreement on the hardline interior minister’s demand that refugees who arrive at Germany’s borders should be turned back. The chancellor is said to have urged Seehofer to wait until a 28 June EU summit at which she would seek a Europe-wide agreement. But Seehofer reportedly told her the EU had failed to forge a common policy since the refugee crisis erupted in 2015 and it was hardly credible to think it would do so by the end of the month. A Bundestag session was interrupted for two hours on Thursday morning so Merkel’s Christian Democrats (CDU) and their Bavarian sister party the CSU, to which Seehofer belongs, could hold separate emergency meetings. Merkel, the EU’s longest-serving leader, on Wednesday called immigration “a litmus test for Europe” requiring “a truly unified approach”, but amid signs that support for her within the CDU is dwindling on the issue, it has also become a flashpoint for mounting tensions within her own conservative bloc. Italy and France, meanwhile, sought to patch up a worsening diplomatic row over the same question, triggered by Macron’s description of a decision by the Italian interior minister, Matteo Salvini, to deny a migrant rescue ship access to Italy’s ports as “an act of cynicism and irresponsibility”. Rome summoned France’s ambassador on Wednesday and Salvini, leader of the far-right League party, demanded an apology, but the Elysée palace said on Thursday the French president had “not made any comment intended to offend Italy or the Italian people” and that Paris sought “constructive dialogue”. The row centred on the Aquarius, now on its way to Valencia in Spain with 629 migrants rescued off the coast of Libya last week. The ship, operated by the charity SOS Méditerranée, was turned away by both Italy and Malta. Salvini insisted on Thursday that ships “belonging to foreign organisations and flying foreign flags will not be allowed to dictate Italy’s immigration policy”. More than 1.8 million migrants have arrived in Europe since 2014 and Italy is currently sheltering 170,000 asylum seekers and an estimated 500,000 unregistered migrants. More than 1 million migrants arrived in Germany in the summer of 2015 after Merkel opened the country’s borders. The June summit in Brussels is due to discuss proposals to change the bloc’s asylum laws, which currently require refugees to apply for asylum in the first EU country they enter, generally Italy or Greece. But the bloc is bitterly divided over how to share the burden between southern “frontline” states, northern “destination” countries, and hardline central and east European governments like Hungary and Poland which want nothing to do with any compulsory quota system. In an interview with the Guardian, Spain’s foreign minister, Josep Borrell, a former president of the European parliament, said Europe had to find agreement over the way to take in asylum seekers. “The approach of people asking for asylum in the first country they reach is now manifestly an obsolete rule that doesn’t work.” Borell warned that because people often do not want to stay in the country they first arrive in, “unless we can find a solution to these problems, Europe’s Schengen system that will collapse”. Speaking at a migration conference at the Vatican, Pope Francis urged countries to work together and “move from considering others as threats to our comfort to valuing them as persons ... who can contribute greatly to the enrichment of our society”. Fallout from the immigration argument could prove most dramatic in Germany, where Seehofer’s CSU faces a state election in October in which it is desperate to stave off the challenge of the anti-immigrant Alternative für Deutschland (AfD). Party leaders believe the CSU needs to be firm on the emotive immigration issue, opening a potentially damaging rift with Merkel’s CDU and provoking the worst crisis of the veteran chancellor’s fourth-term coalition, which took more than six months to build after inconclusive elections last year. The interior minister’s main demand is that asylum seekers be turned back at the German border if they entered the EU in another country, or have already applied for asylum in Germany and had their applications turned down. Merkel has said it would be illegal for Germany to take such a unilateral step, which would damage attempts to shape a comprehensive EU policy, but reportedly offered a compromise, proposing bilateral agreements with Italy and Greece. Merkel and Seehofer have been increasingly at loggerheads over the refugee issue. Political observers say Merkel may rue the day she gave the nod to Seehofer’s appointment as interior minister. Seehofer’s decision to back out of attending an integration summit in Berlin on Wednesday only increased the tension. He went instead to meet Kurz, after which the two announced a three-way “axis of the willing” between Austria, Germany and Italy to fight illegal immigration. The move was seen as a deliberate shunning of Merkel and an outright rejection of her ideas on migration policy. According to polls, 65% of Germans reject Merkel’s stance on migration and would like to see tighter controls at Germany’s borders."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jun/15/facebook-dangers-habitual-sharing","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-15T07:00:09Z","webTitle":"No, Facebook, I won’t be back.

It has been two months since I last checked my feed, during which time Facebook has sent me notifications I didn’t sign up for, informing me every time someone posts, and invited me to attend locally organised focus groups. Ignoring these overtures has given me at least as much pleasure as checking the site ever did. Of course, I am anthropomorphising a machine; no one is in charge of all this. But the small satisfaction of imagining the behemoth scratching its head and wondering how anyone can resist the invitation to get sucked back in is immense. As is this: the sense of new acres of mind opening up. I wish I could say I was spending the time saved reading self-improving books, but I’m mainly reinvesting it in television. Still, when I turn around to look at what, if anything, I miss about Facebook, all I find is relief and genuine shock at how I came to spend so much time looking at the holiday photos of people I haven’t seen for 25 years. At the same time, this feels deeper than a mere question of time management. It feels like the restoration of a natural order, in which memory, rather than being kept artificially alive, is allowed to fade, putting people in one’s past firmly back where they belong, to be picked up occasionally and dusted off for nostalgia and then returned once again to the shelf. It also, surely, frees up space to move on. Since the term “mental load” has entered the mainstream, it has become apparent just how much time and energy many of us spend thinking about what in isolation seem to be small, insignificant details – mostly to do with chores and schedules – but that increasingly I think should be used to cover the sheer amount of junk that social media puts into our brains. When I think, now, about how much of my mental hard drive was taken up at any given time by what I’d just read on Facebook, it was clearly a madness. The site was almost always the last thing I looked at before leaving the house, so that by default, if I wasn’t sitting and scrolling, I was thinking about what I’d just seen while sitting and scrolling, while in a bleary fugue state. And while I don’t expect to have great thoughts on the way to the supermarket, it would be nice to feel that my mind is at least vaguely free-range. As it was, I only now realise two months out, it was rigged by habitual use almost always to float back to the feed. Last weekend I went to the wedding of one of my oldest friends and saw a lot of people I hadn’t seen for a while. It was a very happy experience and, although this sounds trite, it was noticeable how going somewhere and seeing people was an antidote to the grey brain-state of life on social media, and that by not sharing it was somehow made the more precious. • Emma Brockes is a Guardian columnist based in New York"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jun/14/albert-einstein-genius-physics-racist-scientist","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-14T14:39:02Z","webTitle":"Einstein was a genius of physics.

But he wasn’t a saint","bodyText":"Was Albert Einstein racist? In pondering the disobliging remarks he made about Chinese and Japanese people in the private diaries he kept about his travels to east Asia in 1922-3, just published by Princeton University Press, it’s not a particularly helpful question. On the one hand, there’s the view that even this famously humane and broadminded scientist was inevitably a man of his time. Accordingly, we can’t expect him, despite his visceral dislike of nazism, to rise above a prevailing culture in which the open expression of prejudice was routine. We might look on it now with dismay, but to label it racism is to indulge a presentism that achieves nothing except making us feel superior. Besides, says the editor of the diaries, Ze’ev Rosenkranz, here we’re seeing the physicist and inventor of the theories of relativity “off guard”, writing things never meant for publication. On the other hand, it’s rightly said that not everyone in Einstein’s time would have called the Chinese people “filthy and obtuse” or voiced fears that they would “supplant all other races”. Not everyone in the 1920s still adhered to the crude, pseudo-Darwinian ranking of races that led Einstein to suspect the Japanese might be “naturally” intellectually inferior. Since both of these points of view are true, they don’t help us much to deal with this tarnish on Einstein’s humanitarian image. Perhaps it is better to ask where that image comes from. We should first recognize that Einstein barely saw China at all: he only stopped briefly in Shanghai and Hong Kong. And his diaries are a mixture of appreciation – “One has to love and admire this country”, he said of Japan – along with bewilderment and stock stereotypes. It’s the familiar response of a European alienated by cultural, linguistic and emotional difference. That he buys into the common belief of his times in a “national character” is neither surprising nor especially deplorable – but from there it’s only a small step to accepting a hierarchy of races. Einstein clearly did so, though Rosenkranz doubts it amounted to anything like a full-blown and coherent racist ideology. All the same, such views seem rightly repugnant by today’s standards, and it’s a shame that Einstein – a progressive, tolerant internationalist – wasn’t able to transcend them. But it’s curious that this should bother us so much. It’s not as if Einstein was previously deemed a paragon. It’s no secret that his treatment of his first wife, Mileva Marić, bordered on the monstrous after their love soured (although I don’t mean, as some have argued, that he stole her ideas). The list of conditions Einstein drew up in 1914 if they were to continue to live together is comically appalling: she was in effect to be his maid and housekeeper but “neither to expect intimacy from me nor to reproach me in any way” and to “desist immediately from addressing me if I request it”. There’s no reason to read this as an expression of generalised misogyny, but neither can we pretend it doesn’t reflect very badly on Einstein’s respect for women. There are striking parallels with the only two other 20th-century physicists to have acquired a cultural cachet comparable to Einstein’s: Richard Feynman and Stephen Hawking. All three are seen as distinctive, characterful and preternaturally smart men with an endearing playfulness and a readiness to not take themselves too seriously. Yet Feynman’s reputation has undergone some recent reappraisal on the centenary of his birth with a belated recognition of the shockingly demeaning things he says about women in his autobiography, Surely You’re Joking, Mr Feynman! Some have unconvincingly tried to brush these off as the product of their times, but it seems more likely they’re a product of the macho persona Feynman liked to cultivate. Hawking, meanwhile, might just about get away with being labelled “unreconstructed”, to a degree that even his peers had largely abandoned, when he said that women “are a complete mystery”, and in his relish at hanging out at the late Peter Stringfellow’s “gentlemen’s club”. But such examples do little to help physics’ rather dismal gender imbalance. Jenny Rohn has suggested that if we’re disappointed to find such behaviour in scientists, it reflects an unrealistic expectation that they will be as pristine as their theories. She is right – but I think there’s more at play here. For a profession that alleges so strenuously that it’s the ideas, not the people, that count, science is oddly determined to create heroes (and the occasional heroine) and celebrate them in the names of institutes and awards. This practice forces science into a constant, awkward dance with its past as times and mores change. Even the apparently uncontroversial 1936 physics Nobel laureate Peter Debye was at the centre of a row a decade ago when he was accused of having colluded with the Nazis during his prewar career in Germany, and even of being antisemitic. Those accusations were extreme and unfair, but it is precisely because the issues are so grey in Debye’s case that the practice of naming the likes of the Debye Institute in Utrecht seems an unwise hostage to fortune. Even when great scientists are acknowledged to have gone too far, they’re typically indulged, called “colourful” and “outspoken” or remade in the rather romantic image of the flawed genius, and excused by their eminence. When James Watson’s speaking engagement at the Science Museum in London was cancelled in 2007 after he made racist remarks, Richard Dawkins protested at “the hounding, by what can only be described as an illiberal and intolerant ‘thought police’, of one of the most distinguished scientists of our time”. There’s a reluctance to accept that great ideas can come from horrible people – like the rabidly Nazi-supporting and Nobel-winning physicists Philipp Lenard and Johannes Stark. When they both launched virulently antisemitic attacks on Einstein and his “Jewish physics” in the 1920s, he weathered it with great fortitude, patience and even humour. But that doesn’t make him a saint. • Philip Ball is a science writer"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"books/2018/jun/27/top-10-books-about-unrequited-love-kirsty-gunn","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-27T09:53:51Z","webTitle":"From Dante to I Love Dick: top 10 books about unrequited love","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jun/27/top-10-books-about-unrequited-love-kirsty-gunn","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/jun/27/top-10-books-about-unrequited-love-kirsty-gunn","fields":{"headline":"From Dante to I Love Dick: top 10 books about unrequited love","bodyText":"In Katherine Mansfield’s exquisite long short story At the Bay, Beryl, a middle-aged woman still fantasising about the young girl she once was and the lovers she could have captured then, stands in a darkened room half-imagining someone is out there in the dark, desiring her. So much of fiction is about desire, a yearning of some kind or another … the love of reading itself a sort of intense affair. These thoughts and more were whirling around in my mind when I wrote my own novel about unrequited love, Caroline’s Bikini, the story of middle-aged Evan’s great love for his landlady, the desirable but always just out of reach Caroline Beresford. My book is a comedy: Evan and his friends make me smile. And the way Emily, a lowly part-time copywriter and only-once-published short-story author, has written Evan’s story makes me smile, too – her endless diversions and asides, her writing’s dependent clauses straining for inclusion within the main structure of her narrative. But these amusements are underpinned by some serious thinking about love stories and the meaning of fiction in our lives, with the following titles topping my list of inspirational work on that subject. 1. The Canzoniere by Petrarch For a start, I had Petrarch in mind, and his great love for the 14-year-old Laura, who the poet glimpsed coming out of church in 1327 and spent the rest of his life thinking about in the sequence of poems he wrote for her. He never knew Laura, or even spoke to her, but the sonnets in The Canzoniere chart his feelings of love as a life’s work that is as large and passionate as any other love story. 2. The Divine Comedy by Dante Dante follows hard on his heels, of course, and was writing before him – his Divine Comedy a kind of early novel, as I think of it, in three parts, that was inspired by a similar kind of experience. Dante never knew his Beatrice either, yet the idea of her propelled his great work about visiting Hell and Purgatory and Heaven, to be met there by her: another fantasy made true in words. 3. The Arcadia by Sir Philip Sidney Medieval and early Renaissance literature is full of similar knights who woo their ladies with little or no expectation of love being returned. Of all the stories from this era, the one that stands out for me is Sidney’s Arcadia, with its excruciatingly detailed story of four star-crossed lovers who half-manage an idyllic version of their passions, but succumb anyhow to the world’s craziness and disorder. 4. Middlemarch by George Eliot Whirring away like the great engines of intelligence and imagination that they are, are the novels riven through with love that is never quite fulfilled because of the way life and chance get in the way. First, Eliot’s great novel, with the wonderfully wilful and misguided Dorothea and the man who she is barely aware loves her, the ever hopeful but ultimately disappointing Will Ladislaw, who flits away at her back trying to woo while she chooses another suitor before him. 5. War and Peace by Leo Tolstoy Another book I go back to, rereading and finding yearning represented there by such quiet force and sense of elegy that sometimes I can hardly bear it. War and Peace is, alongside its many other stories, about the love of Natasha for her Prince Andrei. The way this is drawn out, rendering a love that seems to wear itself out with time and circumstance, is one of the finest pieces of writing about loss that I can think of. So subtle, like life, that we barely notice the size of its devastation until it has passed us by. 6. To the Lighthouse by Virginia Woolf Woolf does a clever, clever thing with the same theme here, in the section titled Time Passes. In her story, about a family and its extended circle that seems to radiate from the charismatic centre of Mrs Ramsay, Woolf sets down what she called a “corridor”: that strange, leaf-swept, desolate and empty stretch set down in the middle of the book where Mrs Ramsay is not, because she has died. Unrequited is the very tone, the sound, of this novel. 7. The Member of the Wedding by Carson McCullers Frankie Addams is, at 12 years old, a member of “no thing”. Her pangs of grief and jealousy and bitterness and anger are all contained in the feeling of unrequited love she has for the wedding of her brother to his bride. The whole novel is a veering, crazy passionate thing of words, a study of adolescence that is also a construct of clanging sentences and non sequiturs that all add up to an understanding of the deepest order. There is nothing this writer doesn’t know about the fierce, vibrant energies of yearning. 8. Kin by Eudora Welty Welty’s perfect short story draws the lines of unrequited love in similarly abstract and concrete ways. Here, we’re brought close in to the intimacies of family life without ever quite being fully included. There’s a corridor in this story too – a place like Woolf’s, called a “breezeway” – and it’s a metaphor for the same kind of absent centre to a story. Unrequited love speaks to places, too, as much as to people and their relationships with each other. 9. I Love Dick by Chris Kraus Much more recently, the thrillingly wicked and feted – many years after its original publication – this book employs its author’s clear and professed biography as part of its narrative trick to have the reader be let in and also kept out of various secrets. Kraus cuts out a freshly exposed version of unrequited love that can’t ever capture as much as it reaches for. 10. Reality and Dreams by Muriel Spark “Words are ideas,” said Spark, who I would end with here. All of Spark’s novels are unrequited in that their strange sentences carry no expectation that they will be gathered up into a neat ending. But this one might describe her project best: a tale of love and loss that is composed of nothing but ideas for stories and films that seem to disappear off the page as we read. Spark’s end is not an end at all but suggestion that the true love story is yet to come – a mystery that we spend our time on earth yearning towards.

Anwar Choudhury, a trailblazing diplomat, was only appointed in March to govern the islands, which is among a number of Britain’s overseas territories at loggerheads with Westminster over new tax transparency legislation. He is the Cayman Islands’ first Muslim governor. The Foreign Office (FCO) said it was inappropriate to discuss the reasons for Choudhury’s temporary withdrawal, or the nature of the complaints made against him. His deputy has been placed in temporary charge. The Cayman Islands’ elected premier, Alden McLaughlin, said he was unable to say what complaints had been made, but that Choudhury’s suspension was “unforeseen and unfortunate”. McLaughlin is currently in London for a meeting chaired by the overseas territories minister, Lord Ahmad, at which the constitutional relationship between the territories and the UK was certain to be discussed. Born in East Pakistan (now Bangladesh), Choudhury was recruited from the private sector, to become the first Bangladeshi-born British high commissioner to Bangladesh in 2004. He served for four years, returning to the FCO in 2008 as a senior policy director. While serving in Bangladesh he was wounded in the leg in a terrorist attack. Three men were hanged in 2017 for their part in masterminding the grenade attack. Choudhury had made a splash in his first three months as the Cayman Islands’ governor with high profile interviews promising to burn the unnecessary bureaucracy that he said gripped the civil service. The opposition leader Ezzard Miller said it was unfortunate that no reason was being provided for Choudhury’s withdrawal. Resistance to Westminster’s decision to impose public registers of beneficial share ownership has gripped most of the overseas territories since a backbench Tory rebellion forced the plan onto reluctant ministers on 1 May. The territories fear that if they are forced to open share registers to public scrutiny, valuable investments will flee to more secretive jurisdictions elsewhere. Currently, registers of share ownership are only open to law enforcement agencies. The territories have until the end of 2020 to introduce the public registers. The Cayman Islands’ elected politicians claim the UK is overreaching in imposing such an intrusive law though a procedure known as an Order in Council. As the voice of the UK on the islands, the governor is in the delicate position of having to conciliate between the sovereign Westminster government and elected Cayman ministers. In interviews, Choudhury had stressed the need for the islands to produce a public register that the elected politicians had designed, while pointing out the UK legislation provided some flexibility."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2018/jun/24/gang-gang-dance-kazuashita-review","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-24T07:59:20Z","webTitle":"Gang Gang Dance: Kazuashita review – a return to an altered cultural landscape","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/jun/24/gang-gang-dance-kazuashita-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/jun/24/gang-gang-dance-kazuashita-review","fields":{"headline":"Gang Gang Dance: Kazuashita review – a return to an altered cultural landscape","bodyText":"The 00s gave rise to a plethora of spiral-eyed US groove bands. Headiest of all were Gang Gang Dance, a New York outfit whose commitment to aural psychedelics and world music-inclined raves remained anchored to meaty beats. Missing for seven years, three original members have returned to an altered cultural landscape. You can hear the adjustment: a herd of wild buffalo arriving at the Standing Rock oil pipeline protest in 2016 provides the sample at the end of J-Tree, a lovely reintroduction to the beauty Gang Gang Dance can conjure. Interestingly, Kazuashita, which roughly translates as “future peace” as well as being the name of the baby of one of their friends, doesn’t actually pack as much of a percussive punch as the band’s previous album, Eye Contact (2011), whose MindKilla track took GGD into properly scary territory. Splendid as it is to have vocalist Lizzi Bougatsos back, and Brian Degraw and Josh Diamond crafting weird Turkish-influenced R&amp;B on songs such as Young Boy (Marika in Amerika), it is hard not to hear Bougatsos refracted through the lens of Grimes, an artist who radically expanded on GGD’s commercial potential.

Anchored by a brilliant Toni Collette, it is highly accomplished in terms of artistry and performances but, most importantly, it’s scary as hell. A Ciambra (15) (Jonas Carpignano, 2017, Ita/Bra/Ger/Fra/Swe/US) 118 mins We are embedded with the Romani community of southern Italy for this almost documentary-like drama. It’s a modern landscape of poverty, criminality, tight-knit community and children smoking fags, through which we follow resourceful 14-year-old Pio (Pio Amato), who must step up when his male elders are all jailed. The Happy Prince (15) (Rupert Everett, 2018, Ger/Bel/UK/Ita) 105 mins This is no vanity project. Everett uglifies himself considerably to portray Oscar Wilde in his final years: exiled in Europe and broken by the ravages of prison, public vilification, heartbreak and ill health, casting back to the glory days. Despite his inexperience as a director, Everett as a performer has never been better. Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom (12A) (JA Bayona, 2018, US/Spa) 128 mins It is not exactly a giant leap for dinosaur-kind, but this latest instalment brings the requisite megafauna spectacle with visual panache, as well as putting some eco-themed meat on the prehistoric bones. It also brings the Jurassic livestock closer to home, making for a second half that could almost be a haunted-house movie. Dino-lovers Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard come to the rescue. McQueen (15) (Ian Bonhôte, Peter Ettedgui, 2018, UK) 111 mins One of the few designers whose work resonates beyond fashion, Alexander McQueen would make for a fascinating subject purely on the strength of his era-defining works. His personal story is similarly unique: from East End roots to Paris haute couture to his tragic death in 2010, with a host of colourful personalities along the way. This intimate film stitches things together with skill and intelligence.

Megastar-in-the-making Camila Cabello brings the pop, Van Morrison the chance for a nice sit down and Jessie J a unique blend of music and comedy. Seaclose Park, Newport, Thursday 21 to 24 June Krrum Leeds-based producer, songwriter and full-time beard manicurist Alex Carrie makes slightly sinister dance music that absorbs the harder edges of electronica and pairs them with an unshakeable pop sensibility. These shows are perfectly timed as he has just released his debut album, Honeymoon. Hoxton Square Bar &amp; Kitchen, N1, Wednesday 20; Brudenell Social Club, Leeds, Friday 22 June Monsta X Despite being slightly in the shade of fellow South Korean seven-piece BTS, who recently scored a US No 1 album, Monsta X aren’t trailing behind when it comes to expertly drilled choreography, throwback boyband melodies and OTT videos (see recent single Jealousy). This one-off London show – made possible by the tenacity of their British fans, or “Monbebes” – is in support of their recent EP, The Connect: Dejavu. Eventim Apollo, W6, Sunday 17 June Anna Calvi Five years after her last album, Twickenham’s own Mercury prize-nominated Anna Calvi will return in late August with Hunter, her self-described “queer and feminist record”, featuring production from Nick Launay (Yeah Yeah Yeahs, Nick Cave) alongside banging and crashing of various instruments from members of Portishead and the Bad Seeds. Expect raw emotions and some light moshing. Heaven, WC2, Tuesday 19 June MC Jubilee Composer-improviser Basel Rajoub, a saxophonist who hauntingly fuses the instrument’s western scales with Arabic music’s microtonalities, brings a world-jazz flavour to Jubilee, a multicultural epic featuring dozens of artists from Malian ngoni player Bassekou Kouyaté to Chinese lute virtuoso Wu Man and the US’s prolific Kronos Quartet. Royal Albert Hall, SW7, Wednesday 20 June JF Three of the best ... classical concerts Oliver Knussen Oliver Knussen’s connections with the Aldeburgh festival run deep. This year, he conducts two concerts, first taking charge of the BBC Symphony Orchestra in Feldman, Copland and the premiere of Philip Cashian’s Piano Concerto (Sat). He will also curate a typical Knussen programme with the Aldeburgh Festival Ensemble (Mon), which includes more Feldman, Nicolaou and two Harrison Birtwistle premieres: a song cycle, Three Songs from The Holy Forest, and Keyboard Engine, commissioned for Pierre-Laurent Aimard and Tamara Stefanovich. Snape Maltings Concert Hall, Saturday 16; Britten Studio, Saxmundham, Monday 18 June Scordatura Ensemble The Amsterdam-based Scordatura Ensemble perform the wonderfully original microtonal music of American experimentalist Harry Partch, using many of the instruments the composer himself designed. They make a rare British appearance with a programme including perhaps his best-known work, Cloud Chamber Music. It forms part of Rose Petal Jam, Scordatura’s year-long exploration of Partch’s early works, including commissions of pieces inspired by his legacy. Cafe Oto, E8, Monday 18 June Cave Three years ago, English National Opera gave the premiere of composer Tansy Davies and librettist Nick Drake’s 9/11 opera, Between Worlds. Their follow-up is a music-theatre piece in collaboration with London Sinfonietta and the Royal Opera House. Cave is a two-hander set in a dystopian future of rising sea levels, in which a grieving man tries to make contact with his lost daughter. Tenor Mark Padmore and contralto Elaine Mitchener are the protagonists.

She crafted herself as a work of art, then painted the wonder she became.

Victoria &amp; Albert Museum, SW7, Saturday 17 June to 4 November Christo and Jeanne-Claude Christo’s giant floating sculpture on the Serpentine lake is guaranteed to be the star art of the summer. It is the latest chapter in one of the most spectacular careers in contemporary art. A simultaneous survey at the Serpentine Gallery shows how Christo and his late collaborator and wife Jeanne-Claude enlarged the idea of art. Serpentine Gallery, W2, Tuesday 19 June to 9 September Patrick Heron Abstract art is not quite the British thing. Compared with such American artists as Mark Rothko and Jackson Pollock or continental Europeans like Mondrian and Malevich, there is a reluctance or inability by homegrown painters to dive into pure poems of colour. Heron had no such inhibitions. His bright and seductive paintings lack the wildness of Pollock or profundity of Rothko but have a gentle decorative beauty. Tate St Ives, to 30 September Astérix in Britain The plucky Gaul who gets his strength from magic potion and repeatedly beats up whole armies of Romans may seem the quintessence of French nationalism, but he has always found a ready audience in Britain. This exhibition charts the translations of Astérix’s adventures and how funny names in French had to be reinvented in English. It also celebrates René Goscinny, the Jewish co-creator of these great historical comics. Jewish Museum, NW1, to 30 September Raqib Shaw The sensual gossamer vision of this pleasurable painter feasts on art history. Shaw is truly erudite in his exploration of great paintings from the past. Lucas Cranach, Jan Gossaert and Victorian fairy painter Joseph Noel Paton all provide inspiration here. Yet Shaw mixes this European heritage with Asian perspectives in glistening, bizarrely mystical celebrations of colour. Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art, Edinburgh, to 28 October JJ Five of the best ... theatre shows Killer Joe A Stetsoned Orlando Bloom is the titular detective with a murderous sideline in Tracy Letts’s gothic, sometimes violent and laconic tale of dishonour among so-called trailer trash, first seen at the Bush Theatre in 1995 and made into a film in 2011. Bloom’s watchable performance has a hint of Clint, and there’s a new use for a KFC drumstick. Trafalgar Studios, SW1, to 18 August Happy Days Maxine Peake clearly loves to immerse herself in a role and here she is, for a time, literally up to her neck in it, as Winnie in Samuel Beckett’s iconic 1961 piece. Sarah Frankcom has updated Beckett’s existential near-monologue with a revolving mound of earth, webcams and strewn plastic rubbish suggesting ecological concerns. Royal Exchange Theatre, Manchester, to 23 June The Jungle First-time playwrights Joe Murphy and Joe Robertson set up the Good Chance theatre company in the refugee camp at Calais. This work, first seen at the Young Vic, is an account of the camp from 2015 until it was bulldozed a year later, and many of the torrid individual tales found within. An inspiring story of human resilience and resourcefulness, it also finds the French and UK governments wanting, Theresa May in particular. Playhouse Theatre, WC2, Saturday 16 June to 3 November The Rink John Kander and Fred Ebb are best known for writing Chicago and Cabaret. This later show may lack those mega-hits’ razzmatazz but the cast deliver in spades. It’s a smaller, more personal, story of an estranged mother and daughter, as the latter returns home to stop their roller venue being demolished. Caroline O’Connor as the tough but tender matriarch Anna is especially strong. It’s the last week: get your skates on. Southwark Playhouse, SE1, to 23 June Leave Taking When the Bush programmed Winsome Pinnock’s pioneering 1988 play about a Jamaican family in London, it couldn’t have known that the Windrush scandal would blow up. Now shocking in its topical nature, it follows the daily struggles of different generations to survive and feel at home. One character remarks of paying £50 to secure his UK citizenship “till them change them mind again”. You couldn’t make it up.

Barbican Centre: The Curve, EC2, to Sunday 17 June Semperoper Ballett The Dresden-based company makes a rare appearance in the UK with this all-Forsythe triple bill.

No explanation or description needed; just the thing itself delivered – alongside its consequences, both uplifting and dire. Years before Alan Bennett’s rule-breaking, boy-fumbling, inspiring schoolmaster Hector in The History Boys, Muriel Spark created a bewitching and lethal teacher in her 1961 novel The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie. Its heroine soared on stage with Vanessa Redgrave – and on the screen with Maggie Smith. Showing the harm of charm. Now Lia Williams makes the part her own. Anyone in doubt that she is one of the strongest and most supple of actors need only glance at her range – from her impeccable Wallis Simpson in The Crown to her magnificent Clytemnestra. Now she shimmeringly incarnates this ambiguous creature: a mixture of the alluring and the ridiculous, a woman who makes her chosen girls long to get out of their gymslips and nibble biscotti while reverencing Giotto. A teacher who lifts her pupils’ expectations – and traps them in her own dreams. A fan of Mussolini. Williams has an extra electric purr to her voice, a shimmy in her movement: it is as if underneath her marvellous red dress (hip-hugging, with three buttons aslant on the shoulder) she is stepping out of a silk slip. She ends, shrunken, on a note of terrible plaintiveness. David Harrower’s version retains Spark’s diamond-edged dialogue but recasts the narrative so that it is seen retrospectively, through the eyes of Sandy, who as a girl was famous for staring. Having been a writer, Sandy is now about to become a nun: the power of institutional life is evoked in the meshing of school and convent, with acute, suggestive Sylvestra Le Touzel as both mother superior and a headmistress who has sympathetic glimmers beneath her starch. Harrower’s version and Polly Findlay’s production hover above judgment and go deep into sadness. Sandy is the person who betrays her mentor, in what might be thought a good cause. She is beautifully given gleam and avidity by Rona Morison. Angus Wright lopes dolefully as the spurned lover; Edward MacLiam entices crossly as the art teacher; Nicola Coughlan is memorably grief-stricken as the bullied playmate. We should see them all shortly in the West End. It is the plaiting together of the beguiling and the terrifying that makes Jean Brodie so fascinating. No one ever asks whether King Lear was simply a villain or a victim; yet it is a question continually posed by many of the most powerful dramas with women at their centre. Is it possible really to believe in Miss Julie, the play about a rich young woman who seduces a servant and ends up, we are to suppose inevitably, killing herself? Strindberg claimed he had given plenty of reasons for her behaviour: after all, her mother committed suicide – and she was probably having her period. But then Strindberg, hugely gifted and ghastly, thought women were a “stunted form of human being”. Convincing productions of this frequently staged play have shifted the action from 19th-century Sweden. Patrick Marber took it to the eve of the 1945 election, in a Britain electric with dissolving class divisions. Yael Farber’s sweltering version set it in post-apartheid South Africa. Polly Stenham, a specialist observer of damaged rich youth, transplants the play to a pill-popping, coke-snorting, booze-glugging 21st-century London, with a glazed gaggle of partygoers who at one point crouch across the stage like animals. Tom Scutt’s design is an unforgiving concrete box – exposing but insufficiently claustrophobic. This Julie (no “Miss”) is not propelled by outside pressures: she has her own destructive rocket fuel. In Carrie Cracknell’s production Thalissa Teixeira often frames the action as the servant’s fiancee, the only guileless character. Teixeira has an exceptional ability to transmit radiance – but has not enough else to do. As Jean, Eric Kofi Abrefa errs on the stolid side of sinister, more awkward than dangerous. Nevertheless, as a brave and peculiar character study, this is extraordinary. Both witty and vicious. Vanessa Kirby’s Julie is panic and scorn. There is some continuity with her curling-lipped, self-protective Princess Margaret in The Crown and her dramatic disintegration in Robert Icke’s production of Uncle Vanya. Yet here she is from the start without restraint. A bare-footed maenad, graceful in toe and tongue: “gagging on my silver spoon”. She is Strindberg’s misogyny internalised. A hieroglyph of self-disgust. If you are squeamish, keep your eye off the blender. Sophie Treadwell’s Machinal poses the bad versus battered question in acute form. Her 1928 play has as its heroine a near-automaton, a woman drained of will who is propelled from one snare to another: a typing pool, marriage to a man whose touch makes her flinch, an unwanted child. It is a story that contains murder and ends in execution. Natalie Abrahami’s production is elliptical and ferocious, jumping from one scene to the next, each episode like a bite out of an imaginary male face. Miriam Buether’s design traps the characters in screens that snap together from top to bottom; Ben and Max Ringham’s soundscape makes the rattle of typewriters sound like an approaching army. Emily Berrington is persuasively wan-faced and drained as the nameless young women, though the jumbled period setting – which moves from the 20s through to the 21st century – dilutes plausibility.

It is the latest retailer to shut stores amid difficult conditions on the high street and a long-term shift to online shopping. A spokesman for N Brown said the tough retail climate accelerated the decision, but added the move was part of the firm’s strategy to become a purely online retailer. The shops, which are dotted around the UK, from London to Belfast and Glasgow, contributed £15m, or 2% sales, last year and made a loss of £3m. About 240 people working in the shops are at risk of redundancy, along with 15 head office staff in Manchester and 35 working at the Duke Mill warehouse in Shaw. The news came as N Brown posted 0.4% growth in revenues for the 13 weeks to 2 June. Angela Spindler, the chief executive, said: “This was a challenging period for fashion retail. In line with our online strategy, and given continued weak high street footfall, we have today commenced a consultation process with colleagues over the future of our small-store estate. This action has not been taken lightly.” Michelle Byrne, area organiser of the shop workers’ union Usdaw, said the move was a “real shock for staff”. She said the union would “interrogate the business case for the proposed store closures” during the consultation. “Our priority is to save jobs,” she said. N Brown expects the consultation to end by October and said if all 20 stores were closed, there would be a one-off cost of £18m to £22m covering redundancy payments and other costs. Targeting younger shoppers, Jacamo for men and Simply Be for women are among N Brown’s main brands. JD Williams, its biggest brand, caters for over-45s. Sofie Willmott, a senior retail analyst at GobalData, said: “JD Williams is well placed to benefit from clothing spend shifting online as mid-market retailers such as Marks &amp; Spencer and Debenhams close stores and consumers look to digital channels for choice and convenience.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/jun/15/matteo-salvini-from-far-right-fringe-player-to-strongman-leader","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-15T11:15:11Z","webTitle":"Matteo Salvini: from far-right fringe player to strongman leader","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/15/matteo-salvini-from-far-right-fringe-player-to-strongman-leader","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/15/matteo-salvini-from-far-right-fringe-player-to-strongman-leader","fields":{"headline":"Matteo Salvini: from far-right fringe player to strongman leader","bodyText":"Matteo Salvini is unofficially assuming the role of prime minister of Italy after a week in which a standoff over stranded migrants and a row with France has bolstered the interior minister’s profile and created the appearance he is setting the country’s agenda. The transformation of Salvini from far-right fringe candidate to popular strongman leader could have vast implications for the future of Italy, its role in Europe and the fragile alliance that now governs the country. His popularity has increased by about 10 percentage points since the 4 March election, which resulted in a hung parliament with his party, the League, placed second in terms of seats. But its current 27% approval rating puts Salvini on equal footing with Luigi Di Maio, the 31-year-old leader of the anti-establishment Five Star Movement, the largest party, who serves as a minister of labour and industry in the coalition government. It has also won him admiration from the biggest cheerleader in support of far-right populist movements in Europe. “He stepped up and took some pretty dramatic action. I don’t think it could have turned out better for him,” said Steve Bannon, the former adviser to US president Donald Trump who has spent time in Italy and been a vociferous supporter of the far-right surge. Analysts say Salvini’s rise reflects the fact that he is a skilled politician and is competing for attention against Giuseppe Conte, the law professor who was plucked out of obscurity and named prime minister after Salvini and Di Maio agreed neither of them would assume the role, but who is seen as weak. Salvini, a former talk radio host, has made a career out of demonising migrants. He made good on his campaign promise to crack down on irregular migration this week when, in his first major decision as interior minister, he blocked an NGO ship, the Aquarius, with more than 600 migrants on board from docking in Sicily. While the decision created a humanitarian crisis – Spain ultimately agreed to accept the migrants in Valencia – Salvini celebrated it as a big victory. When Italy’s refusal to accept the migrants elicited a sharp rebuke from Emmanuel Macron, the French president, it was seen among Italians as a deeply hypocritical response, given France’s reluctance to accept migrants and refugees. “There is a void in Palazzo Chigi [the prime minister’s residence] so of course this means that other figures will become more visible,” said Giovanni Orsina, a political historian. “Salvini knows how it works. He has got personality, a political education, and a very clear ideology.” Stopping the Aquarius migrant vessel, Orsina said, had cost Salvini nothing, and the fight with Macron, even for those Italians who do not support the League, has garnered him even more support given the Italian view that the rest of the EU, and especially France, have left the country to deal with the migrant crisis on its own. “Many Italians will say they are not with Salvini but that against the French they are with him, because they will say that what Macron said is false, hypocritical, unbearable,” Orsina said. It was also possible that Salvini – like Matteo Renzi before him – could ride a wave of popularity that collapses, much like the former centre-left prime minister did, he said. Bannon, speaking to the Guardian, said he believed that Salvini had done a “great job” by taking on the issue of migration in the first weeks of the new government. “Particularly since it is the summer and the crisis is only going to continue. And he showed the complete hypocrisy of Macron, and I think it is important for the people of Italy to see that he is willing to stand up,” Bannon said. “It is a central part of why Macron is going to crash and burn, he’s all big talk.” For migrants who were rescued by the Aquarius, the decision led to even more hardship. The boat is not expected to arrive in Valencia until Saturday or Sunday, and there are multiple accounts that those onboard, who include children, are suffering intense seasickness. Their journey to Spain has also been interrupted by poor weather, and legal experts have accused Italy of breaking international humanitarian rules. Flavio Di Giacomo, the spokesman for the UN migration agency, the IOM, said it was not the first time that a boat had been blocked from entering Italy. “What has changed is that this time the public opinion is backing this kind of action, which in part is because the anti-NGO narrative has won in the public opinion,” said Di Giacomo. Salvini, and other Italian politicians, have argued that NGOs who rescue migrants represent a “pull factor”, encouraging African economic migrants to make the journey across the Mediterranean. But many migration experts have argued that poor conditions are forcing migrants to flee, and that the NGOs are saving lives. Within a government that has a share of eclectic personalities, including an undersecretary who believes the moon landing was a hoax, Salvini has stood out in part by setting the agenda in a way that focuses on issues he has control over. “He is making migration the most important issue of the country, and then it follows that the minister who handles migration is the most important leader,” said Sergio Fabbrini at Luiss University. “The Five Star Movement is without an agenda, without a strategy.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/live/2018/jun/16/england-v-australia-second-odi-cricket-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-16T18:56:00Z","webTitle":"England beat Australia by 38 runs in second ODI – live!","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2018/jun/16/england-v-australia-second-odi-cricket-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/live/2018/jun/16/england-v-australia-second-odi-cricket-live","fields":{"headline":"England beat Australia by 38 runs in second ODI – live!","bodyText":"Vic Marks’s report from Cardiff: The right result. Plunkett deservedly finished with 4/53 and Rashid 3/70. Expensive, but the wickets he took were vital. As were the couple from Moeen early to put Australia into such a difficult position at 164-5 in the 31st over. Shaun Marsh never gave it up though, and when he found a suitable partner in Ashton Agar, they got the visitors back in the game with a brilliant 94-run stand. The opener’s 131 from 116 balls was elegant, controlled and brutal depending on what the circumstances required, the younger man (46) showing once again that he has a massive future at international level. Who says 50-over cricket is no good? Not me. That was a great game. Keep an eye on the website for Vic Marks’ match report. We’ll be back with OBOs from both this series and the England/South Africa/New Zealand T20 tri-series during the week. Thanks for your company. Bye for now from Cardiff! Jhye Richardson is the last man to fall, holing out to long-on to give Plunkett his fourth. Kane Richardson (0*) the not out man. 47th over: Australia 304-9 (J Richardson2, K Richardson 0) Target 343 39 off 18, if you were wondering. That should be it. Tye, who can give it a wallop, did find the backward square boundary when Wood miscalculated his run on the rope. But he couldn’t get it over the boundary at long-off with his next swing, picking out Billings who doesn’t drop catches. That’s Rashid’s 100th ODI wicket and his third of the evening. 46th over: Australia 295-8 (Tye 2, J Richardson 1) Target 343 “What a knock,” says Phil Tufnell of Marsh on TMS. Too right. He has really put himself into the World Cup frame for next year, for mine. Five runs and the two wickets from the superb Plunkett over. So, Australia need 48 from four. The end of a tremendous innings, bowled by a delivery where the big quick rolled his fingers down the seam and hit leg stump. Marsh was trying to heave it over midwicket but full credit to the bowler. In the space of a few balls, Plunkett has locked this up for the hosts. Paine holes out! Nothing special about that slower ball from Plunkett, sitting up for Paine, but didn’t make the contact he needed to clear the rope. He was dropped the delivery before by Moeen when miscusing a lofted drive but it has only cost them two runs in the wash. Unless Marsh does something astonishing from here... you know what I’m going to say. 45th over: Australia 290-6 (Marsh 131, Paine 13) Target 343 Real gut-running from these two, unable to find the boundary off Rashid, who holds his nerve, but still taking nine from a series of whips and drives and dabs. That’s experience. They are still in this. 44th over: Australia 281-6 (Marsh 128, Paine 7) Target 343 Wide from Wood to begin helps. Both Marsh then Paine are trying to hit the cover off it, the latter the first to found the boundary with a bold hook shot that splits the gap in the deep. BOOOOM! Shaun Marsh goes inside out over cover for SIX! That’s a mighty shot, down on one knee as he made contact. FORGET WHAT I SAID FIVE MINUTES AGO, this is game on again! 16 from it, leaving 62 from 36 balls. If Marsh is there at the end, Australia should win. Wowsers. 43rd over: Australia 265-6 (Marsh 119, Paine 2) Target 343 It is Paine who joins Marsh, cutting to cover for one to get off the mark. Runs of the smaller variety from each of the four remaining deliveries in the Rashid set but only six from it in total, alongside the wicket. That should be the over that finishes Australia. Should. Agar played beautifully but Rashid has done him with a lovely wrong’un, tempting him out of his ground and beating the edge. That really turned; Buttler did the rest. They put on 96. Will Paine bat next after the knock he copped earlier? 42nd over: Australia 259-5 (Marsh 115, Agar 46) Target 343 BOSH! Shaun Marsh hits a BIG SIX off Wood over midwicket to start the new over. Real stand and deliver stuff. What a partnership this has been, now worth 87 in 65 balls. The quick fights back well but can’t close off the over, spraying a legside wide. Will Marsh take advantage of the extra delivery? He won’t, misjudging a slower ball that hits him in the stomach. They take a leg bye. Oh, ignore me: there’s one more ball to come and Agar bashes it through the gap at cover for four! Big over, 14 off it to leave 84 from 48. Gosh! 41st over: Australia 245-5 (Marsh 108, Agar 41) Target 343 I still get the feeling all England need is one wicket to close this off as a serious contest, the visitors requiring nearly 11 an over. Rashid is back, who has bowled just the four overs. He’s right on the money, preventing either player freeing the arms and find the rope. That is until the final ball of the over, Plunkett allowing Agar’s cut to go through his legs! So, it should have been five from the over instead it is nine. Hmmm. 98 from 54 the new equation. 40th over: Australia 236-5 (Marsh 107, Agar 35) Target 343 Important over from Plunkett here, who has been very good today. Plenty going on, Agar pulling four to fine leg but only after swinging and missing twice. A wide in there as well. A blockhole delivery to finish, meaning just six came from it. Advantage England. Ten to go. 39th over: Australia 230-5 (Marsh 104, Agar 31) Target 343 Joe Root? for the 39th? Sure, why not. It has not worked though, Agar hitting back to back boundaries to finish the over and keep Australia very much alive! They went through cover then smaaaashed past midwicket. Two runs came from the first four deliveries, to be fair, but they picked up the two fours they need per over, or thereabouts. 11 off it. 38th over: Australia 219-5 (Marsh 102, Agar 23) Target 343 Marsh to 97... Shaun Marsh to 100! Consecutive boundaries off Plunkett to start his new over. The stroke to 100 is a wooooonderful clip. It took 95 balls to raise his ton, striking 10 fours and a six. For a man who has routinely found himself out of the Australian white-ball teams, he’s making a bit of a statement here. Nice applause from the Glamorgan crowd - he does play for them after all. Ten from the over all told, so he’s on the rate required as well. 37th over: Australia 209-5 (Marsh 93, Agar 22) Target 343 Carbon copy of the over before, in that there was a boundary early in the over - Marsh clipping Moeen beautifully - but only three other singles. They need to break it open asap. Moeen finishes with 10-0-47-2 with Short and Maxwell’s wickets. Having a good series. 36th over: Australia 202-5 (Marsh 88, Agar 20) Target 343 Shot! Willey gives Agar just enough room to play a fabulous cut to the boundary. He’s a lovely player to watch. Only three other singles to go with it though, so the over ends up hindering the overall task. Australia’s 200 did come up in the over, though. So there’s that. “Am I alone in experiencing the slightly queasy sensation of having over indulged in the multiple sporting events today?” asks Brian Withington. “Have even switched off US Open App until later this evening to reduce sensory overload. Please can you guide us through a calming denouement in Cardiff without any of the usual indigestible morsels?” Well, I don’t think I’m spoiling the surprise by saying that I’ve filed a piece on watching the Socceroos from the press box earlier today (sort of), so I might not be the best person to wean you off. Bonkers morning, wasn’t it? I didn’t watch a minute of (my) footy, Hawthorn smashing last year’s grand finalists, Adelaide, by ten goals at the ‘G. 35th over: Australia 195-5 (Marsh 87, Agar 14) Target 343 Moeen lofted over extra cover for four by Agar. Nice swing of the willow. Couple of singles and a few dots. Required rate about to click over to 10RPO. Who takes ownership over turning up the volume? Maybe Marsh? He looks spent between the wickets but still striking well. “Good evening Adam, from sunny Piedmont,” emails Finbar Anslow. “As a Somerset fan I’m getting a little worried here, Mr Paine and co couldn’t call up Matt Renshaw could they?” In short: they probably should, but they won’t. Rest easy. 34th over: Australia 189-5 (Marsh 86, Agar 9) Target 343 Willey gets another go but doesn’t concern either of the left-handers. Agar is cutting then pushing; Marsh glancing to fine leg for a few then driving straight. There’s a legside wide in there too. Ooh, nearly a run out to finish. Agar called Marsh through running to the danger end, he would have been out had Roy hit. Nine from it as they have a drink. 154 needed from 16, so that’s a required rate of 9.62 to the finish line. Yeah, wouldn’t have thought so. 33rd over: Australia 180-5 (Marsh 82, Agar 5) Target 343 Five singles from the Moeen over, most of which went down the ground. Should help Agar get his eye in. “If they are thinking about next year already and the World Cup,” says Adam Gilchrist on TMS, “then I really think they need to get Alex Carey into this team.” Very interesting. 32nd over: Australia 175-5 (Marsh 80, Agar 2) Target 343 Bouncer from Wood to Agar, lucky not to be given as a wide. More short stuff at Agar, who is only able to turn the strike over from the final ball of the over with a push to cover. Gee, watching that back, he would have been run out had the throw been on target from Bairstow at the end Marsh was running to. 31st over: Australia 174-5 (Marsh 80, Agar 1) Target 343 Shot! Marsh drives wonderfully off the back foot through cover, hit too well for the sweeper. He get another boundary to finish the Moeen over, albeit off an edge though slip but there isn’t a fielder there at this stage of the innings. On reflection, more a deflection than an edge. Deserves a ton. I’m now going to change Marsh’s score to what it says on the board at the ground. Fantastic bowling from Moeen Ali, enticing Maxwell to clear mid-off. Instead, he hacks it to long-on where Willey takes a straightforward chance. They shut him down perfectly at the moment he looked like really unleashing. Moeen, the main bowler in that plan, has conceded just 19 runs in 6.1 overs without going for a boundary. Well earned 30th over: Australia 164-4 (Marsh 73, Maxwell 31) Target 343 Wood to Maxwell. Michael Vaughan reckons that he might the long-handle now but he can’t early on, denied by a slower one. Next chance he gets, the right-hander can’t beat mid-on with a nicely struck drive. He misses a clip as well, the second time he’s raced through for a leg bye in the over. Credit to the England quick for his variety here. Last ball, short to Marsh who pulls hard but only as far as Root as midwicket. Good contest, this. One that the hosts have pushed ahead in again over the last four overs. Just three leg byes, so a maiden, technically. We can debate whether it should be. 29th over: Australia 161-4 (Marsh 73, Maxwell 31) Target 343 Marsh is beaten by Moeen and Buttler takes the bails, the appeal just enthusiastic enough to send it upstairs. But his foot is down, no worries there. Beats him later in the over when trying to sweep as well. Just the Maxwell single to begin, nothing further. 28th over: Australia 160-4 (Marsh 73, Maxwell 30) Target 343 Right, so Buttler keeps swinging the changes, Mark Wood back for a second stint. Once again, the pair are happy enough to accumulate in singles, five of them. The 50 partnership is up, stitching that together in 43 balls. There’s an inconsistency between various scorecards on what Marsh is on at the moment but I’ll stick with what I have for now. 27th over: Australia 155-4 (Marsh 71, Maxwell 27) Target 343 That worked well. Moeen brought back and went for just four singles, breaking up the pattern of boundaries for his captain. 26th over: Australia 151-4 (Marsh 68, Maxwell 26) Target 343 Right, firstly, apologies for having Maxwell listed as Finch in the brackets until the last over; my bad. Fixed now. Secondly, another good over, the fourth in a row where a boundary was struck. It’s through the cordon, so less convincing than the previous Maxwell fours so far, but it is a calculated risk with nobody back there. 26 from 21 he is as the Mexican Wave begins around Sophia Gardens. 25th over: Australia 144-4 (Marsh 66, Maxwell 21) Target 343 Heeeeere comes the Big Show. But not as you might imagine with me calling him that. He gets all of the 12 runs made in the over, making 31 in the last three. The right-hander bookends the set with boundaries, smashing Rashid through midwicket with authority and using his feet to drive through cover through the air. Lovely timing. Between times, a couple of hard-run twos. He’s into the 20s. I reckon, touch wood, he’s on. 24th over: Australia 132-4 (Marsh 66, Maxwell 9) Target 343 Another big over in the context of a chase that is yet to get rocking and rolling, nine from it with a couple of boundaries. Maxwell nailed a pull shot from a short Plunkett delivery that didn’t get up - a bit of Ricky Ponting to that one. Marsh finishes with a slap past point into the gap, keeping that required rate at eight an over. Nothing overly daunting about that for Maxwell, that’s for sure. If Marsh can just keep going, well, who knows. 23rd over: Australia 123-4 (Marsh 62, Maxwell 4) Target 343 Australia’s best over so far, taking ten off it. Marsh drove Rashid lavishly through cover to begin then punched three more to the same part of the field. Singles exchanged through the rest of the set. 22nd over: Australia 113-4 (Marsh 53, Maxwell 3) Target 343 Swing and a miss! Maxwell picks the one that really bounces off a length and he’s beaten. Plunkett is right on the mark to the Victorian until the final delivery, which he’s able to clip behind square for a couple. 21st over: Australia 111-4 (Marsh 53, Maxwell 1) Target 343 It wasn’t really much of a sweep on reflection, just trying to turn it around the corner. Maxwell is the new man, who has a ball to see off and he does with a single down the ground. Before Finch fell, Marsh brought up his 50 with a wallop over midwicket. Aaron Finch was shuffled down to number five in order to play against the spinners but it has backfired! The Victorian got down low to sweep the legspinner but he misses the ball. No review required there. Out for a duck! Australia in strife. 20th over: Australia 103-3 (Marsh 46, Finch 0) Target 343 Welcome to The Real Quiz. Aaron Finch averaged 92 against England earlier this year, albeit as an opener. He’s the one Australian (well, other than Maxwell) who can legitimately chase down a score like this. First ball, he gets the board ticked over by four via the leg byes. Poor ball first up to the Aussie vice-captain. Much better at the end, beating him with a beauty! They need exactly eight an over to win from here. Chops on! Straight into his middle stump. The end of an unconvincing stay for the big right-hander. Buttler, the stand-in skipper, rewarded for swinging the changes. 19th over: Australia 99-2 (Marsh 46, Stoinis 9) Target 343 Right, so it is Rashid for the first time today. Wrong’un to begin, Marsh getting it down the ground, then Stoinis miscues through the air over cover for a couple. Good early questions. Later, he brings Marsh forward with another wrong’un then a leg break. Seven from the over but not a lot wrong with it. 18th over: Australia 92-2 (Marsh 43, Stoinis 6) Target 343 That was Shaun Marsh’s first six in ODIs in 625 balls (Sep 2013 his most recent) says Andy Zaltzman. He keeps the strike with a single down the ground. “Off the top of the collective OBO head (OBOnce), can anyone think of a better ODI bowler with a worse average than Moeen? (Currently 64 wickets at 47.45),” asks Tom Bowtell. “I guess with scoring rates rocketing, 47.45 is the new 33.17.” 17.4 overs: Australia 91-2 (Marsh 42, Stoinis 6) Target 343 Marsh is an experienced player and would know that it isn’t sustainable to let the game drift away from Joe Root’s bowling. He steps down and slaps the part-timer over long-on for a big six. Not quite as big as the time Chris Cairns lobbed one into the river here against Australia in the 1999 World Cup. They are going to change the ball though, so it is a premature drinks break with two balls to come in the over. 17th over: Australia 84-2 (Marsh 36, Stoinis 5) Target 343 Moeen landing right where he needs to keep Stoinis quiet early on, the right-hander happy to eventually push one to long-on, Marsh picks out the same fielder to long-off after using his feet. As Tuffers notes on the radio, the plan here will be to push through as many quick and frugal overs as they can from the offies before unleashing the wristspin of Adil Rashid. Leg slip comes in for the last couple of balls, Big Marcus deciding to play along the carpet to deep backward square. Only three from it. 16th over: Australia 81-2 (Marsh 35, Stoinis 3) Target 343 Right, here comes the rebuild. Nothing urgent about the singles taken around the sweepers here. Only three of them though, Marsh drawn forward in defence from the last couple. The last of those, TMS tell me, was a little leg-cutter from Root. 15th over: Australia 78-2 (Marsh 34, Stoinis 1) Target 343 One ball for Stonis to see from Moeen, over the wicket it comes and the huge right-hander plays a lap well enough to squeeze a single to get off the mark. The end of the successful over. Earlier in it, Jonny Bairstow left the field, limping around the rope after making a diving stop at long-on. We’ll keep an eye on that one. Round the wicket from Moeen, Short edges a sharp chance to Root at first slip from the crease. His debut hand is over with spin doing the trick. “They have put a real squeeze on them,” Jimmy Anderson says on radio of the tweakers. Sure have. The hosts on top. 14th over: Australia 74-1 (Short 21, Marsh 31) Target 343 Joey Root, have a trundle. Just as he did at The Oval, the Test captain is on to try and bleed a couple of quick overs out of the Australian innings. He’s done in perfectly, racing through giving up just three. Ten singles from three overs of England spin so far, Andy Zaltzman says on TMS. 13th over: Australia 71-1 (Short 20, Marsh 29) Target 343 Moeen wins an error from Marsh, another nearly/kinda drop at midwicket? Tom Curran is on from Willey and it is had to tell if it carried. Either way, the West Australian survives. Four singles to the sweepers picked up along the way. Short looking more comfortable now as well. 12th over: Australia 67-1 (Short 18, Marsh 27) Target 343 Big shout from Plunkett for leg before, Marsh the man on strike. It is turned down and after Wood’s early referral there is no option to take a second look. Was probably pitching outside leg in any case. Yet more runs through midwicket, a pair of twos from Marsh, keeps the board ticking. He was lucky the first of those wasn’t four, stopped only by a Wood dive on the rope. 11th over: Australia 63-1 (Short 18, Marsh 23) Target 343 Moeen is on one over after we expected, bouncing away from us at the broadcast end. Misfield at extra cover first ball, Roy not picking up cleanly at extra cover, so Marsh walks one. They take two other singles, both to the sweeper on the off-side. Nice and watchful. They will know it is vital that they aren’t opened up by spin again as they were midweek at The Oval. 10th over: Australia 60-1 (Short 17, Marsh 21) Target 343 Liam Plunkett on for the final over of the power play and he immediately feeds Short on the pads, who glances a four to fine leg. He repeats the dose two balls later! They don’t want Short to free his hands, Jimmy Anderson says on TMS, but they are giving up far too many away on the pads. It continues: Short again gets a run past square leg for one and Marsh three to backward square leg to finish the power play. 12 taken from the very poor over. 9th over: Australia 48-1 (Short 8, Marsh 18) Target 343 Short starts the new over with another single off the hip. I don’t believe he has scored a run anywhere but that corner of the ground so far in this innings. Willey has fed them there, to be fair. Some strike rotation in the second half of the over, runs behind both square leg and point. Short does score in the ‘V’ for the first time to finish, via a pushed single to extra cover. 8th over: Australia 43-1 (Short 6, Marsh 15) Target 343 Naked cyclists! Now I have your attention! Yep, a crew of nude people on bikes just rolled behind the scoreboard. It is a better over from Wood on the whole until he drops short to Marsh to finish, who has more than enough time to rock back and pull his second four of the day. 7th over: Australia 38-1 (Short 6, Marsh 11) Target 343 That is a nearly another chance at midwicket. Marsh’s clip didn’t quite make it to Bairstow. He’s far more convincing through the posh side cutting the next Willey delivery to the point rope. A couple more singles off the legs; too many of those so far. Marsh keeps the strike with a push to mid-off. 6th over: Australia 31-1 (Short 5, Marsh 5) Target 343 Marsh grabs one fine and Short a couple down in that direction to finish. Between times, Wood has the junior of the two men defending. It won’t be long until he tries to pop someone on the moon. 5th over: Australia 28-1 (Short 3, Marsh 4) Target 343 Marsh very happy to defend Willey here until the chance arrives to drive, which is does expertly through cover for three. Short has a go! Swing/miss. This is what he does. Wait till he gets going, it’s brilliant. Can’t get off strike for the remainder of this set, mind. TMS tells me that they are going to go back onto the field and play not at St Lucia after the two-hour delay. Hmmm. 4th over: Australia 25-1 (Short 3, Marsh 1) Target 343 Shaun Marsh has walked out at number three as he did in the series opener. He’s forced by Wood to play throughout the rest of the successul over, using a bit of width from the final delivery to get off the mark behind point. Truth told, the major focus of the press box right now is what is happening in St Lucia. As I understand it: Sri Lanka walked out to play, were advised that they were going to be docked five points and walked off again. Blimey. Watch this space. Scrap that, Head is gone! Gives a a catch to midwicket. Nothing shot, taken low by Hales to his right. It is referred upstairs to mak sure it carried and it did. Wood into the book. 3rd over: Australia 20-0 (Head 15, Short 3) Target 343 Short misses a ball on his hip from Wood but gets him a leg bye. Better to Head than he was in his previous set but the left-hander is confident on the front foot. Tucks a single fine to keep the strike. 2nd over: Australia 18-0 (Head 14, Short 3) Target 343 Earlier in the over it was Wood to Short, facing his first ball in ODI cricket. He sent down a wide down the legside to begin then a couple off the hip. He’s away. “What exciting times,” says Adam Gilchrist on TMS about the cap presentation before play. “He was quiet at the best of times but particularly nervous this morning.” Takes another single down that way too. So, Australia into double figures all in that general direction. Head changes that up lifting over the cordon for four more! Clever cricket, I always like an uppercut. As you already know by now, England wasted their review from the last ball. NOT OUT! Great decision from Alex Wharf the man on debut. Pitching outside leg. HAS MARK WOOD TRAPPED HEAD? Turned down but they are going upstairs. 1st over: Australia 8-0 (Head 8, Short 0) Target 343 Easy work for Head, clipping off his thigh for four first ball. With fine leg up, he can’t bowl there. That’s better, beats him next ball with a beaut of an outswinger. The left-armer found the South Australian’s edge early on at The Oval so he should be confident early on here. Urgh, he gives Head a second easy boundary from a misdirected delivery down the legside that he’s able to get a little tickle on. Good batting. Willey, not so much. Stats, stats, stats. From a very handy briefing via the very clever people at CricViz that has just dropped into my inbox. Since the last World Cup, Eoin Morgan’s team have won 72% of matches when chasing, but only 56% of matches when batting first. 58% of Roy’s runs today have come through the off-side, the most (min 10 balls faced) since October 2016. Jason Roy played just 9% false shots today - that’s the lowest figure for any of his centuries. His century earlier this year at Melbourne saw 21% false shots. England’s 71 runs in the first ten overs was their second highest Powerplay score ever against Australia. Jos Buttler has now scored 105 runs with the scoop shot in ODIs. That’s the most by anyone in the history of the game. Righto. The players are back on field Travis Head is alongside D’Arcy Short, the man on debut. David Willey has the ball in his hand. PLAY! Thanks, Tim. Mighty effort from you with the much longer session than expected due to the rain. Isn’t Jos good at cricket? Plenty of oooohing and aaaahing in the press box as he did his thing. To adding a couple of extra stats to what Tim has noted below, that was the best ever ODI score at this ground, and if Australia win from here it’ll be their highest successful chase. The re-start is about ten minutes away so I’m going to grab a cup of tea. I suggest you do the same before dropping me a line (or a tweet). 50th over: England 342-8 (Buttler 91, Rashid 0) Tye bowls a near-wide, which is also short, and Buttler does phenomenally well to toe-end a cut for four. Last ball, he shovel-hooks for four more into the gap at long leg. Shame there wasn’t time for a hundred, but that is a sparkling captain’s innings. And it’s also England’s highest-ever one-day score against Australia. England are firm favourites, but there are plenty of runs in this pitch and the weather is unlikely to get in Australia’s way. Thanks for your company and correspondence, combination sports and all, and it’ll be Adam Collins to see you through. Plunkett sacrifices himself to get Buttler back on strike. That’s what old pros are for. Three balls to go. 49th over: England 329-7 (Buttler 80, Plunkett 0) Willey finds his range with a tennis shot past long-off, then gets lucky with a top edge over Paine’s head. And then he perishes. But that gives the strike to Buttler, who cashes in with a cracking four through midwicket. A slower ball does for Willey, just as he was getting going. He skies it and Kane Richardson takes a good catch off his own bowling. 48th over: England 316-6 (Buttler 75, Willey 3) Buttler’s average with the scoop shot (or ramp) is 105, and his strike rate 223. He tries it again, the ball follows him, so he adjusts and dabs to backward point. There’s only a single in it, but that’s a stroke of genius. Australia are winning the final overs, though. 47th over: England 310-6 (Buttler 71, Willey 3) Richardson K rejoins Richardson J in the attack and keeps it tightish, though he gets away with a near-beamer which Willey does well to squirt down to third man. An email lands from Geoff, who has just the one name, like Stormzy. “If John Starbuck is correct in his suggestion that donning combinations would improve almost any sport,” he wonders, “why has it done so little for baseball?” 46th over: England 304-6 (Buttler 68, Willey 1) Richardson snaffles Moeen and almost gets Buttler too, as Tye just fails to dive forward at fine leg and swallow a top-edged swish. After that fabulous little flurry, Buttler has gone back to scoring at only a run a ball. Moeen swings it languidly to deep square, where Agar claims a sharp low catch. Well, Moeen said he wasn’t going to change his ways, and he hasn’t. 45th over: England 300-5 (Buttler 66, Ali 8) Tye keeps England just about in check. And John Starbuck picks up on Andrew Benton’s musings (42nd over). “Combination sports are best when the contrast is largest, as in very fast/very slow, so ice-hockey + crown green bowls, or table-tennis/croquet. Or you could improve almost any sport by insisting the players wear combinations.” 44th over: England 295-5 (Buttler 64, Ali 5) Jhye Richardson gets three balls past Buttler’s bat, which is quite an achievement. And we even have some blue sky to encourage the Aussies. “Footage of the last two overs should be shown to teach young batters how to move through the gears,” says Nigel Phillips, quoting me just now. “Cricket should be shown on free-to-view TV to show young people what it is.” Amen to that. 43rd over: England 293-5 (Buttler 63, Ali 4) Moeen for Billings is actually an improvement at this stage, as Moeen shows by swatting his first ball over midwicket for four. Nonchalant. Billings drags one on, allowing Bumble to say “It’s a Welsh drag-on.” Billings remains out of form and out of luck, but he played his part – the 50 partnership had just come up, making this the first time in ODI history that the first five wickets have all yielded 50. 42nd over: England 281-4 (Buttler 57, Billings 10) Short continues, in a further sign of Tim Paine’s guts. Buttler plays an off drive that is more of a hockey shot, lovely fast hands. He has made 24 off his last eight balls. As Ed Smith said, he has unique abilities. A thought from Andrew Benton. “What with all these international sports going on at the mo – football, cricket, rugby, golf, Wimbledon soon – in their own exclusive little sporty bubbles, I yearn for some crossover to break up the monotony, chess-boxing style. How about cricket-darts?” 41st over: England 273-4 (Buttler 52, Billings 7) Yes! Buttler goes crazy, but craftily. Jhye Richardson returns, bearing pace, which helps. First ball: a cracker past cover for four. Second: the finest ramp you’ve ever seen, for six over long stop (dropped by the man in the black hoodie). Third: another, slightly coarser ramp for six more. Fourth: a spanking cut for two. That’s fifty for Buttler, off 38 balls. Footage of the last two overs should be shown to teach young batters how to move through the gears. 40th over: England 253-4 (Buttler 33, Billings 6) Another over for Short, another four runs. With ten overs to go, England are surely about to go for it. 39th over: England 249-4 (Buttler 32, Billings 5) Another decent over from Agar. Buttler needs some fireworks, and he will probably have to light them himself. In other news, the mighty Iceland are being held to a draw by the plucky Argentines. 38th over: England 245-4 (Buttler 29, Billings 4) Emboldened by his own brilliance, Paine decides to risk another over from D’Arcy Short. He concedes only four, so the risk pays off. Sam Billings, given another chance by Eoin Morgan’s back spasm, needs to make use of it: there’s time for a quick 40. 37th over: England 241-4 (Buttler 28, Billings 1) A tidy over from Agar, who has been a bit better than figures of 8-0-48-0 might suggest. 36th over: England 239-4 (Buttler 27, Billings 0) Roy plays the first ball after the break for two behind point, and the next for four through wide mid-off. Among other strengths, he has been quite unperturbed by all these interruptions – but then Tye deceives him with an off-cutter. Good comeback from Tye to end an outstanding innings from Roy. He started off playing second fiddle, then stormed the podium. Well that’s come out of nowhere. Tye finds Roy’s inside edge, and the lip-swollen Paine takes a superb catch, somewhere to the left of his left ankle. He’s got some character, this guy. The end of a very fine innings. Paine’s lip looks bad, but he’s battling on. Goodness knows who the vice-captain would be. At least the rain has abated. Mid-36th over: England 233-3 (Roy 114, Buttler 27) Roy thumps a straight drive for four off the returning Tye. Poor old Paine cops one in the face, and then the drizzle returns. The pain, for Paine, comes mainly in the rain. Tim Paine, trying to stop a slower ball from Tye down the leg side, is hit in the face as the ball suddenly pops up at him. He seems to have a nasty cut. 35th over: England 228-3 (Roy 109, Buttler 27) Seeing two men at backward point, Roy decides it would be fun to bisect them with a reverse sweep. 34th over: England 219-3 (Roy 102, Buttler 26) Stoinis’s last over, and England help themselves from the buffet, with a couple of twos and a drop-kick for four by Buttler off the last ball. The Aussies have been able to take one wicket but never two in quick succession, and every England batsman has reached 20. 33rd over: England 209-3 (Roy 101, Buttler 17) That little experiment was Short-lived. Agar returns, bowling a full length, almost yorkers, so Roy props forward, to pick up a hard-run two and a well-deserved hundred. He’s been so measured. 32nd over: England 203-3 (Roy 97, Buttler 15) Stoinis continues, tries a bouncer, and watches it disappear over midwicket as Roy plays that imperious pull of his. A force for two by Buttler brings up the 200 off 190 balls. After flirting with the Aussies, the barometer has decided to stay with England for now. 31st over: England 194-3 (Roy 92, Buttler 11) Short is worth a shot, if only because these two batsmen have apparently never faced a left-arm wristie in 50-over cricket. Buttler’s not bothered, though: he die some milking and then strokes a glorious off drive for four. Ten off the over. And D’Arcy Short, who should be still glowing from that catch, is coming on to bowl. He’s a left-arm wrist-spinner. A resumption is expected around 2.15pm, or 20 minutes’ time. One of the oddities of this England side is that they’ve dispensed with all the senior citizens from the Test team – Cook, Broad and Anderson – while getting many a wicket out of the oldest flinger in town, Liam Plunkett. He was talking to the press yesterday, prompting Vic Marks to draw parallels with the Rolling Stones. if you’d rather hear about Argentina v Iceland, go here for Rob Smyth’s MBM. I confess to video envy seeing that little clip of the Iceland fans practising the synchronised thunderclap. It knocks the Mexican wave into a cocked sombrero. The break is expected to be brief, again. In the meantime, do sign up for The Spin, one of the oldest and best cricket newsletters. It has a rotating cast, much like the spin in the England Test team, but usually more penetrating. 30th over: England 184-3 (Roy 91, Buttler 2) Buttler, missing a pull, takes one from Stoinis on the right thigh, then plays a lovely easy swat for a single. And they’re off again, with the barometer just swinging towards Australia: only 24-1 off the last five overs. 29th over: England 182-3 (Roy 90, Buttler 1) Buttler, so good in the Test series against Pakistan, gets off the mark with a comfy tuck to square leg, and Tye finally keeps it tight. The Aussies have just crept back into this, but the rain should help England, by ruling out reverse swing. 28th over: England 179-3 (Roy 88, Buttler 0) So Root, like Bairstow, offered only a cameo. And here’s Jos Buttler, taking Eoin Morgan’s place at No 5 as well as captain, which gives him time to do some damage, weather permitting - the mizzle has returned. Root, in silky touch, suddenly pops a pull to deep square, where D’Arcy Short takes a lovely low catch. Caught Short indeed. 27th over: England 177-2 (Roy 87, Root 21) You don’t see many threes at Sophia Gardens, but Root gets one with an elegant push past extra cover. This partnership is already 64, off 52 balls: the stage is set for something spectacular. Here’s Brian Withington again. “Sadly I don’t know the answer to David Tripp’s 14th over question about the potential uniqueness of concurrent Australian rugby, cricket and football internationals.” Ah. “However, if the cricket team (or Cardiff weather) can’t come to the rescue then I will stick my neck out and suggest it may well be the first time a nation has played and lost all three.” 26th over: England 170-2 (Roy 84, Root 17) Tye tries one of his surely-not-that-many variations, the bouncer, and Roy smacks him for six to the long square boundary. In view of the rain, lunch is going to be reduced to 35 minutes. That should give everyone time to get half-way up the queue for the bar. 25th over: England 158-2 (Roy 75, Root 16) Roy gets a bouncer from Kane Richardson and plays a tennis smash, with fast hands, which deserves more than a single. The unrelated Richardsons have done pretty well (2 for 65 off 11 overs). The rest have 0 for 93 off 14. 24th over: England 154-2 (Roy 71, Root 15) Roy just carries on where he left off, punching Tye past mid-off for four. Play will resume at five past. The poor old Aussies just had time to see their footballers and rugby players lose, so a nation’s honour is in their hands. Brian Withington takes advantage of the rain to run with a ball from the 20th over. “If Bairstow is lead guitar to Jason Roy’s rhythm, who plays drums and bass in this England beat combo? Reminds me of the old (Dave Allen?) joke about the drummer whose rhythm was so good that the Pope made him an honorary Catholic.” This is like an exam in which I’ve finally spotted a question I can answer. Bass: Hales – not the most demanding role. Drums: Buttler – holds it all together, gets the girl. It has become quite hard to see, so Marais Erasmus finally accepts that it’s time to wave the players off. A chance for the Aussies to watch their football brethren try and hold out for a point against the mighty France, but before they can change the channel, Paul Pogba scores. 23rd over: England 147-2 (Roy 65, Root 14) Roy gets away with a snick off Jhye Richardson which would have been a dolly to first slip, had there been one. Australia are not going to win this by being defensive. Yet another question, this time from Mahendra. “Watching cricket &amp; football simultaneously, why is it that we don’t see Waughs, Clarkes, Taylors, Smiths in football and vice versa. Are those games mutually exclusive to some families down under?” Is the OBO turning into Notes &amp; Queries? 22nd over: England 137-2 (Roy 59, Root 10) Roy clubs Stoinis for six to cow corner, his first of the day. “Plenty going on in this city,” says Mike Atherton. “The Stones were here last night.” It’s uncanny the way the #NoFilter tour has followed the cricket. But has anyone fallen for the tongue-logo Gray Nicolls bat, retailing at £999? 21st over: England 129-2 (Roy 52, Root 9) Root gets four off Jhye Richardson with that square push of his. Kumar Sangakkara, on commentary, calls Root “the complete batsman”. Takes one to know one. 20th over: England 124-2 (Roy 51, Root 5) Roy pulls Stoinis for four, yet again, and takes a single to reach fifty. He’s been composed and adaptable, playing rhythm guitar while Bairstow took the lead, then becoming more assertive. And the next question comes from Pat McGinley. “Can batting side decide *not* to take drinks as it is getting silly now... or are we particularly inept after drinks?” 19th over: England 117-2 (Roy 45, Root 4) Jhye Richardson is back, reintroducing himself with an 88mph bouncer, which Roy wisely decides not to play, and then castling Hales, possibly off the inside edge. What a good bowling change by Paine. Joe Root gets off the mark with a spring-heeled glance for four, using the pace. In other news, Australia have gone one down to France at the World Cup, thanks to a penalty awarded by the VAR. And equalised through another pen! Jhye Richardson brings one back at pace and Hales can’t cope at all. Game on? 18th over: England 112-1 (Roy 44, Hales 26) Roy decides Tye is slow enough to be treated like an offspinner, and mows him over midwicket for four. Hales misses one pull, then nails another as the drizzle turns to a mizzle. Cricket, bloody hell. And that’s drinks, with England in charge. John Starbuck is with us, sending an email entitled Beards. “England still have a highly hirsute bowling attack, and overall six and two halves (Root and Hales), which makes their line-up more macho than Australia’s. Will it be enough?” 17th over: England 103-1 (Roy 39, Hales 22) Agar restores order, no mean feat as the drizzle is back. 16th over: England 101-1 (Roy 38, Hales 21) Holy moly, a boundary. Andrew Tye comes on and Hales gets four through the vacant slips with something between an edge and a squirt. With the spell broken, Roy plays a much better shot for four, through mid-off, and the hundred comes up off 96 balls. Time for some of Tye’s 22 variations, which may be the worst bit of variation hype since Shane Warne’s heyday. 15th over: England 90-1 (Roy 33, Hales 15) Agar continues and so do the singles. The scorecard, to paraphrase Julian Barnes on exclamation marks, looks like an avenue of poplars. 14th over: England 86-1 (Roy 31, Hales 13) Stoinis keeps England honest, and even a bouncer is only pulled for one. Hales and Roy, who used to be England’s blasters, are going about half as fast as Bairstow. David Tripp has a question for you. “Is this the first instance of a country having its cricket, rugby and football teams all playing simultaneously, even starting the matches at the same time?” That will take some looking up. 13th over: England 83-1 (Roy 29, Hales 12) At the moment, it’s just one unremarkable single after another: cricket is turning into Tinder. 12th over: England 77-1 (Roy 26, Hales 9) Stoinis surprises Hales, beating him with some sudden bounce, which will interest Liam Plunkett. Maybe that’s why Paine is standing back. 11th over: England 75-1 (Roy 25, Hales 8) Agar returns, now that he can have some protection, and concedes only singles. “Morning Tim.” Morning Brian Withington. “Obscene amount of sport to consume today. TV and various devices are already taking a hammering, especially as the laptop is in serious Excel spreadsheet mode (sadly). Don’t quite know how I will cope when rugby and US Open also clash with cricket and football. Need a couple of channels (or OBO?) plugged straight into cerebral cortex. No need to ask which body part the emails are sourced from?” I’m happy to say I don’t get that one. “YJB’s departure at least means I can do a bit more number crunching – quite useful for blocking out Bumble’s ‘hilarious’ spectator participation interviews.” 10th over: England 71-1 (Roy 23, Hales 6) Stoinis continues and normal service is resumed as Hales cuts for four. “Way too wide!” reckons Ricky Ponting. That’s the end of the powerplay, with England well on top, but Australia cheerier than they were ten minutes ago. 9th over: England 63-1 (Roy 21, Hales 0) So Bairstow, who split up the Roy-Hales axis, now reunites them. And that’s a very good over from Kane Richardson, conceding only one on top of taking the big wicket. Here’s Phil Sawyer. “I misread lacerated big toe as macerated and wondered why sprinkling sugar on it would keep Stanlake out. Then I read it properly and started limping about the place in sympathy. The mind fair boggles as to how one goes about lacerating a big toe, but I think I can live without finding out through practical experiment.” Phil, full marks for empathy, but you do realise this will damage your chances of reaching high office? Nooooooo! Kane Richardson changes ends and bowls a slower ball, Bairstow makes room, and his cut just produces a tame nick, neatly scooped off the floor by Paine. That’s Bairstow’s second cameo in a row, when he should be getting double hundreds. 8th over: England 62-0 (Roy 20, Bairstow 42) Paine tries Marcus Stoinis’s military medium, but doesn’t stand up to the stumps, as Sarah Taylor surely would. Bairstow carries on enjoying himself with a late cut for four. He has 42 off 23 balls, nine of which have gone to the rope (eight fours, one six). If he can stay in, records will fall. 7th over: England 55-0 (Roy 18, Bairstow 37) Tim Paine turns to spin, ahead of schedule, in the shape of Ashton Agar’s slow left-arm. It doesn’t stem the flow as Roy lofts him over extra cover and Bairstow plays a force for four and a cow-shot for four more. That’s 34 off two overs. C’mon Aussies, c’mon. Richard Neal sends a email from Berlin, politely asking for the TMS link on YouTube. A bit above my pay grade, but I hope this works. 6th over: England 40-0 (Roy 11, Bairstow 29) Stung by my last remark, Roy plays his shot of the morning, a crisply timed off shove for four. Then Richardson K bowls the first juicy half-volley of the day, and Bairstow plays a golf-swing over mid-off for six. Next ball, he plays the same shot, a touch later, for four over extra cover; then when Richardson goes straighter, Bairstow clips him for four more, and that’s 19 off the over. What a star he is in this mood. Hands up if you’d like to see him opening for the Test team. 5th over: England 21-0 (Roy 6, Bairstow 15) Bairstow, beaten by the nip-backer from Richardson J, responds with a crunching off-drive for four, before being beaten again by a bouncer. He has 15 off 14 balls, Roy 6 off 16, so it’s modern one-day cricket at one end and the 1970s at the other. 4th over: England 17-0 (Roy 6, Bairstow 11) Bairstow takes a quick single and Glenn Maxwell, half-stopping it, hurts his shoulder. Hope that’s nothing serious. Kane Richardson keeps it tight, Roy misses another pull, and some drizzle falls. It’s all happening. 3rd over: England 16-0 (Roy 6, Bairstow 10) Jhye Richardson apes his namesake and Bairstow eases him to the cover boundary with a silky push, copyright Joe Root. Roy then plays and misses, pulling too early at a slowish bouncer. 2nd over: England 11-0 (Roy 6, Bairstow 5) Paine lives up to his name by handing the new ball to the other Richardson, Kane (no relation). He avoids the legs but then strays too far the other way, so Roy cuts for four. 1st over: England 7-0 (Roy 2, Bairstow 5) Jhye Richardson takes the new ball and gives Jason Roy a friendly welcome with one on his legs, tucked for a single. Jonny Bairstow gets something similar and whips it for four, to show that despite missing out on a hundred at the Oval, he’s still in glorious touch. All seven runs off the over come on the leg side, so Richardson needs to adjust his radar. Buttler said he would have batted if he’d won the toss, but Stuart Broad, who is commentating, would “definitely” have bowled. Too early to say who’s right. Australia bring in D’Arcy Short, to add some firepower at the top of the order, and sacrifice a bowler in Michael Neser, who can feel doubly miffed because Stanlake’s slot goes to the type-twister Jhye Richardson. England give Morgan’s place to Sam Billings, who has been in ropey form. So Australia’s batting is longer and stronger than on Thursday, and England’s is shallower. Australia 1 Short, 2 Head, 3 Finch, 4 S Marsh, 5 Stoinis, 6 Paine (c, w), 7 Maxwell, 8 Agar, 9 Tye, 10 J Richardson, 11 K Richardson. England 1 Roy, 2 Bairstow, 3 Hales, 4 Root, 5 Buttler (w, c), 6 Billings, 7 Ali, 8 Willey, 9 Plunkett, 10 Rashid, 11 Wood. Easy decision – clouds overhead now, clearer later, Duckworth-Lewis a possible factor too. Eoin Morgan has a back spasm – curse of the OBOer. So Jos Buttler takes over and England, like Australia, will be captained by their keeper. There was some rain forecast for this morning, and it has duly arrived, so the toss is delayed. Can’t quite see the logic there, but that’s cricket for you. Whoever wins the toss may fancy bowling under these black clouds and batting later when the skies are clearer. The Aussies find themselves in an unusual position today: starting an international cricket match and a World Cup at the very same time, 11am BST. If you want to know how many goals Antoine Griezmann can put past the Socceroos, join Paul MacInnes on the MBM. If you’d rather see whether Tim Paine’s patchwork XI can fight back against the might of England, stay here. Paine had a poor day personally in the first game of the series, but his gang of understudies showed plenty of ticker. They turned a top-order collapse into a just-about-defensible total, thanks to a sensible stand between Glenn Maxwell and Ashton Agar, and they bowled well enough to give England a scare or two. Today, alas, they will probably have to do without Billy Stanlake, who is (a) the world’s fastest beanpole and (b) the current cricketer who sounds most like an American novel. He has a lacerated big toe, a condition that is painful even when you’re only typing it. England bowled solidly at the Oval but batted shakily, as so often against Australia, and hardly looked like the World Cup favourites. Still, they were a lot better than the fainthearts who flopped against Scotland. And they managed to sharpen up without changing their XI. In Eoin Morgan, they have the best captain in England. The sage of the press box, Scyld Berry, once divided captains into enablers and exemplars, and Morgan is both. Wouldn’t he be much more of an asset to the Test team now than he was when he last appeared in it, six years ago? Sign up for the Spin, our free weekly email on the world of cricket.

It’s got to be local, 11 June) still gives credence to the view that renationalisation of the entire railway system offers some answer to current problems in the sector. In fact, what is needed is a radical reform of the current passenger rail franchising model, and an end to the highly damaging separation of track and train operation. This could be achieved through the creation of a set of vertically integrated franchises along each main line of route, with a single entity responsible for management and operation of both fixed and mobile assets. These “vertically integrated” franchises would be awarded for terms of 20 to 30 years, to encourage franchisees to take a longer-term view of their businesses, and the financial terms would be subject to periodic review and adjustment, to address the problems that have arisen with the east coast franchise. Properly designed franchises can be part of the solution to the UK’s rail problem. Ian Jones Fownhope, Herefordshire • Recent disruption on the rail network has been unacceptable but it is not a result of the existing public-private model (Just look at housing to see the true cost of privatisation, 12 June). Since the mid-1990s, the rail industry has transformed the services and finances of Britain’s railways. Then the system ran at a £2bn a year loss for taxpayers. Now it generates an operating surplus of £200m, freeing up public money to improve vital public services. Britain faces many challenges – not least the need to build more homes. What’s needed is the best of the public and private sectors working together. Investment in rail has stimulated house-building across the UK. Our long-term plan to change and improve the railway will secure over £85bn of additional economic benefits, boost communities and improve journeys. But we want to go further, which is why we are bringing forward new ideas to evolve the role of the private sector in rail to unlock even greater investment. Paul Plummer CEO, Rail Delivery Group • This week, small businesses descended on parliament to halt the sale of one of our publicly owned crown jewels, the railway arches (Small firms face extermination due to Network Rail asset sale, 2 June). The arches have long been places where small businesses have flourished, but despite being the lifeblood of Britain’s economy, devastating rent increases and the proposed sale of the properties means that the future of these businesses hangs in the balance. At a time when the government is increasingly concerned about a sustainable future for the UK high street, this is the moment to shelve short-term opportunism and work with the arches tenants by valuing, enhancing and capitalising on their social and economic impact.

Watching the composer-lyricist of Sweeney Todd and Follies at such events – taking a bow, with his wry smile – it was impossible not to reflect on our luck in coinciding with the life of someone who would clearly stand in the history of the genre alongside such geniuses as Cole Porter, Irving Berlin, George and Ira Gershwin, Leonard Bernstein, Kurt Weill, Richard Rogers and Oscar Hammerstein. Sondheim had an unusually direct connection to this creative lineage. As an 11-year-old, living in Pennsylvania as the only child of a divorced and distant mother, he became friends at prep school with James Hammerstein, son of the celebrated librettist. Oscar became a surrogate father to Sondheim, who often joked that, if Jamie’s dad had been a plumber, he would have spent his own life fixing pipes. But this suggestion of helpless influence overlooks the fact that the young Sondheim, a piano prodigy, had already written a musical – By George, a satirical history of his school – which encouraged the Broadway legend to mentor him. Hammerstein gave his protege tutorials on rhyme, characterisation and storytelling, and set a demanding piece of homework: to write four musicals – one adapted from a good play, one from a not so good play, one from a non-dramatic source, and one from an original idea. These can be seen as the templates for Sondheim’s mature output. Three shows – West Side Story (1957), A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum (1962) and The Frogs (1974) – are based on good plays, by Shakespeare, Plautus and Aristophanes respectively. Saturday Night (1954), Do I Hear a Waltz? (1965), Company (1970), Sweeney Todd (1979), and Merrily We Roll Along (1981) were adapted from lesser theatrical texts. Non-dramatic sources that he musicalised were the memoirs of the stripper Gypsy Rose Lee, which became Gypsy (1959); the fairytales by Grimm and others that encouraged Into the Woods (1986); and movies (by Ingmar Bergman and Ettore Scola) that inspired A Little Night Music (1973) and Passion (1994). Original ideas triggered Anyone Can Whistle (1964), Follies (1971), Pacific Overtures (1976), Sunday in the Park With George (1984), and Assassins (1990). The subject matters of those free-floating shows were: small-town politics; old variety performers suffering marital and mental breakdowns; the Japanese-American trade wars of the mid 19th-century; the painting of a Pointilliste masterpiece; and the subset of Americans who have killed or tried to kill a US president. For some critics, the improbability of such material as musical theatre narrative showed Sondheim was artistically killing the father-figure of Hammerstein, who was widely seen as a cosy and conservative figure. Sondheim, though, identified Hammerstein’s Show Boat, Oklahoma!, Carousel and South Pacific as hugely radical for the time, moving American musical theatre on from soppy operetta to deal with real people in serious situations. The 17-year-old Sondheim also worked as what he called “a $25-a-week gofer” on Rodgers and Hammerstein’s 1947 show Allegro, an experimental piece in which a man looks back at his life. It was in conscious homage to Hammerstein that he later used a similar psychological song-cycle form for Company, while Pacific Overtures contains thematic nods to South Pacific, which also dealt with American-Asian military and racial tension. Sondheim always remained true to Hammerstein’s vision that a song within a musical was “a one-act play which either intensifies a moment or moves the story forward”. Where he most departed from the traditional Broadway model was in desiring to write both music and lyrics, rather than the more common collaborative division between composer at the piano and librettist with a notepad. Sondheim tended to bracket as lesser works West Side Story and Gypsy, which had music by Leonard Bernstein (whom he loved) and Jule Styne (whom he didn’t). He had hoped to write the songs for Gypsy on his own, but its star, Ethel Merman, felt that the young man was too modernist to provide the lush orchestral score she wanted. Sondheim considered A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum, his first show in charge of both halves of the song, as the true start of his career and, apart from brief sentimentally-inspired reunions with Bernstein and Rodgers, never again wrote words for another composer. “I’ve never found anybody I could work with as quickly as myself, or with less argument,” Sondheim told the New York Times in 1966, a joke that was deadly serious. Yet Sondheim described himself as “naturally a collaborative animal”, and freely admitted that only Sweeney Todd and Passion were entirely his own ideas – or, the word he preferred, “notions”. The rest came from the writers of the “book” (musical theatre’s term for the narrative and dialogue). The most frequent of these were George Furth, John Weidman, Hugh Wheeler and James Lapine. They provided storyline, structure and thematic ideas; Sondheim’s independence came in the insistence that the stuff that was sung would be only his. This encouraged the view, which he never quite eluded, that Sondheim’s lyrics were greater than his music. To make the comparison at all ignored Sondheim’s rationale for doing both jobs – that the two elements are complementary and cross-influential. His lyrics are extravagantly clever, packed with rhymes that give no quarter to Cole Porter. In Follies, he offers in one scene alternative numbers for the performer playing Phyllis, depending on the level of dance skills the actress has. The first song, The Ballad of Lucy and Jessie, reveals the divided personality of the character through the story of two women who crave each other’s traits. The rhyming and rhythm are thrillingly slick: “Lucy wants to be dressy / Jessie wants to be juicy / Lucy wants to be Jessie / And Jessie Lucy / You see.” However, the alternate version, Ah, But Underneath, is even more of a tongue-twister, with a quatrain that builds to a climactic triple rhyme: “In the depths of her interior / Were fears she was inferior / And something even eerier / But no-one dared to query her superior exterior.” In an anti-love song from Company, a troubled couple reflect on their relationship in a verse that, unexpectedly, has the joke rhymes falling internally rather than climactically. It is, they reflect: “The concerts you enjoy together / Neighbours you annoy together / Children you destroy together / That keep marriage intact.” The way in which, in that lyric, the three examples of togetherness rise through the cosy via the funny to that dark parental punchline typifies the comedic sensibility central to Sondheim’s writing. His jokes can be very dark, most notoriously in A Little Priest, from Sweeney Todd, where the murderous barber and pie shop owner Mrs Lovett discuss the various professional flavours that his victims might lend her pastries. Someone in a Tree, from Pacific Overtures, most spectacularly achieves the theory of a song as a compressed play. This Act One finale quartet, which Sondheim identified as his favourite among his compositions, moves fluidly between three timescales. Two old men and the childhood version of one of them remember witnessing, from a high branch, the signing of an American-Japanese treaty in 1853. In the haiku-like lines that Sondheim uses throughout the libretto, one veteran remembers overhearing shreds of negotiation: “‘But we want…’ / ‘No, you can’t / And we won’t…’ / ‘But we need it, / And we want…’ / ‘Will you grant–?’ / ‘If you don’t…’ / ‘We concede it…’” Those 25 words, in which one voice channels two others, supremely demonstrate Sondheim’s often-stated desire to bring theatrical lyrics as close to natural speech as possible. But Sondheim’s words would not have been so memorable without his compositional ability and agility. The thunderous opening chorus of Sweeney Todd, its instruments including a piercing factory whistle, is one of the most exciting and terrifying theatrical soundscapes ever achieved. And, refuting those naysayers who claimed that Sondheim couldn’t write hummable numbers, Send in the Clowns has been recorded more than 500 times by different artists. As a composer, Sondheim was the musical equivalent of Phyllis in Follies, who – reports the lyric of Ah, But Underneath – could be “sly, wry, cool, or coy, or candid”. He was equally adept at harmonies, ballads, choral numbers, love songs, laments and comic ditties, and had an ability to pastiche any musical form, whether operetta, opera, patter songs or military marches. Such protean fluency as a composer was useful because so many numbers are cut – or urgently inserted – during the frequently brutal preview period before a musical opens. Sondheim was so prolific in the cause of making a show work that a CD, Unsung Sondheim (1993), and a sheet music book, The Almost Unknown Sondheim (2016), featured more than 50 songs which, though thrown away on the road to a Broadway opening, sounded anything but throwaway. Sondheim often asked more of audiences than they were prepared to give. He performed the score of Anyone Can Whistle to 33 different groups of potential backers before the budget was raised for a premiere that ran for only nine performances; the premiere of Merrily We Roll Along closed after 16 shows. Almost none of his musicals went into profit on their first production. Crucially, though, he was not ignoring public taste so much as slowly shaping it. Works that had once sat uneasily on Broadway or in London’s West End won over ticket-buyers and critics with subsequent productions. This revisionism was helped by a series of reputation-changing revivals in the less commercially brutal environment of British subsidised or off-West End theatre. They included a 2017 Follies at the National Theatre, and stagings of Sunday in the Park with George, A Little Night Music and Assassins at London’s Menier Chocolate Factory in 2005, 2008 and 2014; and of Sweeney Todd and Gypsy, both starring Imelda Staunton, at the Chichester festival theatre in 2011 and 2014. In the first decades of the 21st century, there were important New York revivals of Sweeney Todd, Gypsy, and Passion. Although honoured that his Broadway shows also graduated to opera houses, he refused offers to create original work for such elite spaces. He was discouraged by the handful of performances given to new operas, and the medium’s resistance to rewriting a work in the light of audience reaction. Revivals of his work helped to shatter the idea that Sondheim’s songs had greater intellectual than emotional intelligence. Losing My Mind, from Follies, when sung by Staunton at the National, was revealed to be a clinically precise account of a nervous breakdown that happened to be written in the form of a torch song. In the same production, Philip Quast, as arrogant diplomat Ben, so convincingly broke down in his final number, Live, Laugh, Love that some in the audience believed the actor was unwell or had forgotten his lines. Sondheim published, in two volumes, what is probably the best autobiography by a major creative talent, Finishing the Hat: Collected Lyrics (1954-1981) with Attendant Comments, Principles, Heresies, Grudges, Whines and Anecdotes and Look, I Made a Hat: Collected Lyrics (1981–2011) with Attendant Comments, Amplifications, Dogmas, Harangues, Digressions, Anecdotes and Miscellany. The memoir included Sondheim’s lyrical mission statement, declaring that four principles underlay “everything I’ve ever written”. These were: “Content Dictates Form, Less is More, God is in the Details – all in the service of Clarity.” The books fascinatingly revealed his perfectionism. For a single line in Sweeney Todd, he pored over numerous maps of London seeking a two-syllable street name, in which a Victorian judge might plausibly have lived, that was stressed on its first rather than second syllable. He admitted to “blushing” over rare imperfect rhymes in early shows, and latterly would only accept “perfect” (or true) rhymes, in which the sounds of the final syllables match (home / roam, convey / dismay), rather than near or false rhymes. Made distrustful of love first by his parents’ failed marriage and then by being gay in a long historical period of homophobia, Sondheim was often considered shy and solitary. Many singers of Send in the Clowns have concluded that its explanation of isolation was autobiographical, while Barcelona, a duet for reluctant lovers in Company, and the refrain “artists are bizarre, fixed, cold”, in Sunday in the Park with George, can reasonably be seen as confessional. However, in maturity, Sondheim sustained two successive relationships with younger men: first with the dramatist Peter Jones and then the digital technologist Jeff Romley. He seemed to have achieved in his private life an ease, personability and generosity that he had always suggested in interviews. In his final decade, Sondheim worked with playwright David Ives on a musical, intended for New York’s Public theatre, based on two films by the Spanish director Luis Buñuel. A section was previewed, to acclaim, in 2017. Sondheim’s theatrical immortality, though, lay in his back catalogue and his influence on others. After Lin Manuel Miranda translated some Sondheim lyrics into Spanish for a 2009 Broadway revival of West Side Story, the older composer became the sort of admiring mentor to Miranda that Hammerstein had been to Sondheim. Sweeney Todd, A Little Night Music, Pacific Overtures and Passion seem certain to be fixtures in the theatrical and operatic repertoires, while Company, Follies and A Funny Thing Happened can expect regular Broadway and West End revivals, as can two classics that Sondheim regarded as only half his: West Side Story and Gypsy. Merrily We Roll Along is likely to be heard less often, but contains a lyric of huge significance. One character, Franklin Shepard, is a Broadway composer whose adult failures and disillusion are seen to contradict his youthful belief that: “But for those who dare / the world is there / to change.” In 1981, after the 16th and final Broadway performance seemed to confirm Sondheim’s reputation as a minority taste, Stephen Sondheim might reasonably have felt that he, like Shepard, had failed in his artistic aims. Now, though, it’s clear that Sondheim not only dared to change musical theatre, but succeeded, forever. His work simply had to wait to rhyme with his time."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"books/2018/jun/21/the-gloaming-kirsty-logan-review","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-21T11:00:09Z","webTitle":"The Gloaming by Kirsty Logan review – mermaids and mysteries on a Scottish island","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jun/21/the-gloaming-kirsty-logan-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/jun/21/the-gloaming-kirsty-logan-review","fields":{"headline":"The Gloaming by Kirsty Logan review – mermaids and mysteries on a Scottish island","bodyText":"Emotionally, an island is always more than a land-mass surrounded by water. As metaphors, islands can denote freedom, imprisonment and everything in between, while as backdrops, they invite extravagant experiment. When it comes to the latter, Kirsty Logan has form. Her debut novel The Gracekeepers, an environmental fairytale set in a lush, futuristic waterscape, won wide acclaim and comparisons to Margaret Atwood, Angela Carter and Emily St John Mandel. In her more diluted follow-up, Logan draws on the same themes – myth, loneliness, desire, grief and ritual – but focuses on a single, unnamed Scottish island in the here and now. “The sea always wants things to change, the land wants to stay the same,” says Mara Ross, the young adult protagonist. “Everyone finds their own balance. Sometimes they get it right but sometimes – far more often – they get it wrong.” While Mara’s observation reflects Logan’s preoccupation with liminality and flux, it could also serve as the novel’s own warning to itself that a miscalibration of action, character and setting can result in a literary gloaming: a half-light in which crucial landmarks are difficult to discern. This is not an issue in the powerful first section of the book, which opens captivatingly with a bold, take-it-or-leave-it magic realist premise: the island’s main distinguishing feature is a clifftop where dying islanders go to be turned to stone. Imagining her own afterlife, Mara pictures herself petrified there, “majestic and candle-lit and loved”; “seabirds would shit on her for ever”. The cliff established, the shocking death of Mara’s little brother Bee carries the story forward, movingly so. With his body swallowed by the sea and no stone effigy to visit, the Ross family is sucked into a whirlpool of grief: the guilt-racked Mara finds solace in an abandoned mobile library where “over that winter she read a hundred deaths – and when the book ended, she could turn the pages again, and the death was undone”. But grief turns out to be a hard act to follow, in fiction as in life. Having initially plunged in deep, the novel heads for shallower and less satisfying waters. Away from the eerie graveyard of the cliff, the island is humdrum. With its lone grocery and single pub, there is little to entertain the island’s few teenagers, including the hapless starter boyfriend Mara barely tolerates, and soon dispatches: “John, or Joe – James? He was so forgettable. It’s an achievement just to be able to mention his existence.” When the sleek, enigmatic Pearl enters Mara’s life, it is as if in answer to an unspoken prayer: a greater contrast to “J” would be hard to find. But is Pearl really a performing mermaid who travels the world doing tank shows with a fake tail and a hidden oxygen supply, as she claims – or something fishier? While Mara frolics in the beguiling waters of sexual discovery, Logan offers some thrillingly observed flashbacks into the past of Mara’s parents: “its eyes were peppercorns. Its insect legs twitched … Peter hated boiling the lobsters. Making a game of their deaths. Watching them die slowly. Cracking their bodies open and sucking them clean. He hated it because he hadn’t hated it.” Such vignettes, strewn like flotsam along the book’s meandering shore, supplement the somewhat static love story with texture, breathing space and movement, as do the novel’s short chapters. But patches of fog remain, from which Logan seems unwilling to conjure substance. As children, Mara and her sister communicate “in spells, combinations of words that sounded made up – but the more you listened, the more a sense emerged … a glamour made from grammar”. But what exactly did the girls say? Is Logan’s decision not to let us taste the words for ourselves an authorial choice, or a blind spot? Likewise, when Mara describes her island as teeming with “mysteries”, “secrets”, “magic” and “stories”, Logan outsources much of its content to the imagination of her readers. While the invocation of the numinous may be enough to cast a spell on some, the more literal-minded, for whom John or Joe or James does matter, will be left feeling hungry enough to gnaw on a fistful of raw seaweed. With its striking image of the cliff and zeitgeisty mermaid theme, The Gloaming offers glamour in abundance. But its lack of specificity and lightly sketched characters leave one with a sense that there is little substantive at stake. By the end, the novel’s emotional waves feel more characteristic of the Baltic than the North Sea: after the initial storm of Bee’s drowning they do not so much rage as gently pulse. Which is a shame, because when the novel’s climax – a wild, sumptuously visual coup de théâtre – arrives, it thrills the inner eye but fails to truly stir the heart. • The Gloaming is published by Harvill Secker.

Nearby, a great spiral of ribbons swirls across a model landscape, like a whirlwind of noodles caught among the trees. A host of other curious creations fills the basement gallery of Japan House, a new cultural centre on Kensington High Street, west London, from teetering nests of wooden sticks to sheets of scrunched up paper, and what looks like a floppy silver pancake resting on a glass cube. These are the dreamy visions of Japanese architect Sou Fujimoto, who approaches the design of his buildings more like a conceptual artist searching for new forms – or a scavenger foraging through a skip. “Trash can be very liberating,” he says, standing next to a row of plinths that display pieces of torn cardboard, a washing-up scourer and a pile of potato crisps, each adorned with a tiny model figure to suggest their transformation into something of an architectural scale. “It makes us more relaxed and open-minded, and helps us to forget what we know. Everything can be a possible architectural space.” Fujimoto, now 46, shot to international prominence in 2013 following his beguiling Serpentine Gallery pavilion. It was one of the most ambitious creations in the 18-year programme, standing as an amorphous white structure of slender steel rods that formed a climbing frame of steps and seats, hovering like a pixelated apparition in the park. It did exactly what the annual commission does best: highlight a little-known foreign architect, give them a platform to distil the essence of their work and propel them to global recognition. “It was like having a free pass to anyone,” says Fujimoto with a broad grin. “It gave me confidence. But more than that, it changed my approach to my work and gave me a new perception of how a building could be landscape, furniture and enclosure at once.” The seeds of his pavilion design – formed over an intense month of self-reflection and experimentation, during which he says his proposals were rejected by the gallery directors as “too Fujimoto” or “not Fujimoto enough” – are revealed in the exhibition. You can see how loops of folded paper and carved polystyrene evolve into a pixelated mass, part-terraced landscape, part-cave. It is the solid form of what would become the hollow frame, where inside, outside, floor and roof would meld in a shape-shifting blur. Five years on, these seeds have germinated into a global portfolio of projects run by an office of 35 people in Tokyo and 20 in Paris, working on everything from an apartment tower in Montpellier to a 1.2km-long shopping mall for an undisclosed country in the Middle East. The former will be an astonishing sight, erupting with enormous cantilevered balconies in all directions. The latter would have been a gargantuan stack of colonnades rising to pointed spires – the Serpentine frame on Islamic arch-infused steroids – but it was cancelled “when the king changed his mind”. A big boat-shaped block of flats with a forest on the roof is being planned for Paris, while the aforementioned silvery pancake will soon emerge above a music hall in a park in Budapest, where concerts will take place in a glass bubble surrounded by forest on all sides. “I really like the feeling of being in a forest,” says Fujimoto, who grew up in rural Hokkaido on the edge of woodland. “It’s an open field but you feel protected, being surrounded by many small pieces. And it inspires curiosity: the fact you can’t see everything inspires you to walk to discover more.” A forest of books was the idea behind his library for Musashino Art University in Tokyo, built in 2010, where one endless bookshelf spirals around in concentric circles, perforated by doorways and bridges. “Of course, the librarian wanted it to be organised and systematic,” he says, “but the other role of a library is to create space where students can meander and happen upon things they weren’t looking for.” His solution synthesises order and happenstance, with book categories arranged radially around a central counter, while the paths that cut across his spiral allow students to drift and discover. Something of an outsider architect, Fujimoto has never worked for another practice, which perhaps explains his firmly original approach. “I was scared of being rejected,” he says. “And if I had gone to work for another architect, they might have overpowered me because I was so easily influenced.” He arrived at the University of Tokyo intending to study physics, but was so flummoxed by what he found that he switched to architecture, which he studied for just two and half years before graduating in 1994, with no interest in continuing to do a master’s degree. “I then had a nice couple of years in Tokyo,” he recalls, “getting up around noon most days and thinking idly about architecture, sometimes going to look at buildings, but mostly just being on my own, thinking and making drawings.” Like so many architects, he began his career with a helping parental hand, designing a ward for the psychiatric hospital that his father ran in Hokkaido. Rather than following the conventional rooms-off-corridors approach, he arranged the patients’ rooms opening into a shared living space and introduced privacy to a place that had always been configured around having no place to hide. Fujimoto’s interest in balancing the needs of privacy and openness became an obsession. His first domestic projects are almost surrealist exercises in how inside can be separated from out with anything but a simple wall. Instead, he layers, nests and stacks spaces to blur the transition from public to private. House N, built in 2008 in the town of Oita, Japan, is “a box within a box within a box” like a Russian doll, each perforated enclosure adding another layer of privacy as you move from the street to the centre of the home. House NA, built in 2011 in Tokyo, is the closest thing to a glass and steel treehouse, where 20 little glass-walled rooms are suspended in a steel frame, “allowing you to hop between the levels like a monkey or a bird in a tree”. Perhaps tired of being performing monkeys for architectural tourists, the residents now keep their curtains firmly closed. His love of toying with the limits of exposure and privacy reaches its peak in one of his smallest projects. Commissioned to design a public toilet in Ichihara, Fujimoto erected a solid wooden fence in an oval ring around the edges of the site, encircling a bucolic garden in which a loo stands brilliantly exposed in a glass pavilion. You can openly defecate among the birds and the bees, surrounded by plants in the middle of a public place, without ever being seen. “Even in such a small project,” he says, “you can find opportunities to reinvent architecture.” Sou Fujimoto: Futures of the Future is at Japan House, London, from 22 June to 5 August."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"football/live/2018/jun/15/portugal-v-spain-world-cup-2018-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-16T09:15:13Z","webTitle":"Portugal 3-3 Spain: World Cup – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2018/jun/15/portugal-v-spain-world-cup-2018-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/live/2018/jun/15/portugal-v-spain-world-cup-2018-live","fields":{"headline":"Portugal 3-3 Spain: World Cup – as it happened","bodyText":"Friday’s other Group B match: That’s about it for tonight’s blog.

And not even Nacho’s strike tonight was as good as Jeff Agoos’s own goal. Give your eyes a Friday night treat “Best group games,” begins Mike Buckley. “Thinking Scotland v Holland in ‘78 in Argentina. It was a cracker with that Archie Gemmil goal too.” Ah yes, excellent shout. Spain 2-3 Nigeria in 1998 was another extremely good game. Italy 3-2 Brazil in 1982 is the greatest match ever played, but that was in the second group stage. I’m trying to think of better matches in the first group stage. In my lifetime, the two that come to mind is Argentina 2-1 France in 1978, a classic with higher stakes than this game, and Ireland 0-0 Norway in 1994. Any other suggestions? Any thoughts on the game? Thanks for your emails, most of which I didn’t get chance to read during the match. Spare a thought for poor old Sid Lowe, who had to file a coherent report on that classic BEFORE THE FINAL WHISTLE. If I was in his shoes, I’d have written nothing but wibble. Thankfully, Sid is a bit more accomplished. Player ratings latest “I gave Ronaldo a 1,” says Louis Taylor, “because he’s not a team player and I don’t like him.” Here’s Sid Lowe’s match report: Spain will be annoyed to have drawn a game they dominated, but when the dust settles they will reflect with pride on a superb performance. Isco was majestic, Nacho scored the goal of his life, and Diego Costa bulldozed a couple of goals. Any doubts about whether they can win the tournament have gone. Before you go, why not give your player ratings for the game? If you give Ronaldo less than 11, you need to have a word with yourself. It’s important not to get carried away with how good that match was. It was only one of the greatest group matches in World Cup history. It had almost everything; most of all, it had a hat-trick from the monstrous Cristiano Ronaldo. The World Cup? Bloody hell. 90+3 min Ronaldo has run himself into a state of exhaustion. I think he has cramp. 90+2 min Quaresma almost wins it for Portugal! He collected a crossfield pass on the left, danced sweetly past two players and hit a low shot that was brilliantly blocked by the sliding Busquets. I think it was Busquets, anyway. Whoever it was has probably earned Spain a point. 90+1 min It’s Portugal on the attack, with one corner leading to another. If Ronaldo scores again, we might as well call off the World Cup and give him the trophy now. 90 min There are four minutes of added time. 89 min When Ronaldo dies he should donate his brain to the Fifa museum, because his mental strength is entirely beyond comprehension. It was a glorious free-kick, curled around the wall and into the right-hand corner of the net. That is astonishing. Before the free-kick, he was inhaling and concentrating as if he was about to take a penalty, not a free-kick from 25 yards. It’s spine-tingling stuff. His mental strength is off the charts. He’s only effing done it! 87 min Pique fouls Ronaldo 25 yards from goal, slightly to the right of centre. I wonder who’ll take this. 86 min Spain make their last substitution, with Lucas Vazquez replacing the excellent David Silva. 84 min Portugal are struggling to get the ball, never mind keep it. Ronaldo is getting increasingly frustrated at the imperfections of those around him. 82 min Tiki taka tiki taka tiki taka tiki taka tiki taka tiki taka tiki taka tiki taka until Aspas mishits a shot through to Patricio from the edge of the box. 81 min Spain have this match under control. Portugal have spent most of the game chasing the ball in fierce heat and they look shattered. 80 min A last change for Portugal: Andre Silva replaces Goncalo Guedes. 79 min A long ball from Cedric invites Ronaldo to hare behind the defence. He is about to shoot and/or clatter into the outrushing De Gea on the edge of the box when Pique comes from the side to make a superb tackle. 77 min Another change for Spain: Iago Aspas replaces the irresistible Diego Costa. 76 min Quaresma waves an extravagant shot over the bar from the right edge of the box. 75 min Portugal are struggling to lay a glove on Spain, with or without the ball. It’s been such a good game but Spain’s superior class is really starting to tell. 72 min A short corner is played to Joao Moutinho, whose deep, lofted cross is headed back beyond the far post by Fonte. Ronaldo keeps it in play but Spain clear. Fonte might have done better there. 71 min Diego Costa misses a good chance for a hat-trick, mishitting a first-time shot wide from Jordi Alba’s crisp cutback. The chance came at the end of another delightful move. On this evidence, Spain are in the top group of contenders with Brazil and Germany. They have been wonderful. 70 min Spain make their first change: Thiago Alcantara replaces Andres Iniesta, who played very well. A hat-tip to the man who said before the game that Iniesta should be subbed after 70 minutes. 69 min Another Portugal change: Ricardo Quaresma replaces Bernardo Silva, who didn’t see much of the ball. 69 min “Re: Diana Ross and the Supremes,” begins Liam Murray. “I seem to recall Diana Ross eventually dropped her second-rate colleagues and doing everything on her own. It’s the inevitable next step for CR7.” 68 min Portugal make their first change, with Joao Mario replacing Bruno Fernandes. 66 min For the first time in the match, Spain have retreated. It’s human nature, I guess, but with the way they are playing they could kill this game pretty quickly. 64 min I wonder how Julen Lopetegui feels tonight. He should be extremely proud of this brilliant Spain performance, but he probably can’t go there just yet. 63 min Bernardo Silva is very lucky not to be booked for a cynical pull on Isco. The referee played a good advantage but should have gone back to book Silva. Isco has been utterly brilliant. 62 min “What I’m enjoying most about the World Cup is, watching my 6 year old son falling in love with football.,” says Matt Dony. “He’s been so excited, and asks non-stop questions about players. The best part of this is the fact that he’s still young enough to have complete trust in me (the fool!) As such, I have explained that Ronaldo is objectively the best footballer in the world, and the Messi apologists are simply wrong.” This will be one of the goals of the tournament, even if we play until the year 2027. With Portugal under all kinds of pressure, a desperate defensive clearance hit Carvalho and rebounded across the edge of the box. It bounced up awkwardly for Nacho, who cut across the ball to swish a spectacular shot that clattered off the inside of the far post and into the net. The technique was perfect, with the ball whistling just above the ground all the way into the net. Nacho gives Spain the lead with a stunning goal! 57 min As Danny Murphy says on BBC, Spain have spent most of the match passing the ball beautifully – and their goals have come from a long hoof and a free-kick. Tiki-taka 0-2 kicky-hacka. 56 min “Have to admit, I have so missed Costa since he left Chelsea,” says Hubert O’Hearn. “I used to call him The Little Ball of Hate, but he’s truly unique with a temperament always right on the edge. What a terrific match so far!” Iniesta was fouled 30 yards from goal in a central position. David Silva took a short free-kick with Koke and clipped the ball beyond the far post, where Busquets towered over his man to head back across goal. Diego Costa reacted fastest and stabbed the ball in from six yards. Diego Costa gets his second equaliser! 53 min Spain have a few options on the bench, including Marco Asensio and Iago Aspas. 52 min “I’m afraid I still don’t understand VAR,” says Prateek Chadha. “What is the rule? The Portuguese were clearly incensed by Costa performing a WWF/E style ‘clothesline’ on Pepe and VAR looked at it and deemed there to be no foul. Why it wasn’t a foul is a mystery to all those watching in the stadium and on TV. Surely VAR referees must be miked up and asked to explain their decisions to the audience like in cricket and the NFL.” Decisions are only overturned if there is a “clear and obvious error”, so I can understand why the Costa goal stood. I agree that the process isn’t quite right though. Somebody will punch a referee before the tournament’s out. 51 min It’s been a slow start to the half, though these things are relative. It’s fascinating to watch Spain probing for gaps in this superb Portugal defence. 49 min “Hang on,” says Rachel Clifton. “Is someone accusing YOU of being more impressed with stereotypical masculinity!?” Haven’t you seen my new byline picture? 48 min Spain have started the second half as they spent most of the first: in possession of the football. Isco continues to pop up all over the pitch; he’s been the biggest threat to Portugal. 47 min Here’s Jonathan Bradley. “Recalling how the Supremes became Diana Ross and the Supremes, are we now to accept the renaming of Portugal as Ronaldo and Portugal.” 46 min Peep peep! Portugal begin the second half. I still cannot believe that error from De Gea. Maybe it was karma for doing a Joe Hart before the penalty. Half time chit chat Thanks for all your emails, most of which I haven’t had chance to read because of this storming match. Charles Antaki “How did Ramos manage to concuss his own keeper?” Phil Podolsky “I guess it’s a matter of ideology: whether you are more impressed by Messi’s palpably superior skills or by bronca, lack of Xaviesta, ‘leadership’ and the rest of the stereotyped iconography of masculinity etc.” Honestly, you couldn’t imagine a better half of football at this stage of a World Cup. Spain played brilliantly in possession but gave away two silly goals, one of them from an unthinkable error by David De Gea. Diego Costa scored a brilliant and controversial equaliser; Isco thundered a stunning shot off the underside of the bar. And Cristiano Ronaldo, who was quite majestic, scored twice. God bless the World Cup! Who needs a drink? That was scorching stuff. 45 min There will be two minutes of added time. They used VAR to check whether Ronaldo was offside. He was in an offside position earler in the build up but it was a different phase of play. How can you begin to make sense of that? Ronaldo, teed up in the D by a short pass from Guedes, drilled a left-foot shot straight at De Gea. It was well struck but should have been a routine save. Instead it slithered through De Gea and into the net. Ronaldo gets his second thanks to a hideous mistake from David De Gea! 43 min The excellent Isco works the ball back onto his left foot and hits a decent shot from the edge of the area. Patricio saves comfortably. Isco has been like a ghost in the Portugal half. 42 min Portugal keep the ball for 90 seconds, which gives them a necessary breather. When Spain regain possession, Pepe takes a sly shortcut through the back of Diego Costa’s Achilles. He’s lucky not to be booked for that. 39 min “Regarding the 90% comment you made, do you not think Messi is (by a wide margin) better than Ronaldo?” asks El Mox. “I’ve supported Real my whole life, I was there for Ronaldo’s very first game for Real (a dull 1-0 win vs Shamrock Rovers in Ireland), he is an icon for Real, however, I’ve watched Messi for his whole career and it’s pretty to clear who the superior player is. Messi is the most complete footballer I’ve ever seen. Come join the 90% Rob, it’s fun over here.” Messi was better from 2008-13, but I think Ronaldo has comfortably surpassed him in the last five years; I don’t really see how anyone can think otherwise. But it’s probably a discussion for another day. And neither of them are fit to clean Maradona’s bidet. 37 min Portugal were terrific on the counter-attack at 1-0, but since it went to 1-1 they have struggled to get out of their third, never mind their half. It’s been a thrilling half of football. 35 min His goal was typical, with defenders being tossed around as if it was a Royal Rumble rather than a football match, but Diego Costa has also shown a more intricate side to his game – especially during that last move. Spain have been terrific. 34 min Iniesta almost makes it 2-1. Spain moved the ball around delightfully on the left, with Diego Costa and Iniesta involved. Eventually Alba cut the ball back to Iniesta, who dragged a left-footed shot just wide of the far post. 32 min Portugal are hanging on, with Spain looking very slick in possession. 28 min Fernandes is booked for a foul on Nacho. 27 min This is blistering stuff. I’d like to see that Costa goal again, because a foul could easily have been given for the challenge on Pepe. 26 min: Isco hits the bar! It was a scintillating strike from the left edge of the area which slammed off the underside of the bar and bounced down towards goal. Spain thought it was over the line but the goal-line technology showed that wasn’t the case. Who needs tiki-taka? The goal came from a long ball by Busquets, which Pepe could only head up in the air while being flattened by Costa’s challenge. Costa picked up the loose ball, ignored a couple of challenges from Fonte and worked the ball into position before dragging a low shot past Patricio from 12 yards. They used VAR to see if there was a foul on Pepe, but it wasn’t overturned. Diego Costa scores a brilliant equaliser! 22 min What a chance for Guedes! Portugal broke from the Spain corner and should have made it 2-0. Fernandes on the right curled a brilliant pass around the defence to Ronaldo, who eschewed the expected shot and instead flicked the ball deliciously into the path of Guedes. He should have shot first time but took a touch and was dispossessed vitally by Alba. Ronaldo throws his hands up in disgust. 21 min Beautiful play from Iniesta. He scoots into the box from the left, sends a defender off to a different postcode and then eases the ball back to David Silva. His shot is deflected behind for a corner. 20 min “Three more international goals from Ronaldo and he’ll overtakes Puskas (currently on 84) as the highest scoring European international in history,” notes Mike Gibbons. “He might never catch Ali Daei who has the world record (with 109), but bloody hell.” It fascinates me that maybe 90 per cent of football fans still think Messi is the best player. 18 min The free-kick is 20 yards from goal, in line with the right edge of the box. Ronaldo batters it into the wall. 17 min Busquets is booked for a lunge at Guedes. 16 min Spain are having all of the ball now, though Portugal – as we saw two years ago – are very well organised defensively. And they know how to break: a beautiful touch from Ronaldo in his own half releases Guedes, who can’t decide whether to go it alone or try too play it back to Ronaldo. In end he does neither. 13 min Spain are starting to look a little sharper, with Isco winning their first corner. Nothing comes of it but the signs are better. 12 min “Looked to me,” says Dave Ankers, “that Ronaldo was already diving before the contact.” I thought he made certain of the contact but that it was a foul nonetheless. 11 min An early goal is perfect for Portugal, who can sit and play on the break. Ronaldo, incidentally, has now scored at four World Cups. He’ll make it five in 2022. 10 min Spain’s first chance. Isco’s left-wing cross is knocked down by Costa to Silva, who lashes the bouncing ball over the bar with his right foot. He slipped in the act of shooting, which may be why the finish was unusually imprecise. 9 min Spain look half asleep at the moment. As Andrew Hurley highlighted earlier, there is a real lack of pace in their team. 7 min Oh, Spain. 6 min “I was a big fan of Spain and Spanish football back when they were enthusiastic underachievers, before tiki-taka made them the hipster’s choice (always hated Pep, though, but that’s for another time...),” says Matt Dony. “Now that flush of popularity has passed, I should be able to enjoy supporting them without the self-conscious concern about looking like just another band-wagon jumper. And yet. And yet. I have to be honest, Ramos has just undermined it all in the Champions League final. Not just the Salah incident, it was the whole shebang. The little look before the dive that lead to Mane’s booking was particularly sly. I mean, I know he’s always been the same, but I was able to appreciate his commitment to the ‘dark arts of defending’ (as we’re obligated to describe it) with a cool detachment in the past. It might be the result of being a one-eyed Liverpool fan, but that game was a turning point in the way I see Spanish football. What I’m trying to say is, ‘Go on, Ronaldo.’ I’m throwing my support firmly behind Portugal. Which I’m sure they will greatly appreciate.” I always think football is better for having a villain who leaves opposition fans foaming with impotent rage. Though I did briefly change this view while flinging all sorts at Vinnie Jones when he celebrated in front of the United fans at Selhurst Park in 1997. Goodness me, what a start. De Gea tried to put Ronaldo off but it didn’t work. Ronaldo ignored him and slapped a penalty into the right side of the net with De Gea going the wrong way. It’s Ronaldo v De Gea - and Ronaldo scores! Ronaldo ran at Nacho on the left edge of the box, beating him with a stepover. Nacho dangled a leg absent-mindedly and brought him down. 3 min It’s been a decent start from Portugal, with Carvalho having a lot of touches in midfield - and now they have a penalty! 2 min “Here’s what’s going to happen,” says Olly Wicks. “Spain will win comfortably and cruise to first place in their group. Meanwhile, Egypt will beat Russia and the Saudis and finish second in their group. This means we get a Spain v Egypt last 16 game, in which Salah nutmegs Ramos to score a 95th minute winner and take sweet, sweet revenge. From Olly, a completely unbiased Liverpool fan.” Imagine if Ramos put him out of the World Cup with a sly suplex. 1 min Peep peep! Spain, in white, kick off. Portugal are in red. Ronaldo and Sergio Ramos shake hands in the centre circle. It’s time for the first humdinger of Russia 2018. Ronaldo “The Wheels of Justice picked up sudden speed early today in Spain,” says Luiz. “Ronaldo got himself a suspended two-year sentence and a huge fine. The good judge could have waited for Monday morning. Ronaldo, according to the Portuguese press, is all upset, mainly, for parting with his hard-earned money. What you think? Is it going to demoralise CR or put him in a killer mood?” I’m not sure two broken legs could demoralise Ronaldo, who is one of the mentally toughest footballers I’ve ever seen. I’d be reluctant to give him any additional motivation. “I’ve noticed Iniesta holding onto the ball a bit too much this year and not releasing it as fast as he usually would, as if trying to convince himself and others that he’s still at that level,” says Paul Fitzgerald. “But Barca conceded a goal to Roma through him getting dispossessed and he struggles around the 70min mark these days.” Stop press! Here are our match reports from today’s thrillers: Egypt 0-1 Uruguay Morocco 0-1 Iran Some pre-match reading Ramos urges Spain to ignore upheaval before Portugal clash Real accuse Spain of ‘absurd reaction’ over Lopetegui Sid Lowe: Anger and ethics at heart of Spain’s decision An email! “I’m a huge fan of both but even if still at a very high level, aren’t David Silva and Iniesta on the way down (more so the latter)?” says Andrew Hurley. “Forget about the coach, I think this will hurt Spain more...” I thought David Silva was majestic last season, though his central role at City probably suits him better at his age. Iniesta is past his best but he’s still influential enough. I know what you mean though - it’s a pretty old team, with nobody under the age of 26 in the starting XI. As ever with Spanish football, they could learn a lot from England. Your pre-match task ... is to pick your all-time World Cup XI for Spain and/or Portugal. If you need some inspiration, or you just want to copy a legend, you can look at the teams picked by Iker Casillas and Paulo Futre. WHERE THE HELL IS ALBERT FERRER? Portugal (4-4-2) Patricio; Soares, Pepe, Fonte, Guerreiro; Silva, Carvalho, Moutinho, B Fernandes; Guedes, Ronaldo. Spain (4-2-3-1) De Gea; Nacho, Pique, Ramos, Alba; Busquets, Koke; Silva, Isco, Iniesta; Costa. Referee Gianluca Rocchi (Italy) In the other Group B match, Iran have snatched a famous victory over Morocco. Barry Glendenning can tell you more. In the Little Book of How To Win a World Cup, there is no mention of sacking your coach 24 hours before the tournament starts. But we shouldn’t write Spain off just yet. From Helmut Schön’s breakdown in 1974 to Calciopoli in 2006, the majority of World Cup winners have overcome chaos, scandal and/or a slew of negativity on the way to lifting that magical hunk of gold. If there’s one dressing-room that should be self-governing, it’s Spain’s. Their squad have won almost 300 trophies between them, so they don’t need that much guidance. As we’re accentuating the positive here, let’s say they also have the perfect opening game to concentrate their minds: an Iberian derby against Portugal, the European champions, and their old friend Cristiano Ronaldo. It’s quite a game to have so early in the tournament. Most will think it’s a cosmetic match - that, even if one side loses, they will still qualify for the second round ahead of Morocco and Iran. But we thought something similar before the first games in 2014, when Spain faced the Netherlands and Portugal met Germany. Both were plugged by four goals and never recovered. Then again, in 2010 Spain lost their first game and won the tournament. The departure of Julen Lopetegui, sacked for disrespecting the Bing Spanish FA, has reinforced the sense that nobody really has a clue what’s going to happen this time. Which is just the way we like it at a World Cup. Kick off is at 7pm BST, 9pm in Sochi."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"us-news/2018/jun/14/trump-charity-sued-latest-new-york-attorney-general-violations","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-14T16:01:34Z","webTitle":"Trump and family sued by New York attorney general over alleged charity violations","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jun/14/trump-charity-sued-latest-new-york-attorney-general-violations","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/jun/14/trump-charity-sued-latest-new-york-attorney-general-violations","fields":{"headline":"Trump and family sued by New York attorney general over alleged charity violations","bodyText":"The attorney general of New York state sued the Donald J Trump charitable foundation, President Trump and three of his children on Thursday for violating state charity laws, alleging that the Trumps used charitable assets as “little more than a checkbook for payments to not-for-profits from Mr Trump” and his companies. Foundation assets, acquired through tax-deductible donations, were used to settle legal claims against one of Trump’s golf clubs and to buy a painting of Trump to be displayed at another club, the suit alleges. The lawsuit, filed by the attorney general, Barbara Underwood, on the morning of Trump’s 72nd birthday, seeks $2.8m in restitution and penalties from Trump and asks for the distribution of $1m in assets to other charities. The lawsuit also seeks to dissolve the Trump Foundation and bar the Trumps from serving on the boards of any charitable organizations – Trump senior for 10 years and three of his children for one year. In addition to Trump, the lawsuit names his children Donald Jr, Ivanka and Eric. Trump began tweeting soon after the charges were filed, dismissing the lawsuit as the work of “the sleazy New York Democrats” and claiming the foundation “took in $18,800,000 and gave out to charity more money than it took in, $19,200,000”. “I won’t settle this case!” Trump tweeted on Thursday. If he does not settle the case, a trial could result, casting a prolonged spotlight on the inner workings of the Trump Organization and probably requiring the president’s personal involvement. A statement from the Trump Foundation declared “this is politics at its very worst” and painted Underwood as a partisan apparatchik. Underwood, a career staffer and former acting US solicitor general who was promoted last month after her predecessor, Eric Schneiderman, resigned in disgrace, has said she will not seek election to the position which she plans to leave in the fall. The lawsuit alleges that the foundation engaged in “at least five self-dealing transactions that were unlawful because they benefited Mr Trump or businesses he controls”, Underwood said in a statement. “These include a $100,000 payment to settle legal claims against Mr Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort, $158,000 to settle legal claims against Trump National Golf Club, and $10,000 to purchase a painting of Mr Trump displayed at the Trump National Doral.” Money used to pay those bills came not from Trump but from would-be charitable donors who paid into the foundation, the lawsuit said. “From 1987 through 2008, Mr Trump personally donated funds to support the foundation,” the suit reads. “Since 2008, however, Mr Trump has not contributed any personal funds to the foundation, which instead has been supported by donations from other persons and entities.” “The foundation is little more than an empty shell that functions with no oversight from its board of directors,” the lawsuit alleges. “Trump ran the foundation according to whim, rather than law.” The lawsuit follows an investigation of the Trump foundation that began in June 2016 under the previous New York attorney general, Schneiderman. That investigation followed on the Pulitzer prize-winning work of the Washington Post journalist David Farenthold and others. Episodes of alleged wrongdoing highlighted by the lawsuit include a charity fundraiser for veterans that Trump held on 28 January 2016, when he was a presidential candidate. Trump held the benefit in lieu of participating in a presidential debate. The lawsuit alleges that a Trump foundation filing claiming that the event was “to raise funds for veterans’ organizations” was in fact false, because “in reality, the fundraiser was a Trump campaign event in which the Foundation participated”. “In violation of state and federal law, senior Trump campaign staff, including campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, dictated the timing, amounts and recipients of grants by the foundation to non-profits,” Underwood said in a statement. To maintain their charitable status under New York state law, organizations are barred from engaging in most political activity. Schneiderman, who served for seven years, had previously sued the Trump Organization on multiple fronts, and after the inauguration, Schneiderman’s office sued the Trump administration and congressional Republicans at least 100 times. Shortly before his inauguration, Trump settled a fraud case brought against Trump University by the state attorney general’s office, then run by Schneiderman, for $25m."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2018/jun/17/christina-aquilera-liberation-review","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-17T07:00:10Z","webTitle":"Christina Aguilera: Liberation review – pop diva grasps creative freedom","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/jun/17/christina-aquilera-liberation-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/jun/17/christina-aquilera-liberation-review","fields":{"headline":"Christina Aguilera: Liberation review – pop diva grasps creative freedom","bodyText":"The last decade hasn’t been kind to Christina Aguilera. Her most recent albums, Bionic (2010) and Lotus (2012), were commercial failures, either too experimental or too on the nose. Her stint on the US version of The Voice kept her profile alive but creatively suffocated her. Despite her tenacity, her position as one of pop’s peak divas was crumbling. But with Liberation, Aguilera is at her most artistically emancipated since Stripped (2002). The Jackson 5-sampling Maria, produced by Kanye West, blasts her near decade-long identity crisis, while Sick of Sittin’ is as thrillingly acerbic as 2002’s Fighter. Fall in Line, a screech-off with fellow vocal acrobat Demi Lovato, is loud but surprisingly rousing, as is the typically Aguileran ballad Twice – although multiple interludes begin to feel tedious. Unable to resist languorous ballads, Aguilera mars proceedings with Masochist and Unless it’s With You – but it’s in the fearless incubation of understated R&amp;B that she excels, sparingly pushing her voice for texture rather than power. Unexpected gummy synths propel Accelerate, the Anderson .Paak-produced Like I Do (featuring Goldlink) is effervescently vibey, and Deserve is Aguilera at her most anguished. It’s tricky to ascertain the true extent of Aguilera’s newfound freedom, but she’s giving it one hell of a go."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/jun/11/uk-working-holiday-visas-bright-blue-tier-5-theresa-may","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-11T14:18:11Z","webTitle":"UK should allow more working holiday visas, says Tory thinktank","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jun/11/uk-working-holiday-visas-bright-blue-tier-5-theresa-may","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/jun/11/uk-working-holiday-visas-bright-blue-tier-5-theresa-may","fields":{"headline":"UK should allow more working holiday visas, says Tory thinktank","bodyText":"The government should expand the number of countries whose citizens are eligible to apply for a working holiday visa to the UK, a Conservative thinktank has said. The tier-5 youth mobility visa allows people aged 18-30 to live, work or study in the UK for two years. It is open only to applicants from Australia, Canada, Japan, Monaco, New Zealand, Hong Kong, South Korea and Taiwan. Bright Blue, the liberal conservative thinktank, said Theresa May’s immigration policies undermined her vision of a “global Britain”, and an expansion of the programme would help achieve this goal. The government’s “hostile environment” immigration policies, introduced by May when she was home secretary, are under scrutiny in the wake of the Windrush scandal. It has faced calls to liberalise immigration policy following the damaging revelations. Ryan Shorthouse, Bright Blue’s director, said: “One of the best ways of achieving a ‘global Britain’ is by enabling talented people from around the world to live, work, invest and study in this country. And, of course, for Britons to be able to do the same in other countries. This two-way migration strengthens Britain’s economic prosperity and cultural influence.” The thinktank said the visa should be rebranded as the “citizens of the world visa programme”, in reference to May’s 2016 conference speech, which included the much-derided line: “If you believe you are a citizen of the world, you are a citizen of nowhere.” Bright Blue said the youth mobility visa should be expanded to include Commonwealth countries that met basic human rights conditions, including the abolition of the death penalty, the decriminalisation of homosexuality, and women having access to contraception services. The visas are offered on a reciprocal basis, meaning that the same number of visas are available each year for UK citizens to live, work or study in the partner country. Applicants must prove they have sufficient funding to support themselves in the UK, including £1,890 in savings.

In many ways, she is an advertisement for the merits of the personalisation of care and health. But McCarthy feels her lifestyle is under threat. “They tell you, ‘there’s the money. You can be independent’,” she says. “But you can’t. They monitor every action you take.” What bothers McCarthy is that, in common with more than 30,000 other people with personal budgets, her funding is no longer sent to her bank account as a direct payment, but is loaded on to a prepaid card. Not only does this enable her local council to check exactly how she is spending it, but it gives it the power to veto expenditure it disapproves of. The concerns arise as a consultation closed last Friday on proposals to extend the right to a personal budget to up to 350,000 more people in England living with long-term physical or mental health conditions, including dementia and learning disabilities. Speaking at a conference last week, NHS England chief executive Simon Stevens said: “We’re going to put a lot of welly behind personalised care over the next few years. It’s central to the future of the NHS.” When personal budgets became available for people with long-term support needs, in the early 2000s, much attention focused on the freedom they gave individuals to pay for things that worked best for them. Instead of going to a day centre, they might pay for art classes, or buy fishing tackle, or even get a dog to get them out of the house. An example cited in the recent consultation was of a 90-year-old woman with dementia who uses a budget to pay for care at home, osteopathy treatment and respite care for her family. Since she was given control in this way, she has had no emergency admissions to hospital or residential care. McCarthy uses her budget to employ four personal assistants. She used to receive the funding direct from the government’s independent living fund, which closed in 2015, but her local council, Merton, has moved her on to the prepaid card. Yoko Wilson, who helps McCarthy with payroll administration, describes the system as “ridiculously cumbersome”. She says: “More importantly, it feels as if her choice is being taken away from her.” A survey last year found that almost all councils issuing the cards to personal budget-holders placed restrictions on how they could be used – banning not only spending on alcohol, gambling, dating or adult services, but in some cases also withdrawal of cash, and payment for gas and electricity, petrol, video games or financial investments. One in three councils stipulated that all spending must be deemed to comply with the individual’s care and support plan. Critics say such control is contrary to the spirit, and arguably to the letter, of personalisation legislation. Jenny Morris, a member of the Independent Living Strategy Group (ILSG), a network of disability organisations that carried out the survey, says: “Local authorities seem so concerned about wrongful or fraudulent use of direct payments that they have forgotten about enabling people to have choice and control over the support they need.” The ILSG survey, based on freedom of information returns by all 152 English councils responsible for social care, found that 69 (45%) were using prepaid cards for some personal budgets. More than 32,000 people had been issued cards, out of 630,000 eligible for long-term care and support, although the ILSG believes that proportion will have since risen sharply. Morris says the number of councils offering no alternative to cards is growing. Of the 69, five said cards were compulsory, and 17 said the option of payment into a bank account was available only on request or in specific circumstances. “We’ve been told this isn’t lawful and it certainly goes against the original intention of direct payments.” Luke Clements, professor of law and social justice at Leeds University and a specialist in care legislation, says statutory guidance is clear that payment of a personal budget into a bank account should always be available on request and where “appropriate to meet needs”. Where a card is issued, the guidance states, it is “important that … the person is still able to exercise choice and control – for example, there should not be blanket restrictions on cash withdrawals”. Clements says that in his view, prepaid cards have “advantages for councils but not necessarily for recipients”. According to the Prepaid Cards Network, which represents both card providers and organisations contracting with them, including 42 local NHS bodies, councils alone load more than £500m on to cards annually, much of it for welfare payments. The ILSG calculates that the 69 councils it found to be using cards had spent a total £1.5m setting up the schemes and were spending about the same again annually on contract fees. Typically, a charge is levied by the card provider for every upload or payment, on top of a basic monthly fee, with average total annual costs of £91 a card. The Association of Directors of Adult Social Services has promised to ensure that use of cards does not compromise the principles and practice of personalisation. “We recently circulated [the survey] to our members and are actively considering its findings to determine what further advice we can provide,” says Glen Garrod, Adass president. A spokeswoman for Merton council says: “While we cannot comment on individual cases, we have written to all our direct-payment customers to explain that we are auditing payments to ensure that the transition to the new prepaid card has been successful.” As the council has a duty to manage public funds, “cards are issued on the understanding that payments are only spent on services that meet the individual’s specific needs as set out in their agreed support plan”. A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Social Care says: “People have a right to ask for a direct payment to meet some or all of their needs and we expect all local authorities to prioritise choice and control in administering these.” Back in Colliers Wood, McCarthy says: “I understand that they need to keep an eye on the money, but for God’s sake it’s just too much. It’s not as if I am going to spend it all on a big night out – though that might be a good thing.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2018/jun/11/grenfell-documentary-review","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-11T21:00:30Z","webTitle":"Grenfell documentary review –  a profoundly moving testament to enduring grief","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/jun/11/grenfell-documentary-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2018/jun/11/grenfell-documentary-review","fields":{"headline":"Grenfell documentary review –  a profoundly moving testament to enduring grief","bodyText":"Lorraine Beadle, fourth floor, was the first tenant to move in to Grenfell Tower. The letter came in August, 1975, inviting her to go and view flat number 13. “I thought it was a palace compared to where I was coming from,” she recalls in the opening frames of Grenfell (BBC One), Ben Anthony’s profoundly moving feature-length documentary. Later, in the disorientating days after the fire that ripped through the tower in minutes, claiming the lives of 72 people, we meet Lorraine again. “My whole life was in that flat,” she says, her face crumpling. “It’s a horror story. Everything’s gone.” Shahin Sadafi, fifth floor, said that Grenfell was “our base, fortress, a concrete castle”. “I was very proud to live there,” says Edward Daffarn, 16th floor, his mouth contorting with grief. “Stay put,” Nick Burton, 19th floor, recalls being told, like others higher up the tower. “It’s concrete. It’s not going anywhere.” He escaped with his wife, Maria del Pilar Burton, but she never recovered, and died seven months later. “When it comes it hits you really hard,” says Nabil Choucair of finding out, after an agonising wait of weeks, that his mother, sister, brother-in-law and their three daughters, who lived on the 22nd floor, all died. “Every time they told us about one it was like a knife going through you.” The articulacy, measure and resolve maintained by survivors is a deeply humbling aspect of this respectful documentary, which began filming the day after the fire and continued throughout the year. What hits you most is the grief, still so fresh, still so engulfing. Everyone breaks down and cries, from Yasmeen, Choucair’s 11-year-old daughter, showing drawings she has done of the tower in flames, to Zeyad Cred, who organises monthly silent walks around the tower, remembering how the first one, “in the midst of all that despair … neutralised everyone”. Grenfell, stitched together from hundreds of hours of interviews and filming, as well as archive and social media footage, airs at a highly sensitive time, amid the public inquiry and approaching the first anniversary. Everyone is talking about Grenfell again: the response from the council and central government, allegations of institutional racism, the cladding and the fire brigade’s stay put policy. And everyone has their take on who was most at fault, though no perspective can be truly objective or divorced from personal bias. What is so vital about Anthony’s take is its resolute focus on the diverse working-class people to whom this tragedy continues to happen. The voices that routinely get drowned out, ignored and disrespected, which many say is why the fire started in the first place. Residents recall lifts regularly out of order, rotting kitchens, and surges of power that made toasters smoke and sparks come out of light fittings in the months leading up to the fire. What emerges is a community deeply wounded by the fire and its aftermath, but also by the cumulative despair of being overlooked for so long. If there is a prevailing message here it is about the contempt with which successive governments treat people in social housing. Local people from mosques and synagogues, churches and rugby clubs recall stepping up in the aftermath. All report the absence of authorities. Some volunteers were themselves survivors. Hassan Awadh Hassan, 23rd floor, was away from his wife and two daughters visiting his sick brother in Egypt on the night of the fire. “I see the news. I take my passport and go to the airport straight away,” he says. “I go to duty-free to buy chocolate for my two daughters.” He breaks down in tears. All three of them died. Lorraine returns to the burnt-out tower one last time and regrets it. “It looked like something out of world war two,” she says. “I’ll never forget it. I wish I hadn’t done it. I had a lot of memories there …” She breaks down. The words fail. There is no closure, no end in sight and no limit to the distress of this disaster for the hundreds who continue to live it."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"society/2018/jun/12/adult-social-care-services-collapse-survey-england-council","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-11T23:01:35Z","webTitle":"Adult social care services on brink of collapse, survey shows","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jun/12/adult-social-care-services-collapse-survey-england-council","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/jun/12/adult-social-care-services-collapse-survey-england-council","fields":{"headline":"Adult social care services on brink of collapse, survey shows","bodyText":"Social care services for vulnerable adults are on the verge of collapse in some areas of England, despite the provision of extra government funding, senior council officials have warned. The fragile state of many council social care budgets – coupled with growing demand for services, increasing NHS pressure, and spiralling staff costs – is highlighted in research by the Association of Directors of Adult Social Services (Adass). It says councils “cannot go on” without a sustainable long-term funding strategy to underpin social care and warns that continuing cuts to budgets risk leaving thousands of people who need care being left without services. “The overall picture is of a sector struggling to meet need and maintain quality in the context of rising costs, increasingly complex care needs, a fragile provider market and pressures from an NHS which itself is in critical need of more funding,” the annual “state of the nation” survey says. It reveals English councils plan to push through social care cuts of £700m in 2018-19, equivalent to nearly 5% of the total £14.5bn budget. Since 2010, social care spending in England has shrunk by £7bn. A government green paper on adult social care funding is expected in the next few weeks, and while councils are hopeful this could put budgets on a firmer footing over time, they warn that extra funding is needed to shore up services in the short term. “Social care is essentially about making sure we not only look after people with profound and increasingly complex needs, but also help many transform their lives. Sadly, however, this budget survey reveals, once again this essential care and support is just not being given the resources it needs,” said the president of Adass, Glen Garrod. He added: “We cannot go on like this. How we help people live the life they want, how we care and support people in our families and communities, and how we ensure carers get the support they need is at stake – it’s time for us to deliver the secure future that so very many people in need of social care urgently need.” A government spokesperson said: “We know the social care system is under pressure — that’s why we’ve provided an extra £9.4bn over three years. We will shortly set out our plans to reform the system, which will include the workforce and a sustainable funding model supported by a diverse, vibrant and stable market.” The Adass survey says the social care market is “increasingly fragile and failing” in some parts of the country, with almost a third of councils reporting that residential and nursing home care providers have closed down or handed back contracts. Although councils are spending an increasing proportion of their total budget on adult social care – almost 38p in every pound in 2018-19, compared with 34p in 2010 – social care directors admit they will have to continue to reduce the number of people in receipt of care packages. The survey reveals councils are increasingly reliant on so-called “self help” or “asset-based” approaches to care – in effect using networks of family and neighbourhood groups to provide volunteer support for some social care recipients. Half of local authorities overspent on adult social care budgets in 2017-18, the survey finds, with half of these drawing on council reserves to meet the overspend. The National Audit Office has warned that about 10% of councils will exhaust reserves in three years at current rates of deployment, putting them at risk of insolvency. Ministers acknowledged the financial crisis facing council adult social care services last year, when they provided £2.6bn over three years through a combination of grants and by enabling councils to raise extra social care funds locally through a council tax precept. Adass says this injection of cash helped stave off financial collapse in some council areas. But it warns that the additional funding has “temporarily relieved, rather than resolved” the long-term funding needs of the sector and there is a danger council services could collapse before any new arrangements are in place. Although councils have a legal duty to ensure there is a functioning care market in their area, nearly four in five say they are concerned that they are unable to guarantee this because of the fragility of many care firm balance sheets and rising care staff wage bills. Councillor Izzi Seccombe, the chair of the Local Government Association’s community wellbeing board, said: “Councils and providers are doing all they can to help ensure older and disabled people receive high quality care, but unless immediate action is taken to tackle increasingly overstretched council budgets, the adult social care tipping point, which we have long warned about, will be breached and councils risk not being able to fulfil their statutory duty under the Care Act.” Richard Murray, the director of policy at The King’s Fund, said: “This latest evidence, from every council in England, lays bare once again the need for, as the prime minister put it herself, a proper plan to pay for and provide social care. “Older and disabled people and their families and carers continue to be let down by a system that is on its knees."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/jun/11/schalk-brits-called-out-of-retirement-and-the-stands-for-south-africa-squad","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-11T21:20:06Z","webTitle":"South Africa call up Schalk Brits from retirement to add to England’s concerns","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/jun/11/schalk-brits-called-out-of-retirement-and-the-stands-for-south-africa-squad","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/jun/11/schalk-brits-called-out-of-retirement-and-the-stands-for-south-africa-squad","fields":{"headline":"South Africa call up Schalk Brits from retirement to add to England’s concerns","bodyText":"With England having just slipped to a disappointing first Test loss and in danger of sliding further down the World Rugby rankings, the news that a snake handler was invited into camp to help boost squad morale following their 42-39 defeat felt more than a little ironic. The deadly mambas, cobras and tarantulas proved a useful distraction but finding an antidote to English deficiencies is less easy. With Wales hoping to move above their neighbours into fourth place in the rankings next week, the list of English concerns also now includes the Saracens hooker Schalk Brits who has interrupted his South African holiday to join the Springbok squad before the second Test in Bloemfontein. The 37-year-old Brits retired a fortnight ago but could yet be invited to make the most popular and unexpected of international comebacks. What a wonderful tale it would be if Brits, among the most successful all‑time Premiership imports, were to resume his Test career against his Saracens team-mates Jamie George, Maro Itoje, the Vunipola brothers and Owen Farrell. Brits, who won the last of his 10 Springbok caps at the 2015 Rugby World Cup, attended the first Test at Ellis Park as a fan but Rassie Erasmus believes he can help South Africa’s younger players as they attempt to clinch the best-of-three series. “We are busy building experience, continuity and capacity towards the Rugby World Cup, so we want our young players rubbing shoulders with experienced players such as Duane Vermeulen and Willie le Roux,” Erasmus said. “I want Schalk to perform a similar role because he has extensive inside knowledge and plenty of experience from playing for Saracens in English and European conditions. It’s a great way for our younger guys to learn the trade of international rugby from these guys.” England, in contrast, have had to fly in the young, uncapped Worcester hooker Jack Singleton as cover after Exeter’s Luke Cowan-Dickie hurt a hamstring at Ellis Park. Joe Launchbury’s sore calf is also still being monitored as all concerned look to regroup following the visitors’ spectacular defensive implosion from 24-3 ahead in Johannesburg. For England’s defence coach, Paul Gustard – on his last tour of duty before taking charge at Harlequins – these are particularly tricky days. His side conceded five tries at the weekend and a further nine against the Barbarians last month and the former Leicester and London Irish flanker acknowledges there is plenty of room for improvement. “We didn’t defend well,” Gustard said. “We were tight and our spacing was poor. We just didn’t deliver what we know we’re capable of. We made some poor decisions, we didn’t work hard enough and we lost composure. There’s a knock-on effect of things going against you which you can’t quantify sometimes: the mental drain, the energy drain that comes with losing momentum. We need to correct that. “It’s also about making good decisions around the tackle contest: whether to go in to slow or steal ball or to bounce out and be a defender in the front line. That said, we conceded three penalties for not rolling away, two for high tackles, one for Mako Vunipola’s late charge on Faf de Klerk and one for Maro Itoje not rolling away following a lineout. They weren’t all [poor] decision-making.” It remains Gustard’s firm belief, furthermore, that England can still wriggle off the hook and win the last two Tests: “Absolutely we can rescue the series. We didn’t have the start to the series we wanted but we are still in it; we can still win the series 2-1 and everyone is a firm believer in that. The players want to achieve something historical and we genuinely believe we can do it.” Amid all the snakes and spiders – Dan Robson and Nick Isiekwe proved the most squeamish team members – which enlivened the squad barbecue on Sunday evening, Gustard also insists England have been perfectly correct to base themselves at sea level despite the first two Tests being played at altitude. “We’ve got our own sports scientists and we’ve got a guy who mentors the coaches who head up British Athletics. We took all that advice in and spoke to a lot of Super Rugby teams about what to do. We are very happy with our decision to stay in Durban. “The result at the weekend was not a reflection of the altitude, it was a reflection of our performance. We let them into the game and gave them too many opportunities, which is something we are looking forward to rectifying on Saturday.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/jun/12/midlife-crisis-stick-with-job-sake-of-family","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-12T11:30:47Z","webTitle":"My midlife crisis: my job has plateaued but should I stick with it for the family’s sake?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jun/12/midlife-crisis-stick-with-job-sake-of-family","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jun/12/midlife-crisis-stick-with-job-sake-of-family","fields":{"headline":"My midlife crisis: my job has plateaued but should I stick with it for the family’s sake?","bodyText":"My predicament could be classified as a midlife crisis.

In a report, Thatcham Research and the Association of British Insurers (ABI) say that drivers are being lulled into a false sense of security by the marketing of new driver assistance features making their way into cars and costing upwards of £20,000. Features such as Tesla’s Enhanced Autopilot and Nissan’s ProPilot, as well as terms such as “full self-driving capability” and being “capable of driving autonomously” are giving the false impression of a level of autonomy not yet available. As such, drivers are not treating these features with the level of scrutiny and attention required resulting in crashes and dangerous driving. “We are starting to see real-life examples of the hazardous situations that occur when motorists expect the car to drive and function on its own,” said Matthew Avery, the head of research at Thatcham Research. “Specifically, where the technology is taking ownership of more and more of the driving task, but the motorist may not be sufficiently aware that they are still required to take back control in problematic circumstances.” Current systems are capable of what is termed level 2 autonomy. This means they are able to keep the car on the road using existing combinations of technologies such as range-guided cruise control and lane-keeping aids. They are not able to deal with the task of driving under all scenarios, meaning that the driver has to pay attention to the road at all times and may have to suddenly take over. A recent spate of accidents involving Tesla’s Autopilot system has highlighted the need for drivers to be much more aware of the limitations of driving aids. In a fatal collision in Silicon Valley in March, a Tesla Model X with Autopilot activated sped up and steered into a concrete barrier at 70.8mph. Another Tesla crashed into a stationary police car in Laguna Beach, while a Model S crashed into the back of a stopped firetruck in Utah. Drivers should have taken over control to avoid these incidents. Drivers have also been found blatantly flouting safety laws, including one man who was banned from driving for 18 months after being filmed sitting in the passenger seat of a Model S in Autopilot mode on the M1. A Tesla spokesperson said: “The feedback that we get from our customers shows that they have a very clear understanding of what Autopilot is, how to properly use it, and what features it consists of. “When using Autopilot, drivers are continuously reminded of their responsibility to keep their hands on the wheel and maintain control of the vehicle at all times. This is designed to prevent driver misuse, and is among the strongest driver-misuse safeguards of any kind on the road today.” While Tesla is the carmaker that’s most aggressive in pushing its driving aids as autonomous systems, similar options are available on cars starting from around £25,000, including the new Nissan Leaf. Renault is also installing the technologies into its next-generation Clio, expected in 2020. “Don’t think it’s just £90,000 Teslas or Mercedes that have got this, it’s going right down the line as manufactures use systems required by Euro NCAP safety regulations to sell features consumers are now demanding,” said Avery. While progress is being made by carmakers towards level 5 fully autonomous vehicles capable of handling all scenarios, their public availability is still many years away. For now, drivers are being sold increasingly sophisticated driving aids that are technically and legally incapable of fully autonomous driving. Despite how the aids are marketed, drivers are criminally liable for the safe operation of their cars. “The capability of current road vehicle technologies must not be oversold,” said Avery. “Names like Autopilot or ProPilot are deeply unhelpful, as they infer the car can do a lot more than it can. Absolute clarity is needed to help drivers understand the when and how these technologies are designed to work and that they should always remain engaged in the driving task.” Ivan Drury, a senior manager of industry analysis at Edmunds, who was not involved in the report, said that carmakers need to balance the idea that they are pushing the envelope with the drawback of overselling the competencies their systems actually have. “Features such as ABS brakes, cruise control and blindspot detectors are driver aids that are relatively standard across the board from one carmaker to the next; however, the varying degrees of ‘autonomy’ that are currently rolling out in the market vary drastically when it comes to the level of engagement required from the driver, what obstacles the system can avoid, how the vehicle corrects itself and more. “Education is critical not only to ensure the safety of consumers, but to pave the way forward for the adoption of these technologies.” Thatcham Research has set out 10 key recommendations for assisted driving technologies, including clear naming, driver engagement monitoring and crash intervention. It is testing a series of systems on cars and will grade them in a report for use by insurers in the autumn. A Tesla spokesperson said: “Tesla has always been clear that Autopilot doesn’t make the car impervious to all accidents and the issues described by Thatcham won’t be a problem for drivers using Autopilot correctly.” A Nissan spokesperson said: “ProPilot Assist is a hands-on, eyes-on, driver-assist system that can be used for motorway and dual carriageway driving. This is clearly communicated to customers at all stages of the purchase process. The system requires the driver to be in control at all times, and with their hands on the steering wheel – the system deactivates if this is not the case.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"media/2018/jun/11/jeremy-vine-to-take-over-wright-stuff-slot-on-channel-5","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-11T13:05:37Z","webTitle":"Jeremy Vine to take over Wright Stuff slot on Channel 5","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/jun/11/jeremy-vine-to-take-over-wright-stuff-slot-on-channel-5","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2018/jun/11/jeremy-vine-to-take-over-wright-stuff-slot-on-channel-5","fields":{"headline":"Jeremy Vine to take over Wright Stuff slot on Channel 5","bodyText":"The Wright Stuff is to be renamed after it was announced that the BBC Radio 2 host Jeremy Vine will be taking over as host of the long-running Channel 5 chatshow in the autumn. Matthew Wright quit as the host of his eponymous morning programme this year after 18 years. He is due to present his final programme this week. It will then relaunch in September with a new name and fronted by Vine. The show broadcasts for two hours every weekday between 9.15am and 11.15am. A BBC spokesperson confirmed Vinewould continue to host his flagship Radio 2 phone-in show, which airs from 12-2pm. The presenter will be required to dash across London from ITN’s studios on Gray’s Inn Road in north London, where the Wright Stuff is filmed, to Radio 2’s base in Wogan House, close to Regent Street in west London. “Matthew Wright has built a brilliant show that’s a big part of the British TV landscape,” Vine said. “I’m delighted to be carrying on all the conversations he has started, with all the guests he’s made me feel I know over the years.” Vine recently took a voluntary pay cut; before the reduction he was earning between £700,000 and £749,999 at the BBC. As well as his radio programme he presents the quiz show Eggheads and provides statistical analysis for political events. Wright quit his Channel 5 show after almost two decades, saying he wished to spend more time with his wife and step away from the rigours of presenting a daily show. The decision came soon after the Channel 5 show changed production companies to ITN Productions. It also followed a dispute over comments made on the show in March by The Chase star Anne Hegerty about the transgender activist Paris Lees, which went unchallenged by Wright.

The leading Conservative party Brexiter said checks would not be needed because EU goods could be trusted. However, his vision was immediately dismissed by legal experts as a breach of World Trade Organization rules because it would amount to discriminatory practice. In a phone-in on London radio station LBC he told a concerned caller from the Kent town that he had no need to worry. “The delays will not be at Dover, they will be at Calais,” Rees-Mogg told him, claiming that the French would have to conducts checks under EU law, but the UK would not as it would have taken back control of its borders. Nathaniel, who did not give his surname, called to ask Rees-Mogg when the government was going to “take seriously” the problems local people would face with congestion if there is no deal. He said locals had already dubbed the government’s plans “Operation Stack on steroids”, a reference to the existing scheme which is put in place in the event of disruption. Rees-Mogg, who is head of the European Research Group of MPs, told him: “There will be no need to have any delays on goods coming in from the continent in the event we leave with no deal, because goods that are safe on 29 March will be safe on 30 March and that means inbound traffic ought not to suffer any delays because it will be our choice.” He also claimed that if the French insisted on checks, lorries could divert to other ports in Europe. “If we leave without a deal and the French say your goods can’t come in via Calais, which is possible, but then there are other ports and Rotterdam and Antwerp have been increasing their infrastructure and taking on more customs officers,” he said. His vision was dismissed as confused by the British Ports Association. “It is difficult to see a situation where food and other products could be legally imported from another customs territory without being subject to some kind of border check. We understand that government may choose to waive these in event of no deal but we are not sure of the basis of that decision. Presumably that would be an emergency option and it is certainly not a comfortable fallback position in the medium or long term,” said Richard Ballantyne, the BPA’s chief executive. Legal experts also questioned Rees-Mogg’s claims and said they could break WTO rules. “The basic idea that we will check non-EU goods but not check EU if there is no trade deal done with the EU or a customs union agreement will violate the basic rules of the WTO, because that would be deemed discriminatory,” said Steve Peers, professor or law at the University of Essex and EU law expert. Quite apart from the “narrow” issue of customs checks, there would also be an issue for suppliers such as car manufacturers because some “parts go back and forth across the channel several times”, Peers added."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/jun/11/judge-asked-to-lift-prosecution-ban-on-hillsborough-officer-david-duckenfield","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-11T17:41:42Z","webTitle":"Judge asked to lift prosecution ban on Hillsborough officer","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jun/11/judge-asked-to-lift-prosecution-ban-on-hillsborough-officer-david-duckenfield","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/jun/11/judge-asked-to-lift-prosecution-ban-on-hillsborough-officer-david-duckenfield","fields":{"headline":"Judge asked to lift prosecution ban on Hillsborough officer","bodyText":"An application by the Crown Prosecution Service to prosecute David Duckenfield, the South Yorkshire police officer who was in command at the FA Cup semi-final at Hillsborough in 1989 when 96 people were killed, has begun at Preston crown court. Duckenfield, and the five other men already charged with criminal offences in relation to the disaster at the stadium and its aftermath, are also applying to have the prosecutions dismissed on legal grounds. Their lawyers are arguing that the prosecutions are an “abuse of process”. Judge Sir Peter Openshaw began on Monday to hear the formal application by the CPS to lift the “stay” on prosecuting Duckenfield, as well as the applications to have the prosecutions dismissed. Duckenfield, who was the chief superintendent in command of the crowd attending the semi-final between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest, was previously a defendant to a private prosecution brought by relatives of some of the people who died. At the conclusion of that trial in 2000, the judge , Mr Justice Hooper, imposed a a block on a further prosecution of Duckenfield. After the 2014-16 inquests into the disaster, the CPS announced last year that it intended to charge Duckenfield with 95 counts of manslaughter. The CPS has not sought a manslaughter charge against Duckenfield in relation to the 96th person who died, Tony Bland, because his death occurred four years after the disaster. Bland, 18 when he went to support Liverpool at the semi-final, was on life support after sustaining critical brain injuries in the crush on Leppings Lane terrace of the Sheffield Wednesday ground. The life support was removed after a court application by his family. According to the law as it stood in 1989, a criminal charge of manslaughter cannot be applied in relation to a person who has died longer than a year and a day after the alleged acts occurred. Duckenfield did not join his legal team, led by Benjamin Myers QC, in court on Monday. Approximately 20 relatives of those who died attended the proceedings. The other men charged are Graham Mackrell, a former secretary of Sheffield Wednesday football club who is charged with breaches of safety legislation; Sir Norman Bettison, a former chief constable of Merseyside and West Yorkshire police who is charged with four counts of misconduct in a public office. Donald Denton, a former South Yorkshire police chief superintendent, his then deputy, former chief inspector Alan Foster, and the then South Yorkshire police solicitor, Peter Metcalf, who have been charged with doing acts with intent to pervert the course of justice."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jun/11/trump-diplomacy-kim-jong-un-north-korea","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-11T10:57:48Z","webTitle":"Trump’s vulgarity could be the one diplomatic style Kim Jong-un understands | Simon Jenkins","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/11/trump-diplomacy-kim-jong-un-north-korea","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/11/trump-diplomacy-kim-jong-un-north-korea","fields":{"headline":"Trump’s vulgarity could be the one diplomatic style Kim Jong-un understands","bodyText":"A battered phoenix is struggling to rise from the ashes of the G7 fiasco. It is diplomacy, Trump-style. The American president in Singapore today appears determined, against all odds, to cut some sort of deal to denuclearise North Korea. To him, the G7 summit in Canada was a pointless gathering of political toffs. North Korea is different. He has made it his own. Having proposed a deal, then cancelled it, then proposed it again, failure would be glaring. Donald Trump’s diplomacy would be fascinating were it not so dangerous. Dealings between modern states are about rules and courtesies for a good reason. They are better than war. Trump left Québec insulting his host as “dishonest” and a back-stabber, and scattering blood-curdling threats of trade sanctions at his closest allies. What he was really doing was calling their bluff. To him, G7’s cosy chats are a waste of time, not least because the two powers that really matter, Russia and China, are not there. The Korea stand-off has long been a blot on the face of diplomacy, resulting in the emergence of the world’s most alarming nuclear power. Whether it “threatens” the US may be moot, but it is unfinished business, and America’s (and China’s) responsibility. Traditional diplomacy has failed for half a century to curb the world’s most vainglorious tyranny. Why not try Trump diplomacy? Kim Jong-un is reportedly desperate to relieve his country of economic strangulation, with his Chinese backers turning against him. He has won as much global attention as he needs with nuclear weapons. They are plainly unusable. Meanwhile his citizens are fed up with seeing their cousins in the south prospering. It can’t go on. Kim’s people might love him all the more if he brought them peace and prosperity. Can Trump pander to this man’s vanity, while understanding that success will pander to his own? It cannot be beyond the bounds of negotiation to sequence North Korea’s nuclear disarmament, dismantling and verification against America’s sanctions relaxation, troop withdrawal and aid. In the middle stands a key figure – South Korea’s president, Moon Jae-in – with a massive interest in peace. It should be doable, and the old methods have not done it. The one virtue of Trump’s diplomatic style is blatancy. It turns its back on politesse. It is loud, personal, real and leaves little scope for misunderstanding. Just conceivably it could be the one diplomacy that Kim understands. If not, Trump will have failed, and his G7 vulgarities will have been re-emphasised by naivety. But if he pulls it off, he will have secured a real coup. He could justly claim that his methods have made the world a safer place. It will be back to the drawing board for traditional diplomacy. • Simon Jenkins is a Guardian staff columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/2018/jun/11/un-calls-for-migrant-ship-to-be-allowed-to-dock-in-italian-port","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-11T18:22:21Z","webTitle":"Italian minister declares victory as Spain accepts rescue boat","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/11/un-calls-for-migrant-ship-to-be-allowed-to-dock-in-italian-port","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/11/un-calls-for-migrant-ship-to-be-allowed-to-dock-in-italian-port","fields":{"headline":"Italian minister declares victory as Spain accepts rescue boat","bodyText":"Matteo Salvini, Italy’s far-right interior minister, has declared victory after a standoff over the fate of 629 people on a humanitarian rescue boat prompted Spain to agree to accept them. The impasse, after the populist and far-right government in Italy refused to allow the MS Aquarius to dock over the weekend, suggested that Europe could face a humanitarian crisis this summer as it comes to grips with the new Italian government’s hardline approach to refugees and migrants. Salvini blocked the ship from Italian ports and said it should go to Malta instead. Malta refused, saying it had nothing to do with a rescue mission overseen by the Italian coastguard in waters off Libya. “We have opened a front in Brussels,” said Salvini, who became interior minister last week. “We are contacting the European commission so that it can fulfil its duties towards Italy that have never been respected.” With the UN refugee agency, the UNHCR, urging the urgent disembarkation of all 629 people on board, including 100 children, as provisions ran out, Pedro Sánchez, Spain’s new prime minister, gave permission for the MS Aquarius to dock in Valencia. He said his country would welcome those on board. Italy’s new prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, thanked Spain for its “gesture of solidarity”. Rome’s new position did not mean every ship would be denied entry. The Italian coastguard vessel the Ubaldo Diciotti, with 937 migrants on board – and two of whom have died, was heading to the port of Catania on Monday evening, signalling that ports are still open to Italy’s own rescue boats. They are expected to be closed to all NGOs, however. While it appeared on Monday that an immediate crisis had been averted by Spain, Salvini’s response, and a statement indicating he would block more ships carrying refugees and migrants, promised that there would be more of such confrontations in the future. The new Italian approach by the ruling coalition of Salvini’s far-right League and the populist Five Star Movement followed an election campaign this year in which Salvini vowed to adopt tough polices on migrants. The standoff over the Aquarius marks the first time thathis rhetoric has translated into action as interior minister, a role in which he will have oversight of migration and domestic security. It has also left the NGOs on the frontlines of rescuing migrants at sea – and who sometimes have faced direct confrontations with Libyan coastguard officials seeking to take the migrants back to Libya – in uncertain territory about what comes next. “’We don’t know if Italy will continue blocking us, we don’t know if they will close again the seaports. What we know is that we will continue coordinating the rescue operation with [rescue officials],” said Mathilde Auvillain of SOS Méditerranée, which operates the Aquarius.” She added: “We’ll wait for the instructions as we always did. If it is not Italy it will be another country. As I said, our rescue operation will continue, regardless.” There were also questions about how long it would take the Aquarius to make it to Valencia, and whether the political and diplomatic fracas had put some of tose on board in harm’s way. “People are in distress, are running out of provisions and need help quickly. Broader issues such as who has responsibility and how these responsibilities can best be shared between states should be looked at later,” said Vincent Cochetel, the UNHCR’s special envoy for the central Mediterranean, before Spain made its offer. Auvillain said the voyage to Spain would take almost two more days at sea. More than 600,000 people have reached Italy by boat from Africa in the past five years, and it is estimated as many as 500,000 are still in the country. Salvini’s League, formerly the Northern League, campaigned in the last election on an anti-immigration platform, even though the previous government had overseen a big drop in the numbers coming from Libya over the past 12 months. The European commission, anxious to avoid feeding the new Italian government’s anti-EU narrative, had earlier called on Italy and Malta to consider the humanitarian needs of those on board. “France pushes people back at the border, Spain defends its frontier with weapons. From today, Italy will also start to say no to human trafficking, no to the business of illegal immigration,” said Salvini said on Sunday, adding that Malta “takes in nobody”. The Maltese government rejected a request to take in the boat, saying international law required that the refugees and migrants be taken to Italian ports. Malta’s prime minister, Joseph Muscat, thanked Spain on Twitter for taking in the Aquarius “after Italy broke international rules and caused a standoff”. He said his country would be “sending fresh supplies to the vessel. We will have to sit down and discuss how to prevent this from happening again. This is a European issue.” Fulvio Vassallo, an expert on asylum and international law from the University of Palermo, said the episode “could be the end of humanitarian rescue operations at sea. Salvini won and his victory will have a serious impact in the migrant crisis,.” Italy’s new approach was met with resistance by the Vatican and mayors across the south of Italy, including by Palermo’s Leoluca Orlando, who had said he was ready to open the city’s seaport to the ship. “Palermo in ancient Greek meant ‘complete port’. We have always welcomed rescue boats and vessels who saved lives at sea. We will not stop now,” he said. “Salvini is violating international law. He has once again shown that we are under an extreme far-right government.’’ Other mayors in southern Italy, including those in Naples, Messina and Reggio Calabria, also said they were ready to disobey Salvini’s order and allow the Aquarius to dock in their seaports. SOS Méditerranée said the people on board, mainly from sub-Saharan Africa, were picked up in six different rescue operations off the coast of Libya and included hundreds plucked from the sea by Italian naval units. Although Sánchez’s offer was swiftly praised at home and abroad, the UNHCR has warned that Spain lacks the resources and infrastructure to cope with the migration crisis.

The ultimate source for the material was Banks himself, after he employed Oakeshott, a former political editor of the Sunday Times, during summer 2016 to ghostwrite a diary-style account of the referendum entitled The Bad Boys of Brexit. The rush-released book – which included an erroneous story on the very first page about a photographer being sent to catch Nigel Farage naked in a sauna – was written by Oakeshott in 10 weeks flat and helped cement Banks’s claims, disputed by leading members of the rival Vote Leave group, to have been central to the Brexit campaign. At the time Oakeshott described how Banks and his right-hand-man, Andy Wigmore, had given her “access to their entire delicious email database, as well as all their text message records” to help her write the book. Over the weekend, according to Oakeshott, some of the files were provided digitally, while others came in paper format. The journalist claims that at the time she was not looking for Russian material and the emails were left to gather “dust in my attic”, only appreciating their significance when she revisited the material at the end of 2017 for a book she is co-writing with Ashcroft on defence funding. This changed last week when she called Observer journalist Carole Cadwalladr, who in conjunction with the freelance reporter Peter Jukes, had obtained some of the material and intended to publish it. At one point Oakeshott appeared willing to cooperate with the Observer but by Saturday evening it was clear that the material had been counter-briefed to the Sunday Times, which splashed on the story accompanied by a piece from the pro-Brexit journalist. Oakeshott has since stated that the emails were obtained via an individual who hacked her online storage account, and others have suggested that the newspaper was involved in this, something that has been disputed by Guardian News and Media, which owns both the Guardian and the Observer. “Our reporters were given access to documents which support these serious allegations in line with normal journalistic practices,” said a spokesperson. “We have done thorough due diligence and have documentary and verbal evidence to support our reporting. Those at the heart of this story have significant questions to answer about who they met, when, and why they did not see fit to declare any of this until contacted by the Observer on Friday 8 June.” Oakeshott did not respond to multiple attempts to contact her on Monday. At the weekend she said she remained in contact with Banks and Wigmore but it was a “grave mistake on their part to forge these links” with Russian officials. Oakeshott herself has been willing to make links with the Russian security services in the past. Her last major book was a biography of David Cameron entitled Call Me Dave, which was co-written with Ashcroft and serialised over several days in the Daily Mail. In the book Oakeshott and Ashcroft describe attempting to contact “current Kremlin and KGB” individuals for information on the then prime minister, before being summoned to a five-star hotel in the Black Sea resort town of Sochi to meet a “very high-level source” and going on to meet figures at the Russian parliament. After reporting the critical views of anonymous Russian security sources on Cameron, Oakeshott and Ashcroft suggest it was possible that Cameron should have adopted a “more sophisticated and pragmatic stance” towards Russia and it could have had extra long-term benefits. Call Me Dave prompted a week’s worth of headlines over the claim the former prime minister put his penis in a dead pig at a University of Oxford party, eventually forcing Cameron into a public denial. The story garnered global attention, with pigs becoming a regular symbol at anti-Tory protests. However, Oakeshott later told a book festival that the source for her story “could have been slightly deranged” and admitted she would have struggled to get the story into the Sunday Times. She added that there is “no need for burden of proof on a colourful anecdote where we’re quite upfront about our own reservations about whether to take it seriously”. For her efforts Oakeshott was, despite some protestations from some Daily Mail reporters, briefly handed the title of Daily Mail political editor-at-large by the editor, Paul Dacre. Her earlier brush with infamy came when, as political editor of the Sunday Times, Oakeshott worked with the economist Vicky Pryce to undermine Pryce’s ex-husband Chris Huhne, who at the time was a Liberal Democrat cabinet minister. Oakeshott’s employers were ultimately ordered to hand over private email correspondence between Oakeshott and her source to the police. At a later trial Pryce and Huhne were found guilty of perverting the course of justice over a speeding offence and were both sent to jail."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2018/jun/11/brexit-tribes-commons-camps-eu-withdrawal-bill","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-11T15:17:00Z","webTitle":"Brexit tribes: how the Commons camps are likely to vote","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jun/11/brexit-tribes-commons-camps-eu-withdrawal-bill","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/jun/11/brexit-tribes-commons-camps-eu-withdrawal-bill","fields":{"headline":"Brexit tribes: how the Commons camps are likely to vote","bodyText":"The parliamentary arithmetic is tight ahead of crucial votes on the EU withdrawal bill. Government and opposition whips will need to keep track of a number of different groups in order to predict any unexpected upset. The Tory rebel alliance The Conservative rebels are close-knit, cemented by attacks from the rightwing press when they defeated the government to win parliament a meaningful vote on the final Brexit deal. The group, which includes Anna Soubry, Dominic Grieve and Sarah Wollaston, has kept its powder dry in recent days, mulling an offer by the government to put the meaningful vote in statute, though the government amendment removes any role for parliament over what happens if a deal is defeated. Rebels may vote for a customs union amendment too, but that is more likely to happen in a forthcoming bill. Ultimately, most in the group are loyal Tories who are unwilling to fatally undermine the prime minister. The hard Brexiters The hardline group of pro-Brexit Tories has been disciplined because they are determined to see the EU withdrawal bill pass, even if many of them have been alarmed by some other aspects of the Brexit negotiations in recent days. Jacob Rees-Mogg, who chairs the European Research Group of Eurosceptic Tory MPs, has urged colleagues to get behind the bill and hold fire criticising the prime minister or the negotiations until it has passed. The Downing Street emissaries A trio of former cabinet ministers – Amber Rudd, Justine Greening and Damian Green – have been reaching out to Tory colleagues over the past few weeks to urge party unity. Rudd has said the majority of the party want a “sensible Brexit” rather than an extreme on either side. Over the weekend, the former home secretary teamed up with Brexiter ex-cabinet colleague Iain Duncan Smith to write a comment article urging MPs to “demonstrate discipline and unity of purpose in support of the prime minister”. Green told the Mail on Sunday that “the whips can count” and that there was “an overwhelming desire of Conservative MPs to give Theresa the strongest hand at the European council meeting later this month.” The Tory loyalists No 10 has expended a lot of energy in recent weeks to try to keep the majority of the parliamentary party onside. Whips have met a number of wavering MPs and the whole parliamentary party was invited in groups to the Department for Exiting the EU to hear briefings on future customs plans. Theresa May addressed the entire party at a private meeting in parliament on Monday night, urging party unity, and the vast majority are likely to fall in line. Labour remain ultras Pro-remain Labour MPs are likely to rebel in significant numbers on a Lords amendment to keep the UK in a Norway-style EEA-arrangement. Many in that group, including former shadow cabinet ministers Chris Leslie, Ben Bradshaw and Chuka Umunna, are furious that the amendment will not be backed by the frontbench, seeing it as a squandered chance to defeat the government. The shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, has instead put down his own amendment that would commit the government to seek a deal giving the UK access to the EU internal market. Labour re-leavers Starmer’s main argument against backing the EEA amendment is the significant number of Labour MPs, many in seats that backed leave, are highly uncomfortable with it. Many MPs who initially backed remain, such as Caroline Flint, Kevan Jones and Jenny Chapman, have repeatedly said that Labour cannot be seen to back a deal that commits the UK to continue being subject to EU rules, including freedom of movement. They, and most of the rest of the parliamentary Labour party, are likely to vote with the Labour whip to abstain on the EEA amendment. Labour Brexiters There is a small but significant number of Labour Brexiters whose votes will be crucial. Leave-supporting MPs such as Graham Stringer and Dennis Skinner were persuaded in December to back the amendment on the parliamentary vote, helping to defeat the government. Labour whips argued that the amendment would not obstruct Brexit and would deliver a damaging blow to the Tories. The success of any amendment will depend on whether those MPs are convinced by that argument again. The remain rearguard Both the SNP and Liberal Democrat parties are firmly behind amendments that will deliver a softer Brexit, as are Plaid Cymru and the Green’s Caroline Lucas. Their votes will be crucial to the success of any amendment, but have probably already been taken for granted by the whips counting the numbers on either side."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/jun/14/adidas-nike-world-cup-who-wins","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-14T12:07:06Z","webTitle":"Adidas and Nike go head to head at the World Cup.

Who will win?","bodyText":"Adidas will celebrate 20 years as an official partner of Fifa on Thursday when the 2018 World Cup begins in Russia. The German outfitter has spent hundreds of millions of pounds — including between $96 million (£71.9m) and $176 million for this year’s tournament — for exclusive rights that include having its logo on match balls and referees’ uniforms. Spain, Argentina and the defending champions Germany are among the 12-team contingent that will wear the three stripes over the next month, the largest representation of any brand. But it is Adidas’s old foe Nike that could end up winning this year’s battle of the brands. Nike controls basketball and American football on its home soil and has chipped away at Adidas’s dominance in “soccer” for decades. Football has grown exponentially in the United States, and the Oregon-based group has adjusted its strategy to focus on a larger piece of the multibillion-pound global market. At recent World Cups, Adidas teams have dominated: in 2014 the company boasted both teams in the final when Germany beat Argentina, and over the past five tournaments three winners have lifted the trophy donning the Adidas logo. Adidas was founded almost 70 years ago by one of two brothers in the small German town of Herzogenaurach — the result of a bitter fallout that led the other brother to start the rival brand Puma. But Adidas’s success cannot be bought with history alone. Despite Adidas becoming an official Fifa partner in 1998, investors have regularly preferred Nike over Adidas. Even after one billion people watched the all-Adidas final in Brazil four years ago, Nike’s share price ballooned and beat Adidas’s by more than 30% in the three months after the tournament. Success from the World Cup comes at different times, according to Andreas Inderst, senior equity research analyst at Macquarie Group. Because Adidas is an official sponsor, its shirts are a main seller. “At the time of the World Cup it’s certainly the jersey business, because many supporters buy the jersey,” Inderst says. “If you go to Germany and watch, let’s say in Berlin with up to one million other people on giant screens, there will be lots of German national jerseys but also from the opponent. Of course you don’t go there with your football boots.” After the tournament ends and the new football season and school year start, Nike’s high volume of top athletes resonates with children and young adults looking to buy boots and other sport-inspired streetwear. Sports streetwear is nothing new but remains very strong and Inderst estimates that it makes up around 70% of the global athletic footwear market. Look around the workplace and you’ll likely see more and more trainers worn at the expense of traditional alternatives. Cristiano Ronaldo and Neymar are the faces of Nike’s football brand but the company has also stockpiled some of the game’s up-and-coming stars, notably Harry Kane and Raheem Sterling. In fact, 132 of the 200 most expensive players at the World Cup, as ranked by CIES Football Observatory, will wear Nike boots. Adidas will have 59. The groundwork Nike has done over the past decade has been smart, yet simple. While Adidas has given hundreds of millions to Fifa, Nike has ploughed its massive resources into growing the marketability of its athletes, primarily via social media, according to Mark Thompson, managing director of the sponsorship management software SponServe. Nielsen Sports’ 2018 World Football Report estimates that Ronaldo amassed more than half a billion engagements across Facebook, Twitter and Instagram between January and May. That’s more than 350 million more than Lionel Messi, Adidas’s top online influencer, who does not have a Twitter account. In terms of followers, Ronaldo has more than Beyoncé and LeBron James combined. Declaring a winner of the World Cup is difficult, even more so before a ball has been kicked. What we do know, though, is that Nike is serious about football and is a major threat to Adidas’s market lead. “Picking a winner or loser is almost impossible,” Thompson said. “That will be down to how well each brand’s marketing teams have planned and can maximise the value of their activations around this incredible event.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/jun/17/thomas-carr-seafood-and-grill-it-demands-to-be-liked-restaurant-review","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-17T04:59:05Z","webTitle":"Thomas Carr Seafood: 'It demands to be liked’ – restaurant review","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jun/17/thomas-carr-seafood-and-grill-it-demands-to-be-liked-restaurant-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jun/17/thomas-carr-seafood-and-grill-it-demands-to-be-liked-restaurant-review","fields":{"headline":"Thomas Carr Seafood and Grill, Devon: 'It demands to be liked’ – restaurant review","bodyText":"Thomas Carr Seafood and Grill, 59 High Street, Ilfracombe, North Devon EX34 9QB (01271 555 005).

During my lunch I am given rousing speeches about what they want the place to be when it grows up and what it isn’t quite yet. They tell us about the – dread words – “fine dining” restaurant they plan for upstairs, and the outside terrace out back of the lower ground level. But which they haven’t got around to yet. Because, you know, stuff. I can’t help but clock a touch of rising damp down the stairwell to that lower ground level. Unusually for me, I also can’t help giving a commentary on the state of the loos when I return from them. The late Anthony Bourdain once instructed us all to pay acute attention to the hygiene standards in the parts of restaurants you can see, because it’s a clue to the standards in the parts you can’t, but I’ve never been that porcelain-obsessed. Then again, rarely do I see anything like this, which turns me into some Victoria Wood character who wants to bellow: “Brenda, bring me the Marigolds. We’ve got a situation.” There are lots of ill-advised polished metal splashbacks and metal wall panelling which show up every man-drip. Everybody knows men’s toilets are a nightmare of drips and stains. And then there’s the menu, which even our cheery waitress says is a bit weird. It’s a medley of all the greatest hits they haven’t yet had. There’s a mention of chilli beef nachos, which sound like a refugee from a wipe-down menu, alongside something nerdy involving fennel-cured salmon, oyster cream and crispy salmon skin. The latter reads like they’ve been boning up on the menu at Copenhagen’s Noma from 2005. So I’m reading the signals and thinking that the effort it has taken me to get to Ilfracombe on the North Devon coast – a 100-minute drive from Exeter – has been wasted. The room doesn’t help. It’s a huge expanse of bar with a brutal tundra of bare floorboards. There are too few tables, all with mismatched chairs, some of them in a startling mustard yellow. Who looked at those and muttered: “Yes”? Still, they sent me an imploring email when they knew I was going to be doing an event in the area. Admittedly they wanted me to try the tasting menu at the Thomas Carr Olive Room on the other side of town, the mothership with its awards and stars, which the eponymous chef opened in 2015 after years cooking with Nathan Outlaw. However, they also mentioned the recent successful crowdfunding campaign they had undertaken to open this Seafood and Grill. They didn’t at any point mention it was going through a troubled adolescence and best to leave it alone until it grows up a bit and tidies its room. Plus, as I’ve said before, tasting menus make my palms itchy. Which means I’m here and, as ever, being hopeful. That hope is fully rewarded. There are some false starts. If you’re going to offer a lobster macaroni cheese, please don’t overcook the macaroni and don’t forget to be stupidly generous with the cheese. There aren’t many things to get right in mac and cheese. Those are two of them. Likewise, if you mention crispy salmon skin, it had better be so crisp it snaps obligingly between my fingers. These bend, sadly, but the lozenges of fennel-cured salmon they are perched upon are delightful: soft, the right side of oily, with a delicate cure which leaves just enough room for a little light fishiness. The oyster cream is a gentle intervention from the bivalve rather than an overwrought slap. It’s waving, not shouting. Prawns in garlic butter are all four of those words done right. The prawns are plump and so fresh they squeak and bounce beneath the teeth. They sit in a bubbling pond of salty molten dairy fat, silted up with chopped garlic, just begging for a bread intervention. They get it. It’s with the mains that everything really comes into focus. A pearly piece of hake rests in a deep shellfish bisque, given go-faster stripes courtesy of handfuls of lemongrass and ginger. It’s rare that a soup mounted with ladles of cream also feels invigorating and curiously healthy. Perched on top is a quenelle of the sweetest of sweet white crab meat. It’s one of those dishes that reminds you why you made the effort to come and eat this close to the sea, where the seafood is just that little bit brighter and friskier. Skate wing is dressed with brown butter, capers and crayfish, and is one of the best versions of this dish ever laid in front of me. I pull the strands of skate from the cartilage, enjoying the satisfying way the flesh slips from the wing, like it was waiting to be undressed. I shovel up some capers and nutty crayfish, and sigh. There are new potatoes to remind you that this is meant to be a balanced lunch, but all eyes are on that glorious skate. Desserts are hardly earth-shattering, but thoroughly serviceable. The long plank of chocolate brownie is big on squidge, has a pleasingly crisp surface and is joined on the plate by both a clotted-cream ice cream and a spiced, sugared ginger biscuit which snaps obligingly in the way the salmon skin didn’t. A crème brûlée is an extraordinary shade of yellow which almost matches those weird leather seats. If it was a classic version of the dish, I would be standing up and applauding. Unfortunately, they’ve decided to “improve” it through the addition of under-sweetened rhubarb, which is no improvement at all. As you can guess by now, I am going to let the rhubarb mistake slide, partly because of those other dishes (especially those two mains) and partly because whatever the idiosyncrasies of this place and its growing pains, it has a warm, beating heart. It demands to be liked. At lunchtime a starter and a main is just £18, which is a pound less than the à la carte price for that hake dish. Three courses are £24. The value is undeniable. If I were nearby, I would choose to eat here again without hesitation. Take that as a recommendation. News bites Another meal at Parson’s in Covent Garden confirms it’s a class act. Yes, it’s a seafood grill offering up whole fish to share, but the joy lies with the starters and sides: the peppery brown shrimp croquettes, the whipped cod’s roe, the salad of grilled baby gem, prawns and anchovies or the trout tartare with bloody mary jelly. You can put together a serious lunch just from those (parsonslondon.co.uk). The Ottolenghi group is launching a new restaurant in London’s Fitzrovia. Rovi, which will have a small takeaway operation as well as a sit-down restaurant, is majoring on grilled vegetables: the likes of braised and smoked carrots with puffed black barley and pickled herbs, hasselback kaffir lime beets with lime cream and kohlrabi ravioli. The sandwich chain Eat has found a new way to use up leftover bread. They are donating it to the eco-brewery Toast Ale, which replaces a third of the malted barley with bread that would otherwise be wasted. The first brew is now on sale, including at Eat’s five licensed branches (eat.co.uk).

Current guidelines in the UK and US recommend that children and teens undertake at least an hour of moderate or vigorous physical activity a day, with adults advised to aim for 150 minutes a week. However, a study from the US has found that more than 20% of adolescent girls and 12% of boys do no sports or recreational physical activity in a week, with just under 30% of men and almost 40% of women, aged 18-29, saying the same. Dr Charlene Wong, co-author of the research from Duke University in North Carolina, said the research could help to direct public health interventions, noting that the study suggests the focus should be on females, young adults and those from minority and low-income backgrounds. “Our black female young adults were the least likely to say they did any physical activity and those who did were active for the shortest amount of time,” she said. Writing in the journal Jama Pediatrics, Wong and colleagues describe how they pooled and analysed data from an annual nationwide health survey in the US, encompassing the years 2007 to 2016, focusing on responses from 9,472 individuals aged between 12 and 29. The survey, carried out through interviews, asked participants questions about their levels of physical activity relating to sports or recreational pursuits. While almost 88% of boys aged between 12 and 17 reported some moderate or vigorous exercise in a week, the figure fell to just under 73% for males aged 18 to 24, and to just below 71% for those aged 25 to 29. For females the proportion fell from just over 78% of adolescents to just over 61% for both of the older age groups. For those who did get their blood pumping, the amount of time spent exercising also fell with age, from just over 71 minutes a day for adolescent boys to just over 50 minutes for those aged 25 to 29. For girls, it fell from 56 minutes to just over 39 minutes a day respectively. White adolescent boys were the most likely to say they exercised in a week, with black males aged 18-24 reporting the longest duration of physical activity a day. Once factors including weight, education and income were taken into account, the team found race was linked to whether females reported any physical activity: in general, a larger proportion of white females said they exercised than black or Hispanic participants. The trend was less clear for males. Higher income was linked to reporting physical activity for females regardless of age, but the same only held true for adolescent boys and not young men, while young adults with a college education were more likely to report any exercise across both sexes. Weight had little impact on whether participants reported exercising. While it is not clear what is behind the trends, the authors say multiple factors might be at play including issues around body image, social norms for exercise being different between the sexes, less scheduled activity after leaving school and growing pressures of working life. But the study had limitations, including that activity such as walking to work was not included, it was not considered whether participants had children, or were pregnant, and the authors admit that self-reported data can lead to an over-estimation of activity. Dr Gavin Sandercock, an expert in child activity and fitness from the University of Essex who was not involved in the study, said the findings mirror certain trends seen in the UK, including that females exercise less than males and that physical activity drops across both sexes with age. While he noted there are already some campaigns aimed at encouraging girls and women to exercise, including This Girl Can, he said it was also important to help individuals of both sexes from lower income groups to become physically active. “We know that if you get children more active, as well as getting more physically healthy, they get happier and their educational attainment improves,” he said. Joan Duda, professor of sport and exercise psychology at the University of Birmingham, said offering a choice of activities and cultivating a sense of empowerment is key: “We need to do more to promote participation in physical activity in the case of adolescent females, and males, not just taking it up or giving a particular activity ‘a go’ but also how to sustain quality engagement,” she said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/booksblog/2018/jun/12/class-sex-and-war-how-rebecca-west-dismantled-edwardian-ideals","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-12T12:26:01Z","webTitle":"Class, sex and war: how Rebecca West dismantled Edwardian ideals","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2018/jun/12/class-sex-and-war-how-rebecca-west-dismantled-edwardian-ideals","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/booksblog/2018/jun/12/class-sex-and-war-how-rebecca-west-dismantled-edwardian-ideals","fields":{"headline":"Class, sex and war: how Rebecca West dismantled Edwardian ideals","bodyText":"The Return of the Soldier sounds like a novel at odds with its society. Rebecca West’s ideas about the hell of war and the iniquities of the class system, combined with her progressive sexual politics, set the then 24-year-old against the Edwardian establishment when it was first published in 1918. But you wouldn’t guess West was going to unleash a modernist firestorm from the first few quiet and genteel pages. There’s an emotional wrench on the very first page when we realise that the setting is the nursery of a dead child – but otherwise the writing is slow, calm and ornate. Take this early description of Baldry Court, the house to which the titular soldier, Chris Baldry, must soon return: “The house lies on the crest of Harrowweald, and from its windows the eye drops to miles of emerald pasture-land lying wet and brilliant under a westward line of sleek hills, blue with distance and distant woods, while nearer it range the suave decorum of the lawn and the Lebanon cedar, the branches of which are like darkness made palpable, and the minatory gauntnesses of the topmost pines in the wood that breaks downward, its bare boughs a close texture of browns and purples, from the pond on the edge of the hill.” This prose feels as richly decorated as the house itself, garlanded with sub-clauses, well-chosen adjectives and carefully sculpted metaphors. It feels right for the setting, the era and – most importantly – the inside of the narrator’s mind. Jenny presents herself as orderly, decorous and careful. A woman who has dedicated herself not only to helping to maintain the comfort of her cousin Chris and his wife Kitty, but also to helping to ensure the world sees them as “gracious”. A woman who has definite ideas about good taste, style and class – and how to represent them. In the early pages, it’s almost possible to believe two things; that Jenny is so wonderful, and that this rich prose represents the book’s highest pinnacle. It might be sophisticated and wordy, but it is also light, clear and enjoyable to read. But it doesn’t take long before we are made to wonder what might be hidden behind this bright edifice of both Jenny and the book. We get hints of something darker when Jenny talks about her dreams of Chris running across the “brown rottenness of No Man’s Land”. And sharp black cracks begin to show when Chris’s first love, Margaret, stumbles on to the scene and threatens the sanctity of Baldry Court. The sentences remain ornate, but the vocabulary takes on a rougher hew. Now Jenny talks as much about repulsion and ugliness as grace and beauty. Metaphors become bestial: “There was no doubt in my mind but that this queer ugly episode, in which this woman butted like a clumsy animal at a gate she was not intelligent enough to open, would dissolve and be replaced by a more pleasing composition in which we would take our proper parts; in which, that is, she should turn from our rightness ashamed.” West’s embellished Edwardian prose increasingly serves as an example of the contradictions, tensions and limitations of Jenny’s world view. The suspicion dawns that this could be West presenting a satire on ideals of good writing, in the same way that Baldry Court begins to feel over-manicured and absurd. The main prompt for our new understanding of Baldry Court comes when the damaged Chris arrives on the scene and reacts strongly against all the supposedly tasteful renovations Kitty and Jenny have made to his old home. We start to realise that the place might actually be confining. Similarly, Jenny’s mode of expression seems increasingly at odds with her story; all the things she can’t control begin to undermine her careful presentation. It becomes ever more notable that the majority of the dialogue in the book is expressed in short, blunt sentences, often unfinished and uncertain. They butt against the framework of Jenny’s narration as awkwardly as that “clumsy animal” in her metaphor. As the book progresses, the sentence formation also becomes a way of measuring Jenny’s confused state of mind. The style remains recognisable from those languid opening pages, but it is increasingly fractured and abrupt. Late on, we get another description of the garden, and while it echoes what has come before it is just as notable for its differences: “There was nothing in the garden; only a column of birds swinging across the lake of green light that lay before the sunset … There had fallen a twilight which was a wistfulness of the earth.” Jenny’s still got that high register – but now she is breathless and racing through the visuals, eager to get back to the main action. (In fact, she only gives this description because Kitty forces her to “look” towards the garden.) And when that action comes, the prose is more staccato and disrupted than ever. As Chris is restored to “reality”, and Baldry Court is rendered a foolish dream, those polished Edwardian sentences have given way to something new: “When we had lifted the yoke of our embraces from his shoulders he would go back to that flooded trench in Flanders, under that sky more full of flying death than clouds, to that No Man’s Land where bullets fall like rain on the rotting faces of the dead …” The thought is left unfinished. You can almost feel the fragmentary uncertainty of modernism emerging. In her prose as well as her ideas, West pointed the way to the future."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"business/2018/jun/11/uk-manufacturing-largest-monthly-fall-in-output-for-five-years","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-11T11:54:50Z","webTitle":"UK manufacturing has largest monthly fall in output for five years","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jun/11/uk-manufacturing-largest-monthly-fall-in-output-for-five-years","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/jun/11/uk-manufacturing-largest-monthly-fall-in-output-for-five-years","fields":{"headline":"UK manufacturing has largest monthly fall in output for five years","bodyText":"Britain’s factories unexpectedly recorded the sharpest fall in output for more than five years in April amid falling demand for steel and electrical machinery, raising fresh concern over the strength of the economy. Pointing to fewer orders for steel used in infrastructure projects and a wider slowdown in demand for British goods at home and abroad, the Office for National Statistics said manufacturing output fell by 1.4% in April from the previous month. Economists had forecast modest growth of 0.3%. The figures will trouble ministers at a time of growing concerns for the UK steel industry, which faces pressure from US import tariffs that could rekindle the crisis of two years ago, when a glut of Chinese imports threatened to bankrupt British producers. Overall industrial output – which includes manufacturing, utilities and mining – dropped in April by 0.8% compared with the previous month, led by the fall in factory production and similar declines for energy supply and water usage. The figures were released as the National Institute of Economic and Social Research forecast only a modest rebound for growth in the three months to the end of May, predicting a rise in GDP of 0.2% during the period, up from a rate of 0.1% in the three months to the end of April. Amit Kara, Niesr’s head of UK macroeconomic forecasting, spoke of risks to the economy from Brexit and escalating trade tensions, saying: “Economic growth has slowed materially since the start of this year and it continues to remain weak.” Union leaders seized on the manufacturing figures to criticise the government for its stance on Brexit and not doing enough to support businesses amid the mounting trade tensions with the US. Labour and business groups have attacked ministers for mishandling the industrial strategy, pointing to a lack of progress made since it was launched in the autumn. Jude Brimble, the national secretary of the GMB union, said: “Between Trump wanting to slap tariffs on our steel and the UK government refusing to be in a European customs union, UK manufacturing risks being stranded.” There was a slight monthly pick-up for construction industry output in April as builders staged a recovery from the heavy snowfall in March. Yet the ONS said the three months to April remained the worst period for the trade since August 2012. The figures will renew fears the slowdown for the British economy in the first three months of the year was not just a one-off, adding to problems that could deter the Bank of England from raising interest rates in August. “Given how sharp the fall was, it’s easy to try to pin it down to some kind of temporary aberration. But that doesn’t appear to be the case,” James Smith, an economist at ING Bank, said. “Remember, too, that April was supposed to be the month where production rebounded following the snow-related disruptions seen in March.” The latest figures also showed the UK’s trade position with the rest of the world deteriorated further in April. Britain’s trade in goods deficit, which is the difference between products sold abroad and imported to the UK, unexpectedly widened by about £2bn to reach £14bn – the biggest monthly gap since September 2016. Suren Thiru, the head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce, said a sweet spot for exporters could be reaching an end. “The possibility of an escalating trade war has added to the downside risks for exporters,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/jun/23/killing-eve-the-good-fight-bim-adewunmi","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-23T04:59:01Z","webTitle":"From Killing Eve to The Good Fight, I love to see a woman win | Bim Adewunmi","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jun/23/killing-eve-the-good-fight-bim-adewunmi","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jun/23/killing-eve-the-good-fight-bim-adewunmi","fields":{"headline":"From Killing Eve to The Good Fight, I love to see a woman win","bodyText":"For whatever reason, I have been consuming a lot of women’s stories recently. Poetry, theatre, film, TV, the visual arts – it doesn’t matter what the medium is, I just want to climb in and stay there. Finding the sweet spot in a woman’s life, when something vital is suddenly unlocked and she steps more fully into herself, is a treat for me. A very simple person might argue that my lust for such stories is directly traceable to the state of the world. When everything feels on fire, why not seek out the not-so-gentle serenity of an episode of Killing Eve? I see Villanelle’s (Jodie Comer) eyes glinting wildly when she is cornered in Killing Eve, and say out loud, “Oh no – she can’t die!” Sometimes, you just want to see a woman win, even a fictional unhinged assassin. (Luke Jennings’ Villanelle books are adapted by Phoebe Waller-Bridge.) It’s not soothing, exactly; it just gives me a rush. That’s how badly bruised the news cycle has left me. The flip of my current television coin reveals another, rather different heroine. In The Good Fight, Diane Lockhart (Christine Baranski) is brilliant, and only metaphorically kills – in the courtroom and via impeccably tasteful brooches and necklaces. Lockhart has been successful for a long time, but there is a newness with which she faces the world. She and Villanelle are very good at their jobs, and in every episode they take knocks but largely bounce back. One series takes place amid the heightened reality of espionage, the other in a Chicago law firm. Both are essentially dark fairytales. Perhaps the happy ending is making a comeback – and in 2018, I need to believe."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"world/2018/jun/11/italy-coalition-collision-course-eu-migration-standoff-matteo-salvini","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-11T14:23:57Z","webTitle":"Italy's coalition on collision course with EU after migration standoff","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/11/italy-coalition-collision-course-eu-migration-standoff-matteo-salvini","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/11/italy-coalition-collision-course-eu-migration-standoff-matteo-salvini","fields":{"headline":"Italy's coalition on collision course with EU after migration standoff","bodyText":"International concern about Italy’s new populist government has mostly focused on the challenge its plans for huge tax cuts and spending hikes might pose to the EU’s budget rules, and the risk it might even leave the euro altogether. But the refusal by the interior minister, Matteo Salvini, this weekend to allow the Aquarius rescue ship carrying 629 migrants to dock in any Italian port makes it clear that the country’s first big clash with the bloc will not be over the common currency, but migration. The Italian finance minister, Giovanni Tria, sought this weekend to reassure investors and EU officials, saying the coalition of the anti-establishment Five Star Movement and far-right League intended to stay in the euro and would “avoid creating the market conditions” for an involuntary exit. Matteo Salvini, the new interior minister and leader of the far-right League, was less emollient. “France pushes people back at the border, Spain defends its frontier with weapons,” he said, announcing that Italy’s ports were closed to the Aquarius. “From today, Italy is also starting to say no to human trafficking, no to the business of illegal immigration,” Salvini – who campaigned on a pledge to round up and deport 500,000 migrants living illegally in Italy – added. His intransigence, the first real evidence of the new government’s promised hardline stance, risks precipitating a full-blown crisis over EU asylum reforms, which the bloc has been trying to overhaul without success for the past two years. Talks in Luxembourg aimed at establishing refugee quotas and a common system for member states to share responsibility for asylum-seekers ended in deadlock last week, with ministers pessimistic that any agreement can be reached by their self-imposed deadline of the next Brussels summit at the end of this month. Salvini, who declared last week that he would not allow Italy to become “Europe’s refugee camp”, did not attend the meeting and has already dismissed the latest EU proposals as not doing enough to help Italy. In an unusually outspoken intervention, Angela Merkel warned of the consequences of failing to reach an accord. “If we are unable to come up with a common response to the migration challenges, the very foundations of the EU will be at stake,” the German chancellor said. “Action is really needed.” Belgium’s minister for asylum and migration, Theo Francken, said Europe “will end” unless member states could agree a joint approach. “At the moment, there is totally no consensus,” he said last week. With xenophobia on the rise across the continent and hard-right, anti-immigration parties either in government or riding high in the polls in countries as diverse as Italy, Hungary, Germany, Poland, Austria and Sweden, immigration has become an issue of existential importance for the bloc. Member states remain hopelessly divided over burden-sharing plans proposed by Brussels intended to ward off any repeat of the 2015-16 migration crisis. Under current rules, refugees must claim asylum in the country in which they first enter the bloc – leaving so-called frontline states like Italy, Greece and Spain complaining, justifiably, that they are shouldering an unfair share of new arrivals. Wealthier destination countries like Germany, France and the Netherlands, meanwhile, argue they are already hosting enough people who have moved northward, and hardline central European nations including Hungary and Poland have rejected out of hand all refugee quota schemes. Faced with deadlock, Europe’s capitals are exploring alternatives. Germany has announced unilateral plans to tighten its asylum system. Austria has promised a “revolution” – abandoning quotas, tightening external border controls, and processing asylum claims outside the bloc – if no consensus can be found. The coalition government in Vienna – which includes the far-right Freedom party – is also working informally with Denmark and the Netherlands on controversial plans to set up camps for rejected asylum seekers in countries outside the EU. As fears mount that migrant flows – down sharply since 2016 after deals were struck with Turkey and Libya – may be about to rise once more, an EU-wide consensus was already looking difficult to achieve. Salvini’s intervention is unlikely to make it any easier. • This article was amended on 12 June 2018 because Theo Francken is Belgium’s minister for asylum and migration, not interior minister as an earlier version said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2018/jun/11/rolls-royce-engine-problems-job-cuts-boeing-787","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-11T09:41:23Z","webTitle":"Rolls-Royce faces more engine problems as it plans job cuts","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jun/11/rolls-royce-engine-problems-job-cuts-boeing-787","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/jun/11/rolls-royce-engine-problems-job-cuts-boeing-787","fields":{"headline":"Rolls-Royce faces more engine problems as it plans job cuts","bodyText":"Rolls-Royce has discovered new problems with its troubled Trent 1000 engines, which power Boeing’s 787 Dreamliner aircraft, triggering fresh safety fears and potential disruption for airlines including British Airways and Norwegian. The aircraft engine maker said a problem affecting compressor durability had been found in another type of Trent 1000 engines and would require inspections of its 166 “package B” engines, some of which have been in service since 2012. The problem means parts wear out faster than expected. Rolls-Royce has been trying to fix durability faults with “package C” versions of the engine. Some aircraft powered by Trent 1000 engines have been grounded, leading to flight cancellations and forcing airlines such as Virgin Atlantic to lease other aircraft. The company warned that fixing the latest problem will result in additional costs, although it is still expecting to generate about £450m in cash this year. It is cutting jobs and reducing non-essential spending on travel and IT upgrades to offset the impact of the engine faults. The Rolls-Royce chief executive. Warren East. is expected to announce a shake-up of the business, including more than 4,000 job losses, on Friday, when the company holds an investor day in London. The firm has indicated that it is cutting middle-management posts rather than frontline engineering jobs, without putting a number on the planned redundancies. Some analysts have pencilled in a reduction of up to 10% of Rolls-Royce’s 50,000 workforce. Rolls-Royce had initially put the cost of fixing the “package C” engines at £370m but indicated in April that figure would rise with the cost of replacing more parts and paying airlines compensation. Analysts have put the bill at up to £1bn. Chris Cholerton, the Rolls-Royce president of civil aerospace, said: “We are working closely with our customers to minimise any operational impact of these inspections and we deeply appreciate their continued co-operation. We remain absolutely committed to eliminating this issue from the Trent 1000 fleet.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2018/jun/13/weatherwatch-mauvoisin-disaster-triggered-scientific-interest-in-glaciers","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-13T20:30:27Z","webTitle":"Weatherwatch: Mauvoisin disaster triggered scientific interest in glaciers","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jun/13/weatherwatch-mauvoisin-disaster-triggered-scientific-interest-in-glaciers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/jun/13/weatherwatch-mauvoisin-disaster-triggered-scientific-interest-in-glaciers","fields":{"headline":"Weatherwatch: Mauvoisin disaster triggered scientific interest in glaciers","bodyText":"In June 1818, ice falling from the tongue of the Giétro glacier had in effect blocked the valley of Mauvoisin in Switzerland. Water was building up behind this ice dam to dangerous levels, and engineers were called in to release it gradually. They drilled a hole through the ice, but it did not relieve the water pressure quickly enough. On 16 June at 4.30pm the ice dam burst, disintegrating and releasing all the water at once. The result was a catastrophic “glacial lake outburst flood”, a phenomenon characterised by extremely high rates of water flow. Warnings did not travel as fast as the sudden rush of 20m cubic metres (4.4bn gallons) of water, which swept away bridges and buildings in its path, killing 44 people and many animals. The event produced a new awareness of this hazard, and today the valley waters are safely contained by the giant Mauvoisin dam. The flood also triggered a new scientific interest in glaciers. Scientists visiting the site found boulders left by previous glacial activity, suggesting that, contrary to their belief, glaciers were not static, but advanced and retreated over time.

For those not familiar with it - despite the name, it’s actually an 89 km (approximately 55 miles) race that just happens to be the oldest and largest ultra marathon. The course runs between Durban and Pietermaritzburg in South Africa, and alternates each year between the ‘up’ and ‘down’ routes. It’s also, by the by, the only ultramarathon that really tempts me. I knew that Steve Way, 2014 Commonwealth games marathoner, all round top guy and amazing runner, had been training hard for it all year, after a fantastic top ten finish in 2017, his race debut. It’s traditionally dominated (at least in recent years) by South African runners - indeed last year Steve was the first non-SA finisher. So when I checked in and saw that with 30k to go, he was in 11th place, I thought “Ah, that’ll end up top ten for sure”. With 21k to go, he was up to 8th. “Excellent”, I thought. “Even better than last year!” I should have had more faith. During that last 21k he worked - no, stormed - his way through the field to finish in third - the highest place finish for a male British runner since 1972. His average - and for that matter stunningly consistent - pace for those 55 miles? 3:44min/km. That’s pretty much spot on 6 minute miles. For FIFTY FIVE miles. That’s my 5k race pace, for heaven’s sake! Simply preposterous. So this morning, let’s all doff our caps, and send absurd amounts of virtual cake and beer, to Steve, and also to another British runner, Carla Molinaro who finished 9th woman, averaging 4:34/km. And now to your stories.

Appearing on stage at New York’s Radio City Music Hall, De Niro declared: “I’m gonna say one thing. Fuck Trump.” As the applauding audience rose to their feet, De Niro continued: “It’s no longer down with Trump. It’s fuck Trump.” He then continued with an apparently prepared introduction of Bruce Springsteen. Although the show was broadcast as-live, CBS had time to bleep out the f-word for TV audiences, thought to number around six million. De Niro has long been a vociferous critic of Donald Trump. After calling him “totally nuts” in August 2016, the actor released a video during the election campaign stating his desire to punch Trump in the face, and calling him “an idiot, a national disaster, an embarrassment to this country … this fool, this bozo”. Following Trump’s election, De Niro told Jimmy Kimmel he would restrain himself from physical violence and said he would try to remain circumspect and supportive of the office of the presidency. “I just have to see what he’s going to do and how he’s going to follow through on certain things,” he said. However, Trump’s tenure does not appear to have impressed De Niro. In May 2017, he criticised the president’s immigration policy at a Lincoln Center gala, and just over a year ago, he hit out again in a speech at Brown University, calling America under the current administration a “tragic, dumbass comedy” and urging students to “work for the change. Work to stop the insanity.” Last month, it was reported that De Niro had banned the president from his Nobu chain of restaurants. However, this was later denied by a representative for the actor and disputed by co-owner Nobuyuki “Nobu” Matsuhisa, who said: “It’s my dream for Trump to sit next to Bob. To make them sushi!” Musical The Band’s Visit was the major winner at the Tony’s, picking up 10 awards. The Broadway transfer of Harry Potter and the Cursed Child took seven awards, including best play, while Glenda Jackson won best actress in a play for her role in Three Tall Women and Andrew Garfield was named best actor in a play for his role in Angels in America."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"business/2018/jun/11/poundworld-administration-jobs-high-street","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-11T11:33:24Z","webTitle":"Poundworld falls into administration, putting 5,000 jobs at risk","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jun/11/poundworld-administration-jobs-high-street","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/jun/11/poundworld-administration-jobs-high-street","fields":{"headline":"Poundworld falls into administration, putting 5,000 jobs at risk","bodyText":"Poundworld has collapsed into administration, putting more than 5,000 jobs at risk, after rescue talks failed over the weekend. It is the latest blow for Britain’s struggling high streets, where a string of retailers and restaurants have shrunk or collapsed due to rising costs and a consumer spending squeeze. Poundworld, which has 335 shops, filed a notice of intention to appoint an administrator last Thursday, giving it temporary protection from its creditors. Deloitte, which was appointed as administrator on Friday, said Poundworld would trade as usual while it sought a buyer for all or part of the business, adding that no redundancies or store closures were planned. At Poundworld in Hyde, in Tameside, Greater Manchester, shoppers were dismayed to hear of the chain’s demise. “What a shame,” said Sylvia Andrew, 61, who had just paid a pound for a dummy security camera to protect her hen house. “If someone comes to nick my chickens they’re not to know it’s not real. If you put two AA batteries in a light flashes,” she said. Currently signed off sick, she counts every penny: “At Poundworld you get two Pears soaps for £1. It’s £1.50 at the supermarket,” she said. Joanne Betts, 48, a carer, had just bought four packets of glow sticks for £1 each and some bin bags. She said: “I didn’t think a place like this would close. I’m in every week buying things I don’t need.” Inside, shoppers could spend a pound on anything from flip-flops to rat poison or packets of Aunt Bessie’s Yorkshire pudding mix. One of Poundworld’s problems may have been its competitors. Next door to its Hyde store is Bodyworks, a discount cosmetics outlet. Next to that is B&amp;M Bargains, a northern chain that recently announced plans to open 45 stores in southern England. Add to that the Quality Save in the precinct, the Iceland in the shopping centre carpark and a branch of Jack Fulton, the Yorkshire frozen food retaile , and it’s clear bargain hunters are spoiled for choice. Deloitte said Poundworld had struggled in an increasingly competitive market for discount goods, but also blamed “high product-cost inflation, decreasing footfall [and] weaker consumer confidence”. Two potential rescue buyouts have fallen through, with the private equity firms Rcapital and Alteri Partners both walking away after talks with Poundworld’s owners, TPG Capital, a US private equity firm. Chris Edwards, who founded the business in Wakefield, Yorkshire, in 1974 before selling it to TPG for £150m, is also thought to have been interested in buying back the business. Deloitte’s joint administrator, Clare Boardman, said: “The retail trading environment in the UK remains extremely challenging and Poundworld has been seeking to address this through a restructure of its business. “Unfortunately, this has not been possible. We still believe a buyer can be found for the business, or at least part of it, and we are keeping staff appraised of developments as they happen. We thank all employees for their support at this difficult time. A TPG spokesperson said: “This was a difficult decision for every party involved. We invested in Poundworld because of our belief in how the company serves its customers and the strength of its employees. “Despite investing resources to strengthen the business, the decline in UK retail and changing consumer behaviour affected Poundworld significantly.” The retail analyst Nick Bubb said the relative health of Poundworld’s rival Poundland, despite a crowded marketplace for discount retailers, indicated the business had been poorly managed. “Poundland is doing OK, despite the general pressure on the high street pound chains from the growth of B&amp;M and Home Bargains in food and toiletries and the growth of Aldi and Lidl,” he said. “So it must be down to management, and I suspect Poundworld lost a lot of momentum when the founder, Chris Edwards, stepped back from the business.” The demise of Poundworld follows the collapse into administration this year of the electronics firm Maplin and Toys R Us. The high street has also been rocked by a succession of retailers and restaurant chains announcing plans to shut stores amid tougher trading conditions. House of Fraser announced plans last week to close 31 stores, putting a further 6,000 jobs at risk. Mothercare, New Look and Carpetright are closing dozens of outlets after creditors approved company voluntary arrangements (CVAs), insolvency procedures that enable them to reduce rents and shut shops. Restaurants including Prezzo, the burger chain Byron and Jamie’s Italian have also closed outlets using the process. Poundworld’s problems surfaced in April when its owner was said to be considering launching a CVA, affecting about 100 stores."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2018/jun/11/history-of-us-north-korea-deals-singapore-summit","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-11T09:45:27Z","webTitle":"History of US-North Korea deals shows hard part is making them stick","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jun/11/history-of-us-north-korea-deals-singapore-summit","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/jun/11/history-of-us-north-korea-deals-singapore-summit","fields":{"headline":"History of US-North Korea deals shows hard part is making them stick","bodyText":"It is Donald Trump’s recurring boast that with the Singapore summit with Kim Jong-un, he has succeeded in negotiations with North Korea where his predecessors failed. But the claim obscures a long history of agreements made and broken by both countries. The lesson of two major deals, in 1994 and 2005, is that it is much easier to reach agreements than to implement them. In fact, the complex, fraught process of implementation has usually brought with it new flashpoints and new crises. Trump’s looming Singapore summit with Kim will be the first meeting between US and North Korean leaders, but that is largely because previous US presidents have balked at giving the Pyongyang regime such recognition and prestige without substantive progress towards disarmament. Each time a deal has been close, the same basic bargain has been on the table: that North Korea relinquish its nuclear arsenal in return for a mix of security and economic incentives. In 1992 – the first time the US and North Korea engaged diplomatically since the 1953 armistice – the Pyongyang regime faced similar isolation and intense economic pressure as it does today. The collapse of the Soviet Union robbed the regime of a steadfast ally and patron. Meanwhile, Beijing was telling North Korea to undergo the same transformative economic reforms as China. Kim’s grandfather, Kim Il-sung, was facing an existential threat. Then, like now, rapprochement between North and South Korea created a diplomatic opening for the US. In January 1992, the two Koreas signed an agreement on the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula. That led to meetings between American and North Korean diplomats at the US mission to the United Nations in New York, where the two delegations eyed each other warily after three decades of silence. The first thing that struck Robert Gallucci, who became chief US negotiator in 1993, was his counterparts’ identical lapel badges portraying the Great Leader. “I tried to imagine us sitting there with lapel pictures of Bill Clinton and I just couldn’t,” he recalled. The first two years of US engagement with North Korea were highly volatile, in which diplomatic breakthroughs were interspersed by dangerous crises. North Korea made an agreement in January 1992 with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to allow its nuclear complex at Yongbyon to be inspected, and at the same time the US called off its joint military exercises with South Korea. The consequent mood of optimism was short-lived. The arrival of the IAEA inspectors led rapidly to a conflict on how much of the Yongbyon nuclear plant they could see. The escalation culminated in the North Koreans unloading spent fuel roads from the Yongbyon reactor, a necessary precursor to extracting plutonium. The Clinton administration started reviewing plans for air strikes to stop them and the two sides came close to war. Just before Washington got to the point of ordering the evacuation of US nationals from the peninsula, the former president Jimmy Carter stepped in. He flew to Pyongyang for a personal meeting with Kim Il-sung, putting the diplomacy back on track and providing the impetus for the first major accord between the two countries, the 1994 Agreed Framework. According to the deal, North Korea would dismantle its reactor at Yongbyon, the source of its plutonium, in return for two civilian light water nuclear power stations, generally seen as less of a proliferation risk. Until those reactors were built, North Korea would receive shipments of US-financed fuel oil. The deal was sealed in Geneva and the North Koreans invited the US negotiators to their mission to toast its success. One of the US diplomats, Joel Wit, was on the point of downing his shot when he spotted snakes at the bottom of the bottle. It was snake liquor, popular across east Asia for special occasions. “Snake liquor really does smell like there has been a dead animal in the bottle, because there is,” Wit said. “I didn’t drink it, and as I turned around to put the glass down on the table I noticed that all the other Americans put theirs away. I’m not sure if the North Koreans noticed.” From such tentative beginnings, the Agreed Framework would last nearly nine years, but its implementation would be a constant struggle. A Republican-dominated Congress did its best to slow down fuel deliveries, and the construction timetable for the reactors was continually postponed. It later emerged that North Korea had been cheating by pursuing a secret uranium route to making a bomb. That was enough for the hawks in the Bush administration, John Bolton among them, to kill off the Agreed Framework. The accord’s defenders suggest that the uranium enrichment programme was the regime’s hedge against the US reneging on the deal, and it could have been closed down through negotiations. They also argue that the Agreed Framework held back the weapons programme for most of the 1990s. Christopher Hill, who became the Bush administration’s chief negotiator with North Korea, disagreed with the decision to end the Agreed Framework. “My own view is we lost control of the plutonium process, we lost inspectors on the ground. We lost the capacity to understand what was going on there,” Hill said. After a break in contact of more than two years, Hill was given the task of re-establishing contacts with the North Koreans under the format of multilateral, six-party talks. Those negotiations eventually led to a 2005 joint statement of principles to guide future negotiations, which included some of the elements of the Agreed Framework, such as the eventual provision of light water reactors, and a lot of language that will be on the table in Tuesday’s talks between Trump and Kim. The statement called for “the verifiable denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula … in a phased manner in line with the principle of ‘commitment for commitment, action for action.’” The joint statement once more raised hopes that the US and North Korea had turned a corner in their relationship, but it began to fall apart almost immediately. Within weeks, the US Treasury imposed new sanctions, freezing $23m (£17m) in North Korean assets in a bank in the Chinese territory of Macau, using counter-terror legislation. It was a relatively small amount of money, but it infuriated the North Koreans and the Chinese, who saw it as a violation of the spirit of the joint statement. US diplomats who had negotiated the 2005 statement were also taken by surprise. “I think it’s fair to say that one part of the US government was not particularly in touch with another part of US government, not for the first or last time,” said Hill, who saw it as an act of sabotage by hawks such as Bolton in the Bush administration. “I think the real purpose of it was to screw up the negotiations.” As relations spiralled downwards, North Korea tested seven ballistic missiles in July 2006, and conducted its first nuclear test in October the same year. The US ended up refunding North Korea the money it had frozen in Macau, and provided shipments of fuel oil, and in return the regime closed down its Yongbyon reactor and provided a partial inventory of its nuclear programme. But the six-party talks became bogged down in the question of verification. As before, North Korea was prepared to allow inspectors in but sought to limit what they could see. Kim Jong-un has struck one deal with the US, in February 2012. Under the Leap Year agreement, the regime undertook once more to suspend enrichment in Yongbyon under IAEA verification and to suspend nuclear and missile testing, in exchange, the Obama administration pledged to send food aid. Once more, the deal fell apart within weeks when North Korea conducted missile launches, which it insisted were for satellite deployment. The US deemed them a breach of the Leap Year agreement and halted plans to send food aid. Through three generations of the Kim dynasty, and successive US administrations, the biggest obstacle has not been reaching an agreement but making it stick. This has not only been a result of North Korea seeking to circumvent deals it has made, but a recurrent problem of US administrations sending conflicting signals, as different factions vie for control of policymaking. Whatever form of words Trump and Kim Jong-un agree on Tuesday, the history of US negotiations with North Korea suggest an agreement on paper is just the start, not the end, of any effort to achieve a real compromise."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/jun/09/gareth-southgate-wants-young-hungry-england-to-dream-of-winning-world-cup","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-09T22:51:00Z","webTitle":"Gareth Southgate wants young, hungry England to dream of winning World Cup","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jun/09/gareth-southgate-wants-young-hungry-england-to-dream-of-winning-world-cup","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/jun/09/gareth-southgate-wants-young-hungry-england-to-dream-of-winning-world-cup","fields":{"headline":"Gareth Southgate wants young, hungry England to dream of winning World Cup","bodyText":"Gareth Southgate is encouraging his young players to believe they can win the World Cup and create a fresh narrative for an England team that for so long has buckled under the weight of expectation at major tournaments. The manager was encouraged to hear Dele Alli and others publicly state their belief that England are capable of reaching the final in Moscow against the odds – and even winning it. “Why would I limit what they feel is possible?” Southgate said. “My job is to allow people to dream. Make the impossible seem possible. None of us are going to get excited or get out of bed just for getting out of the group. They are at an age and have hunger, enthusiasm and no little quality so they can certainly keep improving. “We have got to improve to reach the latter stages of a tournament and that is going to take a lot of work over the next few weeks and a huge commitment. But I am seeing evidence that they’re embracing that challenge.” England are not only one of the youngest in the tournament – only France and Nigeria have younger squads – they have the fewest caps of any squad. The average number of England appearances is 20 compared with 34 per player across all the squads. Southgate acknowledged concerns about a lack of experience but claimed it was outweighed by the benefits. “That’s allowing us to create an environment where they’re actually having a go at things we’re asking them to do,” he said. “Sometimes I think: ‘They’re never going to go for this.’ They’re at times painstakingly putting up with some of the things I throw their way so, that I think, would be more difficult with older players. “They’d possibly be a little less malleable and a little less open to new suggestions, but they really are having a go at everything and they are keen to show people how much it means to them to play for England.” If optimism and openness alone could win games, England would breeze through the group stage on the basis of their performances in front of the media in the past week. The manager praised Danny Rose for speaking publicly about his battle with depression. He has encouraged the squad to tell their backstories to each other to improve cohesion on the pitch but also to improve the public image of the team. “We’re asking them to open up quite a bit on their own feelings about things,” Southgate said. “We’ve discussed the possible situation over racism, which was certainly an important connection between the team. It’s not a comfortable space for us to be at times but it helps to build a togetherness. You get a closer connection. “We’ve spoken at length this week about how we’re really proud to represent everybody but really the guy next to you is the most important one going into this tournament. You’ve got to be there for him, you’ve got to support him, you’ve got to be available when he needs to pass the ball to you and you’ve got to be covering his back if he slips or makes a mistake and that’s what we want to engender.” The 47-year-old urged his side to forget about the past and make history in Russia. He has discussed with his players comments made by Rio Ferdinand, Frank Lampard and Steven Gerrard about bitter inter‑club rivalries destroying the spirit within England camps at previous tournaments. “We have listened to compelling interviews from Rio and Frank and Steven and we’ve used those to say we’ve got to make sure we put those club situations to one side but I don’t think there is that intense rivalry at the moment between our top clubs that there was then,” he said. “The past can help us and inform us but it shouldn’t shape us and we’ve got to be our own team. “This is a diverse team with different sets of skills and they’ve got a chance to make their own history. Whenever you’re in an England shirt you have an opportunity to make history.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"crosswords/everyman/3740","type":"crossword","sectionId":"crosswords","sectionName":"Crosswords","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-16T23:00:10Z","webTitle":"Everyman crossword No 3,740","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/everyman/3740","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/crosswords/everyman/3740","fields":{"headline":"Everyman crossword No 3,740","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"politics/2018/jun/09/carla-ponsati-accuses-spain-of-vendetta-against-catalan-nationalists","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-09T14:40:31Z","webTitle":"Clara Ponsatí accuses Spain of illegal vendetta against Catalan nationalists","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jun/09/carla-ponsati-accuses-spain-of-vendetta-against-catalan-nationalists","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/jun/09/carla-ponsati-accuses-spain-of-vendetta-against-catalan-nationalists","fields":{"headline":"Clara Ponsatí accuses Spain of illegal vendetta against Catalan nationalists","bodyText":"Clara Ponsatí, the Catalan academic facing extradition to Spain, has accused the Spanish judiciary of pursuing an illegal vendetta against Catalan nationalists. Ponsatí told a fringe meeting at the Scottish National party’s spring conference that last October’s referendum on Catalan independence was entirely legal, even if it had not been supported by the government in Madrid. “It was the duty of the Catalan authorities, who had a mandate for the referendum, to organise a referendum. We were obliged to do it. Besides it was not illegal. We have done nothing illegal,” she said. “The Spanish authorities have manipulated the judiciary, have manipulated the reading of the law, have manipulated the facts and they’ve opened these charges which are totally, totally illegal themselves. What is illegal is what the judiciary is doing in Spain now. That is illegal.” Ponsatí, an economics professor at St Andrews University in Scotland, faces a four-week extradition hearing later this summer after the Spanish authorities issued a European arrest warrant. The Spanish courts accuse her of violent rebellion and of misuse of public funds in organising the referendum. The staging of the vote divided Catalonia, and Madrid insists it was illegal and unconstitutional because it was not authorised as required by Spain’s parliament. Ponsatí’s lawyer, Aamer Anwar, says there is “not a scrap of evidence” to support the charges against her, which carry maximum sentences of 25 years and eight years in prison respectively. Other Catalan leaders, including the then president Carlos Puidgemont, face a similar extradition case in Germany. Anwar told the meeting that violent attacks by Spanish civil guards on voters at some polling stations on 1 October carried “shades of Franco”, and were reminiscent of the suppression of human rights during the regime of the fascist dictator who ruled from 1939 to 1975. SNP activists and some Scottish MPs have rallied to Ponsatí’s cause. Her legal defence fund has reached £270,000, but Anwar has told her supporters she needs £500,000 to cover all her expected legal costs given the complexity of the case. Joanna Cherry, an SNP MP and QC, told the meeting that nine political and civic leaders who backed the referendum in October remained in prison, with 19 people due on trial in Madrid in August. She and Anwar said the Ponsatí and Puidgemont extradition cases had increased concerns that some EU member states were abusing the European arrest warrant system to pursue political opponents rather than criminals. The cases also raised concerns about judicial independence, they said. St Andrews University has officially backed Ponsatí, suggesting the extradition attempt against her is politically motivated. The Courier newspaper, based in Dundee, has reported that 10 or more academics at St Andrews including Spanish staff are unhappy it has done so and asked for its statement to be retracted. Much rests on whether the newly appointed Socialist-led government in Madrid, which came to power in part as a result of a deal with Catalan parties, starts talks with the Catalan authorities in Barcelona and agrees a political solution to the crisis."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/jun/10/denmark-swings-right-immigration-muslims-besieged-holbaek","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-10T09:00:47Z","webTitle":"Denmark swings right on immigration – and Muslims feel besieged","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/10/denmark-swings-right-immigration-muslims-besieged-holbaek","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/10/denmark-swings-right-immigration-muslims-besieged-holbaek","fields":{"headline":"Denmark swings right on immigration – and Muslims feel besieged","bodyText":"“It’s a lovely place,” says Jens Kramer, as he gazes across the harbour from his seat outside the wooden shed that serves as Holbæk’s boat club. “But I think people here are becoming more and more hostile to foreigners and I’m not proud of it. It’s not the Holbæk I love.” Kramer is not alone in thinking that the tone of Denmark’s immigration debate has changed.

It imposes a penalty of 10,000 kroner (£1,200) for repeat offenders. In another move greeted with dismay by Denmark’s Muslims, a citizen’s proposal to ban the circumcision of children got the 50,000 signatures it needed to go to a parliamentary vote. In Holbæk, an attractive small town in Zealand, the latest legislation has had a mixed reception. Kramer’s companion Hanne Madsen says: “On the burqa ban there were people who said, ‘if they make it law, then I’m going to leave’, and I said ‘OK, then leave.’” She adds: “Jens and me, we are those who say: ‘If you have a problem come to me, but if you don’t want to take off your burqa or try to learn Danish…’” She throws up her hands in exasperation. The ban was backed not only by both the ruling centre-right Liberal party but also by the centre-left Social Democrats, whose rhetoric on Islam has started to rival that of the populist right in the last two years. The Social Democrats’ leader, Mette Frederiksen, has called Islam a barrier to integration, said some Muslims “do not respect the Danish judicial system”, that some Muslim women refuse to work for religious reasons, and that Muslim girls are subject to “massive social control”. She has also called for all Muslim schools in the country to be closed. Emrah Tuncer, a local politician for the pro-immigration Social Liberal party, worries about where the two main parties’ rhetorical race to the bottom will lead. “They are almost fighting about who has the most extreme ideas,” he said. “With the burqa ban we’re talking about 40 people who are wearing it. Our government is making laws for just 40 people! And these 40 women will now be trapped in their homes from morning to evening. Does it help them? It does not.” The day before we met, Tuncer’s party formally ended its 25-year electoral partnership with the Social Democrats over the party’s rightward turn on Islam and immigration. “I think it’s very ugly that the Social Democrats have become so extreme,” he says. “They’re worse than the [far-right] Danish People’s party.” But he concedes that the party’s shift over the past two years has come in response to a change in public opinion. “They’ve smelt votes on this one,” he says. “It’s moved in Holbæk, like in the whole of Denmark, from: ‘Let’s help people even if they’re Muslims or immigrants’, to: ‘We have to take care of Danish people first.’” Tuncer attributes the shift in mood to the rise of the Islamic State terror group and the refugee crisis. “It’s because of terror: 150 Danish citizens went to Syria to fight with Isis,” he said. “And of course the refugees cost a lot of money at the same time as, in Holbæk, they didn’t didn’t have money to buy paper for schools, or markers to write on the whiteboards.” Stig Hjarvard, a professor of media at the University of Copenhagen who last year co-wrote a paper on Scandinavian attitudes to Islam, believes the antagonism goes further back. According to Hjarvard, it began with Danish troops’ involvement in the Nato-led invasion of Afghanistan in 2001, grew with the US-led invasion of Iraq in 2003 and was further fuelled by the reaction to publication of cartoons of the prophet Muhammad in the Jyllands-Posten newspaper in 2005. He also thinks that the kingmaker position that the populist Danish People’s party has enjoyed in politics recently is important. “That has of course meant that their policies in terms of immigration have spilled into the agenda of the other parties: not only the Liberal party, but also the Social Democrats. That has consistently put immigration on the agenda. It’s immigration in general and it’s Muslim immigration in particular.” Outside Tuncer’s cafe, a couple of women in Islamic headscarves are browsing in the shops, but Holbæk is more ethnically homogenous than Denmark’s major cities. Tuncer’s brother Hikmet, who is chairman of the local mosque, says he’s not aware of anyone who wears the burqa or niqab. “I think here, it’s a bit more white and Danish,” says Dennis Petersen, who is in the harbour working on his traditional galeas schooner. “In Holbæk, it seems like we have this ghetto. They’re locked in. You don’t see them.” Madsen refers disparagingly to Agervang, a housing estate just outside the centre. “We have this ghetto where people are talking: ‘Bap, bap bap,’” she says, miming people babbling in a foreign language with her hands. Mina, 30, has lived in Agervang all her life after her parents came to Denmark from Turkey as children. “I think it’s so sad they call it a ghetto,” she says. “Do you know how many lawyers, doctors and engineers have come out of these blocks? I see so many people studying, trying to become part of this country, but suddenly we’re not good enough just because we don’t eat pork.” When she went to school, she says, teachers and other pupils were sensitive to the fact that she was a Muslim without it being a big deal. “But I went to a kindergarten for my son, and the first thing they said is: ‘Are you a Muslim?’ The very first thing! I’m a human being.” She is particularly incensed by the recent call from Inger Støjberg, Denmark’s hardline immigration minister, for all Muslims to take holidays during this month’s Ramadan fast “to avoid negative consequences for the rest of Danish society”. “I don’t know what this lady is doing,” Mina says. “I can’t take a vacation just because I’m fasting. It’s so ridiculous.” Istahil Hussein, 36, says the change in Danish opinion so disturbing that she is thinking of returning to Somalia, the country she left 18 years ago. “You listen every day [about] Muslims doing this, Muslims doing that. It’s not good,” she says. “I think about what’s coming in the future, because Denmark 10 years ago, was not talking about Muslims. If Somalia is good I will go home. I will go back like this,” she laughs, and snaps her fingers. Each month, Holbæk council holds a meeting of its advisory committee on integration. Tuncer is a member, as is Derya Tamer, a Social Democrat councillor with a Turkish background. Tuncer thinks both the Social Democrat and Liberal groups on the town council are split on immigration. And he does not think that Christina Krzyrosiak Hansen, the town’s Social Democrat mayor (and at 25, Denmark’s youngest) backs her party’s hardline stance. “I believe she doesn’t think this position is the right one, but she can’t do much about it,” he says. He says he has challenged Tamer on Facebook to respond to her party’s hardline position on Islam, but without any success. “I don’t understand Muslim Social Democrats. Everybody is silent. We don’t hear them,” he says. “When they joined the party, [it] didn’t say this about Muslims, so how can they just sit there and applaud?” He wonders when or if a breaking point will come. “Now the Danish People’s party are saying that all schools and kindergartens should have to serve pork once a week,” he says. “That’s not only not liberal, it’s crazy.” This article was amended on 12 June 2018 to correct the attribution of the quote beginning “On the burqa ban”, previously attributed to Kramer."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jun/09/its-not-just-bikini-parades-that-have-had-their-day-so-has-miss-america","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-09T13:02:22Z","webTitle":"It’s not just bikini parades that have had their day.

So has Miss America","bodyText":"The bikini ban brought in by the Miss America contest manages to feel both welcome and absurd. The all-female organisers of the 97-year-old pageant are responding to #MeToo by ditching the swimwear round (four years after Miss World got rid of it). It’s being replaced by an “interactive section” where contestants explain their achievements and goals. They can also wear “whatever they want” in the eveningwear round and there will be “all female shapes and sizes”. Miss America wants to stop being viewed as a pageant, more as a competition that helps smart young women pay for college. Which sounds workable – just get back to us when the contestants are allowed to wear paper bags on their heads. There’s been a backlash to the ban from former contestants and what one could only assume to be time-travellers from 1972, who strongly feel that women should have the right to express their inner beauty, academic brilliance and profound insights on environmental issues via the medium of the string bikini. While those running Miss America should be applauded for ignoring the naysayers, what about the biggest, most female-positive change of all – stopping Miss America altogether? In fact, ditching all beauty pageants? And I include those creepy ones where eight-year-old girls are tarted up to resemble the death masks of meth-addicted Baby Janes. While there are male equivalents to these contests, these mainly focus on bodybuilding, with the contestants sometimes resembling steroid-infested, fake-tanned police lineups. While it’s undoubtedly intriguing to see how intense exercise and “supplements” can manipulate the human form to the point that it becomes its own tangerine-hued bouncy castle, the only plausible response to some of those involved seems to be to scream and run. Yet the female pageants manage to be worse, because of history, context and the fact that, despite all the earnest cheerleading for intellect and personality, they primarily revolve around an anachronistic grading of female looks. There lies the problem for Miss America and any other pageants wishing, however sincerely, to modernise. Just restyling as a competition (that happens to feature gorgeous women), getting rid of bikinis and allowing in token plus-size contestants doesn’t alter the fact that the entire premise is the notion of beauty as the only female currency that truly matters. There can’t be any nods to #MeToo or anything else powered by the newly invigorated female resistance, when their very existence undermines the fact that it should be what women say and do that counts, not how they look. In this way, an “empowered” beauty pageant becomes… just a very pretty-looking oxymoron. If Miss America truly wishes to ring the changes, it should consider disappearing altogether. In the meantime, regarding the “whatever you want” eveningwear round, one hears The Handmaid’s Tale look is big this year. Raise a glass to Gwent police and its plan for drinkers A scheme in Gwent, south-east Wales, means first-time, drunk-and-disorderly offenders who get involved in minor fights could avoid fines and prison sentences by attending a behavioural course. In the same way that motorists are sent on speed-awareness courses, the drunks would attend the moderately priced class, but avoid further penalties. The police and crime commissioner for Gwent, Jeffrey Cuthbert, said: “When people consume substantial amounts of alcohol, individuals can act out of character.” Quite. I’m reminded of my intense dislike for that petty little phrase “in vino veritas”, which always seemed to be permission to drink-shame people already crippled by filthy hangovers. As in: “Not only am I going to torture you for your appalling behaviour last night, I’m going to make out that this is your true grotty nature that your sober self tries to hide from the world and I’m going to give this trite, judgmental nonsense credence by spouting a bit of Latin in a superior, knowing voice that grates on everyone’s nerves.” In truth, there’s hardly ever any “veritas” in “vino” – it’s all just vino, or beer, or whatever else you drank. It wasn’t true of me in my drunken heyday, when I was annoying and boring people with my antics, so, bar racist or misogynist outbursts, I’ve always tried to give others the benefit of the doubt. Drunken behaviour merely speaks of a person’s level of inebriation, not their essential character. That was always my excuse and I stuck to it for many years, against stiff opposition and mounting evidence. Well done, Gwent police for the lateral thinking: the first time they screw up, don’t shame drunks – give them a warning and also a break. Does my bum look big in this? Well, I certainly won’t be asking Amazon’s robot There’s a new Amazon device coming out (so far, just in the US) called the Echo Look, described as “a smart camera that helps you get dressed”. It will judge your outfit and tell you if you look good or bad, using input from various stylists, fashion “influencers” and the like. What sounds a bit like a computerised “bezzie” isn’t entirely about helping you out, because (and this may shock some people) the advice links to items that you can buy and (another shock) these things are often available from Amazon. What woman hasn’t dreamed of an electronic device designed to make her feel paranoid about how she looks? Then again, what’s new? For too many years, women have been constantly nagged by society at large that they’ll never look good enough and are fundamentally worthless unless they spend all their money and every waking hour trying to disguise their core unsightliness. They stagger desperately from product to outfit to hot yoga session in their relentless and doomed quest for acceptance. Basically, Echo Look is just going to do to women what our systemically sexist culture is already doing – it might just be a bit less spiteful about it. • Barbara Ellen is an Observer columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"music/2018/aug/04/observer-archive-glyndebourne-9-august-1957","type":"article","sectionId":"theobserver","sectionName":"From the Observer","webPublicationDate":"2018-08-04T17:00:45Z","webTitle":"Observer picture archive: Glyndebourne, 9 August 1957","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/aug/04/observer-archive-glyndebourne-9-august-1957","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/aug/04/observer-archive-glyndebourne-9-august-1957","fields":{"headline":"Observer picture archive: Glyndebourne, 9 August 1957","bodyText":"This is an edited extract from An Interlude at Glyndebourne by Haro Hodson, published in the Observer on 11 August 1957 This was the first time I had been to Mr Christie’s house. In my imagination I had peopled it with blank-faced advertisement figures, suavely drinking alternate sips of Mozart and Krug, or solemn herds of music lovers in beards and bridge coatees, clutching the score. The 800 in the audience which streamed out across the lawns encircling the house did not look like that. They looked, in so far as English people can, positively happy. They looked more like relations or friends. One of them was, and asked, ‘Are you lunching here?’ The mistake was understandable for the atmosphere was that of a house-party where one day blends imperceptibly into another. People in evening clothes were picnicking under the trees and by the river. I walked past herbaceous borders filled with phlox. Pigeons crooned in the farther woods, and from behind a high, clipped yew hedge, a game of croquet echoed and re-echoed. Most of the people with picnics were young. In the restaurant it was different. Here, with the exception of a table of girls from a finishing school, sat the old. During the interval 400 people are dined and wined, with no semblance of hurry. Going out into the gardens again I met the owner of the house. Mr Christie is an affable septuagenarian who looks like a country squire. His black bow tie was of watered silk, his bearing forthright.

The Food Standards Agency (FSA) made the move on Friday after a newspaper report alleged that traces of pork were found in Sainsbury’s own brand “meat-free” meatballs, and traces of turkey were detected in a Tesco macaroni ready meal, which is part of the supermarket’s new vegan foods line. Religious groups expressed concern about the claims, saying they hoped a product recall would be ordered as a result of the “worrying” findings. “It is distressing for vegetarian and vegan consumers to learn that they may have consumed food products labelled as suitable for their use that have been shown to contain animal DNA,” the Muslim Council of Britain said. “We hope that the FSA will implement the recall procedure urgently and carry out a thorough investigation of what appears to be a contravention of the Trades Description Act,” it told the Daily Telegraph, which first published the allegations on Friday. A spokesman for Europe’s largest kosher agency, Kosher London Beth Din, said: “It is disappointing to hear that pork was found in a supposed vegetarian product – and this news will understandably be worrying for people who do not wish to eat any type of meat.” The Telegraph reported that it had sent samples to a German government-accredited food testing laboratory, which found the traces of meat in the two products. A Food Standards Agency spokesperson confirmed to the Guardian on Friday that it was “investigating the circumstances surrounding these alleged incidents and any resulting action will depend upon the evidence found”. The watchdog added: “Our priority is to ensure consumers can be confident that the food they eat is safe and is what it says it is.” A Sainsbury’s spokeswoman said: “These products are produced at a meat-free factory. Sainsbury’s and the Vegetarian Society also carry out regular checks and no issues have been found. We are concerned by these findings, however, and are carrying out a comprehensive investigation alongside our supplier.” A Tesco spokesman said: “We take the quality and integrity of our products extremely seriously and understand that our vegan and vegetarian products should be exactly that. “Our initial DNA tests have found no traces of animal DNA in the BBQ Butternut Mac product available in stores today. We would urge the Telegraph to share full details of their testing, including the lab used as we continue to investigate.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"sport/2018/jun/08/warrington-castleford-super-league-match-report","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-08T20:51:56Z","webTitle":"Castleford Tigers stun Warrington Wolves in Super League thriller","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/jun/08/warrington-castleford-super-league-match-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/jun/08/warrington-castleford-super-league-match-report","fields":{"headline":"Castleford Tigers stun Warrington Wolves in Super League thriller","bodyText":"When Castleford lost last season’s Grand Final against Leeds, many wondered if they had blown their only chance of breaking the monopoly in Super League. Clearly there is still a way to go before it becomes clear whether they can become only the fifth different champion in the competition’s history but performances like this against Warington amid a litany of injuries and setbacks make it hard to imagine they will not be in the mix again. Castleford were without more than half a dozen frontline players but the squad men who replaced them – some of them still only teenagers – acquitted themselves superbly. This victory took them level with their opponents, who lie third in Super League, and only two points adrift of second-placed Wigan. “We’ve had some big wins but for character and toughness I haven’t had a better win than that,” Daryl Powell said. The young full-back, Callum Turner, scored 16 of Castleford’s 34 points despite not training with the first team all week while the Samoan Quentin Laulu-Togaga’e excelled in the week he signed from the part-timers Halifax. But Castleford, often reliant on one or two men on their run to the Grand Final last year, produced an all-round team display. Mike McMeeken and Turner put them 12-0 ahead, though Warrington fought back to lead 20-12 before a magnificent team try finished by Jy Hitchcox, coupled with two more goals from Turner, levelled it at half-time. Warrington’s experience looked as though it would prove decisive when Josh Charnley moved them ahead again with a magnificent finish. Yet the visitors refused to give in. First, Laulu-Togaga’e darted through to mark his debut with a try, before turning the ball on for Oliver Holmes to seal the victory shortly after. Charnley’s second try that followed could not spare Warrington from defeat – but their coach was magnanimous afterwards. “Credit to Castleford,” Steve Price said. “I thought they played really well with a number of players out: everything they did was superior to us.” St Helens are now six points clear at the top after beating Hull KR 26-4, with Ben Barba on the scoresheet twice. The reigning champions, Leeds, however, continue to fall further off the pace after a fourth successive leaguedefeat, this time losing 25-18 to eighth-placed Huddersfield. Hull FC kept up their hunt for a play-off place with a comprehensive 45-14 win over Salford.

For a country twice world champions, proud exporters of football talent, it was not without frustration that even staying in the tournament past the quarter-finals had become an elusive task. For a short while after the last World Cup, then, Argentina’s success in keeping the nation enthralled until the very last minute was praised, a cause for celebration. And one player in particular became the viral pin-up hero of the day: Javier Mascherano. “It was a unique experience because we had never lived or experienced anything like what happened in 2014 – it was spectacular,” an older, wiser Mascherano tells me when we meet in Spain for Argentina’s warm-up tour. “The World Cup itself sets the pace and indicates what we can and can’t do: we changed the way we played, the system, as we went along, but always with total clarity about what we were doing. That was what led us to the final. The conviction of our idea, of doing things in a certain way, up to the very last minute. And if you look back I think it was Argentina’s best match in years.” Mascherano was praised for his tactical intelligence and his face was Photoshopped on to the iconic Che Guevara beret image, with memes claiming he could do anything, solve any problem, doing the rounds. He found himself raised on a pedestal so high that the only way was going to be down. Of that final loss to Germany, his memory of the game’s decisive moment remains vivid. “It was one of those isolated moves when you think nothing’s going on and football always ends up proving that every ball is important. The ball comes from the side and [André] Schürrle manages a cross between Pablo [Zabaleta] and me, it was actually the only space where it could have gone through … and we weren’t standing in the best position, and when [Mario] Götze gets it … It was unexpected, a moment in the game where it seemed nothing was happening but ends up giving them the advantage and crowning Germany world champions.” Argentina followed 2014 up by reaching two Copa América finals, but lost both to Chile, on penalties. “When we thought we’d hit rock bottom with the famous three finals – not in terms of football, because I think the standard of our game was by far among the highest Argentina has displayed in recent years, but in terms of results and because of the frustration generated by one lost final after another – we realised that the bottom was much deeper than we had envisaged.” As he shrugs and tuts about the passage of time, the toll the years have taken, the criticism, his sadness is clear. Speaking with just one other journalist present, the UK-based Argentinian broadcaster Christian Martín, no sponsored backdrops, no PR gatekeepers, he is relaxed and open. Of Argentina’s qualifying campaign, he says: “It’s hard to find high points. Mostly because throughout the qualifiers we were very inconsistent; we suffered a lot. “It all started off really badly with a defeat to Ecuador at home, then we went to Paraguay and drew. When we thought we might be able to make the jump, in the matches against Brazil, Colombia and Chile, an actual team started to appear, that’s when we went to the other Copa América in the US [the 2016 Centenario edition, with the final staged in New Jersey], and ended up changing manager. After Tata [Martino] everything descended into chaos. Because we weren’t getting the results, because we were so needy, so lacking … because we changed manager again after that. There was such a sense of urgency.” It was after that final in June 2016 that Argentina really did descend into chaos: Messi resigned from the squad pitch-side after missing a penalty in the shootout defeat by Chile, while the Argentina FA was placed under Fifa administration following a rigged election, internal disputes and accusations of corruption. Bankruptcy and violence plagued the domestic game. The bottom was much deeper than anyone envisaged. “We were so close to the edge … one match away from not qualifying for the World Cup, it was a Calvary,” says Mascherano. “Those of us who have been around for some time have seen the good times and the bad, facing up to the task and doing what’s needed along the way … luckily we’ve come through.” I first met Mascherano shortly after the 2006 World Cup, when he had just signed for West Ham. He was a midfielder back then, a traditional No 5, but he was already aware that his defensive potential might slowly shift him further back. “If you don’t watch out you’re going to end up in goal any minute,” his compatriot Carlos Tevez joked. Since his move from Liverpool to Barcelona in 2010, he has come to occupy the defensive role more naturally, but also to understand the importance of the post. Argentina’s strength is often considered to be their forwards but Mascherano disagrees. “For years the talk has been of Argentina’s strong point being the offensive side, the attack,” he says. “And clearly we do have players with immense talent up front. But I think what has made these recent teams so competitive has been the ability to find a defensive equilibrium.” Russia 2018 will be the 34-year‑old’s fourth World Cup. Argentina’s most capped player with 143 international games under his belt, he recalls his first World Cup now, fondly remembering the 24-pass goal against Serbia in 2006 with which José Pékerman’s team made history. “Things always develop according to the players you field. If I remember right in midfield we had Maxi, Cuchu [Cambiasso], myself, Román [Riquelme], [Javier] Saviola and then [Hernán] Crespo, no? It was a reflection of José’s feeling for football. It was a very Argentinian squad, evoking Argentinian football from earlier times … very similar to Maradona’s goal against Greece [at USA 94], lots of touches. “That’s a bit what José preached. In the end I think we were all left feeling we could have gone further in that World Cup. It was a squad that could have aspired to more. Germany knocked us out in a penalty shootout, but in a match we arguably deserved to win.” We met again when he was playing for Liverpool and was asked to captain Argentina by Maradona, an unlikely manager of the national team. He then decided to hand over the armband to Messi, adding to his sense of leadership. Defeat once again when facing Germany in the quarter-finals of the 2010 World Cup he describes as “an enormous sadness; our expectations were much higher”. By contrast, at club level it was a rewarding time: “Playing in England was a fantastic experience. In Liverpool I felt at home and really thoroughly enjoyed it. That’s the truth. The kudos and hierarchy of playing in the Premier League for a footballer is huge.” The excellence of his tackles, interceptions and distribution were described by the Guardian’s Richard Williams as “sitting in front of the defence controlling the traffic with a calmness and technical excellence reminiscent of Barcelona’s Pep Guardiola”, a project he would later join and be a part of for eight years. Although Mascherano became more entrenched in the centre-back role under Guardiola, he remained for years the exemplar of a player able to play at the back, recover, save awkward situations and pass the ball forward at the highest level. He also gained experience of sharing the pitch with Messi, a plus for Argentina. “One wishes for this coming World Cup that Leo can be the best version of himself, because the aspirations of the whole squad depend on this version. It’s clear Leo conditions our collective performance; I hope as his team‑mates we can meet his standards.” Ready to kick off the World Cup with a raw squad and a manager, Jorge Sampaoli, parachuted in late in qualifying, Mascherano is conscious of the difficulties Argentina face. “There was such an urgency when Jorge stepped in – we have been varying and tweaking and now I believe our aim is to become a much more solid team, which is what we’re going to need. “Take care to be defensively strong, which is what has made us go far in international competitions, and from there hope the quality starts to flow – because we do have quality players.” He is keenly aware that Argentina have been drawn in a tough group. “Iceland are a new team in the sense that they maybe don’t have a long football tradition but they’re a generation of players that have made history recently, with spectacular success at Euro 16, and qualifying ahead of Croatia. “Croatia are a first-class side with top players, especially in the midfield, such as Modric, Brozovic, Kovacic, Rakitic … Perisic; a team to watch out, quality squad. And Nigeria are quite well known to us, we’ve always met in the last World Cups. They’re tough, not just because of their physical power, but because their disorganisation has the effect of disorganising you as a rival. And that’s when teams like ours suffer the most – in disorder.” Fully aware that for him and a few others, this World Cup presents the last chance of winning something big with Argentina, he stresses that the key is: “One step at a time. No need to rush things, the World Cup itself guides you, gives you signals on the go … it’s very important to start well because of the peace of mind, but we mustn’t look further than the first match.” He is now facing the dusk of his playing career, ending the season in China, far from his family. Rather than proclaim Argentina will be victorious, he has a measured view of what can now be achieved in Russia. “This is football: one day you win, one day you lose and there’s a very fine line between them.” It is hard to argue with my colleague Christian Martín’s view: “Masche is our leader. The finest example of his generation. A warrior facing his last great stand.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/2018/jun/14/musical-memories-bergkamp-and-clough-world-cup-classic-youtube","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-14T09:30:43Z","webTitle":"Musical memories, Bergkamp and Clough: World Cup Classic YouTube","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/jun/14/musical-memories-bergkamp-and-clough-world-cup-classic-youtube","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/jun/14/musical-memories-bergkamp-and-clough-world-cup-classic-youtube","fields":{"headline":"Musical memories, Bergkamp and Clough: World Cup Classic YouTube","bodyText":"1) Let’s start with some TV gold. The greatest ever World Cup TV theme tune, hands down, is Silsoe’s Aztec Gold, used for Mexico ‘86 by ITV. Sorry, BBC. Decent effort that year but your entry holds nowhere near the nostalgic melancholy of its competitor. More Mexico memories: Ian St John is caught on candid camera as Scotland exit after a 0-0 draw with Uruguay; Terry Venables in a clear case of tapping up as he and Gary Lineker review the final with Lawrie McMenemy looking on for BBC; Brian Clough channels Frank Sinatra. 2) From the previous Mexico World Cup, in 1970, a presenter duo of Jimmy Hill and Brian Moore attempt to control a studio dream team of Brian Clough, Big Malcolm Allison, Derek “The Doug” Dougan and Paddy Crerand. Four years later, with Hill having gone to the BBC, Moore presides over a panel of Clough, Allison, Crerand and Bobby Moncur. It also features an uncomfortable set-piece between Sir Alf Ramsey and Helmut Schön. By 1978, the ITV team has been pared down to Moore and the twinned perms of Andy Gray and Kevin Keegan. Pushing on 12 years, the BBC’s review of Italia 90 is an hour-long joy. 3) You want some golden moments? Greatest ever World Cup TV commentary? “Dennis Bergkamp! Dennis Bergkamp! Dennis Bergkamp! Dennis Bergkamp!” and Jack van Gelder. Having said, that this Colombian chap has a decent stab after James Rodríguez’s volley against Uruguay in 2014. Mario Götze’s winning goal with German commentary from 2014’s final is another exercise in losing it. Andrés Iniesta’s winner in 2010 is celebrated in the Soccer City press box here. And how about Diego Maradona and team-mates in the dressing room after winning in 1986? 4) Forget “World in Motion”, football songs are not supposed to be good, even allowing for Hey Duggee’s World Cup Kick Song getting the party started for Russia. As it stands, Del Amitri’s Don’t Come Home Too Soon, from 1998, is the last ever Scotland World Cup song. The same year, the Spice Girls, Echo &amp; the Bunnymen, Space and Ocean Colour Scene teamed up for England’s effort, On Top of the World, performed here on a peak-banter TFI Friday. 5) The tournament’s official tune for France ‘98 was Ricky Martin’s The Cup of Life, featuring some excellent crowd coordination, although the view of the acclaimed music critic Martin O’Neill is as yet unpublished. Who wouldn’t want to listen to commercial house behemoth Paul Oakenfold’s remix of Yorkshire Britpop triers Embrace’s official England 2006 song, World At Your Feet? From the same year, how about one Sheffield crooner Tony Christie’s Is This the Way to the World Cup?, which reheats Amarillo to suggest we “go down the local, have a laugh and get all vocal”. 6) Setting off further afield and four years on, how about Dr Alban, he of It’s My Life fame and his collaboration with producer Sash! with Hello South Africa. And to close out our musical interlude, we have to call on Diana “Call Me Miss” Ross and her USA ‘94 opening ceremony performance and that penalty, as introduced by Oprah Winfrey.

The figure increased to 62% of women aged under 30, a sign that it remains a major issue in offices and workplaces across Britain. The survey was conducted by the Prospect union, which represents skilled workers from a range of industries in both the public and private sectors. It was completed by 7,000 people, 40% of whom were female and 60% male. Respondents were drawn from the worlds of aviation, defence, energy, archaeology and heritage, the civil service and broadcasting. It found that 35% of women reported sexual harassment of various kinds, while some described losing jobs or being too intimidated to report the misconduct of colleagues. More than a quarter were subjected to suggestive remarks or jokes of a sexual nature (27%), while a similar number (25%) were forced to endure unwanted comments about their appearance. Unwelcome behaviour of a sexual nature was experienced by 17%, while 14% endured unwanted and inappropriate touching, hugging or kissing. Of the women, reporting incidents of harassment, two thirds have heard suggestive remarks or jokes of a sexual nature in the last year, while a third have experienced inappropriate touching or hugging in that time. Some women described the harassment that they had suffered. One described “a male manager who used inappropriate comments and hugged and kissed females each time we had a team meeting”. Another described an “old boys’ club” culture, where the victim assumed harassment would not be taken seriously. Another victim said when she complained, she was “made to feel like I was to blame by the investigating officer”. One respondent said: “I have lost a job after bringing up sexual harassment from a manager.” Mike Clancy, the Prospect general secretary, said: “This survey was created so that we were able to engage with our members on unacceptable behaviours that are taking place across the UK’s workplaces. “Prospect’s membership represents a cross-section of highly educated and highly skilled workers. The findings of this survey demonstrate that sexual harassment is endemic and takes place in all parts of the economy. That can’t be taken for granted and Prospect is committed to making this a mainstream issue that remains in the public consciousness.” 35% of women who took part in the survey said they had suffered sexual harassment in the workplace 62% of women under 30 said they had faced sexual harassment at work 14% said they had suffered unwanted touching, hugging and kissing"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/jun/09/the-1975-funding-for-lgbqt-centre-in-hackney-london","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-09T23:05:35Z","webTitle":"The 1975 back new centre for London’s LGBTQ+ community","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/09/the-1975-funding-for-lgbqt-centre-in-hackney-london","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/09/the-1975-funding-for-lgbqt-centre-in-hackney-london","fields":{"headline":"The 1975 back new centre for London’s LGBTQ+ community","bodyText":"The international chart-topping Manchester band The 1975 have helped finance a new LGBTQ+ community centre for London, making a significant donation that has allowed the project to secure its fundraising target. Matthew Healy, the band’s frontman, told the Observer: “You might wonder why it is needed, and even ask yourself what exactly is everyone still scared of, but sadly, I think stigma still exists even in London and we still have some way to go.” Healy, 29, added that he was surprised to find the capital city did not have a place for LGBTQ+ people to meet and support one another. New York, Berlin, Los Angeles and Manchester already have such venues – and London did once. A Gay and Lesbian Centre in Farringdon was shut down in the early 1990s, because of a lack of funding and management disagreements about its core purpose. But now a team of volunteers, including the activist and journalist Michael Segalov, are attempting to set up a new and more welcoming place for London’s large LGBTQ+ community that could have a more stable future. Segalov, too, had assumed that Londoners in need of friendship, or a safe space to escape from prejudice, already had somewhere to go. The fundraising campaign won support from Hackney Council, the borough that will host the planned centre, and then from the London mayor’s office. Money-raising events, ranging from club nights to community picnics, got the project off the ground, but it was Healy and his band’s 11th-hour response to the project’s appeal to raise £50,000 that has now enabled the creation of the centre. “When a friend of mine sent me the link, I was quite surprised that such a good idea had not yet raised enough to get over the threshold,” said Healy, the son of actors Tim Healy and Denise Welch. “I am a bit wary of talking about it because I don’t want to appear to be virtue-signalling, but me and the others in the band all felt it was obviously a good thing to put our money towards.” The musicians, who formed a group in 2002 while at school in Wilmslow and won the Brit award last year for best British band, are currently in the studio working on a third album, A Brief Inquiry into Online Relationships. In 2013, their debut album went to the top of the UK album chart. In 2016, their second album topped both the UK chart and the US Billboard 200. Yesterday, Healy said a large section of the 1975’s fanbase comes from the LGBTQ+ community so the decision to fund the centre had seemed a natural choice. “Aside from believing in the idea, a more superficial reason is that one of our songs, Loving Someone, has become a bit of an anthem for some people in that community,” he said. The new venue will host a wide variety of entertainment and group activities, from drag shows to Christmas dinners for the lonely. Key to its purpose will be welcoming older members, who are sometimes left out, and holding events that do not revolve around alcohol. The centre plans to run a cafe employing LGBTQ+ people, as well as an information and research hub. Three full-time official posts will run the operation, with new personnel selected each year. “The fundamental aim is setting up the centre,” explains Segalov, adding the team has now set the online fundraising target to £100,000. “But it’s also about bringing together a community that can be disparate. We’re trying to bridge those gaps.” More than half of London’s established bars, clubs and pubs set up for the LGBTQ+ community have closed in the last decade, many of them victims of rising business rates and rents. At the same time, concerns about public safety among this community have grown. A recent YouGov national survey of 5,000 people suggested that in the last five years, verbal or physical attacks on LGBTQ+ people have increased by almost 80%. Research conducted by the Albert Kennedy Trust also found that 24% of homeless young people identify as LGBTQ+."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2018/jun/09/eunice-gayson-the-first-bond-girl-dies-aged-90","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-09T14:53:14Z","webTitle":"Eunice Gayson, the first Bond girl, dies aged 90","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/jun/09/eunice-gayson-the-first-bond-girl-dies-aged-90","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/jun/09/eunice-gayson-the-first-bond-girl-dies-aged-90","fields":{"headline":"Eunice Gayson, the first Bond girl, dies aged 90","bodyText":"Eunice Gayson, the actor who played the first Bond girl in 007’s on-screen debut, has died at the age of 90. Gayson starred as James Bond’s love interest, Sylvia Trench, alongside Sir Sean Connery in the 1962 film Dr No. A post on her official Twitter feed said she died on 8 June. “An amazing lady who left a lasting impression on everyone she met. She will be very much missed,” the post said. The James Bond franchise’s producers, Michael G Wilson and Barbara Broccoli, paid tribute to Gayson in a separate comment posted on the official James Bond Twitter account. The message from the daughter and stepson of original Bond producer, Albert R Broccoli, appeared alongside a picture of Gayson in character as Trench. “Our sincere thoughts are with her family,” the pair said. Gayson is known for eliciting one of Bond’s most famous catchphrases. Over a game of cards at the Le Cercle Club casino, Bond asks her for her name. “I admire your courage, Miss, er?” She replies: “Trench, Sylvia Trench. I admire your luck, Mr...?” “Bond, James Bond,” Connery replies. Speaking about the scene in 2012, Gayson recalled how she helped calm Connery’s nerves by taking him for a drink so he could deliver the line correctly. “I’d known Sean for years and I’d never seen him so nervous as he was on that day because of all these delays,” she said. “He had to say Bond, James Bond, but he came out with other permutations like Sean Bond, James Connery. ‘Cut! Cut! Cut!’ “[Director] Terence Young told me to take him away for a drink – even though he was meant to be on the wagon – so I took him off for a drink or two and he came back on set and said: ‘Bond, James Bond’. It was so wonderful. The day took off from that moment. He was so relaxed.” Trench also appeared in From Russia With Love. Like other Bond girls in the 60s and 70s, however, Gayson’s voice was never heard in the movies. Her lines were rerecorded by the voiceover artist Nikki van der Zyl. Gayson was originally to be cast as Miss Moneypenny, but the part went to Lois Maxwell instead. Trench had been due to be a recurring character, but the idea was dropped by the director of Goldfinger, Guy Hamilton. The actor was born in Surrey in 1928, and played in other screen roles including Hammer Horror’s 1958 movie The Revenge of Frankenstein and The Avengers."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"sport/2018/jun/09/australia-ireland-summer-international-match-report","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-09T12:47:50Z","webTitle":"Australia end Ireland’s unbeaten run as David Pocock returns in style","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/jun/09/australia-ireland-summer-international-match-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/jun/09/australia-ireland-summer-international-match-report","fields":{"headline":"Australia end Ireland’s unbeaten run as David Pocock returns in style","bodyText":"From Surfers Paradise to total wipeout. Ireland’s 12-match winning run hit the rocks against a fired up Australia as David Pocock’s late try sank the Six Nations champions in Brisbane. Bernard Foley chipped in with 13 points but it was fitting that the back-rower, in his first international appearance since 2016, had the final say – his sabbatical has clearly had the desired effect. Ireland arrived as the pride of the north – Michael Cheika, the Australia coach, made sure to proclaim them favourites – but they had not beaten Australia away for 39 years and here was a reminder that while club rugby down under is flatlining, the Wallabies always have it in them to flourish. It would be easy to blame Ireland’s defeat on Joe Schmidt’s decision to relegate Johnny Sexton to the bench. Joey Carbery did miss a straightforward kick at goal in the second half but it must also be said that Sexton’s error – missing touch after Israel Folau’s try had been overturned – was one of the turning points in this match. Ireland did not lose because of the identity of their fly-half, rather they ran into a ferocious Wallabies side who do not lose in Brisbane often and who boasted the game’s two outstanding performers in Folau and Pocock. The former was flawless in the air and frightening with ball in hand, the latter lethal on the floor. The sides now head to Melbourne next Saturday – Ireland no doubt with Sexton in their starting lineup, the Wallabies with a spring in their step. Cheika knew what he was doing when heralding this Ireland side as the best in their history but he will be mightily relieved that a whitewashing, as befell the Wallabies two years ago when England arrived as grand slam Six Nations champions, is no longer possible. In 2016 England found themselves two tries down inside 15 minutes, so it was to Ireland’s credit that they kept their line intact in the breathless opening exchanges. Australia flew out of the blocks but had only an opening Foley penalty to show for it. Carbery, composed if not in total control of proceedings, replied with two penalties but Australia took an 8-6 lead into half-time thanks to Foley’s try. Robbie Henshaw had already ridden his luck when flying out of the line but when he attempted a man-and-ball hit on Foley he was too late and while Samu Kerevi was stopped short, Will Genia found his fly-half on the short side and Australia were ahead again. After the break it was Australia’s turn to defend en masse. CJ Stander broke clear but Australia did superbly well to scramble, Pocock playing an integral role in denying the British &amp; Irish Lion. Ireland began stringing together their phases – they reached 19 before Pocock made the crucial turnover – but mistakes were creeping in for the Wallabies. Michael Hooper was foolishly offside – to his relief Carbery missed the target – but the Munster-bound fly-half made no mistake when Pocock was harshly pinged soon afterwards. Then came Folau’s disallowed try, a shame simply because of the ruthless precision with which it was taken. Will Genia, Kurtley Beale and Foley combined to set the full-back clear down the right but the referee, Marius van der Westhuizen, ruled it out on the advice of his TMO for an infringement from Adam Coleman before Australia were even in possession. Ultimately it proved academic but Ireland may have delivered a killer blow had Sexton found the corner with the subsequent kick. Not least because of Sexton’s presence, Ireland’s bench looked by far the stronger but despite calling on the Lions duo Jack McGrath and Tadhg Furlong, Australia won a scrum penalty in front of the posts and retook the lead at 11-9. Pocock powered over from close-range soon after – Australia scenting the opportunity to put the game to bed – before Ireland had the ignominy of a disallowed try for Kieran Marmion at the death."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2018/jun/20/are-any-1990s-world-cup-stars-still-playing-professional-football","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-20T09:00:37Z","webTitle":"Are any 1990s World Cup stars still playing professional football? | The Knowledge","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jun/20/are-any-1990s-world-cup-stars-still-playing-professional-football","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/jun/20/are-any-1990s-world-cup-stars-still-playing-professional-football","fields":{"headline":"Are any 1990s World Cup stars still playing professional football?","bodyText":"“Everton and Cameroon legend Samuel Eto’o took part in the 1998 World Cup and is still playing in Turkey,” tweets Deej. “Is there anyone still playing professionally who appeared at an earlier World Cup?” Let’s proceed straight to an age-old favourite: Kazuyoshi Miura, the Japanese forward who last year, at the age of 50, broke Sir Stanley Matthews’ record to become the oldest goalscorer in professional football history. He didn’t actually play in the World Cup but let’s not split hairs when the trivia is this rewarding. “Miura comes close as part of Japan’s 1994 play-off-losing side (and wasn’t part of 1998 because of a spat with the coach),” notes Tom Prankerd. “Brad Friedel (retired 2015) seems to have been the last active professional player to be part of the 1994 World Cup, unless Sigurd Rushveldt’s comeback with Lyngen/Karnes is in need of an update.” To another legend, then. “A young Gianluigi Buffon could be found on the Italian bench in 1998, having starred in their play-off win over Russia,” muses Niall MacGalloway. “Shinji Ono, who played for Japan in 1998, is still plying his trade for Consadole Sapporo in the J1 League. Lee Dong-guk also played in that tournament for South Korea, and is now at Jeonbuk Hyundai Motors.” A few players from the 2002 World Cup are still earning a living through association football, including Japan midfielder Junichi Inamoto, the Cameroon keeper Carlos Kameni and Nigeria keeper Austin Ejide. As Kameni and Ejide are only 34 years old, they could well appear when this question is updated in 2022. Have you got any other examples? If so, email knowledge@theguardian.com or tweet @TheKnowledge_GU. Scoring in four World Cups “Cristiano Ronaldo’s hat-trick against Spain means he has now scored in four different World Cups,” notes Paula Diaz. “Is this a record?” Ronaldo has indeed scored in all four tournaments since his debut 12 years ago, though he had only managed three World Cup goals in all before that hat-trick on Friday: a penalty against Iran in 2006, the last goal in the 7-0 win over North Korea in 2010 and a futile winner against Ghana in 2014, when Portugal went out of the tournament on goal difference. Scoring in four World Cups is a record, albeit one he has to share with three other players – at least until Qatar 2022. Pelé and the West German Uwe Seeler both scored in every World Cup between 1958 and 1970, while Miroslav Klose scored for Germany in 2002, 2006, 2010 and 2014. There’s another player who could join the club in this tournament – not Lionel Messi (he failed to score in 2010) but Australia’s Tim Cahill. He was on target for Australia in 2006, 2010 and 2014. The curse of the European champions “My friend reckons Portugal are doomed to fail in Russia because the European champions are cursed at the following World Cup,” writes Abby Phipps. “Is this true?” It’s not quite a curse but there is a notable history of the European champions failing at the World Cup two years later. Portugal have avoided the first obstacle by actually qualifying: Czechoslovakia (who won Euro 76), Denmark (Euro 92) and Greece (Euro 2004) all failed to do that – though Denmark had a helluva hard luck story to tell. Three other European champions failed to get past the group stage – two of them shockingly so, because they were also world champions at the time. France did not even score a goal in 2002, while Spain’s 5-1 defeat to the Netherlands four years ago was the most jaw-dropping result in modern World Cup history – until Germany plugged Brazil 7-1 in the semi-finals 25 days later. Spain were also eliminated in the group stage at the 1966 World Cup. That makes six out of 14 European champions who have made a mess of their World Cup campaign. We can probably add the Netherlands to the list. Their magnificent team stunk out Italia 90, failing to win a game in the group stage before being well beaten by West Germany in the last 16. The only thing most people remember about their campaign for is Frank Rijkaard deciding to moisten Rudi Völler’s mullet. There have been a few success stories: West Germany (1972) and Spain (2008) won the World Cup two years after becoming champions of Europe, while West Germany’s villainous team reached the final in 1982 – the same as Italy in 1970. But overall, it’s not the greatest record. Here’s the full list: 1962 Soviet Union lost in the quarter-finals 1966 Spain were eliminated in the group stage 1970 Italy lost in the final 1974 West Germany won the World Cup 1978 Czechoslovakia failed to qualify 1984 West Germany lost in the final 1986 France lost in the semi-finals 1990 Netherlands lost in the last 16 1994 Denmark failed to qualify 1998 Germany lost in the quarter-finals 2002 France went out in the group stage 2006 Greece failed to quality 2010 Spain won the World Cup 2014 Spain went out in the group stage Knowledge archive “What’s the longest gap between World Cup appearances for a player?” pondered R Reisman back in 2014. “Has anyone ever missed two tournaments and then come back to play again?” Yes, is the quick answer. The most obvious is Michael Laudrup, who appeared in the great Denmark side of 1986 (which, as it happens, you can read all about in this little tome), then had to wait 12 years before he could play in another World Cup, as Denmark failed to qualify in 1990 and 1994. However, he was still around for France 1998, and his last game in that tournament happened to be his final ever game of professional football “Niall Quinn was a member of the Republic of Ireland squad at Italia ‘90,” writes Philip in Dublin. “As he was injured in 1994 and RoI failed to qualify for 1998, Quinn didn’t see the World Cup again until Japan and South Korea in 2002.” Doug Coyle points out a similar gap between the Costa Rica forward Hernan Medford’s first appearance in 1990 and his last in 2002, but Marcelo Leal has perhaps the definitive suggestion: “Colombian goalkeeper Faryd Mondragón was part of the squad in 1994 (did not play) and 1998 (three appearances) and now, at age 43, is part of the 23-man squad called by José Pekerman. If he manages to stay fit until their first game in Brazil, it will be 20 years since he was first part of a WC squad and 16 since his first WC match.” [update – Mondragón did play at Brazil 2014, coming on as an 85th-minute substitute for David Ospina in the 4-1 win over Japan.] Can you help? “What is the earliest known team photo?” asks John Briggs.

The idea that fish, like snakes and other ectotherms (“cold-blooded” creatures), might enjoy or benefit from sunbathing was dismissed as a childish fancy at the time, but many decades later has been vindicated. A scientific paper shows that carp not only sunbathe, but also gain body heat, grow faster and are fitter as a result. These fish were warmer than their surroundings despite the fact that scientists thought this was impossible because the fish were immersed in cold water. Another key finding is that not all fish gained equally. The darker fish absorbed more warmth than their paler companions and grew faster. Much stranger was the fact that the personality of the fish mattered. Bolder carp that were prepared to hang about and catch the maximum sunshine did better than timid ones that hid in the reeds. Since carp are widely farmed as a food fish in much of Europe and China, the scientists say these findings are commercially important. It also means these fish might cope better with climate change."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2018/jun/09/donald-trump-kim-jong-un-north-korea-g7-summit-canada","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-09T17:34:15Z","webTitle":"Trump: I'll know whether Kim summit will be successful 'in first minute'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jun/09/donald-trump-kim-jong-un-north-korea-g7-summit-canada","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/jun/09/donald-trump-kim-jong-un-north-korea-g7-summit-canada","fields":{"headline":"Trump: I'll know whether Kim summit will be successful 'in first minute'","bodyText":"Donald Trump on Saturday said his summit with Kim Jong-un in Singapore would be a “one-time shot”. Speaking to reporters at the G7 summit in La Malbaie, Canada, the US president projected confidence over the prospects for a deal on denuclearization, stating: “I think within the first minute, I’ll know.” “Just my touch, my feel, that’s what I do,” he said. “How long will it take to figure out if they’re serious? You know, the way they say you know if you’re going to like somebody in the first five seconds, you ever hear that one? I think very quickly I’ll know whether or not something good is going to happen.” Trump spoke as he prepared to depart for Singapore and the first meeting between a North Korean leader and a sitting US president. The two leaders’ relationship began with a long period of mutual threats and abuse but a surprise and rapid diplomatic thaw has endured despite Trump’s abrupt cancellation of the summit late last month. “You don’t know, it’s not been done before at this level,” Trump said of attempts to establish peace with a reclusive, authoritarian and nuclear-armed regime. He added: “This is a leader that’s really an unknown personality, people don’t know much about him. I think that he’s going to surprise on the upside, very much on the upside, we’ll see.” The Trump administration has said it wants a “permanent, verifiable, irreversible” dismantling of North Korea’s nuclear weapons program and a peace treaty to formally end the Korean war, which ceased only with an armistice in 1953. “It’s a one-time shot and I think it’s going to work out very well,” Trump said, though he also indicated that the summit may only be a starting point, saying it “may not work out. There’s a good chance it won’t work out. There’s probably an even better chance that it will take a period of time, it’ll be a process.” The president also downplayed suggestions he was not well prepared, a notion he appeared to reinforce earlier this week when he said his approach to the meeting was not about preparation but “about attitude”. Those comments sparked concerns among national security experts that the North Korean leader could outfox his opposite number. “So we’re going in with a very positive spirit, very well prepared, I think,” Trump said, before misidentifying the site of the meeting. “And by the way, we have worked very well with their people, they have many people now in Shanghai, our people have been – in Singapore – our people have been working very, very well with the representatives of North Korea and I think we’re going to come out fine.” Asked about suggestions that even granting a meeting to Kim meant conceding valuable ground, he said: “Only the fake news says that. We just got three hostages back, we paid nothing … we have gotten … we haven’t done anything. The haters, they say, ‘Oh, you’re giving him a meeting’ – gimme a break, OK?” Trump also made lengthy complaints about other countries’ trade policies and doubled down on his claim that Russia should be reinstated to the G7, having been suspended in 2014 after its annexation of Crimea. Trump’s statement on Friday that the Putin regime should be readmitted sparked bipartisan scorn and rebuke from key US allies. “I think it would be an asset to have Russia back in,” Trump told reporters on Saturday. “I think it would be good for the world, I think it would be good for Russia, I think it would be good for the United States, I think it would be good for all of the countries in the G7.” Trump blamed Barack Obama for not doing enough to counter Russian aggression in Ukraine, stating: “Obama can say all he wants but he allowed Russia to take Crimea. I may have had a much different attitude.” Obama condemned Russia’s actions and pursued sanctions against Moscow. Trump also pushed back at suggestions that under his leadership, amid disputes regarding relations with Russia and international trade, the US was becoming isolated from its traditional allies. “I would say the level of relationship is a 10,” he said, claiming “we have a great relationship” with the leaders of countries including Germany, France and Canada. After a prompt from his economic adviser Larry Kudlow, the US president then left the summit."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"artanddesign/2018/jun/10/observer-archive-society-wedding-15-june-1968","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-10T07:00:48Z","webTitle":"Observer picture archive: Society wedding, 15 June 1968","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/jun/10/observer-archive-society-wedding-15-june-1968","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2018/jun/10/observer-archive-society-wedding-15-june-1968","fields":{"headline":"Observer picture archive: Society wedding, 15 June 1968","bodyText":"This report by John Gale was published in the Observer on 16 June 1968 Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother and Princess Margaret arrived at the village church here today in crackling sunlight for the marriage of Miss Sheran Cazalet, daughter of the Queen Mother’s racehorse trainer, Mr Peter Cazalet, to Mr Simon Hornby. At the entrance to the church they climbed from a great maroon Rolls-Royce to the applause of assembled villagers, mainly women, whose summer dresses lined the gravel drive like confetti. The Queen Mother wore a pale-green dress and a pale-green hat trimmed with white, and Princess Margaret wore a bold purple, pink and blue faintly psychedelic outfit. They smiled and looked well. Buttercups shone in the fields nearby. The bride, an old friend of Princess Margaret and a step-granddaughter of P.G. Wodehouse, formerly worked for the BBC. The groom is an executive of W.H. Smith and Son. Not long before the Royal Party, Miss Elizabeth Taylor, Mr Richard Burton and Mr Noël Coward had entered the church, also to applause. Miss Taylor wore a turquoise turban and turquoise outfit with sequins at the hem. Mr Coward had his grey topper at a rakish angle, and he nodded his head like a handsome tortoise as he walked towards the church with small steps, bent slightly forward, his hands halfway into his trouser pockets. Mr Burton had silver sideburns and his long dark hair curled up at the back under his grey topper. Both Mr Coward and Mr Burton looked quite rumpled. ‘Doesn’t Richard look a rascal!’ exclaimed a villager. Some time before the wedding, as the bells pealed, Mr Coward and the Burtons, also in a serpentine Rolls, had drawn up at ‘The Chaser,’ a small pub near the church. Entering the saloon bar, they ordered three vodkas and tonic. ‘Large ones please,’ said Mr Burton, who prepared to pay. But Mr Coward fore-stalled him, saying: ‘I’ve got some money. I’m rich as Croesus.’ They sat down at a table and talked. ‘Those terrible gulls and the sea bashing below…’ Mr Coward said at one point. Later, he remarked: ‘I heard someone say, “I’ll give you three Noël Cowards for one…”’ He looked happy. Miss Taylor looked quite nervous, and Mr Coward said, ‘What are you nervous about? It’s not your wedding.’ ‘That’s why I’m nervous,’ Miss Taylor replied. The bridegroom entered the pub. He was tall and dark, wore a grey morning coat, and carried a red ecclesiastical tome. ‘I love your shirt,’ Miss Taylor said to him. ‘You are kind to come here,’ he said to her. Outside in the sun, the choir, who wore crimsony-mauve, were taking photographs of the famous with small cameras. A large policeman thought that Mr Frank Sinatra and Mr Gregory Peck were coming. But as far as one could see, they didn’t. The service was over sooner than expected. The Queen Mother and Princess Margaret drove off to the reception to more clapping and waving. When the Burtons came out of the church, with Mr Coward just behind, there was near-pandemonium; wise-looking village women rushed forward as though to touch or embrace the Burtons, and the police had to surround them closely and force a way through the boiling throng to the Rolls. At one point Mr Coward, looking surprised and amused, but frail, was jostled by the mob and nearly left behind. ‘Show your ring, Liz,’ the women cried, ‘You’re lovely’.

It’s no Coe-Ovett, Navratilova-Evert, Ali-Frazier. Historically, it’s been just a bit too one-sided. But, as head-to-heads go, there’s plenty of passion, and maybe even animosity, on both sides. You can’t fault it for longevity, either. What started at the World Cup in 1966 will have its latest instalment in Russia over the next five weeks. And millions of us will tune in to watch. It’s BBC v ITV in the battle of the broadcasters, going back and forth until the World Cup final in Moscow on 15 July. The opening shots of this media showdown were fired in mid-May. ITV launched its World Cup trailer, called Forget, first. The film – directed by Hauke Hilberg, who is German – was energetic, wry and modern. It starts with a mural of Bobby Moore’s winning team being painted over and ends with Harry Kane being pursued by three rampaging lions. The BBC responded a few days later with History Will Be Made. This was a more portentous, stately affair, with a soundtrack of the Russian folk song Ochi Chernye in earth-rumbling baritone. You had to marvel at the ambition, though: it featured more than 600 embroideries of key moments from the World Cup, made from 227,000 metres of thread. Both were impressive, but YouTube gave the first round, narrowly, to the BBC: 435,000 views to 362,000 for ITV. This follows a well-established template. Whenever both broadcasters screen the same match – essentially, only the Euro or World Cup finals – the BBC scores significantly higher viewing figures. But ITV clearly has no intention of settling for second best. In November, the network announced it had signed up Sky Sports’ Gary Neville, football’s most admired pundit, for the tournament. A coup for sure and he will be joined on the sofa by a Manchester United-heavy lineup that includes Roy Keane, Ryan Giggs and Patrice Evra. The BBC team will be more familiar from regular Match of the Day duties, but where both channels will be breaking new ground is in their use of female commentators, presenters and pundits. The BBC’s Vicki Sparks will become the first woman to commentate on a World Cup game for British TV during the tournament, which starts on Thursday. Meanwhile, two of England women’s longest-serving players, Alex Scott and Eniola Aluko, will be pundits on the BBC and ITV respectively, while Gabby Logan and Jacqui Oatley will also present. “Gabby Logan and Clare Balding have been a great inspiration for girls coming into the industry but I don’t model myself on anyone,” says Scott, who retired last year with 140 England caps. “What people see on screen is me and my personality. I’m from east London and I’ve got an accent but nobody has tried to make me change it.” Does she feel the pressure of being a trailblazer? “It’s a huge responsibility,” she replies. “I know this is a first for the BBC to have a female pundit at a World Cup and there’s not only that pressure but also the responsibility of inspiring the next generation of females watching me. “Not everyone’s going to make it as an elite footballer but this shows young girls at home that there are other avenues.” Broadcasters’ team sheets The anchors BBC Gary Lineker, the clean-cut England hero from a family of Leicester greengrocers, has become the benchmark for sports presenting. Normally reserved and deferential on TV, his outspoken social-media presence (he’s been called “the voice of liberal Britain”) reveals a more spiky side. ITV Since 2015 Mark Pougatch has been the frontman and he performs the role with smooth competence. Trained for decades at the BBC, his knowledge is deep and he will be a reliable link to the pundits. Who has the edge? BBC The pundits BBC Its pundits have always felt like a tight club and recently it has added strong new members. Frank Lampard has been excellent on Match of the Day, likewise Rio Ferdinand. For the World Cup, they’ll be joined by Didier Drogba, Jürgen Klinsmann and Pablo Zabaleta, a charismatic Argentinian now at West Ham. Alex Scott, formerly of Arsenal women, has been building experience on Football Focus and the women’s FA Cup coverage. ITV While the BBC’s pundits are unquestionably solid, there’s a loose-cannon appeal to ITV’s line-up. Gary Neville is unquestionably the star addition, but Roy Keane can be as fierce as he was on the pitch and Martin O’Neill, Slaven Bilić and Patrice Evra all bring strong personalities. Eniola Aluko, who off the field is a lawyer and has been a guest editor on Woman’s Hour, rounds off an exciting, unpredictable team. Who has the edge? ITV The tech BBC This World Cup will see some technological firsts. All 33 matches will be available in ultra HD and high dynamic range (although only for a limited number of people, first-come, first-served). Also, via their app, you can watch matches in virtual reality, almost – but not quite – as if you are in a private box at a Russian stadium. ITV– Promises its biggest and best digital offering, though it’s low-tech compared with the Beeb. One element will be a collaboration with the F2 – aka freestylers Billy Wingrove and Jeremy Lynch – who have a reach of more than 50 million followers from their social-media platforms. F2 will create packages of goals, mixed with their usual tricks and stunts. Who has the edge?

Music, emotion, football, Italy – then the epicentre for glamorous football – what more could one possibly want from life? The added wonder of Italia 90, not that we really knew it then, was that it was the last of the old-style tournaments, a voyage of footballing discovery. Many players and teams and formations were barely known outside each home country, before football’s globalisation and monetisation really began to soar. Italia 90 was the last tournament that was easily accessible to the ordinary fan – not overpriced and not over-organised or sponsored to within an inch of its life. So it was possible to watch Cameroon beat Argentina in the opening game on telly, make an instant decision to go, and wake up the following morning in Turin on the day of Brazil v Sweden. Brazil being Brazil, those tickets came with a price hike but Scotland v Costa Rica, a day later, was easy. Word of mouth took us to a bar selling at face value. Bingo. This may not necessarily be a match worthy of the pantheon of classics but symbolically it represented a rite of glorious passage: simply going to the World Cup. Scotland’s fans were pink and joyous in the heat. Their team were ponderous, though, and Costa Rica beat them thanks to a slick passing move embellished with a brilliant backheel when Juan “The Kid” Cayasso scored their first ever World Cup goal. 1998: The Edmundo team-sheet The old maxim about the Netherlands being the best team never to have won the World Cup might mostly refer to the 1970s but one could also make a case for 1998. They took part in a couple of stellar knockout games while the heat beat into Marseille’s then-roofless Vélodrome. The Dennis Bergkamp goal to defeat Argentina was an instant classic, mixing all the coolness of refined one-touch technique with the madness of the dramatic last-minute punch. Then came a riveting semi-final against Brazil. The Dutch shaded it but Brazil won it. After extra time. In a shootout. Brazil were reigning champions, back in the final, with the best player in the world – Ronaldo – central to their status as favourites against the host nation. France’s tournament had grown as both a sporting and social movement, gaining momentum and gathering positivity along the way, but would home advantage be enough? The final was shaped by an extraordinary episode. Ronaldo suffered an unexplained seizure. At the time the official team-sheets were handed out Ronaldo was out of the final with Edmundo selected in his place. But in a sudden flurry, an hour before kick-off, new team-sheets arrived with Ronaldo reinstated. He played as if in a semi‑daze on a night that would belong to France and their own icon, Zinedine Zidane. 2002: The South Korean miracle The message “Again 1966” spelled out in giant letters behind the goal added to the sense of high theatre. South Korea had fallen in love with football during the summer of 2002 and the entire nation apparently stopped to see if its Red Devils could emulate the legend of the North Koreans, who scripted one of the World Cup’s unlikeliest upsets in the distant past, beating Italy 1-0 at Ayresome Park – when news of that feat was censored in the South. The poignancy shuddered through the stadium in Daejeon. As World Cup co-hosts, South Koreans ventured out into the streets to watch games as a communal experience. Youngsters screamed if they saw the players. An estimated 98.3% of households who turned on their television sets on the night of South Korea v Italy tuned in for this game. It did not start well. Ahn Jung-hwan squandered a penalty and Christian Vieri’s header gave Italy the lead. But then the pendulum swung. South Korea equalised, Francesco Totti was sent off and Damiano Tomassi saw a goal mysteriously disallowed. The stage was too perfect for Ahn, the penalty villain who had played in Serie A, to glance in a golden goal. “After scoring I couldn’t hear anything,” said Ahn. “I was dumbfounded.” Weren’t we all? 2006: The master’s meltdown In many ways I felt fortunate to be at the final in Berlin, mostly because a colleague from La Gazzetta dello Sport grabbed me round the neck and lost all self-control as he vigorously celebrated Fabio Grosso’s emphatic goal to tilt a brilliant semi-final against Germany. That was perhaps the game of the tournament, one of those where one wonders if the final can match the compelling energy of the semi. Italy’s opponents were Zidane’s France. It was inevitable the spiritual leader of Les Bleus would be centre of attention. He had come back from international retirement alongside two other golden oldies, Lilian Thuram and Claude Makélélé, to help the team when France were in such a state they were about to flunk qualification. Zidane delivered masterclasses in the knock-out games. Watch his absolute supremacy against Spain. See him pirouette against Brazil. Then he scored the penalty to decide the semi-final against Portugal. The script for the final, his farewell, was perfect. Enter Marco Materazzi, and a few choice words from the Italian defender. The twist in the tale lurched suddenly and brutally. Zidane’s red mist descended, his head steamed into Materazzi. The image as he walked past the trophy on the side of the pitch en route to the dressing room remains breathtaking. 2014: The match-winning tackle The nature of the geography and scheduling of tournaments is that, while sometimes one can feel elated to be at the game of the day or the round, at other times one can find oneself undeniably at the wrong game. Come the semi-finals, there seemed nothing inherently wrong with Argentina v the Netherlands at the Maracanã – except, as it turned out, the other semi was one of the most surreal games in World Cup history. Everyone remembers where they were during Germany 7-1 Brazil and I was in a different city watching the game on telly. The morning after the night before, the poor Brazilians who had to pass near the stretch of beach occupied by the thousands of Argentinians who had driven over for their semi-final had to endure the kind of teasing that requires more than one hand to tot up the scoreline. Then Argentina and the Netherlands took their turn and slugged it out. It was not a memorable game but it was perhaps defined by a memorable moment that sums up how great teams need not only matchwinners but matchwinner-deniers. In the 90th minute Arjen Robben hared towards goal and it took a monumental effort from Javier Mascherano, who had some catching-up to do on the chase against a faster player, to reach his opponent before dispossessing him with a clean, brilliantly timed, last-ditch tackle. Mascherano later admitted he injured a painful and personal part of his anatomy in doing so. Without putting his body on the line they would not have reached the final."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/live/2018/jun/10/canadian-grand-prix-f1-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-10T19:53:13Z","webTitle":"Sebastian Vettel takes championship lead after Canada GP win – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2018/jun/10/canadian-grand-prix-f1-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/live/2018/jun/10/canadian-grand-prix-f1-live","fields":{"headline":"Sebastian Vettel takes championship lead after Canada GP win – as it happened","bodyText":"Read Giles Richards’s race report: Sebastian Vettel speaks, after his 50th GP win. “I said yesterday how much this place means to Ferrari,” he says. “To have a race like we had today is unbelievable. After a long stretch without a win here, we’re all happy. It’s a day to remember the great Gilles Villeneuve. Everybody will have a blast tonight. There’s still a long way [to go in the championship].” Valtteri Bottas, the Mercedes who finished second, says: “From P2, I think we maxxed out so we were happy.” Max Verstappen, the Red Bull who secured a podium finish, adds: “It was good, I enjoyed it.” Vettel wins at a canter. A timely, morale-boosting Ferrari success. Race result: 1 Vettel 2 Bottas 3 Verstappen 4 Ricciardo 5 Hamilton 6 Räikkönen “Grazie,” shouts Vettel, before breezing into a little dance in the Ferrari. Happy days for them after their first win in Canada since 2004. Not so for Hamilton, who surrenders his lead at the top of the drivers’ championship after finishing fifth. Qualifying was close, but the race was a foregone conclusion once the safety car departed. The chequered flag is raised prematurely, by the model Winnie Harlow, for a moment angering the German. But, that’s job done, he’s over the line and retakes the championship lead. From start to finish, Vettel has done a fine, professional job in Montreal. Lap 69/70: Now is the time for the spectacular ... Lap 68/70: “Hopefully Daniel [Ricciardo] has got Lewis [Hamilton] covered, it’s all about if Max [Verstappen] can get to Valtteri [Bottas],” Christian Horner says. “It’s a straight fight now.” The only man breathing easily in the top five at the moment is surely the race leader, Sebastian Vettel. He’s cruising out there. Lap 67/70: Verstappen has surrendered a little time in the middle sector to Bottas. Hamilton, for a moment, eyes up a challenge on Ricciardo but he doesn’t seem to have the grip to cause him problems upon the exit of the hairpin. Lap 66/70: 1 Vettel 2 Bottas 3 Verstappen 4 Ricciardo 5 Hamilton 6 Raikkonen The top six look nailed on; can anything change from here on in? Lap 64/70: “Leave me alone,” Hulkenberg urges down the team radio, when warned that Ocon is breathing down Sainz’s neck. Lap 63/70: If Hamilton stays fifth, and Vettel retains his lead, the Briton will concede his lead at the top of the drivers’ championship this evening. A win for Vettel, as it stands, would nudge him a point ahead of the Mercedes. Lap 62/70: The Haas of Grosjean is catching Gasly, in 11th. Lap 61/70: Not an awful lot of movement at the front, with Vettel opening up his legs and extending his lead in front of Bottas to almost 8secs. Lap 60/70: Crikey, Hulkenberg trails Raikkonen by nigh on 59secs. Seventeen drivers remain out on track, with Alonso, Stroll and Hartley, the latter who has gone to hospital for routine checks after that clash, having already exited. Stroll, meanwhile, is debriefing his version of events to the baying media. Lap 59/70: Renault are having a good day in seventh and eighth, but they are still getting lapped out there; a sign of the pace in Montreal. Everybody has been lapped, right up until Hulkenberg in seventh. Lap 58/70: And Hamilton is within DRS zone of Hamilton. Is it all a little too late for the Mercedes? A reminder that he trails Ricciardo by 1.3secs. Lap 57/70: Vettel has just set a new fastest lap. Lovely jubbly. Lap 56/70: Bottas might be left to rue that clumsy error, bumbling off track for a moment after soaring beyond Sainz. The gap to Vettel is back over five seconds, approaching 5.6secs. Can he cut the margin to the Ferrari? Lap 55/70: Now Bottas makes a mistake when faced with Carlos Sainz, who is down in eighth. He has just lost 1.8secs on Vettel in a sluggish first sector ... Lap 54/70: The gap between Bottas and Vettel? 3.6secs. And Vettel needs to re-engage, bogged down by lapping those cumbersome back markers. Can Bottas assault the Ferrari? Lap 53/70: Vettel has just lapped Ocon. “Pretty sure there was more overtakes at Monaco race then there has been this race so far ... “ tweets Lando Norris, the F2 driver. “We are fighting for points,” 11th-placed Gasly is told over the team radio. Lap 52/70: Verstappen fancies a run at Bottas, who has just set a new fastest lap. As for Ricciardo, he’s opened up a small gap between him and Hamilton. Lap 51/70: Exhaust failure, according to Renault, forced Alonso out. Lap 50/70: And, finally, Romain Grosjean pits! He’s got rid of the ultrasofts and he will run out in 12th. “Did you see what Ocon did?” Grosjean says upon entry into the pits, with the Force India cutting it fine as he flew past him. Lap 49/70: Hamilton is 1.5secs behind Ricciardo, in fourth. Lap 47/70: Vettel leads, and it’s still business as usual. As it stands, he could nip in front of Lewis Hamilton in the drivers’ championship. Lap 45/70: Christian Horner, the Red Bull chief, admits they are being a little bit conservative with the tyres at the moment, with Verstappen not exactly bearing down on Bottas in second. He’s 6.4secs behind, with Ricciardo, his team-mate, trailing him. And now Perez pits once more. Lap 43/70: Where does Alonso go from here? Le Mans, next weekend. That must nudge him another step closer to Indy 500. Lap 42/70: Disaster for Fernando Alonso, who is forced to retire on his 300th grand prix meeting. That sinking feeling strikes again for the Renault. Ah, that’s miserable. He comes into the pits, lifts his visor and looks absolutely seething. At the front, what can Mercedes and Red Bull do to hound down Vettel? He has led from pole but, listen to this, Ferrari have not won in Canada since Michael Schumacher in 2004. Vettel looks good for his first win in five. Lap 41/70: Raikkonen has sensor alarms going off in his Ferrari but he is reassured, over the team radio, that they are unconcerned about his car’s temperature. Lap 40/70: Romain Grosjean, whose engine blew up yesterday, has not stopped on the ultrasoft. It’s the motor-racing equivalent of goal-hanging. Lap 39/70: Sergio Perez is chasing Gasly from 14th, having never recovered from that clash with Carlos Sainz on the opening lap. He has work to do. Lap 38/70: The gap between Vettel and Bottas? 5.6secs. Lap 37/70: Vettel is tucked up with back markers of sorts, with Fernando Alonso in 11th for company ... that’s until the Ferrari trundles into the pits. That is 21 laps later than Hamilton and those pesky Red Bulls. Vettel goes on to the supersofts. Lap 36/70: Hamilton remember has six wins in Montreal. A seventh looks elusive at the moment. Bottas is told to box by Mercedes, and he’s flown into the pits. Lap 35/70: At the halfway mark, we’re as we started in many ways, with Vettel dictating the pace at the front of the pack. Raikkonen, meanwhile, has just set the fastest lap on those new grooving tyres. He has his eyes on Hamilton. Lap 34/70: Vettel leads Bottas by 5.7secs, and then Verstappen is almost 24secs behind the Mercedes. Oh, and Michael Douglas is here. Lap 33/70: And here comes Kimi Raikkonen into the pits, making his way out on the supersofts ... and Sergey Sorotkin’s attempt to get out of the way almost blocked Lewis Hamilton’s path. “I’m giving it everything already,” a moody Hamilton steams down the team radio. Hamilton – just – remains in front of Raikkonen, who had done a solid, slick job in the pits. Lap 31/70: Surely Raikkonen will pit soon and chop in the ultrasofts. He’s 14 seconds behind Bottas. The leading Ferrari however, Sebastian Vettel, is making light work of this, having just lapped Stoffel Vandoorne. Lap 30/70: As it stands in Montreal; 1 Vettel 2 Bottas 3 Raikkonen 4 Verstappen 5 Ricciardo 6 Hamilton. “Why did we pit so early?” Hamilton asks. “We needed to sort this PU problem – it’s helped,” the race engineer replies. Lap 28/70: Ocon and Grosjean are battling it out for ninth, but he cannot clear the Haas. Ocon’s pursuit of Hulkenberg and Sainz needs to think of a route through. Lap 27/70: “You are still half a second quicker than the cars that have changed tyres,” Bottas is told by Mercedes. Vettel is cruising out in front. There’s no one to worry him at the moment, with Bottas nearest, trailing by 3.5secs. Fernando Alonso, meanwhile, has surged past Charles Leclerc and into 11th. Lap 26/70: When Raikkonen pits, that will surely provide another slice of action. An easy overtake for Sainz, past Romain Grosjean, who’s racing lightly. Lap 24/70: Things are looking good for Ferrari, with Vettel out in front, controlling the race and Raikkonen 17secs behind, in third, with Bottas sandwiched in between. Hamilton is down in sixth, behind the Red Bull pair. Ricciardo and Verstappen are cruising, eking out what they can from their tyres. Lap 23/70: Magnussen heads for the pits, so Ocon nips in front into 11th. Lap 22/70: It is another wretched afternoon for Williams, who are devoid of anything positive to cling on to really. Their remaining car in this race is down in 16th, with Sergey Sirotkin trailing Sergio Perez. Lap 21/70: Brendon Hartley shrugs his shoulders, jumps on the golf buggy and he’s heading back to the pits. His race finished on the opening lap, squeezed up against the wall by Lance Stroll. “He had made such a good start,” says Clare Williams. “Lance was minding his own business.” Lap 20/70: “We’re on Plan B,” Vettel says down the team radio, though it very much looks like Plan A out there, with Vettel the quickest man out there since the get-go. He’s sitting pretty ahead of Bottas, with Raikkonen third. Lap 19/70: Red Bull pat each other on the back, with Hamilton’s pace having hurt him as Ricciardo slides in front of Hamilton out of the pits. They’re both on supersofts. “Good stuff,” Ricciardo says. Toto Wolff does not look quite so enthused. Lap 18/70: And now in comes Ricciardo ... Lap 17/70: Hamilton and Verstappen pit, with supersofts going on. Hamilton wobbles his way out of the pit, slow and wide as he trudges out. Lap 16/70: “Looks like Lewis is struggling a bit,” Ricciardo, in fifth, tells Red Bull over the team radio. The gist of the reply is, go and get him son. He’s 0.7secs behind the wobbling Mercedes, which is struggling with grip on ultrasofts. Lap 15/70: Vettel is ahead by 4.4secs, with fourth-placed Hamilton 10.6secs off the lead. Sainz and Hulkenberg, meanwhile, exit the pits. Lap 13/70: Verstappen is told Bottas’s tyres are on the verge of overheating. How Red Bull know Mercedes have problems is difficult to know, but either way, they may have at least found a way to soothe him. Hulkenberg, caught up behind Ocon, has ditched the hypersoft for the supersofts in search of pace. Plenty of early pitting. The tyres aren’t working out, unless you’re Vettel, on the ultrasofts. Lap 11/70: “I’m really being held up here,” moans Hulkenberg, with Ocon almost 4secs in front of him. It’s seemingly more a case of he cannot find a route past him. Ocon, though, promptly heads for the pits. Lap 10/70: Perez comes into the pits in search of damage limitation. Can he do 60 laps on the newly-fitted supersofts? It’s a gamble but he has to do something to salvage a result in Montreal. Elsewhere, Verstappen has lost ground on Bottas, with the Mercedes trailing the race leader Vettel, who sets a new fastest lap. Lap 8/70: Leclerc and Alonso are having a ding-dong, but the McLaren is forced wide in his attempts to breeze beyond the Sauber. Lap 7/70: “I’m having drop outs of power guys,” Hamilton says down the team radio. That doesn’t sound brilliant battery-wise for Mercedes. Lap 6/70: Vettel is leading the way, almost 1.7secs ahead of Bottas in second. Behind him, there’s Verstappen and then Hamilton. Lap 5/70: Perez v Sainz is being investigated, as is that Hartley-Stroll incident with the next race, the France GP at Circuit Paul Ricard, in mind. Lap 4/70: Nuggets of information down the respective Toro Rosso and Williams’ team radios. “I’m fine, he just ran me out of road,” says Brendon Hartley. As for Lance Stroll: “I had a puncture,” comes the message. And as the race restarts, Perez goes wide in the Force India, those icy tyres and brakes catching him cold. Sainz, in turn, has taken a thud from Perez. Lap 3/70: The front six remain in the same order as they left the grid, with Vettel still leading and, despite that bustling between Bottas and a revved-up Verstappen, Mercedes clung on to second. The fun and games will presumably begin again at the restart. Lap 2/70: The safety car is out leading the pack after that hoo-ha on the first corner. That might benefit those a little skinny on fuel. Lap 1/70: A lively start ends with Hartley and Stroll, the local lad, both trudging back to the pits. That’s their race run. Put that stash of Canada flags away. And away they go, with Bottas and Verstappen going wheel-to-wheel in the first corner. But the Mercedes puts his elbows out and retains second. Ah, and for the second race running, Brendon Hartley is out after crashing into Lance Stroll, who left him no room whatsoever. Other than that, not a lot going on ... We’re almost there ... as the formation lap draws to a climax. Martin Brundle has just done a marvellous gridwalk; he just bumped into “Bono” (Peter Bennington), Hamilton’s race engineer, as well as NBA’s Serge Ibaka, and Winnie Harlow, who he interrupted while she was talking to the Arsenal defender Héctor Bellerín. Anyway, here comes a spine-tingling national anthem of sorts. Before the get-go, a reminder of the drivers’ standings: 1 L Hamilton 110pts 2 S Vettel 96 3 D Ricciardo 72 4 V Bottas 68 5 K Räikkönen 60 6 M Verstappen 35 With that in mind, a bit more from Vettel, who starts on pole. “It’s a long race here, a lot of laps, a lot of things to look out for,” he says. “In terms of race pace, as we’ve seen many times this year, it’s very close between the three teams and between the six drivers so we will see, but for sure if you start on pole you want to win.” A word on Lewis Hamilton, who has a habit of coming up trumps in Canada; he is looking for his seventh victory at an electrifying circuit Gilles Villeneuve, a record that would match Michael Schumacher’s numbers here. Five of those came from pole, one from second in 2012. But, to savour another win here, Hamilton will have to become only the second man to win from fourth on the grid in Montreal (Gerhard Berger did it last, in 1992). Hamilton looks relaxed, though, and has been chatting with the Seattle Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson, among the guests trackside. Time for a few soundbites; Vettel has been flying the Ferrari flag out on the circuit. “There’s so much support for us, which is incredible,” he says. “So many passionate fans. Thanks for coming out on a beautiful day, and we hope to make it more beautiful.” Daniel Ricciardo, meanwhile, has been chatting about his own biggest fans – his parents – after they celebrated with him last weekend. “The last time they were there for a win was 2014 in Spa,” he says. “To win Monaco with their presence was huge. They have been part of the journey from day one.” As for Alonso, making that special bow, he says: “I think today’s a perfect day for the 300 and now we need to execute the race properly.” 1 Vettel 2 Bottas 3 Verstappen 4 Hamilton 5 Räikkönen 6 Ricciardo 7 Hulkenberg 8 Ocon 9 Sainz 10 Pérez 11 Magnussen 12 Hartley 13 Leclerc 14 Alonso 15 Vandoorne 16 Gasly 17 Stroll 18 Sirotkin 19 Ericsson 20 Grosjean Sebastian Vettel will start on pole, confident in the knowledge that he could have fared even better in qualifying, boasting he could have gone “even faster”. A glorious day in Montreal provides the German with the chance to show as much, with Valtteri Bottas second, Max Verstappen third and Lewis Hamilton fourth on the grid respectively. It’s a race that is poised nicely: Ferrari-Mercedes-Red Bull-Mercedes-Ferrari-Red Bull, a love-in of sorts. One man determined to celebrate, despite beginning his 300th grand prix meeting down in 14th after a miserable Q1 is Fernando Alonso. “I am one of the best to have raced in F1,” the Spaniard mused earlier this week. “I am probably not fastest in qualifying, or the wet, but I am 9.5 in all areas. I try to benefit from that.” An engine failure on Saturday means Romain Grosjean will start as the back marker. The racing at Circuit Gilles Villeneuve is scarcely dull.

Arron Banks came on to the political scene suddenly in 2014, when he agreed to donate £1m to Ukip. He had planned to give £100,000, but upped the amount after the former Conservative leader William Hague said he had not heard of him. Colourful and outspoken, Banks quickly became a key figure in Ukip, close to the then party leader, Nigel Farage, and was part of the group who visited Donald Trump at Trump Tower shortly after his presidential election victory in November 2016. Banks owns the insurance company GoSkippy and gave £9m to the Leave.EU and Grassroots Out Brexit campaigns, mostly in the form of loans and branded merchandise. His wife, Katya, was born in Russia. They have three children and have been married since 2001. What is he alleged to have done? Emails leaked to the Observer and the Sunday Times reveal Banks, Farage’s main financial backer in the run-up to the EU referendum, had far more extensive contacts with Russian officials than he previously claimed. The emails show he met the Russian ambassador to the UK, Alexander Yakovenko, three times, rather than once, that Banks shared at least one phone number for the Trump transition team with the Russians, and that he was offered the chance to participate in a goldmining deal in Russia, although it is not clear whether he took this up. Why are the leaks so serious? There has been persistent speculation about Banks’s relationship with Russian officials in the UK since he disclosed that he and his colleague Andy Wigmore had a “six-hour boozy lunch” with the Russian ambassador on 6 November 2015. But Banks has now been forced to admit the contacts were deeper than previously stated. They also met the ambassador on 17 November 2015, when the gold deal was mentioned, and again in November 2016, three days after visiting Trump. The disclosures raise questions as to whether he participated in or profited from the proposed mining agreement with Siman Povarenkin, a Russian businessman introduced to him by the ambassador, and whether he passed on any valuable political information in the three meetings. How did the emails emerge? The emails from Banks and key associates were collected by the journalist Isabel Oakeshott, who knows Banks well. She was the ghostwriter of his book The Bad Boys of Brexit, a diary of the period leading up to the EU referendum, and collected the emails as part of background research at the time. Oakeshott said she only gradually appreciated their significance and was planning to publish them at a later date as part of a separate book she had been working on with the Conservative donor Lord Ashcroft about the “state of the British armed forces”. She said some of her emails were hacked, but this has been denied by others who had obtained them. They were leaked first to the Observer, and then, seemingly with Oakeshott’s approval and Banks’s acquiescence, to the Sunday Times. What happens next? Banks and Wigmore, who was present or involved in many of the meetings with the Russians, are due to give evidence to a select committee on Tuesday morning. They had suggested on Friday that they were not going to appear, but as the emails emerged, they changed their minds. MPs on the digital, culture, media and sport committee, who have the protection of parliamentary privilege, had been expected to focus on Banks’s links to Russia, including the provenance of his wealth. He is also subject to an Electoral Commission inquiry into the “true source” of his donations. Leave.EU has been fined £70,000 for accounting irregularities. The organisation’s chief executive, Liz Bilney, another Banks associate, is under police investigation. Theresa May has said if there are any allegations that need investigation she is sure “the proper authorities will do that”. Did Farage know about the Russian connections? There is nothing specific in the emails about Farage’s knowledge of the additional Russian contacts. But they will raise questions for the former Ukip leader to answer. Farage has previously said Vladimir Putin is the world leader he most admires."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jun/11/french-surrealism-big-chains-high-streets-small-business","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-11T09:00:15Z","webTitle":"Why a little French surrealism (not big chains) can save our high streets | Andy Merrifield","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/11/french-surrealism-big-chains-high-streets-small-business","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/11/french-surrealism-big-chains-high-streets-small-business","fields":{"headline":"Why a little French surrealism (not big chains) can save our high streets","bodyText":"Growing up in Liverpool in the 1970s, I remember a time when you couldn’t get a decent cup of coffee anywhere. This was very troubling for me, a wannabe French surrealist shacked up in gloomy Garston. Those surrealists used to drink a lot of coffee. They liked to talk and hang out in cafes. And with all that caffeine inside them, afterwards they liked to walk the city streets. In those streets, they said, you could discover novelty and chance encounter. That’s the meaning of life in the city, they said, novelty. A bit later, I read Jane Jacobs. She wrote a great book in the early 1960s called The Death and Life of Great American Cities. Jacobs drank more gin than coffee. She particularly liked her local – New York’s White Horse Tavern, on the same Greenwich Village block she lived. Jacobs didn’t much like what planners had done to cities both sides of the Atlantic, nor what they were to mastermind. They peddled the silly idea that functional separation was the way forward, that spaces should have mono-uses – work here, residence there, leisure someplace else. Jacobs said this destroyed the mixed land uses and diversity that made neighbourhoods vibrant, that brought life to cities of all shapes and sizes. The city block that worked best, she said, was the block “with high-yield, middling-yield, low-yield, and no-yield enterprises”. Decades on, weird things have happened to our cities. Since Margaret Thatcher’s day, we have not had much planning of the sort Jacobs dissed. The “free” market has decided things. And the free market soon discovered coffee. We have more places nowadays to drink coffee than the surrealist could ever have imagined. We know something’s up when Whitbread, the brewery group, started shutting its pubs and diversified into coffee, supplying us with a Costa on every street corner – or on every other street corner, next to every Co-op, with a Starbucks and Caffè Nero close by. The surrealists can get their caffeine rush. But where, afterwards, would they wander, for that novelty and fleeting delight? Once the famine, lately the feast, an orgy of sameness. Steadily but surely, up and down the country, in that free market our big cites and little towns have become alike. Predictable chain stores dominate, too ubiquitous to mention. Yet now, amid the grumbles, chain giants have had enough, aren’t making enough. So they’re closing stores down in selected towns and cities. Marks &amp; Spencer, as part of its “radical restructuring plan”, will close 100 stores by 2022, risking 2,000 jobs – House of Fraser is closing 31 stores with thousands more jobs on the line. Can’t live with them, can’t live without them. The high street we once knew as predictable and boring is destined to become something worse: deserted, boarded-up and jobless. Our public spaces are sterile or else sterile wildernesses. What’s gone wrong? What can be done? I’m old enough to blame it all on Thatcherism. Planning was bad, but no planning is worse. Though it’s not that there isn’t any planning; more our local authority planners seem to be bought off by those same big, rich chains. Meanwhile, honest planners haven’t been very imaginative. They need to read more French surrealism. And more Jane Jacobs. Nor has the free market been very free. Our cities these days are arenas for high-yields only, for gleaning land rent, for making property pay any way it can. People are priced off the land. Only rich companies can afford to stay put. They monopolise and drive out smaller businesses. At the same time, they abandon areas not worth investing in. Rich people and rich companies see city real estate and central locations as ever more profitable financial investments. After they have driven away competitors, they rule. In the mix, there’s not much mix. And when they overextend, they downsize, leaving people with no alternative. Can’t central government empower local authorities to empower local, independent businesses? Real empowerment, I mean – empowerment of ideas. Many people, lacking money capital, have capital inside their heads awaiting realisation. That’s the alternative. That’s the opportunity. Cities and small towns have lacked any sense of participatory democracy for a long while, and chains are a sure way to foster disempowerment in work and in urban life. Can planners and architects recreate vibrant high street social spaces? Maybe. But what’s needed isn’t an architecture of elitist celebration or bland conformism, but an architecture that creates the conditions for innovative action to occur – action that connects ordinary people, that hooks people up together and helps install new imaginative sorts of urban spaces. Our retreat to online shopping is merely a symptom of high street alienation. Yet it isn’t hi-tech urban design that’s at stake; more low-budget city acupuncture, of finding new ways to recreate old stuff, of poking into things meticulously and lovingly to enable sociability – not rolling in roughshod with the bulldozer or with a new Tesco superstore. Some people call this weak architecture: it’s the opposite of designing and constructing immense buildings. It’s about nurturing activities in between strong buildings. It’s more about nurturing street space, developing floor space, re-energising vacant units and dormant high streets, subverting what’s within those spectacular projects. It’s about shaking up the very foundations upon which strong buildings are built. That’s weak architecture’s strength. The essential thing is to construct a human space in which experiential communication can be most effectively transmitted. Physicality morphs into sociality. The more we stay passive objects along a supermarket aisle, the less we actively participate in the production of our own life. Then, things get done to us rather than by us. Our own ability to realise ourselves, to affirm ourselves, is stunted. We’re talking about a new value system for our cites and small towns; it’s nothing official, not as yet, but a sovereignty constituted by a going back to the future, back in the sense that the building block for this empowerment is the ancient ideal of a citadin, a person belonging to the city, a citizen belonging to la cité, like the surrealists said – after drinking a lot of coffee. • Andy Merrifield is an urban theorist and author"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/jun/10/uk-firms-to-be-forced-to-justify-pay-gap-between-bosses-and-staff","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-10T14:53:45Z","webTitle":"UK firms to be forced to justify pay gap between bosses and staff","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jun/10/uk-firms-to-be-forced-to-justify-pay-gap-between-bosses-and-staff","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/jun/10/uk-firms-to-be-forced-to-justify-pay-gap-between-bosses-and-staff","fields":{"headline":"UK firms to be forced to justify pay gap between bosses and staff","bodyText":"The country’s biggest public businesses will have to publish the gap between the pay of their chief executive and an average worker, according to rules to be unveiled in parliament on Monday. Greg Clark, the business secretary, said directors of all companies with more than 250 employees would be required to disclose and explain this difference, known as the “pay ratio”. The long-awaited plans have been criticised by Labour and trade unions for failing to tackle the “entrenched inequality” within Britain’s biggest firms. Shareholders have become increasingly vocal over executive pay levels, and have voted against what they see as excessive pay awards, most notably the high sums paid to the former WPP boss Sir Martin Sorrell. As well as introducing the publication of pay ratios, the rules will also require listed companies to show what effect an increase in share prices will have on executive pay, in order to inform shareholders when voting on long-term incentive plans. Subject to parliamentary approval, companies would start reporting their pay ratios in 2020. Clark said: “Most of the UK’s largest companies get their business practices right, but we understand the anger of workers and shareholders when bosses’ pay is out of step with company performance.” The move comes after years of shareholder and public outrage over bumper chief executive pay at firms such as Persimmon and BP. Shell, Lloyds, AstraZeneca, Playtech, William Hill, GVC, and Inmarsat are among firms who have been subject to shareholder revolts at AGMs this year. Last week, housebuilder Persimmon admitted a raft of failures that led to an embarrassing shareholder rebellion over pay for top executives of more than £100m. Rebecca Long Bailey, the shadow business and industrial secretary, said the Conservatives had missed an opportunity, and pointed out the rule changes had been announced by the government before. “This won’t end staggering pay disparity or help hard-up workers at the bottom of the chain,” she said. The TUC general secretary, Frances O’Grady, said publishing and justifying pay ratios was a first step, but more was needed. “Fat-cat bosses are masters of self-justification and shrugging off public outcry. New rules are needed to make sure they change. “We need guaranteed places for worker representatives on boardroom pay committees. That would bring a bit of common sense and fairness to decision-making when boardroom pay packets are approved,” she said. The plans have received a cautious welcome from some equal pay campaigners, business and investor groups. Chris Cummings, the chief executive of the Investment Association, said investors wanted greater director accountability and more transparency over executive remuneration. “Investors will expect boards to articulate why the ratio is right for the company and how directors are fulfilling their duties,” he said. The director of the High Pay Centre, Luke Hildyard, said pay ratios could prove useful to investors, workers and society more broadly. “We hope that [the move] will initiate a more informed debate about what represents fair, proportionate pay for workers at all levels,” he said. The Confederation of British Industry’s Matthew Fell said high pay was only ever justified by outstanding performance. “This legislation can help to develop a better dialogue between boards and employees about the goals and aspirations of their business, and how pay is determined to achieve this shared vision.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jun/08/sex-and-the-city-dated-jokes-diversity","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-08T12:18:40Z","webTitle":"Sex and the City is too good to be written off as just ‘dated’ | Rebecca Nicholson","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/08/sex-and-the-city-dated-jokes-diversity","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/08/sex-and-the-city-dated-jokes-diversity","fields":{"headline":"Sex and the City is too good to be written off as just ‘dated’","bodyText":"Sex and the City made its TV debut two decades ago, in 1998, in the same year as Dawson’s Creek and Will &amp; Grace (in the UK, we saw the beginnings of The Royle Family and Dinnerladies – just as iconic, if more casually attired). Big Brother was yet to appear and change the very nature of what viewers expected from on-screen drama, but in the late 90s Sex and the City was a phenomenon, a foul-mouthed and frank hit, an aspirational template for living (if eating expensive cupcakes in designer dresses and going to slick parties full of icy rich people was the kind of thing you aspired to). These strengths also became its downfall, at least in terms of its reputation. For many women of my generation, slightly too young to have anything to grab on to in those “are you a Charlotte or a Miranda?” conversations, Sex and the City became a spectre of the powerhouse it must have been and, at times, almost a punchline. The cupcakes, shoes and shopping that coloured its world became the focal point, beating the funny and sometimes brutal candour of what was happening to these women into a misremembered cartoonish shape. As is often the way with interests that are seen as more “female” – such as fashion and make-up – there’s an assumption of frivolity, that it must lack heft. By 2010, Sex and the City had been sunk further by a mediocre if massively successful film, and a truly terrible sequel which managed to betray everything the show had been and include a mortifying storyline in which Samantha “liberates” women wearing burqas and finds that they, like, totally love fashion too. In 2013, Emily Nussbaum wrote a brilliant essay for the New Yorker that argued for its restoration as a TV great. She pointed out that Carrie Bradshaw was the first female anti-hero, and that, until the very end when Carrie landed Big, it played with the conventions of romantic comedy, rather than adhering to them. In 2016, Sex and the City’s creator, Darren Star, admitted that its ending was not what he wanted for the series: “I think the show ultimately betrayed what it was about, which was that women don’t ultimately find happiness from marriage.” I had not seen the show itself for a number of years, until a recent long-ish flight in which Sex and the City reruns were the only watchable thing on offer. (Even after all of HBO’s achievements, and all the great shows it has produced in the past 20 years, I still anticipate that the opening piano bars of the SATC theme tune will follow whenever I hear the fuzzy chord of the network play.) I settled in for six hours of it, and although the swearing and the sex had largely been chopped out – if you’ve ever tried to listen to a clean version of a Lil’ Kim album on Spotify, the experience is not dissimilar – it was a reminder that it was, and is, a brilliant, daring, pioneering show. It’s desperately dated, in many ways. It has a jarring lack of diversity, and plenty of its jokes would not pass muster in this era of scrutiny (at one point in the second season, Samantha locks horns with a housekeeper called Sum; “She wasn’t so dim, that Sum,” goes the voiceover). There’s a lot of smoking, and a lot of smoking inside. I was struck by the general lack of anxiety in the air, by the gleeful abandon of a wealthy lifestyle that, in these frugal times, seems even more removed and exclusive than it must have done when it first aired. It makes sense that Girls was considered its natural successor, and that the four younger women in that show were worried all the time, scrabbling for security, living in flatshares in Brooklyn, not apartments in Manhattan. But what was most striking about seeing it again was its sharpness. The lines crackle with sly wit. Nussbaum explained that the four women were not particularly liked by men. Now, more than ever, that seems especially prescient and radical. While many once-successful shows have been plundered for reboots, the deterioration of the relationship between the cast since the second film seems to position Sex and the City as The Smiths of the TV world, and now that Cynthia Nixon is, in a very Miranda move, running for governor of New York, a revival seems even more unlikely. Good. What worked then would not work in the same way now, and we’ll always have the reruns. Just be sure to find the ones with swearing. • Rebecca Nicholson is a regular contributor to the Guardian"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jun/08/government-nuclear-dream-north-wales-climate-change","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-08T11:30:51Z","webTitle":"Britain’s nuclear U-turn puts us in a very lonely club | Fred Pearce","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/08/government-nuclear-dream-north-wales-climate-change","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/08/government-nuclear-dream-north-wales-climate-change","fields":{"headline":"Britain’s nuclear U-turn puts us in a very lonely club","bodyText":"For once, ministers have put their money where their mouth is – into taking another stab at nuclear power. This week the business secretary, Greg Clark, announced plans to pump £5bn into a new nuclear power station at Wylfa in north Wales. It was a reversal of a longstanding Conservative policy not to underwrite nuclear construction. So why the sudden enthusiasm? And what does Clark know that the rest of the world does not? For almost everywhere else, governments and corporations are pulling the plug on nuclear. Even in a world fearful of climate change, in which nations have promised to wean themselves off fossil fuels by the mid-century, almost no one wants to touch nuclear. Germany will be nuclear-free by 2022. France – once Europe’s great nuclear advocates – is backtracking. President Macron is committed to cutting nuclear’s contribution to grid power from the 75% to 50%. Seven years after the Fukushima accident, all but a handful of Japan’s 54 nuclear power plants remain closed. US utilities are shutting reactors fast too, even those with years of their operating licences yet to run. In America’s deregulated energy markets, nuclear cannot compete. Last week President Trump called for the utilities to suspend closures, citing national energy security. He may resort to the law to get his way, but even Trump is not demanding new reactors. Meanwhile, the state-sponsored nuclear enthusiasm of China, recently the world’s premier builder, has dimmed. Beijing has issued no new construction approvals for over two years. Only Russia keeps up the momentum – which puts Britain in an embarrassing club. Britain hasn’t completed a new nuclear power station for 23 years. The government’s professed reason for its newfound enthusiasm is fighting climate change, and in particular the need to find replacements on the grid for the remaining coal-fired power plants that it has pledged to shut by 2025. But while the cause is correct, the solution is increasingly at odds with the rest of the world. Yes, nuclear is a proven large-scale source of low-carbon electricity. But renewable sources like solar and wind are both now cheaper, and are becoming cheaper still, while nuclear costs only rise. Some who call themselves “eco-modernists” argue that nuclear and renewables would make a great mix: nuclear could fill in when the sun goes down and the winds drop. But there is a problem. Any effective stand-in for fickle renewables needs to be available at the flick of a switch. Hydropower or natural gas can do the job, but not nuclear. Its forte is to deliver constant baseload power. If nuclear ticked enough other boxes, it might still have a role to play in keeping the lights on. But it has always been a bad neighbour and troublesome citizen. Some of our fears about radiation may be exaggerated, but they are real fears nonetheless. And nuclear power’s links to nuclear weapons are not just about shared technology – at least not while Britain remains home to the world’s largest stockpile of plutonium. We are sitting on 130 tonnes of a human-made element that lies at the heart of most nuclear weapons. The stockpile is at a warehouse at Sellafield in Cumbria, in defiance of warnings from scientists at the Royal Society a decade ago that in its present form it poses a major security risk, whether diverted for weapons or breached by terrorists. The plutonium was manufactured over decades from used power-station reactor fuel. Britain wanted to be at the forefront of a new global industry using plutonium to fuel new designs of reactors. But production continues even though there is no sign of a world market for plutonium. And neither the new Hinkley Point reactor under construction in Somerset, nor the proposed plant at Wylfa, will burn the stuff. The government seems determined to pursue a nuclear dream, even though it has palpably failed to come to terms with the toxic legacy of the country’s nuclear past. Next to the site of the planned Wylfa plant sits the shell of an old nuclear power station. It was shut in 2015, but is not scheduled for demolition for almost another century, in 2105. It is one of 11 former plants that sit abandoned around our coastlines, from Dungeness in Kent to Trawsfynydd in Snowdonia, and Sizewell in Suffolk to Hunterston in south-west Scotland. They are currently being put into what the industry terms “care and maintenance” – mothballed while their radioactivity decays, and until the government’s Nuclear Decommissioning Authority can find somewhere to put their remains. On present form, that day may never come. Britain is today no nearer agreeing a final resting place for its most dangerous and long-lasting radioactive wastes than it was back in 1976, when the royal commission on environmental pollution said we should build no more nuclear power plants until that problem was resolved. Absurdly, the most recent plan has been to bury the waste in tunnels to be dug beneath the Lake District national park. Nuclear power today is a largely friendless industry: uneconomic without heavy government support, uninsurable, stuck with a military heritage from hell, overtaken by cleaner competitors, beset by waste problems that no one has resolved, and always vulnerable to public panic after the Chernobyl or Fukushima accidents. Some believe it may have a future when the waste problems are resolved and if radical new reactor designs emerge. That may be so. But the truth is that in the 60 years since the bomb-makers first promised us “atoms for peace”, nuclear power has gone from a sunrise to a sunset industry. Only the British government seems not to realise it. • Fred Pearce is the author of Fallout: A Journey Through the Nuclear Age, From the Atom Bomb to Radioactive Waste"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"society/2018/jun/14/tobacco-industry-seeking-to-control-anti-smuggling-measures-say-critics","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-14T06:00:40Z","webTitle":"Tobacco industry seeking to control anti-smuggling measures, say critics","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jun/14/tobacco-industry-seeking-to-control-anti-smuggling-measures-say-critics","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/jun/14/tobacco-industry-seeking-to-control-anti-smuggling-measures-say-critics","fields":{"headline":"Tobacco industry seeking to control anti-smuggling measures, say critics","bodyText":"The tobacco industry is working to secure control of a system to track the movement of cigarettes around the world, allegedly because it is complicit in the smuggling of its own products, according to a new research paper. A detailed study from the Tobacco Control Research Group at the University of Bath, using a range of sources including internal documents and whistleblower testimony, claims the industry is now going to elaborate lengths to control the global “track and trace” system that the United Nations has said must be put in place to counter smuggling. High taxes have been imposed in many countries on cigarettes and other tobacco products because price rises have been shown to be an effective way to cut smoking. Tobacco companies have in the past been found to be complicit in the smuggling of their brands across national borders to evade these high taxes. Tobacco companies complain about the smuggling of cheap illegally-made copies of their brands, but two-thirds of the illicit tobacco market is made up of genuine product, says the study in the journal Tobacco Control. “At best, evidence indicates that tobacco companies are failing to control their supply chain, over-producing in some markets (eg Ukraine) and oversupplying others (eg Belgium) in the knowledge their products will end up on the illicit market,” says the paper. At worst, some companies may be proactive, they say,. “Ex-employees insist JTI remained actively involved, describing ‘rampant smuggling’ throughout the Middle East, Russia, Moldova and the Balkans. Leaked documents suggest that British Tobacco Association staff suspected JTI was facilitating smuggling into the Democratic Republic of Congo but that BAT also clandestinely moved millions of dollars in cash from Uganda to the DRC to buy tobacco leaf which was presumably then illegally exported,” says the paper. Each of the big tobacco companies has strongly denied any involvement in the illicit trade. The World Health Organisation’s Framework Convention on Tobacco Control adopted an Illicit Trade Protocol in 2012 to crack down on smuggling. Central to this protocol is a “track and trace” system, which would ensure every pack of cigarettes or other tobacco product would be marked in a way that it can be followed on its journey from manufacturer to smoker around the globe. Philip Morris International (PMI) devised a track and trace system called Codentify in the mid-2000s which it licensed for free to the other big tobacco companies. But the Illicit Trade Protocol states that the track and trace system cannot be “delegated to the tobacco industry”. So the companies tried to give Codentify the impression of independence “via a complex system of front groups and third parties”, says the paper. The Digital Coding and Tracking Association was one of these, created in 2011 to promote Codentify to governments, say the authors. Criticised for its connections to the industry, in 2016 it sold Codentify to a new company called Inexto. A PMI spokesman stated Codentify “now complies with ... the WHO’s Framework Convention on Tobacco Control.” But, says the paper, “Inexto’s links to PMI are clear”. Top officials were former tobacco company employees. The paper traces payments by tobacco companies to organisations that could help promote Codentify, including Interpol, which received 15m Euros in 2012 and European and UN anti-corruption educational organisations. Professor Anna Gilmore, lead author of the paper in the journal Tobacco Control, said: “This has to be one of the tobacco industry’s greatest scams: not only is it still involved in tobacco smuggling, but big tobacco is positioning itself to control the very system governments around the world have designed to stop companies from smuggling. The industry’s elaborate and underhand effort involves front groups, third parties, fake news and payments to the regulatory authorities meant to hold them to account.” The companies say they want to control smuggling. “Illegal trade hurts our business and that’s why we invest heavily in securing our supply chain and why we support the FCTC’s Anti-Illicit Trade Protocol,” said Alvise Giustiniani, vice president Illicit Trade Prevention at PMI. “Allegations that the tobacco industry cannot be trusted are absurd, given that we collect more than $32bn in excise tax for governments across the world,” said Brendan Lemoult, Fiscal Affairs and Anti-Illicit Trade vice president of JTI. “We are totally opposed to illicit trade. Illicit trade benefits no one but the criminals involved and creates a market that is uncontrolled and unaccountable,” said a spokesman for Imperial. Codentify had been transferred to Inexto, he said, because “a specialised technology company is better placed to further develop the technology to ensure it remains state-of-the-art and fit for purpose.” BAT says smuggling is organised crime and “a well-coordinated and collaborative solution is needed. BAT works with governments, law enforcement agencies, the industry and international organisations, as well as utilising our own robust supply chain security systems to prevent our products from becoming part of this criminal trade,” a spokesman said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jun/08/peter-stringfellow-sleaze-strip-clubs-porn-women","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-08T13:08:52Z","webTitle":"Peter Stringfellow normalised sleaze – that’s nothing to celebrate | Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/08/peter-stringfellow-sleaze-strip-clubs-porn-women","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/08/peter-stringfellow-sleaze-strip-clubs-porn-women","fields":{"headline":"Peter Stringfellow normalised sleaze – that’s nothing to celebrate","bodyText":"Peter Stringfellow exploited women’s objectified bodies for profit, as though they were cuts of meat hanging in a butcher’s shop, and while it would be unseemly to rejoice in his death I do not mourn him, either. He was a pimp. The feminist writer Julie Bindel recalled that she called him a pimp to his face during a radio debate and that he went “berserk” and “demanded she apologise”. I find the prissiness of this astonishing: that this unsavoury sleaze could demean and degrade women so openly for so many years and then be upset to be called on it. But that’s the thing: the “calling out”, as it’s called today, is considered rude. For some people, alerting them to their prejudices and/or exploitative practices is somehow seen as bad manners. I have no doubt that I will be in for a whole world of internet abuse for writing this piece. If I don’t get at least one rape threat it will be a miracle. There is a certain kind of man who loathes feminists who refuse to silently and passively accept a culture in which young women are paid to take their clothes off for male entertainment. When Suzanne Moore called Hugh Hefner a pimp, he threatened to sue. And yet somehow we’re the snowflakes. Like Hefner and Paul Raymond, Stringfellow normalised sleaze. He took a sexually repressed society and began to turn it into a pornified one. I grew up in the “post-feminist” 1990s, the peak of laddism, when the corporate sex industry was such a standard part of capitalist consumption that if you challenged it, you were immediately dismissed as a hairy bra-burner with no sense of humour. Women were expected to laugh along when men boasted about getting wrecked and ending up in Stringfellows or Spearmint Rhino. There the foulness was packaged in hard, glossy surroundings; the sleaze was wrapped in shiny. But visit the kind of joint where all you had to do was pop a quid in a pint glass and you would see the industry for what it was. It all paved the way for the dominance of pornography, for the conduct described by so many women as part of #MeToo and “grabbing them by the pussy”. The objectification rife in strip clubs bled into lads’ mags, a more contemporary version of the old man on the bus pretending to juggle teenage girls’ breasts. It made itself known in the boys at university who thought a grope was a greeting. The idea of consent workshops was mocked, but the lines had become so blurred they were necessary. Feminism was decades old but we were still being treated like meat. Even in this age of #MeToo, it’s still rarely heard just quite how disgusting young women find being drooled over by pervy older men, which happens to us from puberty onwards. And as Moore wrote last year, part of Hefner’s Playboy mythology was “the idea that women do this sort of thing willingly”. But we all know that for the majority of women in the sex industry, it’s not so much a choice as a way of surviving. A stripper I spoke to once told me that the entire time that she was dancing for male gratification, she would repeat the mantra “fuck you, fuck you, fuck you” in her head. It was her way of coping. And yet, we continue to be told how innocent it all was, how liberating for women. As with Hefner’s death, the accolades and the RIPs come in from men, the pally anecdotes about his “sense of humour”. We hear the eulogising on the Today programme and by ex-lad male journalists who don’t realise how it makes them sound. So for the avoidance of all doubt, before I log off social media for a week: I see you, we see you. You’re disgusting, too. And that stripper’s mantra? She’s not the only one making use of it. • Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett is a regular contributor to the Guardian"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/jun/10/grenfell-survivor-mouna-el-ogbani-interview","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-10T08:30:47Z","webTitle":"Grenfell one year on: ‘We don’t want those lives to be lost for nothing’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jun/10/grenfell-survivor-mouna-el-ogbani-interview","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/jun/10/grenfell-survivor-mouna-el-ogbani-interview","fields":{"headline":"Grenfell one year on: ‘We don’t want those lives to be lost for nothing’","bodyText":"Mouna El-Ogbani lived on the 11th floor of Grenfell Tower for 10 years with her husband, Youseff, and their three children Zaid, 14, Hafsa, 11, and Nusaybah, three. She was a teenager when she came to live in London from Tangier in Morocco, and the family lived in Testerton Walk, adjacent to the tower (and where her mother still lives). “When I got married we stayed with my mum,” she begins, “then we rented for a year and eventually we got a home in the tower and I loved living there. We had friends, good neighbours. It was a nice mixed community – we shared Eid and Christmas together, we helped each other with our children’s homework and they played downstairs in the playground together.” On the night of the fire she had been at her mother’s and when she went home with her children her husband was still at the mosque (it was Ramadan). “He returned at about 12.30pm. We didn’t hear anything. I did smell a bit of gas and I went to the kitchen but I thought ‘no smell of gas here’ so I thought maybe it’s nothing. I then went to go to sleep.” At around 1.25am the telephone rang – it was a friend who could see the tower from her balcony. “She doesn’t usually call me that late. She said: ‘Your building is on fire you need to come out, it’s approaching your floor.’” She and her husband woke the kids. “We didn’t call the fire brigade or anything; we just decided to leave.” Zaid wanted to wear his tracksuit bottoms, put on his trainers but there was no time. Youseff picked up Nusaybah who was still sleeping, Hafsa had her slippers on. When they opened the door, “It was just thick black smoke. Really thick. We couldn’t see anything and the smell of it… it’s like gas, it smells of gas.” She closed the door and asked Youseff: “‘Is it too late?’ I usually panic a lot,” but they opened the door again and this time a firefighter was visible holding open an exit door a few feet away across the corridor. “There was a bit of light to show us where to go. He was telling everyone to get out. I told the children to hold their noses and I did the same. At that time the air on the stairs was normal. No smoke, no heat. I bumped into Mr Mohammed Rasoul, he was taking his uncle out and Mr Sabbah as well, who lost his wife. Then we got outside and we looked around and what we saw was unbelievable – the fire was going all the way to the top of the tower.” She and Youseff were unsure what to do and where to go. They had never had a fire drill so didn’t know where a meeting point might be. They decided to go to Mouna’s mother’s house, where they left the kids, then went back out to see what was going on. Everywhere she looked, she says, there was chaos – people screaming for help, someone had put bed sheets together and was trying to climb down the outside of the tower, the police shouting at him not to do it. “We heard screaming on the other side [of the tower] as well because someone had dropped [jumped].” Eventually the police told them they had to evacuate Testerton Walk, where her mother lived, and so the family spent that first night at a friend’s. After that they were placed in hotels until, in March of this year, they were found a new home in West Kensington. “It’s nice, quiet, and there are other families from Grenfell in the building,” she says, “but it’s not the same.” It is, she confirms, strange and stressful starting from scratch, having lost everything in the fire. “I miss my dad’s things the most,” she says, pausing, her eyes filling with tears. (Her father died in 2010.) Mouna is still having counselling, she still gets anxious. Before the fire she worked for a local charity, a Moroccan women’s centre, as an adviser on domestic violence – “I supported Arabic-speaking women fleeing abuse” – but she hasn’t felt able to return to this work with vulnerable women. She is not herself, she says. “I am still recovering and trying to rebuild my life as well as my children’s.” Her faith has helped: “We just have to believe that something better will come and those that passed away are in paradise. My faith has been my coping mechanism.” That and being a member of the group Grenfell United. “It is these two things that have made me stronger.” Grenfell United was set up in the early days after the fire by some of the survivors and the bereaved. “We gathered together by word of mouth, everyone was in the street. It was decided to start GU to fight for justice, to fight for a voice for the bereaved and the survivors. I joined on the second meeting after a friend, another resident, said to me, ‘We haven’t got a lot of women, why don’t you come?’” What has surprised Mouna most since the fire is “how we were treated by the government, as if we are nothing. We’ve had to battle and campaign. There has been a lot of hard work, a lot of meetings and pushing and we’re not asking for much – for people to be rehoused [she says there are still about 40 families waiting]. It’s just box-ticking for them. They don’t look at us as humans, only as numbers.” GU has been doing “great work with the NHS making sure everyone got the support they need. Working for the children as well.… One child asked: ‘Why can’t I go back and make final closure at the tower?’ We decided to take them close [to the tower] to say goodbye before they wrapped the building up. It was an opportunity for the children to express their feelings and we had a really good turnout.” When she first got out of the tower, she recalls watching and thinking that they might eventually be able to go back into the flat again. But at about 2.15am she could see that her sitting room was on fire and she was struck by a wave of relief that they escaped. “I thought others would get out. I was praying that they would.” She had been calling neighbours for hours. “I called quite a few, like Nura, Yayha’s mum – they passed away – I called her from 1.30am to about 4 o’clock and she never answered. My son says now that he feels guilty that he left and his friend stayed behind. They went to the same school and used to do homework together. He still finds it hard to talk about him.” She can’t believe it is already a year since the fire. “In the Arabic calendar, last night [Monday 4 June] was one year on and I was watching the inquiry with my husband.” The inquiry is, of course, a matter of anxiety for her. “I’m hoping that the judge will see that the people who lost their lives, they were human,” she says. “They worked really hard to make a living… [I hope] that justice will come about. We want those that did it to be prosecuted. We don’t want those lives to be lost for nothing. We want to know what happened, why we were living in a death trap.” Not just for those from Grenfell, she says, but for all those that live in social housing: “We want them all to feel safe in their homes.” For the anniversary next week she will be here [at Grenfell United] with her family “to be with the others and give our support. I will definitely go to the silent march [the marches that have taken place in the area on the 14th of every month]. Hopefully my husband will be off work [he returned to his job as a shift engineer in a hotel last August] and we can do iftar with everyone [breaking the fast during Ramadan].” There has been a healing process of sorts over the 12 months, she says, but “to be honest it’s still raw. I still get upset, I still get emotional whenever I speak abut the tower, not just remembering what happened, but sometimes feeling it [the tower] is no longer there is more upsetting. But being with the other residents helps. Even though I’m in West Kensington I will always be in North Kensington. That’s where I lived.” • The citizen journalist and activist fighting for change after Grenfell"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/jun/08/emma-thompson-made-a-dame-in-queens-birthday-honours","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-09T17:41:46Z","webTitle":"Row over rail boss CBE overshadows Queen's birthday honours","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jun/08/emma-thompson-made-a-dame-in-queens-birthday-honours","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/jun/08/emma-thompson-made-a-dame-in-queens-birthday-honours","fields":{"headline":"Row over rail boss CBE overshadows Queen's birthday honours","bodyText":"The Queen’s birthday honours list, in which actor Emma Thompson was made a dame, has been partially overshadowed by a row over the decorating of Network Rail’s outgoing boss. Mark Carne was awarded a CBE at a time when passengers have been facing huge disruption to their journeys. The Department for Transport admitted the timing of the honour for Carne was “unfortunate”, while insisting the recent problems should not detract from his overall record. Manuel Cortes, the general secretary of the Transport Salaried Staffs Association, likened it to “rewarding the captain of the Titanic for jumping ship”. Labour MP Lisa Nandy called for the honour to be withdrawn. “There’s absolutely no way that the government should press ahead with this award,” she said. She told The World Tonight on BBC Radio 4 that the decision was another kick in the teeth for rail travellers and should be withdrawn. “It’s the most astonishing thing to have happened in a week when commuters have been suffering from rail chaos,” she said. Thompson, who is one of Britain’s best loved actors, has been made a dame, adding to a long list of awards including Oscars, Baftas, Golden Globes and Emmys. The damehood awarded to the classicist Mary Beard is likely to prove more popular. The Cambridge professor, author and TV presenter described it as a “smashing honour” and attributed it to growing interest in her field of work. “I feel especially pleased that someone working on the ancient classical world gets honoured in this way,” she said. “I’d like to treat it as a bit of a tribute to the Greeks and Romans themselves, as well as to all my wonderful academic colleagues who also do so much for the study of antiquity.” The actors Keira Knightley and Tom Hardy are awarded an OBE and CBE respectively. The author Kazuo Ishiguro, whose works include The Remains of the Day, the film adaptation of which starred Thompson, is knighted for his services to literature. He said he was “deeply touched to receive this honour from the nation that welcomed me as a small foreign boy”. The rapper and singer Ms Dynamite is honoured with an MBE, under her real name Niomi McLean-Daley, for services to music, 16 years after winning the Mercury prize, while the Mobo awards founder Kanya King receives a CBE for services to music and culture. Among the sporting stars honoured is the England striker Jermain Defoe, who described himself as “blessed and humbled” to be recognised with an OBE for his services to the charitable foundation set up in his name. Liverpool and Celtic legend Kenny Dalglish is awarded a knighthood. The world heavyweight champion boxer Anthony Joshua is also made an OBE, for services to sport, and the 20-year-old alpine skier Menna Fitzpatrick, Britain’s most successful winter Paralympian, is awarded an MBE. After the wave of terror attacks in the UK in 2017, the former assistant commissioner of the Metropolitan police, Mark Rowley, who led the national response, receives a knighthood. While there are no honours for those involved in the response to the Grenfell Tower fire, the cabinet has said it expects “acts of bravery and extraordinary community spirit” that emerged from the tragedy to feature on future lists. The second world war nurse Rosemary Powell, at 103, is the oldest person honoured, receiving an MBE for voluntary service to the Royal British Legion poppy appeal, having spent 97 years collecting for the charity. The Holocaust survivor Ber Helfgott, also known as Ben, is knighted for services to Holocaust remembrance and education, one of nearly three-quarters on the list deemed to have undertaken outstanding work in or for their local community. Forty-nine per cent of the honourees are women, and 10% are from BAME backgrounds. Akeela Ahmed, who founded the online platform She Speaks We Hear, is made an MBE for services to Muslim women. She said she hoped her award would challenge stereotypes and “silence the haters”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/blog/2018/jun/08/talking-horses-money-rolling-into-racing-from-offshore-betting-horse-racing-tips","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-08T09:42:41Z","webTitle":"Talking Horses: Money rolling into racing from offshore betting","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2018/jun/08/talking-horses-money-rolling-into-racing-from-offshore-betting-horse-racing-tips","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/blog/2018/jun/08/talking-horses-money-rolling-into-racing-from-offshore-betting-horse-racing-tips","fields":{"headline":"Talking Horses: Money rolling into racing from offshore betting","bodyText":"An announcement by the British Horseracing Authority this morning confirms that the structure of the new Racing Authority, which will take over the functions of the Levy Board from April 2019, has been confirmed by the main stakeholders. The BHA, the Horsemen’s Group and the Racecourse Association will all get two board members each, alongside two independent appointees including Sir Hugh Robertson, the chairman, a former minister for sport. Buried in paragraph six, meanwhile, is the interesting news that yield from the 2017/18 levy scheme – the first to include mandatory payments from offshore bets placed online – is expected to exceed £90m, and could even reach £95m. Since the 2016/17 yielded just £49.8m, a drop from £54.5m in 2015/16, this suggests the success of the new regime in capturing bets that were previously slipping through the net has exceeded beyond most expectations, given the widespread prediction when the new scheme was introduced that it might generate an extra £30m in Levy income. The Levy is, of course, calculated on the basis of bookies’ gross profits, and a bumper programme of six meetings today, including the popular finale to the hunter-chase season at Stratford this evening, will be a tricky one to negotiate without adding a few more pennies to the Levy yield along the way. The best bets of the day may be later on at Goodwood, where Sky Eagle (7.05) will be hard to beat in the stayers’ handicap. Ed Walker’s colt has improved steadily through a seven-race career to date and his latest run into third in a hot race at the Dante meeting was his best yet. The step up to 14 furlongs seems sure to bring further improvement and he looks a big price at around 9-4. Incentive (6.30) should go well on the same card, while Lady Dancealot (3.00) and Chiswick Bey (5.00) both have solid chances at the prices at Carlisle.

Patrick Marber’s After Miss Julie relocated the action to the night of Labour’s election victory in 1945. Yaël Farber’s Mies Julie set the story in a post-apartheid South Africa still simmering with racial and class tensions. Both these versions gave the play a strong political context signally lacking in Stenham’s version, which, although well acted – not least by The Crown’s Vanessa Kirby – doesn’t make total sense. In Strindberg’s 1888 original, a count’s daughter fatally seduces her father’s valet. In Stenham’s version we are in modern London, where Julie, the 33-year-old daughter of a rich tycoon, is having a wild birthday bash in her dad’s townhouse. Down in the kitchen her father’s black chauffeur, Jean, who has been deputed to keep an eye on proceedings, passes the time with his Brazilian fiancee, Kristina. The coke-snorting Julie, in turmoil after a breakup with her partner, comes downstairs and demands a dance with Jean that, as in Strindberg, has disastrous results. Strindberg set the play in a world of rigid class distinctions for which Stenham finds no exact equivalent: if today a fat cat’s daughter had sex with a chauffeur, it might lead to chit-chat on social media but would hardly provoke the participants into dreaming of taking flight. Stenham’s solution is to substitute money for class: the gulf between Julie and Jean is here financial. But, although the published version tells us that the play’s two servants are “first-generation economic or political immigrants”, the text itself gives us scant information about their backgrounds. You wonder why Jean would want to run off with an employer who insultingly tells him that “You’re sticking the maid”. Stenham’s answer is to hint that Jean wants to get his hands on Julie’s wealth, but that merely turns him into a cynical opportunist. Put simply, the crisis in Stenham’s version seems disproportionate to the events. Carrie Cracknell’s production and Tom Scutt’s design are similarly overblown. Whatever his misogyny, one of Strindberg’s insights was to realise that his play demanded “a small stage and a small auditorium”. Here the play has to occupy a big theatre. This leads to awkward transitions from the upstairs party to the downstairs kitchen, where the characters confront each other across a space like the Grand Canyon. The party itself looks over-choreographed rather than spontaneous, and the production makes excessive use of that ominous background hum that, ever since Ivo van Hove’s A View from the Bridge, has become a staple feature of cutting-edge productions. Fortunately, the acting is good. Kirby catches perfectly the idea of Julie as a damaged, overgrown child torn between total dependence on others and suspicion that she is seen as a moneybox anyone can shake and rattle. Kirby manages to make her both vindictive and helpless, and when she asks “Am I insane?” it is with genuine pathos. Eric Kofi Abrefa is not helped by Jean’s lack of a backstory but conveys the character’s mix of attraction and repulsion towards the unstable Julie, and Thalissa Teixeira lends Kristina an unusual sexual vibrancy. These actors do sterling work but in Stenham’s version I never felt that the tragic outcome was dictated by an inexorable dramatic force. •Julie is at the Lyttelton at the National Theatre, London, until 8 September.

That’s it for today’s blog. Thanks for your company, do join us for the second ODI on Tuesday – and/or for the men’s ODI between Scotland and England tomorrow. Goodnight! Here’s the South African captain Dane van Niekerk “What can I say? It was close to a perfect performance. I couldn’t ask for better than that opening spell of bowling. We were a bit down after Katherine’s knock but I felt the wicket got a lot quicker. I felt I had to play my natural game with the bat and we had a lot of fun out there. England are a very good team and we know they’ll come back at us on Tuesday.” The England captain Heather Knight speaks! “I think it was a 50/50 call at the toss. They bowled very well but we had a few soft dismissals. We were short with the bat. Katherine was outstanding; she’s a genuine all-rounder now. Hopefully we’re still developing as a team. We haven’t had a great day today but we have the chance to put it right on Tuesday.” England will reflect on a loose batting performance, particularly in the first 15 overs, which left them chasing the game. They had a sniff after a couple of early wickets but Lizelle Lee and Dane van Niekerk batted supremely. 45.3 overs: South Africa 193-3 (Lee 92, du Preez 36) That’s it! Lee slog-sweeps Marsh for six to complete a thumping win for South Africa. They outplayed England completely and would have won by an even greater margin but for the defiant batting of Katherine Brunt. 45th over: South Africa 187-3 (Lee 86, du Preez 36) A wide slower ball from Gunn is blazed over extra cover for four by Lee. She has struck the ball so cleanly throughout the innings. South Africa need three to win. 44th over: South Africa 180-3 (Lee 80, du Preez 35) Ten to win. 43rd over: South Africa 177-3 (Lee 78, du Preez 34) A fine shot from du Preez, who pulls Brunt smoothly for four to bring up the fifty partnership. A dragged pull brings four more, and the last ball of the over is driven beautifully down the ground for two. Brunt ends with figures of 10-2-31-1. 42nd over: South Africa 167-3 (Lee 78, du Preez 24) Lee has an almighty heave at Marsh, dragging the ball back onto her body. England went up for LBW but there was a clear inside edge. Just one run from a good over. 41st over: South Africa 166-3 (Lee 78, du Preez 23) Brunt, who has two overs remaining, returns to the attack. A loose stroke from du Preez flies over backward point for one, another moment of frustration for England. This match is over. 40th over: South Africa 163-3 (Lee 77, du Preez 21) Sarah Taylor misses a stumping chance! I’ve seen it all now. du Preez charged Marsh and missed, but the partially unsighted Taylor could not take the ball cleanly. “How definite is ‘definite’ (34th over)?” says Smylers. “CricketHer, at the ground, is claiming the catch was good, despite how it looked on TV.” 39th over: South Africa 155-3 (Lee 76, du Preez 15) Gunn strays onto leg stump and is dragged around the corner for four by the superb Lee. She could still make her second ODI hundred: she needs 24, with 35 points remaining on the table. 38th over: South Africa 151-3 (Lee 72, du Preez 14) Laura Marsh returns to the attack. An entirely forgettable over yields two runs. South Africa need 39 from 72 balls. 37th over: South Africa 149-3 (Lee 71, du Preez 13) Jenny Gunn replaces Sophie Ecclestone (10-0-32-0), and du Preez cuffs her down the ground for four more. It wasn’t the cleanest strike but once it cleared mid-on it raced away. 36th over: South Africa 144-3 (Lee 70, du Preez 9) du Preez gets her first boundary, crashing Shrubsole through the covers. Shrubsole ends a good spell of bowling with figures of 10-0-36-2. It looks like there will be no miracle today. 35th over: South Africa 137-3 (Lee 70, du Preez 3) The wicket of Lee would have given England a chance of slowly asphyxiating South Africa’s lower middle order. While she is at the crease, it’s hard to see South Africa losing this game. 34th over: South Africa 136-3 (Lee 69, du Preez 2) It would be presumptuous to say Brunt cheated by claiming that catch. It’s possible she knew the ball had grazed the floor, though that’s far from certain as it did end up cleanly in her hands. It certainly wasn’t as bad as, say, Steve Waugh against Brian Lara in 1994-95. Yes, the ball definitely touched the ground and Lee is returning to the middle. Is Lee about to be reprieved? There’s a bit of controversy here, because replays suggested Brunt may have grassed that catch and South Africa have told Lee to stay on the field. The umpires have now decided to go upstairs. England need a wicket now, ideally Lee, so there’s no point holding Shrubsole back. And she’s got the key wicket! Lee drove high to long off, where Brunt dived forward to take a superb catch! 33rd over: South Africa 135-3 (Lee 68, du Preez 2) Good stuff from Ecclestone, who beats du Preez in the flight to end another thrifty over – two from it. South Africa need 55 from 17 overs. Should. 32nd over: South Africa 133-3 (Lee 67, du Preez 1) Shrubsole, who has bowled excellently in this second spell, seams another beauty past du Preez’s outside edge. du Preez eventually gets off the mark from her 13th delivery. 31st over: South Africa 131-3 (Lee 66, du Preez 0) Lee swipes Ecclestone for a sweet straight six! That’s another belting stroke from Lee, who looks good for a second ODI hundred. 30th over: South Africa 124-3 (Lee 59, du Preez 0) Shrubsole, who is not familiar with the concept of the lost cause, is making a lot of noise in an attempt to gee England up. She beats Lee outside off stump with a clever cutter; Lee responds with a glorious chip over mid-off for four. Shot! While she is at the crease, South Africa will feel comfortable. 29th over: South Africa 119-3 (Lee 54, du Preez 0) Ecclestone returns and bowls a good over, just one from it. England will try to squeeze the new batter du Preez and see what happens. South Africa need 71 from 21 overs. 28th over: South Africa 118-3 (Lee 53, du Preez 0) Since you asked, India were 191 for three chasing 229 in the World Cup final, so England have a pretty powerful precedent to use as inspiration. Shrubsole gives England a bit of hope, bowling van Niekerk with a lovely slower delivery. She tried to glide it to third man but was beaten for lack of pace. It ends a high-class innings: 58 from 79 balls with 10 fours and one six. 27th over: South Africa 114-2 (Lee 53, van Niekerk 54) Lee waves Brunt through backward point for four to bring up a calm, controlled half-century, her 16th in ODIs. This will be a huge win for South Africa, who have lost 19 of their last 20 completed ODIs against England. They have improved so much in the last few years. 26th over: South Africa 109-2 (Lee 49, van Niekerk 53) Anya Shrubsole is back in the attack. There’s no point England saving their best bowlers for the death overs, as there probably won’t be any. A good over goes for just a single. In other news, Ultra-Edge suggests there was a slight inside-edge from Lee before that LBW appeal in the previous over. 25th over: South Africa 108-2 (Lee 49, van Niekerk 52) Brunt has a desperate LBW shout against Lee turned down by Tim Robinson. I’m pretty sure there was an inside edge. There was certainly a noise, though it may have been bat on pad, and it would have been very close if Lee didn’t hit it. 24th over: South Africa 106-2 (Lee 48, van Niekerk 50) van Niekerk hammers Marsh for consecutive boundaries to reach a very accomplished fifty from just 61 balls. She has played some beautiful strokes, particularly through the covers and backward point. 23rd over: South Africa 96-2 (Lee 47, van Niekerk 42) Brunt returns to the attack, with England in urgent need of a wicket. No sign of that, but she does restore a bit of order with some accurate wicket-to-wicket bowling. 22nd over: South Africa 95-2 (Lee 47, van Niekerk 41) Lee lifts Marsh high over mid-off for four, a superb stroke that takes South Africa halfway to their target of 190. They are cruising to victory. 21st over: South Africa 87-2 (Lee 39, van Niekerk 41) In isolation this has been a fine spell from Ecclestone (6-0-20-0), but in the context of the match it probably isn’t enough for England. There’s a lot to like about her though, particular the variations in flight. 20th over: South Africa 86-2 (Lee 38, van Niekerk 41) Laura Marsh replaces Nat Sciver and almost strikes when van Niekerk mishits a reverse sweep onto the knee of Sarah Taylor. I don’t know whether that goes down as a dropped catch; it probably does for somebody as good as Taylor. 19th over: South Africa 80-2 (Lee 37, van Niekerk 37) Lee, beaten in the flight by Eccelstone, drags the ball this far wide of leg stump. That was a lovely bit of bowling from the impressive Ecclestone. 18th over: South Africa 77-2 (Lee 35, van Niekerk 36) Another blistering cut from van Niekerk brings four more off Sciver. England are starting to look resigned to defeat. In fairness, van Niekerk in particular has played beautifully. 17th over: South Africa 71-2 (Lee 34, van Niekerk 31) 16th over: South Africa 69-2 (Lee 33, van Niekerk 30) Nat Sciver replaces Jenny Gunn. After a good start, she slips one wide to van Niekerk, who back cuts beautifully for four. South Africa are getting a boundary almost every over at the moment, which is eating into the target. 15th over: South Africa 64-2 (Lee 32, van Niekerk 26) Too wide from Ecclestone and Lee hammers a cut for four. South Africa are batting with a lot of authority at the moment and have control of the match. Mind you, I suppose we said the same about India in last year’s World Cup final. 14th over: South Africa 59-2 (Lee 27, van Niekerk 26) A quiet over from Gunn. England really need a wicket, and I’d be tempted to go back to Shrubsole for a couple of overs. 13th over: South Africa 56-2 (Lee 25, van Niekerk 25) van Niekerk drags Ecclestone just over wide mid-on for four, a slightly risky stroke. South Africa are rattling along now, and a single brings up a fine fifty partnership. They need 134 from 37 overs. 12th over: South Africa 50-2 (Lee 24, van Niekerk 20) Gunn’s second over is milked for four, a relief after her first disappeared for 15. 11th over: South Africa 46-2 (Lee 21, van Niekerk 19) The left-arm spinner Sophie Ecclestone comes into the attack. She’s only 19 but looks a class act, and her first over here is a good one – three from it. 10th over: South Africa 43-2 (Lee 19, van Niekerk 18) Jenny Gunn replaces Anya Shrubsole - and van Niekerk carts her fourth ball over midwicket for a huge six! As if that wasn’t enough, she blasts the next two through extra cover for four! That’s majestic batting. 9th over: South Africa 28-2 (Lee 19, van Niekerk 4) Brunt continues to bowl very straight to Lee, giving her no room to free her arms. One delivery takes a thick inside edge onto the pad, the highlight of a terrific maiden. 8th over: South Africa 28-2 (Lee 19, van Niekerk 4) A bit of width from Shrubsole allows Lee to clatter four through the covers, and a snick through the vacant slip area makes it eight from two balls. 7th over: South Africa 19-2 (Lee 10, van Niekerk 4) South Africa are starting to settle after that difficult start. Sciver saves a couple of runs with a diving stop at midwicket. “Watching on a lazy Saturday afternoon here in Derby between the rugby,” says Alex Stackhouse. “Love watching Taylor stand up to the stumps and work that magic. Always dangerous with either the bat or the gloves. I’m glad that, as the audience for women’s cricket grows, more people will get to appreciate a great English talent.” Agreed. I overuse the word ‘genius’ but I’m not sure there’s any other way to describe her wicketkeeping. Our old friend Gary Naylor called it as long ago as 2009. 6th over: South Africa 18-2 (Lee 9, van Niekerk 4) van Niekerk tries to drive a huge inswinger from Shrubsole and is lucky to get an inside edge. That probably saved her from being out LBW. The drive is a risky stroke against the inswinger but she nails it two balls later with a classic boundary through extra cover. “I’m a Kiwi coming in to gloat about 490...” says Rhys Muir. “At least I was until I saw Brunt today! I’m calling it for England.” 5th over: South Africa 14-2 (Lee 9, van Niekerk 0) Lee gets her first boundary, drilling Brunt through the covers, and then back cuts another to third man. Brunt is unhappy with the footholes I think. 4th over: South Africa 6-2 (Lee 1, van Niekerk 0) Shrubsole is getting some really sharp inswing to the right-handers. These are dangerous times for South Africa, who need to dig in and see off this new-ball spell. The required rate will not be an issue for a long while yet, but the number of wickets might be. A moment of spine-tingling genius from Sarah Taylor, who has stumped Luus off a leg-side wide! We’ve seen it before but it never gets old. Luus overbalanced and Taylor, having gone a fair way to her left to collect the ball, swung his left arm round in one movement to dislodge the bails. That is sheer delightful wicketkeeping. 3rd over: South Africa 4-1 (Lee 1, Luus 0) Brunt and Shrubsole have started superbly, bowling a really tight line to the right-handers. This is turning into Katherine Brunt’s match. She has struck in her second over, bowling Wolvaardt via the inside edge. The line was excellent and Wolvaardt, trying to drive, dragged the ball back onto the stumps. 2nd over: South Africa 2-0 (Lee 0, Wolvaardt 2) Anya Shrubsole will share the new ball as usual. Laura Wolfvaardt, a serious young talent at the top of the order, gets off the mark with a steer to third man for two. Anyone out there? Eh? 1st over: South Africa 0-0 (Lee 0, Wolfvaardt 0) Katherine Brunt opens the bowling for England. The new ball swung prodigiously for South Africa and there’s some encouraging early movement for Brunt. The dangerous Lizelle Lee survives an LBW shout from the fourth ball; I think it was sliding down. An excellent maiden to start the innings. Thanks Adam, hello everyone. The question could be rhetorical or interrogative: how good was that innings from Katherine Brunt? Her career-best 72 not out, a smart, skilful and defiant innings, has given England a chance of a famous victory. They were 97 for eight before Brunt dragged them to a total of 189 for nine. South Africa are favourites but England have something to work with. Let’s recap. England were absolutely gone at 61-5 when Brunt walked in. Then 64-6 then 80-7 then 97-8. But the all-rounder - and that’s what she is these days - has orchestrated a wonderful escape for the hosts. 72 not out from 98 balls does not at all do it justice. She had to dig in and survive for the better part of an hour before playing a shot in anger. But boy, when she did, it was superb. A career best in every way. Right, that’s it from me. I’ll leave you with Rob Smyth to tell you more about the Barnsley Express and reflect on England’s chances of pulling off a remarkable victory. Brunt doesn’t mind giving the strike to Ecclestone, who pulls a couple to midwicket. The single from the fourth balls leaves the veteran two swings. Instead of that, she laps! And laps wonderfully! Class from Katherine! Kapp as under the pump as any of the bowlers at the death. Last ball, she lands her yorker. What a comeback! TMS tells me thjey equalled England’s highest tenth wicket stand in ODIs, putting on an unbeaten 41. 49th over: England 182-9 (Brunt 68, Ecclestone 9) Two over cover to begin for Brunt, who is doing this perfectly with the number 11. But when Ecclestone gets her turn she does it well too, galloping to the danger end for a quick single. Brunt’s turn bringing the shot of the day! Khaka didn’t do much wrong there but Brunt nails the drive down the ground beating the two fielders trying to cut it off. Have that! Ecclestone has a go as well! Khaka gives her width and the 19-year-old slays a punishing cut shot to the rope. 13 more added! Khaka finishes with 3/42 from her ten, but this game has changed significantly over the last few overs. 48th over: England 169-9 (Brunt 61, Ecclestone 5) Ecclestone again does her bit, getting off strike first ball. So it is Brunt vs Kapp. The former goes over mid-on where the field is up, racing down to the rope to raise her second ODI half-century! What a wonderful effort in the circumstances. 86 balls to get there but the first ten overs or so you could count them on one hand such was the scrap. Then four more through cover! Wonderful cricket. And again lifting Kapp’s next ball over square leg! Outstanding batting from the Barnsley Express. A single to cover gives her the strike again as well. 13 from the set, the best of the innings for England. Game on? Two overs left. 47th over: England 155-9 (Brunt 48, Ecclestone 4) Brunt on the advance at Ismail but she drops the length back to cramp her, only a single on offer. Ecclestone does her bit too, taking one from the first ball to midwicket to give the all-rounder another chance. Again, only a single is available. The teenager takes a bit swing from the final ball and luckily doesn’t go to hand, landing at fly slip. They decide to run, meaning she will stay on strike. Ismail finishes with 10-2-25-3. Excellent. 46th over: England 151-9 (Brunt 46, Ecclestone 2) van Niekerk at Ecclestone, trying to cut off this England innings before it reaches 150. That doesn’t happen though, the number 11 nabbing a single off the inside edge. Brunt sweeps another behind square to keep the strike. Good batting. This next over could be fun. 45th over: England 149-9 (Brunt 45, Ecclestone 1) The number 11, if memory serves me correctly, got off the mark in Ashes cricket with a six last year. Doesn’t get the chance to open up immediately here but does keep the strike with a hoick to midwicket. Through her with a slower ball! Just after the 50 partnership is applauded by the crowd Marsh is walking off, sorted out by an excellent piece of death bowling. 44th over: England 146-8 (Brunt 44, Marsh 14) van Niekerk backing herself in at the Cathedral End. It is a suitable set, only three singles taken from it. Marsh keeps the strike, which the South Africans won’t be as concerned about with Brunt building into blitz mode. 43rd over: England 143-8 (Brunt 43, Marsh 12) Brunt walking at Tryon to break her concentration, which works when the short ball comes outside the off-stump, allowing a couple to be cut. Well struck. The next ball was to, a straight drive, but unfortunately for her it cracks into the stumps, so no run. She beats the field next time though, crashing into the point rope. It prompts a wide, reinforcing that Brunt is well on top. And goes again to finish, lifting four over backward square leg. 11 from the over, which is the best for England all day. Would have been 14 if not for the stumps at the non-strikers’ end getting in the way. All of a sudden, the partnership is into the 40s and Brunt is too. 42nd over: England 132-8 (Brunt 33, Marsh 12) van Niekerk brings herself back on. A wide to begin before she finds her radar, beating the batsman and the ‘keeper with one that really goes. Next up, she is past the edge. Third time lucky, Marsh makes solid contact behind point and takes a couple. Continues with a controlled sweep that advances the score by one once more. “I think they are into defendable territory,” says Ebony Rainford-Brent on TMS. Seven from that over. Maybe? Eight overs left. 41st over: England 125-8 (Brunt 32, Marsh 9) Leading edge! Doesn’t carry. Brunt tries to whip Tryon through midwicket but survives. She has to dive to avoid getting herself run out next ball as well, sent back by Marsh when looking for a single that was never there behind point. A wide helps the cause of the hosts. 19 extras so far, making the column the second highest scorer. Brunt keeps it ticking over with a nice steer to the sweeper before Marsh keeps the strike with another run in that direction as well. 40th over: England 119-8 (Brunt 31, Marsh 7) Khaka swung around to the Cathedral End for the first time today. In a sign of what might come in the final ten overs, Brunt advances to slap the seamer through point for a couple. No risk there, she’s seeing it well. She does it again later in the over to smack a lovely boundary through the gap at cover; on the up after using her feet before the ball was bowled. She moves into the 30s with the stroke. A wide follows with Brunt again moving around in the crease, perhaps putting off the bowler in her delivery stride. Ten (count them!) ten from the over. 39th over: England 110-8 (Brunt 22, Marsh 7) Tryon replaces Ismail with her left-arm medium pacers. Marsh gets down the other end first ball, but Brunt isn’t yet prepared to do anything daft. She knows the drill, bat out the overs and give yourselves a vague chance later on. 38th over: England 108-8 (Brunt 21, Marsh 6) Kapp in for her eighth as well. Dropped catch? van Niekerk looks to have put down a sharp chance at gully off Marsh. Hard to tell if it carried, to be fair. Marsh driving again, hard behind point, but this time du Preez stops a certain boundary with a great dive in front of our position in the press box. They still take three, but that effort is emblematic of the committed South African performance in the field so far today. 37th over: England 104-8 (Brunt 21, Marsh 3) Ismail to start her eighth over. She got the party started earlier today with the wickets of Jones then Taylor, can she finish it off? “She’s absolutely not shy,” Charlotte Edwards notes the Proteas quick. Brunt can’t make a dent in this over, nor Marsh who picks out cover twice with nice drives. They won’t be making a commemorative DVD of this match. 36th over: England 102-8 (Brunt 21, Marsh 2) We are entering Power Play 2. That means for the next five overs, South Africa can only have three fielders outside of the circle. In turn, van Niekerk brings back the experience of Kapp at the bowling crease. Two singles from the fiest two balls brings up England’s 100 (so they avoid this). Marsh guided it to third man with control. She’s batted up the order quite often for England but has to ride shotgun for another hour with Brunt here to give them any chance when they bowl after lunch. Not an easy task from this position. 35th over: England 98-8 (Brunt 19, Marsh 0) Bumper! Ismail bowls a short ball at Brunt and hits her in the shoulder! She tried to pull it but missed. The visiting quick goes down for a quick word, which we’re enjoying in the press box. Brunt responds by swinging harder, but it flies off an edge to third man. That single makes her England’s equal top scorer. How unfortunate. Shrubsole takes on Tryon at mid-on, but the left-armer has a fantastic arm and nails the non-striker stumps with a direct hit. The third umpire confirms that she’s gone by at least a foot. “That’s such a waste,” says Charlotte Edwards on radio. “Anya will be kicking herself. That was a major opportunity for her.” IS SHRUBSOLE RUN OUT? Direct hit. We’re going upstairs. 34th over: England 97-7 (Brunt 18, Shrubsole 7) Right, van Niekerk is now over the wicket. When she gets on strike, Brunt plays a solid sweep behind square, collected by the sweeper after a couple are added. She tries it again but doens’t beat the fielder on the circle at the 45. The veteran right-hander done the tough yards, now 48 balls into her innings, but has to take full advantage now and bat for the majority of the remaining overs. 33rd over: England 93-7 (Brunt 16, Shrubsole 6) Khaka’s back with three England wickets on the shelf, so notionally there is a 6fa sitting there for her. Not this over, though. “A lot of teams can get from 90-7 to 170,” observes Charlotte Edwards. “This is where you have to be ruthless as a fielding captain.” As she says that, Shrubsole clips a lovely shot through midwicket for three. Would have been four if not for an excellent dive from Tryon. “It’s a good sign for England,” Lottie continues. “If they can get to 160 they are definitely in this game.” Interesting. 32nd over: England 88-7 (Brunt 16, Shrubsole 2) Well, it won’t be Luus it will be van Niekerk. Fair enough, given that she is the number one spinner in this game. Indeed, according to the Top 20, she is the best legspinner in the world. She was certainly the in both last year’s World Cup and Women’s Big Bash. Round the wicket she comes, which seems a bit odd. Singles for both into the deep. Nothing wrong with the over but I am surprised she isn’t going all-out aggression to drive the hosts into the ground with a sub-100 final tally. 31st over: England 85-7 (Brunt 15, Shrubsole 1) Buzzers! Two of them. They’ll take them, the overthrows coming after van Niekerk misses with her ping at the bowler’s end. Shrubsole would have been gone had she hit, so it was worth the throw. Brunt called her through from a tuck into the legside. Anya is off the mark to the sweeper at backward square leg. Four (four!) from from the Tryon set. 30th over: England 81-7 (Brunt 12, Shrubsole 0) There is a baby crying, aggressively, in front of us. Something, something... England’s performance with the bat! Brunt takes a single but that’s their lot from the final Ntozakhe over. The spinner finishes with the very tidy analysis of 10-1-0-21. Do we get to see Sune Luus now? Hope so. 29th over: England 80-7 (Brunt 11, Shrubsole 0) Brunt and Shrubsole are known for what they do together with the ball. Now, they have to salvage something from this with the bat. As I noted in the preamble (a long time ago), Shrubsole’s last innings against the Proteas only lasted one ball, a cover drive to the boundary to win the semi-final of the World Cup with a delivery to spare. She’s happy in defence to see out the second half of this successful Tryon over. Cut, gone! Caught at point. No power in the stroke off the left-arm seamer. Her 41-ball innings comes to an end. Nicely taken by Lackay on debut. 28th over: England 79-6 (Brunt 10, Gunn 4) A boundary! The spinner Ntozakhe at last gives Brunt the chance to whack a long-hop and she doesn’t miss out, sweeping powerfully to the rope. The first four since the tenth over, to repeat that stat. She then drives one to mid-off to retain the strike. Into double figures! Hurrah! The top scorer, Amy Jones (19), is suddenly in her sights. 27th over: England 74-6 (Brunt 5, Gunn 4) They have put on seven from 57 balls, Long adds. Chloe Tryon the new bowler, making a third change in three overs from our media end (not sure what it is formally called). Brunt frees the arms this time but doesn’t quite get it to the rope. Ooh, make that nearly run out! Third man runs around to prevent the boundary and keep it to a single. There were at least two on offer there. Gunn drives to the sweeper at cover then Brunt takes another behind point when dropping her hands to deflect. The left-arm seamer concedes three from the over. Positively rapid in the context of the last ten, which have gone at about one an over. 26th over: England 71-6 (Brunt 3, Gunn 3) Ntozakhe just bowling to her plan. Runs to her mark, drops it on her spot from around the wicket, goes back to do it again. Brunt has the ability to clear the rope with regularity, but she is struggling to get it outside of the fielding circle at this stage. She does when going down the ground with a drive, taking one to long-off. That’s the only run from another frugal over. The last boundary, Phil Long reveals on TMS, was in the tenth over when Sciver hit two in a row. Hard to score and hard to watch. 25th over: England 70-6 (Brunt 2, Gunn 3) Ismail back on after one Kapp over, van Niekerk rotating her frontline quicks to prevent the England pair from settling in at the crease. “There isn’t as much pace in the wicket as I thought it would be,” says Charlotte Edwards on TMS. Gunn tries to use what pace there is to beat backward point, but she can’t beat the fielder on the circle. It’s much the same when she’s on the front foot, picking out cover. Gunn has three from 34 balls and Brunt two from 18. Not their fault, of course. 24th over: England 70-6 (Brunt 2, Gunn 3) Rinse and repeat. Ntozakhe sticks around the wicket to Gunn, who plays with a straight bat throughout before grabbing a single down the ground to keep the strike. Just the 14 runs taken from her seven overs. 23rd over: England 69-6 (Brunt 2, Gunn 2) Time for the attack-leader, Kapp brought back. She’s able to beat the inside edge of Brunt, just missing the woodwork. Another chance to finish! They take a couple of leg byes, the second would have sent Gunn packing had a direct hit been achieved. Given the clinical way South Africa have gone about it today, I’m surprised it didn’t happen. 22nd over: England 67-6 (Brunt 2, Gunn 2) This has been a lovely little spell from Ntozakhe, dropping it on a length after giving it plenty of air and racing back to her mark to go again. The key is that she is making the batsman make the pace; never easy when there has been so much mayhem. And we’re yet to see either of the leggies. Just the single for Brunt for the over. 21st over: England 66-6 (Brunt 1, Gunn 2) Khaka bowls, nothing on offer. Gunn defends, which is probably the best option for now. Another maiden. It’s always a risk to think about your match report before a ball has been bowled. I had this whole thing prepared in my head about Love Island but will have to wait for a brighter day. A more serious interrogation awaits tonight. 20th over: England 66-6 (Brunt 1, Gunn 2) Ntozkhe giving it ample air from around the wicket to Gunn but she is able to break the string of dots with a single to long-on. Warm applause - ironic perhaps? - from the crowd. Brunt tries to find a run to the same place on the ground but the fielder has been moved straighter so she can’t. One from it. Squeeeeeze. 19th over: England 65-6 (Brunt 1, Gunn 1) Amusingly, five of the 13 runs that Khaka has conceded so far have been wides. No judgement: reminds me of many of my own returns over the years when the ball was hooping. She’s right on the money to Brunt, attacking her stumps to secure back to back maidens for the visitors. 18th over: England 65-6 (Brunt 1, Gunn 1) “Bloody hell,” emails Rob Smyth, who is taking over from me. He might not have a lot of work to do the way this is going. In the time I take checking my inbox, the off-spinner Ntozakhe has raced through a 60-second maiden. Good game awareness, as they say. Don’t give them a moment to breathe. 17th over: England 65-6 (Brunt 1, Gunn 1) Well, if you are going to rebuild, Jenny Gunn isn’t a bad player to walk out. An incredibly optimistic take, I grant you. She’s off the mark with a relatively controlled edge. Brunt got off the mark herself in between the two wicket-taking deliveries of the set. All coming just when Sciver and Wyatt looked to be getting on top of things a touch. Career best bowling figures for Khaka so far, 3/13 from her four so far. Thanks to Phil Long from TMS. Khaka has a third! Her second wicket of another terrible over for England. That’s a poorly executed shot from Danni Wyatt, walking down the track and slapping a wide delivery straight to point. Luus does the rest. Blimey. What a mess. Oh dear, I’ve burned another. Sciver has spooned the easiest catch after walking at the the bowler before she let it go. Tried to work it to leg, but didn’t find the middle, the ball directed straight to midwicket. Great bowling, Khaka pulling back her length when she saw Nat coming. “England are almost lucky to have 61 on the board,” observes Ebony Rainford-Brent on TMS. Grim scenes for the world champs. 16th over: England 61-4 (Sciver 16, Wyatt 7) More singles from the spin, Sciver coming down to use her feet to punch down the ground. Looking forward to seeing how the all-rounder handles this situation. Everyone remembers her pair of blistering World Cup tons, but the 50 she made in the final - England’s top score - was a different innings altogether. She had to graft then and will again here. 15th over: England 57-4 (Sciver 14, Wyatt 6) Khaka starts with a couple of dots to Sciver before she can get down the other end with a single to fine leg. But the medium pacer is keeping both players in their defensive postures more often than not. The church bells are ringing from the Worcester Cathedral at the other side of the ground, it being midday and all. Just the single and a leg bye from it. 14th over: England 55-4 (Sciver 12, Wyatt 6) Well, England’s 50 is up, courtesy of a single to Wyatt to begin. They add a couple more off Ntozakhe down the ground to long-off. Then another to point. Better approach. That’s the way to rebuild an innings. 13th over: England 49-4 (Sciver 9, Wyatt 3) Wyatt nearly holes out! She’s lucky, her lofted drive bouncing before Tryon at mid-on. That would have been an ugly way to depart in the circumstances. In saying that, taking on the attack is what she does. A leg bye the only other run in the over. Sheesh. 12th over: England 44-4 (Sciver 9, Wyatt 1) Raisibe Ntozakhe on to replace Kapp, the first we have seen of spin today. The 21-year-old offbreaker is up where she should be to begin, conceding just a couple of singles in her first set before beating Wyatt’s edge to conclude when trying to glide behind point. They’re squeezing the hosts. 11th over: England 42-4 (Sciver 8, Wyatt 0) Plenty of scrutiny on the decision of Heather Knight to bat first at the toss in conditions so favourable for seamers. In keeping with that theme, Khaka is getting plenty of shape back into the new player to the crease, Danni Wyatt. Then nearly runs herself out before scoring! Thankfully, after nearly shaking hands, she and Wyatt return to where they started. Some wides down the legside keeps the board (just) moving. Khaka beats Sciver outside the off-stump to finish! Not far away at all. Played for movement, but held its line. Classy bowling. First ball! Ayabonga Khaka into the attack and straight into the book, through Beaumont’s gate and into her middle stump. I reckon there was an inside edge along the way, but either way, it’s right on the money and the opener’s unconvincing 24-ball stay comes to an end. The world champions are in big trouble here. 10th over: England 39-3 (Beaumont 6, Sciver 8) Righto, let’s welcome Natalie Sciver to the crease. She’s lifting Kapp around the corner for four then inside edging her fine for another boundary. Never dull, is she? Nat’s mother is sitting below us, who I know is a reader of the OBO. Give me a wave if you’ve got it open today? 9th over: England 31-3 (Beaumont 6, Sciver 0) Ismail in for her fifth over, understandably so given her last couple have brought wickets. This England pair both made the team of the World Cup last year with Beaumont the player of that tournament and have to set up the innings here now. Beaumont picks up a couple through midwicket, taking her to six from 23 balls. She tries to cut a further four but picks out point. What did you think about her missing our Top 20? That was the biggest surprise for me. Knight gone too! Kapp has trapped her leg before, misjudging the line of a straight delivery. The captain was off the mark with a beautiful cover drive, but her day has lasted just the three deliveries. She is shaking her head as she walks back into the dressing room, but the first replay looks fairly conclusive. South Africa up and about. 8th over: England 29-3 (Beaumont 4, Sciver 0) Ismail strikes again! Taylor tried to whip a fullish delivery through midwicket but doesn’t make contact. No hesitation from the umpire to pop the finger up. Yep, that’s very out. England in some early strife after winning the toss. 6th over: England 23-1 (Beaumont 2, Taylor 2) “This is quite a defensive field,” says Lottie Edwards on radio. “I would like to see them have a slip in for Kapp. They are setting the field for the previous batter.” Tammy’s turn. The last time she played an international at this ground she made her maiden ton. I was sitting in the same seat that day as she went inside-out over cover time and time again. Batting conservatively at the moment, she keeps the strike with a quick single to midwicket. Nice running. 5th over: England 21-1 (Beaumont 1, Taylor 1) Master statistician hypocaust is immediately at me on twitter, (quite rightly) declaring the Jones dismissal as my fault for my boast moments before. Taylor is off the mark the same way that Beaumont was, via an inside edge to fine leg. She retains the strike. Sorry Amy - scrap that! She’s bowled, chopping on pulling when trying to reach the boundary for a fifth time. It didn’t quite get up and instead hit her off stump on the deflection. Urgh! The ball before, she hit another cover drive to the rope, helped by a du Preez misfield. Fun while it lasted. 4th over: England 16-0 (Jones 15, Beaumont 1) Kapp beats Jones outside the off-stump early in the over. That’s where Kapp does her best work. Reading some CricViz analysis during the week, Kapp bowls fewer balls on the stumps than any of her seam-up contemporaries, living in the fourth stump channel, yet goes for the fewest runs in the game. Go figure. Back to the action, Jones is on the advance and bisecting the gap at extra cover to pick up three more. I am willing to declare it already: she is on one here. 3rd over: England 13-0 (Jones 12, Beaumont 1) Much better from Ismail this time around, keeping Beaumont on the front foot, who picks out gully a couple of times trying to steer singles to third man. Very good set. Maiden. Phil Long on TMS observes that was Ismail’s 100th maiden in ODIs. She’s the first South African to reach that, um, milestone? Still, I love it. Phil is very good at his job. 2nd over: England 13-0 (Jones 12, Beaumont 1) Inside edge! Beaumont lucky not to chop Marizanne Kapp on, but instead gets a single to fine leg. It’s Amy Jones show here though, striking her third boundary in the space of a handful of deliveries, timed superbly through point. “That’s the best of the lot!” roars Charlotte Edwards in approval. “It wasn’t even that short. She’s so elegant.” 1st over: England 8-0 (Jones 8, Beaumont 0) A swing and a miss to begin, but from the third ball of the game Jones absolutely nails a back foot cover drive to the rope. What a graceful way to get off the mark. “If there is anywhere you can’t bowl to Amy Jones it is short,” says Charlotte Edwards, her former captain, on the TMS commentary. The right-hander proves that point a second time with an equally elegant pull shot to end the over, smashing it with perfect technique along the carpet. Shot. No national anthems today. Just straight out there to their positions. van Niekerk leads out the visitors before Beaumont and Jones join them. The latter will be facing first up. Ismail has the new ball for South Africa. She’s the fastest woman in the game and doesn’t mind telling the world about it. This should be fun. PLAY! Not strictly cricket. But a brilliant reference to our game in Marina Hyde’s smashing column this morning that I have to share with you before we begin in a few minutes. He was back on the theatrics on Wednesday over this backstop business. Are you on top of the “backstop”, which the EU has predictably rejected? It feels apt that the UK has chosen to invoke the not-even-a-sport of rounders. There’s a reason why rounders is what people play on their office awaydays – it’s because you don’t have to be any good at it, or know the rules, or even know what’s going on. Unfortunately, these are not the criteria for handling complex negotiations with the EU. For them, the UK twatting around with backstops is just not cricket. They don’t really deal in backstops. What they really need to hear is that the UK is going to have four slips and a gully, and a forward short leg. Or, given our increasingly defensive needs, everyone on the boundary, including a third man and a deep fine leg. Also... England’s players have been given a pay rise after last year’s World Cup win. The pot increased by 40 per cent on 1 February. Make no mistake, there is still some way to go with Australia the clubhouse leaders when it comes to women central contracts. But this is very good news. Before we begin. A big day for The Guardian’s coverage of women’s cricket with the announcement of the inaugural Top 20 players in the world. A lot of effort went into compiling this list, with a fantastic panel of judges. The spread in the paper (across three pages) is spot on as well. And check out the interactive while you’re there. Here are those team sheets. Surprised but very pleased to see that Amy Jones decision. With Sarah Taylor returning to the wicketkeeping gig, I was worried she would again be watching from the bench. Instead, she gets a gig as a specialist bat (as she has from time to time alongside Taylor, to be fair). Good stuff. England: Beaumont, Jones, Taylor, Wyatt, Sciver, Knight, Brunt, Marsh, Gunn, Shrubsole, Ecclestone. South Africa: van Niekerk, Tryon, Kapp, Lee, Wolvaardt, du Preez, Ismail, Khaka, Ntozakhe, Luus, Lackay (debut). South Africa as expected, by the looks. Shabnim Ismail is just about my favourite cricketer in the world. Certainly the most fun to interview. Has an almighty crack. “We don’t think conditions will change too much,” the England skipper says when explaining her decision. Of the squad that England named during the week, spinner Danielle Hazell, opener Lauren Winfield and all-rounder Georgia Elwiss are the three to miss out. That means Amy Jones is given the chance to open the innings. Fair enough too, she top scored with 94 the last time England played in April. South Africa’s Dane van Niekerk says that they would have bowled her she won the toss, so everyone is happy. I’ll be back shortly with the full teams as named. It remains gloomy (per this pic), but the rain is staying away. For now. It is the start of a new summer for England’s women, hosting the first of three ODIs against the side that came so close to knocking them off in the World Cup semi-final the last time they met. Of course, as we know, Anya Shrubsole made sure of the result lashing the penultimate ball of the game to the rope and they all lived happily ever after. It was the game of the tournament, the Proteas proving in the process that they are a legitimate force in the women’s game after making up the numbers for so many years. The image of their skipper, Dane van Niekerk, in tears at the side of the pitch when the winning runs were scored sticks in the memory. They are a serious cricket team. From the XI that won the final a few days later in the famous Lord’s triumph, spinner Alex Hartley and middle-order accumulator Fran Wilson have made way. In the case of the tweaker, she’s a victim of a very strong spin division inside the team. As Mark Robinson said when I asked him during the week, the left-armer lost confidence and form after her brilliant 2017. Wilson has been replaced by Lauren Winfield, who is back after losing her spot for the India tour earlier this year. On that trip - the last time Heather Knight’s side played - they were the beaten finalists in a T20 tri-series against India and Australia before losing a three-game ODI series 2-1 against the hosts. But that was without experienced matchwinners Katherine Brunt and Sarah Taylor, who were both rested. They are back today at Worcester. Their opponents today were also beaten by India 2-1 this year in the 50-over format. Despite the fact that the World T20 is the main game for both sides in 2018, all of these ODIs are played for ICC Championship points. In short, that league decides the four automatic qualifiers for the next World Cup in 2021. Last time around, South Africa had to reach the main draw the hard way. It’s a good system, giving context to every ODI. In their one official warm-up game, they were beaten by an England Academy side by four wickets. But the good news from that was that 20-year-old opener Laura Wolvaardt collected a half-century. As we learned during their World Cup campaign last year, her cover drive is something to behold. Plenty of those today, please. I can report from the press box that it is very cloudy and fairly gloomy at New Road but without a drop of rain, so the toss will go ahead in 10 minutes as planned. Let’s crack on in the usual way. I’m around on both the email (please note the new address if we’re talked before) and on the tweet."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/commentisfree/2018/jun/09/milk-canada-us-trade-war","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-09T11:00:20Z","webTitle":"Why Canadian milk infuriates Donald Trump","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/commentisfree/2018/jun/09/milk-canada-us-trade-war","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/commentisfree/2018/jun/09/milk-canada-us-trade-war","fields":{"headline":"Why Canadian milk infuriates Donald Trump","bodyText":"In the midst of what appears to be a full-blown trade war between Canada and the US over steel and aluminum, and with Donald Trump taking his first steps on Canadian soil for the G7 summit, a familiar bugbear reappeared to haunt the negotiations. Whatever understanding Canada and the US may (or may not) have come to on their high-value trade in lumber or auto parts, they remain implacably opposed on the comparatively minor matter of milk. Trump has attacked Canada’s protected dairy industry before, calling it a “disgrace” and blaming it for widespread hardship among US farmers. Although the entire trade in dairy products between the two countries is worth less than US$600m, ideological division has sharpened the ongoing dispute. His negotiators have demanded the dismantlement of Canada’s openly dirigiste system of supply management in agriculture – a complicated nexus of production quotas and import tariffs designed to ensure Canadian dairy, egg and poultry farmers receive fair prices for their products. But the Canadians are no less determined to retain one of the last vestiges of their otherwise-abandoned collectivist traditions. Canadian cows are sacred, and the farmers who care for them enjoy outsized influence in national politics. Expert observers have said that Justin Trudeau’s government would abandon the treaty altogether before sacrificing supply management. “It’s just too sensitive for the Canadians,” Kevin Carmichael, a senior fellow at the Centre for International Governance Innovation in Waterloo, recently told CNBC news. Even so, the Trudeau government recently alarmed Canadian farmers by signalling a willingness to give on the issue in the face of insistent US demands. The dispute has acquired new urgency as the US dairy industry continues to suffer from a deep crisis of persistent overproduction, with farmers sinking into insolvency as farm-gate milk prices stick stubbornly below the cost of production. Last year, US farmers dumped almost 100m gallons of surplus milk. Recently, a surge in dairy-farmer suicides has caused national alarm, drawing attention to what the New York Times called “the widespread hopelessness afflicting the industry”. Representing a state suffering especially hard from farm failures and suicides, the US Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, recently echoed his Republican president in blaming Canada for the debacle. “Canada, when it comes to dairy, acts like China when it comes to trade,” Schumer told hard-pressed farmers in upstate New York. “They’re unfair. They put up barriers. They treat us bad.” Meanwhile, just across the St Lawrence river in what free-trading Americans like to call Soviet Canuckistan, the dairy industry is thriving like never before – and like none other in the developed world. Family farms milking an average of 80 cows each have prospered under a heavily regulated system that supports prices at sustainable levels by restricting domestic overproduction and keeping imports at bay. In 2016, Canadian farmers received an average price of C$0.79 a litre for milk, compared with C$0.49 on average for US farmers. The result is that dairying remains a key economic support of traditional rural life throughout central Canada. As critics of the system like to point out, hoping to inspire resentment among consumers annoyed by the price of milk, Canadian dairy farmers enjoy incomes 60% above average in the country. But to supporters, the uniquely prosperous, protected Canadian dairy industry stands as a model alternative to the increasingly disruptive and unpopular dynamic of unrestricted free trade in all things. Supply management enjoys strong government support in no small part because the policy obviates the need to subsidize farmers directly in the manner of the US and the EU – the two greatest culprits behind the current world dairy glut. “The system works so incredibly well,” said Bruce Muirhead, associate vice-president and professor of history at the University of Waterloo. “And the big thing about supply management is that it doesn’t cost the government a cent. Consumers pay the full cost of production.” Domestic critics have called supply management a grotesque distortion of free-market principles, complaining that the comparatively high price of Canadian milk sacrifices the interests of consumers in favour of producers and victimizes the poor. But no consumer or social policy group has taken up the cause, and all six parties currently represented in the House of Commons unanimously support supply management. As do Canadian consumers: an Ipsos poll this year by the Dairy Farmers of Canada reported that 75% of Canadians support even greater government efforts to defend the industry in the face of current US demands. As the trade minister, Chrystia Freeland, has pointed out, trade data flatly contradicts the claim that Canadian supply management is ravaging US dairyland – either because it unfairly restricts imports or because it dumps a subsidized surplus in US markets. In 2016, Canada imported dairy products from the US worth five times more than the small amount it exported there. “I would call that a pretty good deal,” she told the House of Commons. Canadian farmers point out that despite the tariffs that protect them, imports make up 10% of the country’s dairy consumption. By contrast, the US restricts dairy imports to 3% of domestic consumption. “That just screams hypocrisy to me,” Muirhead said. “I don’t understand how they can get away with these positions.” As a recent visitor to Wisconsin, “America’s Dairyland”, where low prices are forcing the closure of hundreds of dairy farms a year, Muirhead said he encountered no resentment against Canada among local farmers. “The president of the Wisconsin Farmers Union told me that what they really wanted was a supply-managed system like ours,” he said. Dairy deregulation has spread hardship wherever it has been implemented, Muirhead added. “Every single objective indicator says that in the case of dairy you cannot have a system that operates without production controls,” he said. “If you try, you’re basically consigning your farmers to a life of penury – or worse.” Canada successfully defended the system in its first free trade agreement with the US, and several subsequent ones. But with the full wrath of Trump now focused squarely on the country’s protected farmers, this stubborn remnant of Canadian exceptionalism has never been more fragile."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2018/jun/08/arron-banks-refuses-to-appear-before-commons-committee","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-08T19:01:34Z","webTitle":"Arron Banks refuses to appear before Commons committee","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jun/08/arron-banks-refuses-to-appear-before-commons-committee","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/jun/08/arron-banks-refuses-to-appear-before-commons-committee","fields":{"headline":"Arron Banks refuses to appear before Commons committee","bodyText":"Arron Banks and his Leave.EU colleague Andy Wigmore risk being summoned to give evidence to MPs after the Brexit-backing duo suddenly said they would not appear before a select committee next week, claiming they were victims of a “witch hunt”. The two men had been due to give evidence at the committee’s inquiry into fake news next Tuesday but the campaigners for British parliamentary sovereignty announced on Friday afternoon that they would not turn up because the committee was biased against them. “It is perfectly clear that the committee, which comprises only of remain supporting MPs, is conducting a coordinated ‘Witch Hunt’ of Leave groups involving the Electoral Commission &amp; the ICO. You have called not witnesses from the Remain campaign or associated groups,” Banks wrote in a letter released on Twitter. The digital, culture, media and sport select committee said it would consider its response on Tuesday, and could seek a formal summons for Banks and Wigmore if they continue to refuse to appear, the second time it has done so in a week. Damian Collins, the committee’s chairman, tweeted that it was not only his committee “that has questions” for Banks and Wigmore, and said there were ongoing investigations by the Electoral Commission, the Information Commissioner and a court in Mississippi. Later Banks tweeted that “we have only delayed our appearance”. In his letter Banks accused the committee of colluding with a pro-remain campaign group called the Fair Vote Project, which has brought a legal action in the US, alleging that Leave.EU data was illegally sent abroad to be processed at the University of Mississippi. Banks denies the allegation and complained that the MPs had released evidence from a witness in that case early “in order to aid this group”. The Fair Vote Project said that it had brought the case to obtain an order to preserve data from Banks’s insurance company Eldon Insurance and a second company called Big Data Dolphins, “so that the authorities can investigate whether or not UK citizen data was processed improperly”. Kyle Taylor, the director of the Fair Vote Project, added: “If their claim that Eldon Insurance and Big Data Dolphins are not connected to Leave.EU is correct, why are they now claiming that a court case in Mississippi about these private companies affects their ability to appear before the DCMS select committee in their capacity as key figures in Leave.EU?” Dominic Cummings, Vote Leave’s campaign director, is already subject to a formal summons by June 20 before the same group of MPs after he repeatedly refused to agree to attend on the dates suggested, saying he wanted to wait for formal investigations from the Electoral Commission and the Information Commissioner to conclude."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2018/jun/09/resistance-now-democrat-numbers-lead-poll","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-09T14:00:24Z","webTitle":"Democrat enthusiasm dominates among voters, new numbers show","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jun/09/resistance-now-democrat-numbers-lead-poll","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/jun/09/resistance-now-democrat-numbers-lead-poll","fields":{"headline":"Democrat enthusiasm dominates among voters, new numbers show","bodyText":"The Resistance Now is a weekly update on the people, action and ideas driving the protest movement in the US. If you’re not already receiving it by email, subscribe. New poll reflects a growing opposition to Trump With critical primary contests under way ahead of the 2018 midterm elections, enthusiasm among Democrats and the so-called “resistance” to Donald Trump continues to dominate the mood of the American electorate. The proof is in the numbers: a new poll released this week from NBC News and the Wall Street Journal found Democrats with a 10-point lead among registered voters across the country. But perhaps more striking was the growing opposition to Trump specifically, reflected in the survey’s finding that voters, by a whopping 25-point margin, prefer a candidate for Congress who promises emphatically to serve as a check on the current president. By a similar margin, voters said they would be less likely to cast a ballot for candidates who have supported Trump on most issues. The findings reinforce the trend across other polling in recent months showing Democrats favored to win, although the party’s overall advantage has narrowed from 13 points or more at the end of last year to just over five points today. That Democrats’ numbers have remained steady even as Trump’s own approval ratings have ticked upward underscores how he could well remain a liability for the Republican party as it seeks to hold on to control of both chambers of Congress in November. According to the same poll, a majority of Americans expressed satisfaction with the direction of the US economy, and a plurality of respondents credited Trump with improving the economic outlook. Even so, voters were more likely to disagree with his policies on a number of issues, including immigration and healthcare, and continue to disapprove of his overall job performance. The findings come days after Democrats strengthened their prospects of retaking control of the House of Representatives during Tuesday’s coast-to-coast primaries. The results marked another big night for Democratic women running for office, who made gains in states ranging from New Jersey to New Mexico and Iowa, and the party had a respectable showing in California. Trump nonetheless retains overwhelming support from Republican voters, who have been willing to forgive the president no shortage of controversies. Many of Trump’s recent actions – from an aggressive crackdown on immigrants to reigniting his feud with predominantly black athletes who kneel during the national anthem – resemble an effort to exploit the culture wars that helped propel him to the presidency. The question is whether those same tactics will drive even more Democrats, whose resistance is rooted in these precise issues, to the polls. Cities across the US launch a collective renewable energy effort Meanwhile, as Donald Trump snubs the rest of the G7 leaders on Saturday by leaving their summit in Canada early – before key meetings on climate change, energy and the state of our oceans – US cities are making more effort to step up on clean energy. The mayor of Boston, Marty Walsh, announced two days ago that several cities across the country are launching an effort to buy renewable energy collectively. His stated hope is that the collaborative effort could cut down on renewable energy purchasing costs for the cities, and create new incentives for green energy production. Walsh made the announcement at the International Mayors Climate Summit taking place in Boston simultaneously with the annual US Conference of Mayors. “Climate change and climate resiliency is not a city issue, it’s a nationwide issue,” Walsh said in an interview with the Boston Globe, announcing the plans for the “large-scale renewable energy initiative”, involving Los Angeles, Chicago, Pittsburgh and others. But not forgetting that talk is cheap, activists organized protests in Boston yesterday to demand that the city turns words into action on its pledge to be carbon neutral by 2050, and other green proposals. “Kayaktivists” also took to the water in Boston Harbor opposite the mayors’ venue – during a classic New England clambake event, demanding more progress on climate change and less cheerleading for the natural gas industry. With eco chants still ringing in his ears, no doubt, Walsh will take part in the LGBTQ Pride March in Boston on Saturday."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/jun/08/kenny-dalglish-is-knighted-in-queens-birthday-honours-list","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-08T21:35:21Z","webTitle":"Arise, Sir Kenny: Dalglish is knighted in Queen’s birthday honours","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jun/08/kenny-dalglish-is-knighted-in-queens-birthday-honours-list","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/jun/08/kenny-dalglish-is-knighted-in-queens-birthday-honours-list","fields":{"headline":"Arise, Sir Kenny: Dalglish is knighted in Queen’s birthday honours","bodyText":"The “King” is to become a knight. The Liverpool and Celtic legend Kenny Dalglish has been awarded a knighthood in the Queen’s birthday honours in recognition of his services to football, charity and the victims of the Hillsborough disaster in 1989. Dalglish’s absence from honours lists since being made a MBE in 1984 has been a source of bewilderment and consternation at Liverpool’s Anfield home, where his status is reflected in the “King Kenny” moniker. That has been rectified with the announcement that the 67-year-old will join a select band of knighted former footballers and managers, a list that includes England’s World Cup winning manager Alf Ramsey, Bobby Charlton, Bobby Robson and Dalglish’s one-time Manchester United adversary Alex Ferguson. He is the first Liverpool manager to be given the honour with Bill Shankly and Bob Paisley, the only English manager to win the European Cup three times, both overlooked. In a playing career spanning 22 years the Glasgow-born footballer scored 167 goals in 322 appearances for Celtic and 172 goals in 515 games for Liverpool, where he is widely regarded as the club’s finest player. He won nine league championships at Anfield – three as manager – three European Cups and three FA Cups. He is also Scotland’s most capped international with 102 appearances, joint-leading scorer with 30 goals and led Blackburn Rovers to the Premier League title in 1995. But Dalglish’s impact transcends the football pitch, as the citation for the knighthood recognises. “He was Liverpool manager at the time of the Hillsborough disaster in 1989,” it reads. “He selflessly made himself available to the families of the bereaved, attending most of the funerals, organising hospital visits and attending annual memorial services held at Anfield. He has been a steadfast supporter of the families in their quest for and throughout the Hillsborough Inquiry, and was granted Freedom of the City of Liverpool in recognition of his work. He is the co-founder of The Marina Dalglish Appeal, his family’s cancer charity which opened the £1.5m Centre for Oncology at University Hospital, Aintree in 2007 and which has raised over £10m in total.” Dalglish and his wife Marina, now Lady Dalglish, once attended in one day the funerals of four Liverpool fans who were unlawfully killed at Hillsborough. The impact of the disaster on the then 38-year-old led to his resignation as Liverpool manager in 1991. The former Liverpool Walton MP Steve Rotheram, now metro mayor for the city region, tabled a Commons motion in 2011 for Dalglish to be given a knighthood. The motion was signed by 13 MPs. Dalglish, who claims he will be uncomfortable with “Sir Kenny”, said: “We are hugely proud to have got this. You start off in life just hoping to be a footballer. You become a footballer and have a bit of success in the football world and that seems to give you a platform to go on to other things. We only set out to do the best we possibly could, even through all the other stuff. The charity or Hillsborough; it was to help people because somebody helped us. Marina wanted to show her appreciation – or we did as a family – for the way she was looked after when she was treated [for breast cancer] and ended up starting the charity. I think it’s just what you are supposed to do in life, isn’t it? “You start off with your parents and they put you on the right road. Marina and I are fortunate that we got good direction from them. Then the football. You couldn’t get any better tutors than [former Celtic manager] Jock Stein and Bob Paisley. People might say they didn’t get a recognition like this. I wouldn’t get into a discussion about that but I’m not saying I’m any more deserving than those two great men.” • This article was amended on 12 June 2018. Kenny Dalglish is not the first Liverpool player to receive a knighthood, as an earlier version said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"education/2018/jun/11/post-school-education-in-england-attacked-lords-report-universities-poor-value-for-money","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-10T23:01:05Z","webTitle":"Post-school education in England attacked in Lords report","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2018/jun/11/post-school-education-in-england-attacked-lords-report-universities-poor-value-for-money","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/education/2018/jun/11/post-school-education-in-england-attacked-lords-report-universities-poor-value-for-money","fields":{"headline":"Post-school education in England attacked in Lords report","bodyText":"Tertiary education in England is heavily skewed in favour of universities, but offers poor value for money for students and the economy, according to a critical report by the House of Lords. The report by the Lords’ economic affairs committee calls for immediate reform of the funding system and concludes that changes introduced in 2012 - when university fees were raised to £9,000 a year – have overbalanced funding for 18-year-olds towards universities while heaping debt on students. The crossbench committee, which is chaired by Michael Forsyth, a former Conservative minister, is calling for “a new deal for post-school education funding which promotes all types of learning regardless of where or how it takes place”. Its report also backs the reintroduction of maintenance grants for disadvantaged students, and for a steep cut in the interest rates charged on student loans. “The way we expect students to access higher and further education is deeply unfair. We must create a single system, including apprenticeships, that offers more choice and better value for money,” Lord Forsyth said. The Lords’ intervention comes as the government is reviewing the funding of tertiary education, with ministers questioning the purpose of courses that appeared to offer little value to their graduates. “It’s not whether or not you offer creative arts, it’s whether or not you offer creative arts that is truly competitive, so you are not putting on courses that are cheap to offer, that are threadbare and not as competitive as they could be,” Sam Gyimah, the universities minister, said last week. A recent report by the Institute for Fiscal Studies, which was commissioned by the Department for Education, found huge variations in the rewards earned by graduates. Those who studied economics or medicine earned 20% more than average several years after graduation. The Lords’ report criticises many parts of the higher education system, in particular arguing that the switch in funding towards tuition fees has incentivised universities to attract as many students as possible to maximise income. “Many graduates appear to be in jobs which do not require a degree-level education and at the same time, many businesses are reporting skills shortages, particularly at technician level. “This suggests that in terms of labour market outcomes at least, some graduates may have been better off considering other higher education qualifications that were cheaper, shorter and more relevant to the workplace.” Peers were also critical of the government’s promotion of apprenticeships, saying the levy for these has merely encouraged rebadging of existing training or even courses such as MBAs as apprenticeships. “The government’s target of 3 million apprenticeships has prioritised quantity over quality, and should be scrapped. The lack of clear accountability for the delivery and quality of apprenticeships is unacceptable,” the report says. The report follows a series of hearings and evidence from more than 150 individuals and organisations. Members of the committee include Lord Turnbull, a former head of the civil service, and Lord Layard, emeritus professor of economics at the London School of Economics. The report found evidence that while higher education funding for universities was at its highest level for 30 years, funding per student in further education has continued to fall. “The gap in resources between further education and universities was described by one witness as ‘quite staggering’,” it says. Universities UK, the lobbying group that represents most of the country’s higher education institutions, said: “A university degree remains an excellent investment. On average, graduates continue to earn £10,000 per year more than the average non-graduate and are more likely to be in employment.” The way student loans is included in the UK national accounts was also criticised by the committee as being motivated mainly by a desire to keep the costs of the loans out of the government’s deficit. “The decision to switch almost all higher education funding to tuition fees hides the true cost of public spending on higher education,” it concludes. Because a substantial proportion of student loans will never be repaid after 30 years – an estimated loss of more than £8bn on loans made in 2017-18 alone – the committee noted that the cost will fall on taxpayers in 2047-48. “It is unacceptable to expect future taxpayers to bear the brunt for funding today’s students,” the report says."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"inequality/2018/jun/10/rising-inequality-falling-union-membership","type":"article","sectionId":"inequality","sectionName":"Inequality","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-09T23:04:35Z","webTitle":"Rising inequality linked to drop in union membership","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/inequality/2018/jun/10/rising-inequality-falling-union-membership","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/inequality/2018/jun/10/rising-inequality-falling-union-membership","fields":{"headline":"Rising inequality linked to drop in union membership","bodyText":"The sharp fall in trade union membership since Margaret Thatcher came to power in 1979 has directly contributed to the high levels of income inequality that the current prime minister, Theresa May, has denounced and promised to tackle, according to a new study. The analysis, which looked at the effect unions have had in combating inequality and improving pay and working conditions in the UK and other countries, found that, where membership had fallen and union influence had decreased in workplaces, income inequalities had risen. At the same time, wealth had become concentrated more and more in the hands of the richest 1% in society. Conversely, during periods when union membership had grown and in countries where unions were strong, pay inequality had declined. The study by the centre-left Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR) also found that there was less pay inequality in firms where a trade union was present and represented at least some of the workforce. Between 1937 and 1979, trade union membership more than doubled (increasing by 126%), while the share of income going to the top 1% fell by two-thirds (65%). However, between 1979 and 2014, a period during which membership of unions fell by half (47%) in the UK, the share of wealth that went to the richest 1% more than doubled (leaping by 134%). The research comes at an important time for unions as the TUC marks its 150th anniversary and new figures show that the proportion of employees who are members of a union has fallen to an all-time low. Across the 37 member countries of the OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development), the study found that where collective bargaining was more common in workplaces, inequality tended to be lower. Reacting to the report, Frances O’Grady, the TUC general secretary, said: “If we want to live in a more equal Britain, we have to get more people into unions – and unions into more workplaces. Extending collective bargaining would improve workers’ pay, conditions and voice at work – and get them a fairer share of the wealth they create. “If Theresa May is serious about ‘protecting and enhancing’ workers’ rights, she must allow unions the right to go into every workplace.” The author of the report, Joe Dromey, a senior research fellow at IPPR, said: “In recent years, we have seen union membership fall by half, and collective bargaining coverage fall by two-thirds. At the same time, inequality has rocketed. Over the past four decades, the share of income going to the top 1% has nearly tripled. “Inequality is the scourge of modern times. If we want to tackle inequality – and if we want to improve productivity, pay and job quality – we need stronger unions and a renaissance in collective bargaining.” When May entered Downing Street on July 2016 she said she would govern in the interests of everyone not just those at the top of the income pile. Pledging to make this the guiding principle of her premiership she said: “The government I lead will be driven not by the interests of the privileged few, but by yours. We will do everything we can to give you more control over your lives. When we take the big calls we’ll think not of the powerful, but you. When we pass new laws, we’ll listen not to the mighty, but to you.” With nearly three million union members set to retire over the next two decades, IPPR suggests May’s government should act to reverse the decline in union membership by appointing a minister for labour with a target of doubling the proportion of workers covered by collective agreements, to 50%, by 2030. Other measures proposed include: mandatory collective bargaining to raise pay in low-productivity sectors; a lower threshold for unions to achieve recognition at employer level; a “right of access” – based on a New Zealand model – under which unions would be ensured access to workplaces to recruit members; and a “right to join”, with employers required to inform workers of their right to join a union on starting employment, with the right to have subs deducted at source."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/jun/11/i-could-have-ended-up-dead-why-womens-refuges-face-a-fatal-new-threat","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-11T12:00:19Z","webTitle":"‘I could have ended up dead’: why women’s refuges face a fatal new threat","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jun/11/i-could-have-ended-up-dead-why-womens-refuges-face-a-fatal-new-threat","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jun/11/i-could-have-ended-up-dead-why-womens-refuges-face-a-fatal-new-threat","fields":{"headline":"‘I could have ended up dead’: why women’s refuges face a fatal new threat","bodyText":"On average, a woman will attempt to leave a violent partner seven times before finally breaking away. Barbara tried several dozen times. But each time, her abusive husband found her, often assisted by the authorities she had fled to for help in the first place. It was the 1970s, and domestic abuse was thought of as exactly that: domestic. “We don’t have anything to do with that,” she was told by the police during one attempt to escape. Another time, when she was in a psychiatric hospital, buckling under the weight of the abuse, the Salvation Army told her husband where to find her. On a different occasion, a social worker asked her to wait while they got the police to escort her back to him, “in case he wants to hit you”. Those were the days before women’s refuges. But while attitudes towards domestic violence may have changed, many women are finding themselves in a place not dissimilar to that which Barbara found herself in almost 60 years ago – being brutally beaten, but unable to escape. Barbara met her husband at a party in a pub in 1967. “He was kind and gentle. Straightforwardly lovely,” she says. She was 21 and, by her own admission, “very, very naive”. She remembers their early days together fondly: “We were footloose and fancy free.” They moved to London briefly, without any money or a place to stay. It was, she says, “one of the happiest times of our relationship”. He was sober then, so “there was no fear of violence”. They had about 11p, “a small loaf of bread and a bit of cheese. That was a king’s banquet to us.” It was after they moved back to Scotland, while Barbara was pregnant with their first child, Fiona, that he began to hit her. “Once everything started, I grew up with a vengeance,” she says. Barbara, now in her 70s, doesn’t remember the first time he was violent towards her: “There were so many I can’t remember what the first was. There was one time when he tried choking me, that was quite early on. Luckily there was an unopened bottle of Whitbread’s on the bed and I belted him with it.” Violence always followed drinking. “If anyone offered him a spirit, that was it.” Things escalated and, although Barbara’s memory of the chronology is hazy, the following years were punctuated by extreme violence. “If he came home from the pub, I would smile, welcoming him, and he would go: ‘What are you laughing at?’ I’d probably get a hit, then.” She missed her brother’s wedding because he had beaten her that morning. “I wasn’t going to go with black eyes.” Her daughter Fiona’s earliest memory is of a caravan holiday with her father and uncle, who was also routinely violent. They were fighting. One of them had a knife. “In among the scuffle,” she says, “they knocked my baby brother off a bench and he landed face down.” She remembers his silence. “I’m nearly 50 now. I don’t know how a two or three-year-old could have thought that someone had died, but I did.” It was around that time that Fiona was first given tranquilisers – even as a two-year-old, she was wary enough of her father to fight sleep until she knew he was asleep too. “My experience of domestic violence,” she says, “was a woman covered in blood, slumped on the floor, sometimes unconscious. Children beside themselves. And my dad disappearing again.” Barbara had a difficult birth with her second child. After a caesarean, she remembers a swelling, and stitches coming loose. “I just watched my stomach opening up. It made coping with [the baby] very difficult.” Her husband wanted sex almost straight away when she came out of hospital, she says. “He threw me at the front door and all kind of things. It was not a nice time.” When her second child was six months old, Barbara’s mother gave her the bus fare to go down to London with her children. They ended up staying in a hostel, and it was there they heard about a place that had opened up for women fleeing domestic violence. It was 1972, and the world’s first women’s refuge had opened in Chiswick the previous year. Barbara doesn’t remember much about it, but she does remember being shocked. “It was something that would stun you. It was totally different to anything that you would see nowadays.” Sandra Horley, who is now the chief executive of Refuge, currently the largest single provider of domestic abuse refuge services in the country, worked there from 1983. “Nothing had existed like it before,” she says. “Women and children just flocked to our doors in their hundreds.” It was, she says, chaotic. “Very distressed women, women with black eyes, broken bones … they were all very traumatised and had been emotionally abused, controlled, blamed by their families and friends, because it was a taboo subject then.” Horley has several lifetimes’ worth of stories about the women who sought help there – the woman who kept fainting on arrival because, it turned out, she had a fractured skull, the women with cigarette burns all over their bodies. But, she says, domestic violence is more than that: it is about “the systematic, purposeful pattern of behaviour designed to control. You don’t have to hit a woman to abuse her.” She remembers how 150 women and children would sleep head-to-toe on mattresses, “squeezed like sardines” in this eight-bedroom, rat- and cockroach-infested Victorian house. A very far cry from the renovated refuges they run today, she is quick to point out. “Dilapidated is an understatement. It was straight out of Dickens.” But, she says, the women who knocked on the doors in the dead of night told her “over and over and over again that it was far better being in the refuge in that state than being beaten at home”. It was here that Barbara managed to find a cot for her baby and a mattress on the floor for her and Fiona. “In the morning, you picked it up, put it against the wall, folded your bedding and it became a space for kids to play.” There was no official support, beyond Refuge’s founder Erin Pizzey, now a controversial figure thanks in part to comments she has made stating that men are as much victims of domestic abuse as women. “There were no counsellors,” says Barbara. “We had Erin, who helped us; we would talk to her about problems, she was still trying to work things out.” Despite this, Barbara’s time in the refuge was a relatively happy one, full of camaraderie. “I felt secure. People rallied around to help.” She remembers a time when they heard a noise out in the backyard. Someone phoned the police. “They went into the garden and it was a cat. We had a laugh about that. “Everyone knew where everybody had come from, we were all in the same place in our lives.” She remembers one woman who went back to her husband. “We all thought she shouldn’t, and she came back and she had lost an eye.” After six months at the refuge, Barbara went back to Scotland. It was years until she managed to free herself for good – realising she couldn’t run any more. In 1979, she managed to get a harassment order and, in 1980, when her husband went to prison for manslaughter after killing a man in a brawl, she got a divorce and took out more injunctions against him. “I don’t know what it is, but they have a hold on you,” she says. “It has to be the right time to break that hold and get away.” “People used to tell us we should be nicer to Dad,” says Fiona. “Our next-door neighbour, who could hear the violence – council houses have thin walls – used to say, ‘Your mum’s asking for it.’” While Horley stresses that not all women want to go to a refuge – they have community-based services for those cases – many do. Yet refuges are facing unprecedented cuts: “There aren’t enough spaces to meet demand. Finding one is like finding gold dust, sometimes,” she says. Local authorities across England have cut their spending on refuges by nearly a quarter since 2010, according to the Bureau of Investigative Journalism. In March of this year, 65% of councils responding to freedom of information requests by the Guardian confirmed they had cut funding in real terms over the past seven years. Since 2011, Refuge has seen funding for its safe-houses slashed, on average, by a third. All of this is against the background of what Refuge calls the “single biggest threat to the future of refuges”: government proposals, published last October, to remove refuges from the welfare system, meaning vulnerable women will not be able to pay for placements using housing benefits. Currently, more than 50% of refuge funding comes from those benefits. If the proposals, due to come into force in 2020, go ahead, Refuge is warning that four out of 10 refuges will have to close. According to Women’s Aid, 60% of all referrals to refuges were declined in 2016/17, usually owing to a lack of space, with figures suggesting that rate is even higher for BME women. The upshot is women are being left without the support they need at what can be the most fraught part of their journey – the time they try to flee. It is ironic, given the funding crisis presented by the government’s proposals, that a new piece of legislation, spearheaded by Theresa May as part of her “longstanding commitment to end domestic abuse”, will provide a new statutory definition that includes economic as well as other non-physical abuse. It will also allow, according to May, for “tougher sentences in cases involving children, and will better protect victims with new domestic abuse protection orders”. While charities working with victims welcome these efforts – Women’s Aid is calling it a “once in a generation opportunity” – Horley says the legislation is in danger of ignoring the fundamental cause of violence against women and girls, “which is gender inequality and discrimination”. She hopes the bill, due to be brought forward in draft form later this parliamentary year, will do more to recognise the gendered nature of domestic abuse – of the 6,000 survivors Refuge supports daily, about 3,500 are children, 2,500 are women and 100 are men. “Inequality and violence against women are two sides of the same coin,” she says. “One in four women will experience domestic abuse in their lifetime and many more will experience other forms of abuse because they are women.” The proposals in the bill will “only be as good as their implementation”, she says. “We’re going to need funding to implement an infrastructure of services if we’re really going to end violence against women.” Sisters Uncut, a feminist direct-action group for domestic violence services, puts its perspective a little more bluntly: the bill, they say, is a “dangerous distraction from the real state of the domestic violence sector in the UK”, and that the government should be focusing on “refinancing refuges, reinstating legal aid and providing desperately needed housing for domestic violence survivors”. Barbara cannot be sure what would have happened were it not for her time in the refuge, but knows it could have been a lot worse. “I could have ended up dead, I suppose … I don’t know how I would have managed.” Fiona doesn’t remember the refuge, but she knows it was a lifeline. “People seem to think women should somehow get themselves out of these situations, but even now, it seems nigh-on impossible … People still need help.” Find support at refuge.org.uk"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"books/2018/jun/17/how-britain-really-works-smoking-kills-tamed-ten-species-changed-world-alice-roberts-review","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-17T06:00:09Z","webTitle":"In brief: How Britain Really Works; Smoking Kills; Tamed: Ten Species That Changed Our World – review","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jun/17/how-britain-really-works-smoking-kills-tamed-ten-species-changed-world-alice-roberts-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/jun/17/how-britain-really-works-smoking-kills-tamed-ten-species-changed-world-alice-roberts-review","fields":{"headline":"In brief: How Britain Really Works; Smoking Kills; Tamed: Ten Species That Changed Our World – review","bodyText":"How Britain Really Works Stig Abell John Murray, £20, pp416 Sun managing editor turned TLS editor Abell’s first book, a wry and insightful examination of Britain’s major institutions, reflects his background of populism and erudition.

While another writer might have plunged headlong into giddy farce, Laurain’s considered tale retains an elegant detachment from Valentine and his milieu, even as the bodies pile up.

Are they still a flourishing side who simply endured a blip during the Six Nations? Are Jones’s players still energised by their master’s voice? The first Test at Ellis Park this weekend feels a significant moment of truth. Nowhere will that sense be stronger than inside the red rose dressing room where a desire to prove the doubters wrong has emerged as one of the team’s primary motivations. “Everyone’s bagging us, everyone’s saying we can’t win,” Jones said. “From ex‑players to ex-coaches [they are saying] we’re no good so it’s a great opportunity to show we are of value.” Not so long ago England were a team who could not stop winning; now Jones is employing the same backs-to-the-wall rhetoric favoured by relegation-threatened football managers. Even a drawn series or a narrow 2-1 defeat would represent a clear improvement on recent events, albeit with an asterisk attached: win or lose, England urgently need to distance themselves from the weary mob who trailed in second-bottom of the Six Nations table. Even Jones has finally acknowledged his side were a shadow of their old selves, particularly in their last two away games in Scotland and France. “When I look back we got tired for a number of reasons. I think we got tactically, physically and mentally tired and that was shown in our results. We’ve all had a break, had a look at where we want to go tactically and how we want to prepare as a team.” All of which makes this first encounter with the Springboks unusually hard to second guess. England are not alone in trying to rediscover the best of themselves; the host nation have been enduring an even leaner spell and their new coach Rassie Erasmus has picked a team which, in several areas, has an untested feel. Siya Kolisi, their impressive new leader, is the first black Test captain in their history but a symbolic success in the same stadium where Nelson Mandela presented his predecessor Francois Pienaar with the Webb Ellis Cup in 1995 is not guaranteed. Listening to the composed Kolisi and a quietly determined Owen Farrell in the build-up has merely increased the sense of the fresh guard being taken by both these sides. Of the two new captains, Farrell has a bit more experience at his disposal and sounds marginally the more bullish: “We learned a lot about ourselves in the Six Nations … we were probably not as bad as everyone made out at the time. The challenge now is to get excited about this weekend and to be able to take a knock and still come through it. It’s not just about sticking in the game but for it to bring out the best in you. That’s something we’ll try and make sure happens.” The first priority will be to try and keep Farrell and England’s other most influential players on the pitch for as long as possible. If anything befalls Maro Itoje or Nick Isiekwe early on, the second-row back-up is being supplied by the debutant Brad Shields who has played the vast majority of his Super Rugby career in the back row. If Tom Curry also departs prematurely and Billy Vunipola’s hamstring starts grumbling again, it could turn into a very long afternoon at a venue where South Africa have not lost to any side from the home nations, aside from the 2009 Lions in a dead rubber, since 1972. Assuming they can hold their own at the breakdown, however, England will hope to examine two possible areas of Springbok vulnerability. The home side’s back three are potentially lethal with ball in hand but not necessarily so reliable under the high ball, making an aerial bombardment from the visitors a strong possibility. The absence of the injured Eben Etzebeth and, crucially, their marauding new hooker Malcolm Marx, also makes the lineout a crucial area. South Africa have plenty of good jumpers but none with a massive amount of Test experience. While no Springbok side ever lacks entirely for physicality, it may be England who set out to slow the game down to their pace, unleash their big men around the fringes and play for territory. Jones never won at Ellis Park with Australia but he knows a fair amount about preparing teams to play up on the high veld. “The game stats show the game is a little bit different at altitude. Less ball in play, shorter periods of play, the ball travels further and people run faster. We have spoken about that. The general feedback from the players is that you get that ‘hit’ in the first 10 minutes and it feels like you are never going to recover. Then you do recover and it is all about your ability to absorb that psychologically. If you have got a good side you win there, if you haven’t got a good side, you don’t win there.” If the Vunipola brothers, Itoje, George and Farrell maintain the kind of form that swept Saracens to the Premiership title at Twickenham two weeks ago, a relieving victory is entirely possible. Elliot Daly has barely put a foot wrong in the past 12 months and should relish the extra freedom of wearing 15; at outside-centre Henry Slade is too talented a footballer not to nail down a regular place at some stage. At various points over the next fortnight, Jones is also hoping other strong 2019 candidates will emerge: “Some players will rise during the tour and some will fall, that’s the way it always is. You don’t get many harder tours than this in world rugby. New Zealand and South Africa are the ultimate tests of tough rugby.” Which is precisely why this trip promises to be the most revealing since the all-conquering Clive Woodward era. “It’s a new side, a new team, a new captain and we want to play the game in a new way,” Jones said. “It’s an opportunity for us to take a step forward and start the march to the World Cup. Ultimately, to win it, you’ve got to win these big games.” Fail to relocate their old winning habit and England stand little chance of being big in Japan."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/jun/22/experience-my-zip-wire-failed-at-500ft","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-22T09:00:25Z","webTitle":"Experience: my zip wire snapped at 500ft","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jun/22/experience-my-zip-wire-failed-at-500ft","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jun/22/experience-my-zip-wire-failed-at-500ft","fields":{"headline":"Experience: my zip wire failed at 500ft","bodyText":"My husband and I were excited as the cruise ship pulled into its final stop, a small port in Mexico, in April 2016. Ryan and I had been zip lining before, so when we saw signs for an ecopark boasting 11 lines in the middle of the jungle, we thought, “Let’s go for it.” We got off the ship at 8am and had to be back by 5pm. We’re avid cruisers, so we knew activities were much cheaper to buy at the port than onboard. By 10.30am, we were admiring the view from a high platform, waiting to cross the deep gorge by zip line – a distance of 2,100ft. Ryan went first. It took about a minute for him to cross. Then it was my turn. I’m petite, at 5ft 3in and 120lb, so wasn’t worried about putting much strain on the line. I felt safe: I was wearing a harness and helmet. The guide said, “Have fun!” and sent me out. I was 500ft up in the air, enjoying the beautiful view of the ocean to the left and the rainforest below. The first I knew that something had gone wrong was an eerie silence. Until then, there was the high-pitched zinging of the zip line. All of a sudden, it stopped. I was halfway across the gorge and began falling in slow motion for what felt like an eternity. After several seconds, I felt a jolt and heard rustling. Then there was a hard yank. When I opened my eyes, I was upside down. The handlebars of the zip line had caught in the V of a tree branch. That broke my fall, but my body flipped backwards and I was hanging 40ft from the ground with my feet above my head. I could hear a branch snap. That terrified me. I thought, if I fall the rest of the way, I’ll die. I was wearing shorts, a vest and flipflops, and I was covered in blood. Soon, huge ants and spiders were crawling on me. I screamed for help. Ryan was waiting for me on the landing platform when he heard a loud noise and saw the metal cable slip past his foot and disappear. “What the hell just happened?” he said, but the guide had no idea. Ryan was so relieved when he heard me screaming, though he couldn’t know if I was impaled on a branch or paralysed. He went down the mountain, ripping through the bushes, following the sound of my voice. When he reached me, I kept repeating, “Please, baby, catch me if I fall.” My leg was split open. My left shin was the size of an orange. There were huge abrasions on my right leg from where the metal cables had zipped through my skin – I don’t know how they didn’t cut my legs off. My right buttock was cut open and dripping blood on to Ryan below. Nobody knew how to get me down. After 20 minutes, they loosened the tension at the end of the zip line, which was still attached to the base platform. I had to turn the handlebar sideways, to release myself. I knew Ryan would catch me. Back at the base, an ambulance was called and the guides tried to feed me tequila, which I didn’t want. At the clinic, they took x-rays and brought in a surgeon. I didn’t want surgery, though, as nothing was broken. I knew the ship would be leaving at 5pm and didn’t want to be left behind, especially as our passports were onboard. I had to convince the crew to let me back on, signing waivers to say I wouldn’t use the ship’s medical services, as the Mexican clinic had deemed me unfit to travel. Days later, back home in California, I was purple from the waist down. I was in an immobiliser for six weeks, to keep my leg straight, and it was three months before I could drive. While it wasn’t broken, the muscle was balled up. Even now, that leg aches every day. I still have flashbacks. I have to sleep with the TV on, as I can’t bear the silence. Sometimes my husband and I wake ourselves up screaming in the night. We didn’t sign any waiver at the ecopark, but we weren’t entitled to compensation. I never got an apology from the company. How does a zip line give way like that? The company denied that the line had become detached or broken, but the fact that I ended up upside down in a tree means something went very wrong. You hear about deaths on zip lines. Some people fall from 20ft and die, so to fall from 500ft and walk away without serious injuries is mind-boggling. Zip lines are a gamble, but then life is a gamble. It’s not going to happen to everybody. Do your research, but don’t live your life in fear. • As told to Sophie Haydock Do you have an experience to share?

He and his band are sitting cramped around one of the tiny tables of Le Baiser Salé, a jazz club in Paris’s Marais district, where three grey-haired men in smart trousers are thrumming away on stage. It’s the early hours and Washington has come here after playing a full show at the 1,500-capacity Bataclan; now he and his bandmates are facing a familiar conundrum: wind down or give in to the irresistible urge to get back on stage right here. Unsurprisingly, music wins. The club’s in-house band apprehensively welcome Washington, flanked by his drummer Tony Austin and keys player Brandon Coleman. Then a sort of friendly duel ensues. It’s intriguing to watch the old guard – talented but stiff Parisian trads – figure out how to interlock notes with the new wave, a crew of California cats dressed like they’ve stepped off a Funkadelic record cover, freewheeling through the standards, fizzing with a bold new language. The next day, Washington laughs when I suggest that most musicians would rather party or pass out than find somewhere else to play after a big gig. “It’s just fun,” says the 37-year-old in a laidback drawl, clinking the silver rings adorning his fingers. “It’s chill.” Two weeks ago, he performed with a 40-strong choir and orchestra at Coachella, one of America’s major music festivals. It makes no difference to him and his band – most of whom he’s known since childhood – whether their audience is 20 or 20,000. “If we were stuck on a desert island with no people or no money,” he says, “we would still play music the whole time.” For now, however, Washington is the man credited with leading a jazz revival in the past few years, usually in a dashiki tunic and an array of medallions. He was one of the leading instrumentalists who contributed to Kendrick Lamar’s landmark album To Pimp a Butterfly in 2015, which helped bring contemporary jazz to a new audience. Washington’s own debut, a triple-disc album fittingly called The Epic, swiftly followed, continuing Lamar’s themes of black American identity and leading one critic to write that Washington is “the jazz voice of Black Lives Matter”. He’s also been called a jazz celebrity, who has the star power to launch an EP with an installation at a venerable museum (last year’s Harmony of Difference, at the Whitney in New York). In person, Washington is warm, witty and as breezy as his approach to genre. His maximalist fusions pull liberally from hip-hop, Afrobeat, funk and electro-funk; from the spiritual jazz skronking of elders such as John Coltrane and Pharoah Sanders, the cosmic ideas of collective improvisation laid down by Sun Ra, and the theatricality of 60s and 70s film soundtracks. As a result, he doesn’t much like the term “jazz”; instead he says “the music is the music”. “It’s like if all of a sudden I gave a different name to your hair than I gave to you, it wouldn’t make your hair a separate thing,” he says. “If I call your hair ‘Dilly’” – he laughs again – “like, ‘Hey, Dilly!’, it’s still you. I look at all this music as part of my heritage. Jazz is a part of me.” The cheerful ease with which he can bowl into a club and take over the stage is partly down to these links with jazz’s legacy. Up-and-coming musicians in the field often talk of the pressure they feel to not only appease the gatekeepers of tradition but to live up to the greats. Washington never felt daunted. “It wasn’t alien to us,” he explains. “[Jazz] comes from poor black neighbourhoods, so because of that foundation we thought of it as a support. It feels more like a horse that you can ride out on than a weight, the horse that’s taken all your forefathers around the world and allowed you to express yourself.” Washington grew up in South Central Los Angeles, which after the 1992 riots became a shorthand for “ghetto”. His mother is a science teacher, his father a music teacher, and he started playing sax at 13 (his dad also plays flute in his son’s touring band). Washington and Ronald Bruner Jr – one of his two drummers and the brother of bassist/songwriter/vocalist Thundercat – would call each other on the phone to boast about how much they’d each practised that day. “There’s a sense of urgency that you get growing up where we grew up,” says Washington. “I hate to talk about it in that sense because it’s a really beautiful place but there’s pressure to become a gangster, or to be poor.” Music, he says, was “one of the paths to success that you feel you have access to in my neighbourhood. Because it doesn’t always feel like you have access to all of them. When you find something that you’re good at, you definitely have a motivation to become great at it, because that’s your way to overcome these stereotypes.” A tight sense of community and a vibrant local music scene was influential, too. At the same time as listening to west coast hip-hop, Washington was hanging out in Leimert Park, a largely African area of LA, which is home to the nonprofit performing arts club World Stage, where he first saw Sanders play. Washington continued to find deeper connections between hip-hop and jazz when, in 2009, he started working as a session musician for Snoop Dogg. At the same time, he began to forge a new fusion LA sound with the West Coast Get Down, the collective with whom he still plays. Dubbed “the Wu-Tang of jazz”, these musicians, including Coleman, Austin, Bruner Jr and double bassist Miles Mosley, pooled their money one December to buy 30 days of studio time and cut all their records (including The Epic) in one go. But it was the call to go into the studio with Kendrick Lamar that fast-tracked Washington into mainstream consciousness. “I went in and I didn’t really know what he wanted me to do,” he remembers of the Butterfly sessions. “It was pretty hush-hush. I felt like I was going to go meet Barack Obama or something.” Still, he knew instinctively that Lamar’s expansive meditation on black identity was going to make an impact. “There’s this notion that music has to be confined to some small, simple place to be popular, something I never believed,” he says. “And when I heard that record I was like, he’s about to dispel that myth, he’s trying to open people up.” Lamar’s record was also a lightning rod for the Black Lives Matter movement and, even if instrumental music is more open to interpretation, Washington says his own music can’t help but also reflect his experience as an African American. “It’s a reality that I’m living in,” he says, “a reality I’ve lived with since way before there was a term ‘Black Lives Matter’, that black people all around the world have lived with for a long time. This idea that because of the colour of your skin your life is not valued at the [level] that other people’s lives are. And so my music is a representation of who I am. When you’re making music, you’re creeping up on your heart and pouring it out into something.” His music, he says, can’t help but be politically charged “because I’m living on this earth. I don’t know how you can live on this planet, with all the information that is so readily accessible, and not be concerned with what people are doing. I feel like we’re at a crossroads where society’s going to choose to either go in a direction that’s going to lead to the world being a more universally fair place, or less, or it’s going to go backwards, to what we did in the past. Society’s pushing towards this idea of fairness, love and compassion. But then we have, you know, Trump and Brexit. As musicians we have one of the greatest tools of bringing people together in music. So, I wouldn’t say [it’s a] responsibility but we have an opportunity to sway things one way or the other, you know?” We move on to discussing police brutality. “It’s not just the police,” he says. “It’s not just the fact that police officers are committing violent acts… on innocent black people, it’s that our society, these juries, these judges, these prosecuting attorneys, these people who are not part of the police department are deeming these acts to be lawful. If it’s lawful for you to take my life because of my skin colour, there’s something wrong.” Washington’s second LP, Heaven and Earth, is another vast concept album that oscillates between idealism and realism. Sounding like part stoner novel, part Plato metaphysics, it is, he says, about creating new realities: Earth is “the world that we’re in [and] is what we imagine it to be” and Heaven is one where “what we think it’s going to be, it ends up becoming”. “I was looking to take this journey where we start off [with the] understanding that what we think and what we imagine affects our experience,” Washington continues. “If my thoughts and dreams can affect the world, that means essentially I am making my own world for myself. The world isn’t what the ‘world leaders’ want it to be; it’s what we all make it to be. Those people don’t really have power, we give them their power. If we all took that mentality of, ‘I’m going to make the world the way it’s supposed to be, to the best extent that I can do it’, true change could happen.” This is why he’s kicked off his album with the rallying cry of Fists of Fury, a cover of a Bruce Lee theme track that adds charged lyrics sung by Patrice Quinn into his musical mix: “Our time as victims is over/ We will no longer ask for justice/ Instead, we will take our retribution”. It is, Washington says, “a recognition of the reality that life is this never-ending struggle. I always have something on my plate, but to overcome it you [need to have] the mentality that you can overtake it. “I know that this grander scheme of thinking, the idea that we make the earth what we want it to be, can seem a bit naive, but that song, to me, is about not waiting for someone to do things for us but to do them for ourselves. One of the biggest problems we have is letting other people think for you. I listen to everyone, but I only believe myself.” I wonder what Washington is thinking when he wields his instrument, eyes closed. How does he communicate musically with his band? “It’s like being at a party. You meet someone and you try to find common ground,” he says. “You fish around a little bit. ‘Do you like sports? OK, so what kind of sports are you into? You’re into basketball. Are you into politics? Are you reading any books or watching any shows?’ And then you start to get a gist of who the person you’re talking to is. You’re constantly figuring it out.” There’s no doubting the renewed interest in jazz, but does it have the kind of crossover appeal to reach pop audiences? “I think so,” says Washington. “I’ve always felt there’s a misconception of jazz, that it requires some type of superiority to be appreciated. The idea of a music that connects you to your inner self – that connection is something that most people would enjoy if they tried.” Washington says jazz will continue to shape modern music, as it has been doing for decades. But can he see a future where Rihanna has a mean sax solo in the middle of a song? “Yeah, if she wants her show to be great,” he says, laughing. “I mean, I think it’s already [begun]. Even at Coachella, seeing Beyoncé with a brass marching band, people are learning the value of what jazz represents: ideas of musicianship and allowing multitudes of people to express themselves within your show. It’s growing. Once you kind of get a taste of that, it’s hard to go back.” Heaven and Earth is out on Young Turks on Friday"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"cities/2018/jul/10/who-owns-the-space-under-cities-the-attempt-to-map-the-ground-beneath-our-feet","type":"article","sectionId":"cities","sectionName":"Cities","webPublicationDate":"2018-07-10T06:15:36Z","webTitle":"Who owns the space under cities?

The attempt to map the earth beneath us","bodyText":"Just over a year ago I was sent a photograph of a tunnel-boring machine in a dirt lot in Los Angeles. The caption read: “Elon Musk is about to start digging.” The message was from Wayne Chambliss, a geographer in southern California, who tends to be prescient in such matters – and indeed, Musk’s freshly minted Boring Company soon set its machine loose, ripping through the subsurface soil under the SpaceX headquarters in Hawthorne to create a short tunnel. This pet project – to test a private mass-transit system based on Hyperloop technology that would magnetically propel small pods and cars through LA’s underbelly – has now become a serious challenge to the famously traffic-snarled city’s failure to create viable public transit. The company’s website suggests “roads must go 3D” and Musk has stated “in theory, you could have hundreds of levels of tunnel” as more thoroughfares are required. As so often with Musk’s projects, the company is treating subterranean space as a tabula rasa – or in this case, tubula rasa – to be played in for profit. Indeed, in most major cities, just as you can’t expect commercial planes to stop flying over your house through aerial highways, you also can’t prevent public transport routes being dug out underneath it. Outside Melbourne, Australia, for example, the government is currently preparing to bore underneath 260 properties – including more than 100 homes – to build a road tunnel. Homeowners received a letter explaining that their “sub-stratum” land was being sequestered – without compensation. In London, a city with 150 years of trenching, digging and boring to its name, the chaos is reaching new depths. According to Newcastle University’s Global Urban Research Unit, more than 4,600 basements have been granted planning permission in the last decade – in just seven of London’s 32 boroughs. The space under London is now getting so busy that the Ordnance Survey, Future Cities Catapult and the British Geological Survey have joined forces to create a new initiative called Project Iceberg, which will attempt to aggregate cities’ subterranean data. In London it will include transport tunnel information, geological records and maps of 1.5m km (0.9m miles) of underground utilities and four million kilometres of telecommunications lines. Los Angeles does not have the same degree of vertical complication as a much older city like London, and the city council seems to be tentatively backing Musk’s new private transit tunnels. But Musk’s vision of underground dominance presents us with another thorny problem: what complications arise from passing the underground into the hands of private industry? And should the state be allowed to cede subterranean land to a billionaire to build a private transport system? From heaven to hell – with caveats Historically, the foundation of property law in the US and UK was enshrined in the Latin phrase “Cuius est solum, eius est usque ad coelum et ad inferos” – which roughly translates as: “Whoever owns the soil, holds title up to the heavens and down to the depths of hell.” Subterranean scholar Dr Marilu Melo of the University of Sydney explains that not all countries behave this way. In Mexico, for example, “property rights are effectively superficial, they do not extend volumetrically into the earth,” she says. Even in places that have traditionally been ardent defenders of private property, however, once human beings took to the air and started tunnelling underground, the old heaven to hell ideal began to require caveats. In Australia, although pre-1891 land titles went “to the centre of the Earth”, those issued after 1891 extend down just 15 metres (49 feet). The new Melbourne tunnels will edge right up to this legal vertical limit. “Land prices tend to force private construction downwards, especially where there are planning limits on upward expansion,” says the Ordnance Survey’s Rollo Home. There has been a growing concern in London over “iceberg architecture”, where the volume of subterranean expansions can quickly eclipse the “host” architecture in size. The Newcastle researchers separate the London basements it studied into what sounds like fast-food drink sizes: “standard”, “large” and “mega”. In the “mega” category, they found that on average owners pulled almost 1,700 cubic metres of dirt from under their houses. Many of the basements contained cinemas, gymnasiums, pools, wine cellars and panic rooms. One even included plans for a subterranean beach with an accompanying waterfall. Kensington and Chelsea and Westminster councils have now taken steps to curb the maximum depth of such projects. The Ordnance Survey has suggested that £5.5bn ($7bn) is spent every year on exploratory excavation just to figure out what’s underground, and according to a 2013 Mayor of London report, £150m of damage is done every year to underground utilities because of a lack of information. Underground urban planning of an extension of a tube line, for instance, requires knowledge of where sewer and water systems, electricity and utility tunnels, bunkers, foundations, basements, cellars, vaults, passageways, archaeological remains, data centres, basements, and other transport tunnels are located. Most cities have a “dial before you dig” hotline because there is no central holding place for data about underground space. Enter Project Iceberg. The goal is to serve as a framework for data on all of these underground elements, from which a comprehensive visualisation can be built. The resulting map would need to be an all-inclusive spatial database, but how volumetric cartography might look is not yet imagined. It could perhaps be something like Bruno Imbrizi’s real-time 3D tube map that went viral in 2013. Or the framework could feed an augmented reality engine, so that aiming a phone camera at the ground would reveal what is underneath. Singapore, Helsinki and Hong Kong are model cities for developing underground masterplans – and it is no coincidence that tightly controlled and regulated cities hold better data in this regard. Private developers digging and burrowing into cities like Los Angeles and London make this immensely more complicated – as does the need for secrecy on many underground projects. The underground is, after all, where we hide things. When Westminster tube station was built, much of it had to be “planned by omission”, a guide told me. Engineers would submit plans and the government would send them back with suggestions for different routes – refusing to explain why. Land registry data later confirmed what anti-secrecy journalists like Duncan Campbell had suspected all along: the existence of a network of covert tunnels connecting government buildings in Westminster. The government, in short, wasted loads of public money denying the existence of something that it had secretly spent a great deal of public money building in the first place. Further clandestine excavations spring to mind: tunnels under borders used to smuggle people and contraband; shipping containers stockpiled with food buried in the wee hours by doomsday preppers. Given London’s history of furtive diggers – like William Lyttle, the Mole Man of Hackney, who burrowed under his house for 40 years – it doesn’t seem a stretch to imagine a TfL boring machine punching through the side of a fallout shelter dug without permission. Nowhere left to hide Although it is an open project, Iceberg researchers have suggested creating a hidden vault layer in the 3D map, where secret data could be locked away from general view. Yet as was clear in the Westminster example, the absence of data is data in a comprehensive archive. Given this, both governments and criminals who wish to keep their underground infrastructure under wraps may find it difficult to do so in the coming age of volumetric transparency. We have little virtual privacy left; within decades, all spatial privacy may evaporate, too. The US government has been trying to map the subsurface of the Earth from outer space, by measuring differences in the gravity field at the Earth’s surface. An Air Force project undertaken more than 20 years ago on a tunnel in Texas was able to capture “reasonably accurate readings of the tunnel’s size, shape, variable depth, and orientation”, as Chambliss told attendees of the recent annual American Association of Geographers conference in New Orleans. This could soon enable a planetary-scale survey of the underground, revealing new tunnels, bunkers, silos, and compounds. His recommendation to the assembled geographers: “Dig now.” Many are. In Sweden, which already has 65,000 known shelters for a population of just under 10 million people, the government has begun building new bunkers. Seoul in South Korea has more than 3,000 large public shelters. In the plains of Kansas, I recently visited two cold war-era Atlas intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) silos being redeveloped into “Survival Condos for the wealthy. Meanwhile, the US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (Darpa) is currently funding a “subterranean challenge”, soliciting bids for techniques to enhance “situational awareness” of global underground spaces, with a $2m prize. The challenge is to create machines that can make their way through tunnel systems, urban undergrounds and natural caves. Robots will need to climb, crawl, squeeze and sense their way through these environments, with an eye towards future use in dangerous or hostile underground environments that human bodies can’t access. These robots will effectively become our subterranean avatars, and their deployment will mean that there really is nowhere left to hide. “If we are to take control of the subsurface, we need to have an holistic view of the subsurface,” says Home. But who is to wield that control? For almost 200 years – since Marc Brunel’s invention of the tunnelling shield, which protects workers as they inch forward during excavation – human beings have almost exclusively excavated using money from the public purse. Only two years ago, for example, more than £9bn of public money was used in Switzerland to tunnel 35 miles through the Alps, down to depths of almost 2.4km. Underground has long been a space of public investment, communal infrastructure, exploration and, when required, secret assembly. In many ways subterranean environs have been more democratic than the surface of the Earth, as depicted in Gabriel Tarde’s 1896 utopian novel The Underground Man, in which in which people not only survive but thrive after a “fortunate disaster” forces human kind to burrow. But as we rush to render our underground world in three dimensions, increasingly it appears we are backing – tacitly or otherwise – private ownership and comprehensive surveillance. The mayor of Chicago, Rahm Emanuel, has just handed Musk’s Boring Company a contract to build a Hyperloop to shuttle people from O’Hare International Airport to the city centre. Although Musk’s company will build the tunnel, the city will own it and lease it back to Musk for use, and Musk has also stated that (unlike in Melbourne) no land will be seized to build it. Both sound like good caveats, but neither dilute the fact that this will be a private, for-profit, transport system – not public transport. Just like our drone-filled skies, the undergrounds of the future appear to be just another territory for the rich and powerful to colonise the rich and powerful , a process that may replicate and compound the inequalities of the present. This may be cause enough to throw a wrench into Musk’s tunnel-boring machines. Metaphorically speaking, of course.

His decision to put the Daily Mail’s warhorse of an editor, Paul Dacre, out to grass has been an extraordinary example of procrastination. He should have handed the job to Geordie Greig five years ago, when he was just a year into his editorship of the Mail on Sunday and champing at the bit. If the Europhile Rothermere had not dithered, it is possible to imagine there would have been a different outcome in the EU referendum. Greig, a passionate Remainer, a Tory with a streak of liberalism and imbued with an establishment ethos, would never have campaigned for Brexit, and certainly not with Dacre’s fanaticism. We may never know why Rothermere, aka Jonathan Harold Esmond Vere Harmsworth, the fourth viscount in his line, waited so long. What we do know is that his vacillation allowed Dacre too great a licence, for far too long, to pursue a relentless reactionary agenda of chauvinism, xenophobia, misogyny and racism, not to mention the bullying of several people in public life along with his own staff. Yet Rothermere had the gall to mark Dacre’s belated kick upstairs to a non-job as the passing of “the greatest Fleet Street editor of his generation”. Admittedly, there was a measure of corporate hyperbole but surely, m’lord, your tongue was in your cheek. Let’s get the “greatness” in perspective. Dacre has always produced a technically admirable, popular newspaper. If not always first with the news, its reporting has been more than proficient. Its choice of features is smart, if rather predictable, and the quality of its feature writing first rate. Attention to detail is evident on every page. It’s important, however, to acknowledge that Dacre has been blessed with unparalleled editorial resources. At his disposal has been the largest journalistic staff in national newspapers and a budget that makes rival editors’ eyes water. He has been able to open a chequebook to buy any story. Space has been unlimited. On some days, the Mail has more editorial pages than the Sun, Daily Express and Daily Mirror put together. Journalistic professionalism, inaugurated under his predecessor, David English, is an essential component. It has given credence to the controversial content. Much has been made by those who praise Dacre’s achievement in articulating the concerns of that mythical construct “middle England”. According to a former Mail marketing director, these “middle Englanders” are a mixture of wealthy executives, affluent retirees and secure families who live in settled suburbia. Maybe. Of far greater importance is whether Dacre’s Mail represents their opinions, or provokes them. What is often missed in a simplistic analysis of the relationship between popular newspapers and their audiences, is the way in which deep-seated prejudices are reinforced rather than challenged. Dacre’s brand of conservatism, as promulgated day after day, has not only sought to buttress the outlook of largely comfortable, white, middle-class, small ‘c’ conservatives, but to play on their fears that their way of life is under persistent threat by forces they cannot control. Democracy has let them down. By contrast, the Mail is their only true friend. In acting for them, the Mail has created, and also sustained, a siege mentality. In so doing, while claiming to hold power to account, it has tended to undermine its very foundation by demeaning both politicians and politics itself. Indeed, there is the central contradiction at the heart of the Mail agenda under Dacre: it decries the very institutions it affects to support. Modernity, in its myriad forms, is viewed as a menace. Why can’t everything stay as it was in, say, the 1950s? Why do we need to have immigrants? Why should women work? Why aren’t the judges proper Conservatives as they were in times of yore? What point is there to the meddlesome European Union? Dacre is the epitome of a grumpy old man, with the added advantage of having a platform to proselytise his Blimpish views to a vast audience. Vast? With barely 1.3m daily sales and a likely readership of not much more than 4 million, it might appear as though the Mail has only a marginal hold on the attention of a population exceeding 65 million. But its influence stretches way beyond that. Of far greater significance is the status the Mail enjoys with opinion formers including, crucially, broadcasting outlets. It benefits from a media narcissism which allows it to set the daily political and social agenda. There is a disproportionate reaction on a daily basis to what it says. It has gained the kind of kudos that puts former Fleet Street agenda setters, the Sun and Daily Mirror, in the shade. At this point, some of you might be tempted to point to the Mail’s greatest claim to editorial fame: its fight for justice on behalf of murdered teenager Stephen Lawrence. It cannot be denied that it was an exceptional piece of journalism that had far-reaching implications. Critics have raised any number of cavils, not least that Dacre acted after realising he had known Stephen’s father. Until that point, the paper had covered the story in its usual negative fashion, viewing complaints about police inaction through the prism of its law-and-order stance. It is crass to view that single campaign as adequate compensation for the 26 years in which Dacre has shamelessly played to, and fortified, the worst aspects of an intolerant and isolationist fraction of the British population. This bigotry culminated in pro-Brexit hysteria. At times, such as the front-page attacks on judges and Gina Miller, Dacre appeared to have lost all reason. How, one was given to saying, can Rothermere live with this stuff? Why is he keeping him in the chair? Now it is all too late. Greig will certainly pursue a less strident line, but the damage has been done. Dacre, the grand old Duke of York, marched his army up to the top of the Brexit hill, and they are still there, firing Mail-manufactured missiles at the so-called Remoaners. Greig cannot march them down again. He cannot turn back the clock. Although Brexit will be seen as Dacre’s legacy, see it instead as Rothermere’s. The last of Britain’s press barons has let his country down."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/jun/09/chris-grayling-fault-rail-chaos-lord-adonis","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-09T11:18:32Z","webTitle":"Chris Grayling to blame for rail chaos, says Lord Adonis","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jun/09/chris-grayling-fault-rail-chaos-lord-adonis","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/jun/09/chris-grayling-fault-rail-chaos-lord-adonis","fields":{"headline":"Chris Grayling to blame for rail chaos, says Lord Adonis","bodyText":"Pressure is growing on transport secretary Chris Grayling to take responsibility for the rail chaos that has disrupted the lives of thousands of commuters over the past three weeks. Politicians including MPs and former Labour transport minister Lord Adonis, as well as rail bosses and trade unions, are urging action. Around 15,000 trains have been cancelled or have run severely late since Govia Thameslink Railway (GTR) and Northern Rail brought in new timetables in May. Passengers have reported missing work, or regularly being late, and last week GTR resorted to laying on taxis for children taking GCSE exams. Adonis said that when he was in charge of the UK’s transport network, he had blocked similarly sweeping timetable changes. “He [Grayling] obviously shouldn’t have permitted a wholesale timetable change across the country. The industry always wants to make big changes to the timetable – they did when I was transport secretary and I stopped them.” Grayling said last week that he had acted on advice from the Thameslink readiness committee – which includes Network Rail and train company representatives – as well as “personal assurances” from GTR bosses. But Adonis said: “He started blaming the train companies and then his own department for things for which he was ultimately responsible, and he’s now hiding behind the readiness committee. The whole point is that your job is to make a judgment. You don’t bring in system-wide changes until you’ve examined them locally – especially given there were such evident problems before.” The Observer understands that GTR executives may also dispute Grayling’s contention in the Commons last week that the company had assured him “it would be fine” once the timetable change was introduced. Even if inquiries do confirm Grayling’s version of events, pressure on the transport secretary from all parties is intense: more than 50 MPs whose constituents were affected have sought meetings with ministers this week. Lib Dem Tom Brake, who signed a cross-party letter from 20 MPs demanding action, said: “Given this is a mess of Chris Grayling’s own making, questions must be asked about whether he can clean it up. I wouldn’t be surprised if he soon finds his ministerial car returned permanently to the carpool.” Passengers are still waiting to hear news of a fresh compensation deal, which GTR said was awaiting approval by the Department for Transport, while the terms of an independent inquiry are likely to rule out public hearings. Rail companies have tried to stem the crisis by withdrawing around 6% of services, reducing short-notice cancellations significantly on Northern. GTR will launch a medium-term timetable in July. Northern’s troubles could also be eased after it agreed a deal with Aslef, the drivers’ union, to allow rest-day working, enabling training to progress more rapidly and with less disruption. But an admission that Northern will not restore trains to the Lake District for at least four weeks has angered many in Cumbria, with tourism businesses gearing up for high season. Thousands more services will be taken out of action later this month in three days of strikes called by guards in the Rail, Maritime and Transport union. RMT general secretary Mick Cash said his members would try to meet Grayling at a regional transport summit in Manchester later this month. “We are calling out Chris Grayling, who has presided over the rail chaos,” he said. “We will be taking frontline rail workers to meet with him at this northern event.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/jun/11/robert-martinez-world-cup-belgium-england-russia-criticism","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-11T15:30:23Z","webTitle":"Roberto Martínez: ‘At the World Cup we need to show we are prepared to suffer’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jun/11/robert-martinez-world-cup-belgium-england-russia-criticism","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/jun/11/robert-martinez-world-cup-belgium-england-russia-criticism","fields":{"headline":"Roberto Martínez: ‘At the World Cup we need to show we are prepared to suffer’","bodyText":"“Everyone remembers their first World Cup as their introduction to football,” Roberto Martínez says on an intriguing afternoon at Belgium’s training centre in Tubize. We’re just a short drive from Brussels but a long way from Sochi where Belgium, whom Martínez has managed since August 2016, play their first game as one of the tournament favourites against Panama on Monday. “I remember my first World Cup in 1982, when I was 10, starting a Panini collection with my dad and getting all the stickers and trying to understand as much as I could about the other nations,” Martínez says. “So to be involved in the tournament, as an international manager, means a great deal. But, just like then, football is all about the players. I have a fantastic group and I believe totally in them.” Martínez is under intense pressure. He leads one of the most talented squads in Russia while his position is debated in Belgium, where the Spaniard has never quite been accepted. Yet his enthusiasm is unstinting, on a day where he gives up 80 minutes to engage so fully with this interview it is hard to think of another World Cup manager who would be as generous. Some have suggested that, considering the excellence of his squad, anything less than topping a group which includes England and Tunisia and reaching at least the semi-finals should be considered a failure. Martínez is too cute to make any predictions but he exudes a breezy confidence. “Failure is not trying to win,” he says airily before outlining his challenges in more precise detail. “We’re going to be adventurous and brave. We’re going to try and win every game. But the feelings you develop in the three group games are essential. “We’ve got the talent but, clearly, a country like Germany already has the belief. When you speak with ex-players from Germany they tell you that when they pulled on the shirt they had no doubt they would win. That psychology is powerful in knock-out tournaments. We need to show that mentality and I believe we will because our attitude and talent is very good.” Belgium’s record under Martínez looks impressive. They have played 18 matches, losing only once, and they were the first European country to qualify for the World Cup from an easy group. “We have only lost my first game, the friendly against Spain, and since then the players showed incredible focus. Spain was a very interesting game because Julen Lopetegui took over as their manager at a similar time. That was both our first game in charge. It was similar when he took over Porto and we faced each other in a friendly at Everton. “Spain are in a very good moment. They’ve got a really good mixture of players that already know what it means to win a major tournament and younger players that have played in this style the last 10 years. From that point we learned a lot tactically and adjusted. We are ready to compete against teams like Spain.” One of his star players, Kevin De Bruyne, challenged Martínez last November. After Belgium drew with Mexico, De Bruyne said they had been outwitted and, despite the 3-3 scoreline, Martínez had used an excessively defensive 5-3-2 formation. “Mexico were tactically better,” De Bruyne said. “As long as there is no good tactical system we face difficulties. It’s a pity we have not yet found a solution. We are playing a very defensive system, but our team is filled with many attacking players.” “We don’t normally play 5-3-2,” Martínez explains, “but we want to be flexible. The system we used most was 3-4-3 as it helps the front players we have with Kevin, Eden Hazard, Dries Mertens and Romelu Lukaku. It was good in qualifying but we tried other systems in friendlies. Mexico were fantastic tactically and gave us a really good exercise.” Some coaches might bristle when an outstanding player is openly critical but Martínez turns those misgivings into praise. “Kevin showed how much he cares. The reason for talking was totally honest and healthy. There is a culture here of trying to understand things from a tactical point of view, which I like. I’m not asking every player to give their view in public but Kevin said it in a way of wanting us to improve. He is growing into a big leadership role. “The 3-4-3 system helped Chelsea win the Premier League last year and I used it with Wigan in 2009. But the system is just a starting position. I’m more interested in the way we play and our mentality. At the World Cup we need to show that we are prepared to suffer – and face adversity. This group do not have a previous generation to show them how to win a major tournament. So it’s almost going into the unknown and we need to be very focused.” Portugal are the only other team from Martínez’s first 18 matches to harbour serious World Cup ambitions and they drew 0-0 in Brussels this month. Belgium were more impressive last week when brushing aside Egypt 3-0. But, rather than lamenting a lack of serious opposition, Martínez highlights the distinct character of a 23-man squad in which only one player, Leander Dendoncker from Anderlecht, is based in Belgium. “In this dressing room the players understand what it means to play for the Red Devils,” Martínez says, using a nickname he loves for his team. “It’s different to any other country in Europe because normally you don’t get this situation where 95% of the squad play abroad. When they come back they care about the national team.” Belgium has three official languages and Martínez has yet to master an anthem which features French, Flemish and German. “I’ve realised that more than the anthem, or any specific language, the unity comes from the team. The fact that players are all in other countries shapes an extra responsibility when they become Red Devils.” Do French and Flemish‑speaking Belgians have different mentalities? “You cannot generalise too much but, yes, they are very different personalities. You see it straightaway. That’s why it’s so rich. In Belgium you’ve got many geographical influences. You get on a train and you’re in Holland, France or the UK so fast. So we have players with real awareness who speak two or three languages. It produces special personalities.” Martínez points out that, until he moved to Belgium, he had spent exactly 21 years each in Spain and Britain – having lived almost his entire adult life in the UK as a player and then as a manager for Wigan, Swansea, Motherwell, Walsall, Chester and Everton. Has his unusual past helped him in Belgium? “I think so. I first moved out of my comfort zone at 16 to play for Real Zaragoza. To go from there at 21 to Wigan was like going to the moon. “These different experiences were valuable when later managing a very diverse Premier League dressing room. Diversity is very important in the Belgium dressing room so it feels natural.” Having lived in England for so long, Martínez knows that ‘golden generation’ is a loaded term. Yet it is often applied to a group of Belgian players including De Bruyne, Hazard, Thibaut Courtois, Vincent Kompany, Jan Vertonghen, Mousa Dembélé, Lukaku and Mertens. “When people talk of Belgium’s golden generation it doesn’t bother me. It’s a media term but there’s nothing wrong in highlighting this group’s quality. It’s more important you find a winning mentality from inside the group and they deal with adversity – because you’ll face that in a major tournament.” Martínez will need to overcome any psychological barriers that have affected Belgium in recent tournaments – most recently when Wales knocked them out in the quarter-finals of Euro 2016. The appointment of Thierry Henry as his assistant has helped. Henry was part of a transformative French squad which won the 1998 World Cup and Euro 2000 after decades of disappointment. “When I took the job I wanted to bring in international experience,” Martínez says, acknowledging that the highest level he reached as a player was as a substitute in one La Liga game for Zaragoza. “I know Thierry’s philosophies because you see how he played at Arsenal and Barcelona. We sat down and within two minutes I knew he was perfect for the role.” Belgium play England in their final group game two weeks on Thursday. In an understated way, Gareth Southgate has prepared England more effectively than many of his World Cup predecessors. “Absolutely. Gareth is a thinker. He has a clear vision and he has players he knows really well from his time in the under-21s. He’s created a team that looks as if it will enjoy the World Cup. We worked together on ITV during the Euros in Poland and Ukraine and we got on really well and share a similar outlook.” There will be nerves for both managers when they meet in Kaliningrad but their earlier results against Panama and Tunisia will set the tone. “Panama just kept the United States out of the World Cup so they are national heroes. They’ve got incredible belief and are very competitive. And when you go into a World Cup with a feeling of celebration, you’ve got nothing to lose. Tunisia also have a strong team that has been together for a few years. They like to play but they know how to be solid. It’s a very good mixture and they qualified in style.” Brazil, Germany, Spain and France are ahead of Belgium as World Cup favourites. Martínez grins. “And Argentina. They have Messi. Those five teams won the World Cup in modern times, in the last 22 years. They can look internally and get guidance from the generation that won it. You need that because, psychologically, to overcome the unknown is difficult. You can have good individuals but to reach that level you need to unlock something special.” Criticised heavily in Belgium for excluding Radja Nainggolan, Martínez knows how lucky he is to have exceptional players. “Kevin De Bruyne almost goes against the idea that we have of a playmaker who finds his own tempo and almost delays everything. Kevin’s the opposite. He’s the most dynamic playmaker. He can execute a pass with incredible precision but at a very quick tempo. Eden Hazard is a leader and he would never turn away from getting on the ball. He’s getting to a moment where everything is done with real purpose and quality. Dries Mertens has been brilliant at Napoli in his first season as a No 9. His appreciation of space and his intelligence makes him really efficient.” Martínez managed Lukaku at Everton and the striker complained that they should play more direct football. “That was one comment in a 30-minute interview and you need to understand Romelu is obsessed with becoming the best he can be. That is a winning mentality. He was never disrespectful. So we have these strong personalities. Look at Vincent Kompany. We hope he is fit because his experience is so important and he knows how to face adversity. He’s had to cope with a lot and he keeps bouncing back. He is special.” We talk for another 30 minutes as Martínez remembers the first football shirt he bought as a boy – Carlos ‘Lobo’ Diarte’s No 9 for Zaragoza – and his surreal early years as a Spaniard in Wigan. He also remembers his luck meeting his Scottish wife, Beth, during a brief spell at Motherwell and how, amid an absorption in the football philosophy of Johan Cruyff, he became close to Cruyff’s son. Jordi Cruyff was best man at his wedding on a beautiful day in Wales. Martínez jokes that his young daughter, Luella, might support England, the country of her birth, as we complete a photo session while opera booms out. “That’s Nacer Chadli,” Martínez says of the West Brom midfielder who is in his World Cup squad. “He loves opera.” Martínez is at ease with these contrasts and, despite all those who doubt him, he could inspire Belgium in Russia. “These players carry the inspiration,” he insists. “We have so much diversity in Belgium but the Red Devils will bring everyone together.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"music/2018/jun/17/tim-garland-weather-walker-review-edition","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-17T07:00:08Z","webTitle":"Tim Garland: Weather Walker review – an evocative blend of jazz, classical and folk","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/jun/17/tim-garland-weather-walker-review-edition","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/jun/17/tim-garland-weather-walker-review-edition","fields":{"headline":"Tim Garland: Weather Walker review – an evocative blend of jazz, classical and folk","bodyText":"There’s nothing quite like Tim Garland’s music, with its three strands of jazz, classical and folk woven in ever-changing and surprising patterns. In this case, we have a string orchestra of up to 35 players, some superb jazz soloists, notably Garland himself, and traditional song from north-west England. The music is an evocation of the Lake District in its various seasons and moods. There’s a certain resistance, even now, to the mixing of strings and jazz, but the richness and variety of these 12 pieces should banish such prejudice: bassist Yuri Goloubev soloing to an ethereal background of two violins; the earthy sound of Garland’s tenor saxophone declaiming the haunting melody of The Snows They Melt the Soonest; the boldly expansive playing of both pianists, Jason Rebello and Pablo Held. Everything fits with such perfection, you would never guess that their improvised solos were added to the previously recorded ensemble. Garland makes the point that people nowadays often experience orchestral music first through film soundtracks, which may stimulate the imagination when listening to music like this.

After writing a bestselling memoir, Kitchen Confidential, he moved into television, and used the travelogue format not only to explore global cuisine, but to give cultural clout to marginalized voices. Here are a selection of clips that pay tribute to what he called “the best job in the world”. Slurping noodles with Obama A 2016 episode of Bourdain’s CNN show, Parts Unknown, featured the then president, Barack Obama, on his first trip to Vietnam. The pair memorably sat on plastic stools in a Hanoi cafe, drinking beer and talking about everything from ketchup on hotdogs to Obama’s childhood. Bourdain also taught Obama the art of the noodle slurp. On Friday, Obama paid tribute to Bourdain, tweeting a photo of the occasion. “He taught us about food,” wrote Obama, “but more importantly, about its ability to bring us together. To make us a little less afraid of the unknown. We’ll miss him.” Revealing chefs’ secrets to Oprah Bourdain was well known for revealing the hidden secrets of the restaurant industry: he told people to go to restaurants on Tuesdays to get the freshest food and that old or unwanted cuts of steak were saved for when people ordered their meat well done. In this clip, he reveals to Oprah just how much butter you eat at a good restaurant – to audible gasps from the audience. Eating street food in Queens While Bourdain traveled the world, he also reminded us that you don’t need to go far from home to experience different cultures. In a 2017 episode of Parts Unknown, he took the 7 train to Queens, New York, and spoke to the borough’s many street food vendors. Eating deep-fried haggis in Scotland Bourdain was always a sharp critic of McDonald’s and KFC, but that doesn’t mean he didn’t enjoy delicious, unhealthy fast food. On a trip to Scotland he delighted in a menu of fish and chips and deep-fried haggis with thick curry sauce. Reflecting on the opioid epidemic Bourdain often used food as a way into bigger issues. His episode on Massachusetts hit all the normal beats (lobster, oysters, drinking) but also spoke tenderly and personally about the opioid crisis savaging the state and Bourdain’s own heroin use while working in Boston. First trip to Waffle House If you’ve never seen Bourdain visiting Waffle House for the first time, then you have never seen fine dining the way it is meant to be done. The southern chef Sean Brock shows him how to turn the southern fast-food institution’s offering into a tasting menu and Bourdain, initially suspicious, goes gooey over a burger patty and cheese between two slices of white bread. Visiting Gordon Ramsay’s restaurant In a clip from one of Bourdain’s early shows on the Food Network, he enjoys the food and foul mouth of a youngish Gordon Ramsay. Just before Ramsay serves Bourdain his third course, a shin of beef with grated truffle and seared foie gras, he says to camera: “That should stuff him, but knowing him, he eats like a fucking horse, so I know he’ll find room somewhere.” Eating maqloubeh in the Gaza Strip In 2014, the Muslim Public Affairs Council gave a “voices of courage and conscience” in media award to Bourdain for an episode of Parts Unknown in which he visited Palestine. Bourdain replied by saying: “It’s a measure, I guess, of how twisted and shallow our depiction of a people is that these images come as a shock to so many. The world has visited many terrible things on the Palestinian people, none more shameful than robbing them of their basic humanity. People are not statistics. That is all we attempted to show. A small, pathetically small, step towards understanding.” Here he is in the Gaza Strip, eating with a family and reminding the world that Palestinians are not just statistics."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"sport/2018/jun/08/eddie-jones-history-south-africa-england-test-series","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-08T16:51:45Z","webTitle":"Eddie Jones relishes writing next chapter in his history with South Africa | Gerard Meagher","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/jun/08/eddie-jones-history-south-africa-england-test-series","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/jun/08/eddie-jones-history-south-africa-england-test-series","fields":{"headline":"Eddie Jones relishes next chapter in his history with South Africa","bodyText":"Alun Wyn Jones’s dry wit aside, Eddie Jones is rarely described as avuncular. Uncles are not known for feuding with Premiership club owners nor belittling neighbouring countries but a return to South Africa shines a different light on England’s head coach. Jones and South Africa have history. He recently said he “understands the South African rugby psyche as well as any”, having been on their coaching staff for the 2007 World Cup triumph and masterminded what was described by the Die Rapport newspaper as the “darkest day in Springbok history” in 2015. A few months later he took charge of the Stormers but left after less than two weeks to take the England job. Suffice to say his relationship with the rainbow nation is colourful. Jones’s contributions to the 2007 World Cup-winning Springboks cannot be overstated, however. The former South Africa head coach, Nick Mallett described Jones’s role in the camp as “Uncle Wallaby” – a calming presence and a sharp technical mind to improve their attack – and the players hold him in even higher esteem. The day after the final the Springboks refused to wear their famous green and gold blazers to the World Rugby awards dinner because Jones – not being South African – was not allowed to do so. Bryan Habana went as far as to send Jones his own blazer a few weeks later. “We saw the Eddie who wasn’t really under the spotlight like he is at the moment,” Habana recalls. “We were fortunate in that regard. We had the fun-loving, very technical Eddie Jones who played a crucial part in fine-tuning our specific structure for 2007. As players who were involved with him for that three- to four-month period we fully understand his value and for that we have a lot of respect for him. “From the general public point of view I don’t think South Africans understand how much of an impact Eddie really had. Not a lot of people were aware of exactly what he did compared to the other coaches. A lot of us as players were fully aware of his strengths and conjured up a relationship because of Eddie.” If his role 11 years ago did not leave an imprint on the South African public, Japan’s victory in 2015 certainly did. Jean de Villiers, the former captain who started for South Africa in Brighton, admits: “It felt like a defeat to Eddie Jones’s Japan.” Schalk Burger, another on the losing side that day, pointedly remarks: “Eddie Jones has been holding his camps in Brighton ever since.” Jones does not outwardly seek adulation and, considering they could finish the weekend fifth in the world rankings, arresting England’s slump is dominating his thoughts at present. But there is no doubting South Africa is no ordinary away trip for Jones and Saturday’s series opener is a contest he is relishing. “I am so excited about it. In world rugby who do you want to beat? The Springboks at Ellis Park; it is the spiritual home of rugby.” De Villiers – like Habana part of the 2007 squad but injured early in the campaign – is another who holds Jones in “very high regard”. But as a Cape Town native he recalls obvious disappointment over Jones’s abrupt departure from the Stormers. Albeit with tongue firmly in cheek, he even suggests there may be some unfavourable local coverage in the build-up to the third Test at Newlands. “Once you’ve committed to one thing, do you then go for the better offer? It was always going to be a tough one for Eddie to say no to,” he says. “With the pound calling rather than the rand, a national side with everything at your disposal versus a Super Rugby franchise in a building stage … It was going to be a battle that the Stormers would lose.” Habana agrees. “I think a lot of people were disappointed he didn’t go on with the Stormers but we in the game understood the opportunity that had presented itself.” Jones’s reasons for taking the Stormers job are perhaps more revealing, then, than those for leaving. “I wanted to prove that an Australian could coach in South Africa,” he has since said, and that may explain the obvious appeal that coaching the 2021 British &amp; Irish Lions holds. Firstly, however, he must negotiate the Highveld at Ellis Park before moving on to Bloemfontein and then to Cape Town for a potentially decisive third Test. It was there that, eight days before he was appointed by England, upon his unveiling as head coach of the Stormers, he said: “I woke up this morning and looked at Table Mountain … I’m very happy to be here.” It remains to be seen if that still rings true when he catches his next glimpse.

Posing concerns in terms of economic stability, public health and safety, the abandoned homes that line many of the city’s streets are at once symbols of its resilience and ongoing obstacles to growth and prosperity. Cleveland native Christopher Maurer, founder and principal architect at local humanitarian design firm Redhouse Studio and adjunct professor at Kent State University, has plenty of ideas about how to address the city’s complex challenges. Inspired by the work of inventor Philip Ross and his company MycoWorks, Maurer argues that one of the keys to addressing Cleveland’s housing crisis lies in an unlikely source: mushrooms. Specifically, in using mycelium – the vegetative part of a fungus – and Cleveland’s other “natural” resource, construction waste, in a process called “biocycling”, which essentially recycles old buildings into new ones using plant materials. “I like to refer to Cleveland as ‘ground zero’ for biocycling,” says Maurer, who believes the city has the perfect conditions and challenges to serve as a prototype for the process. Widespread demolition is often touted as a means of solving many of Cleveland’s ills, including violent crime rates. In 2017, in response to the discovery of the body of a 14-year-old girl, Alianna DeFreeze, in a vacant home in Cuyahoga County after she was abducted on her way to school, the mayor, Frank Jackson, unveiled a demolition programme as part of his Healthy Neighborhoods initiative. The city allocated $5m last year for the demolition of 500 vacant homes –primarily on Cleveland’s east side – within 500ft of public schools. But many critics say demolition isn’t enough and doesn’t get to the root of Cleveland’s complex housing challenges, particularly poverty and racial inequality. Around 36.5% of the Cleveland population live in poverty, and there was a 24% increase in family homelessness from 2015 to 2017, leading to a troubling irony: despite empty homes everywhere, thousands of Clevelanders are homeless. Given the complex obstacles Cleveland faces in the housing market, using mushrooms to rebuild may seem strange, but it’s actually part of a growing trend called mycotecture, or architecture using mushrooms and fungi. “Demolition waste is one of Cleveland’s raw materials,” Maurer says, “and the philosophy of biocycling is about doing something with what we already have rather than generating even more waste.” About 9,000 homes have been demolished in Cleveland in the last 12 years, and building with mycelium-based materials and other living organisms, he says, could serve as a viable way to make good use of the aftermath. Biocycling combines construction waste and debris with “biobinders” (natural glue or cement) like fungi, plant materials and microbes to create new building materials. In practice this means that onsite construction waste such as wood and insulation is ground up into a pulp and mixed with plant materials, which are allowed to grow in place. The resulting “bioterials” are then pressed and treated to make suitable bricks and insulation. “The ultimate goal,” says Maurer, “is to reduce the embodied carbon footprint, to be able to make new buildings entirely out of old ones.” Redhouse Studio is working on a project in Cleveland’s bustling Ohio City neighbourhood that will serve as a prototype of biocycling and showcase the possibilities of sustainable architecture. Maurer and his team are currently renovating a three-storey 19th-century building on West 25th Street to create a boutique hotel. The debris from the hotel will then be “recycled” onsite and combined with organic materials like mycelium to construct the building blocks for a shed at a nearby urban farm. The process of biocycling avoids the high financial and environmental costs often associated with construction. In the US alone, over 500 million tons of construction waste go to landfills each year. Meanwhile, buildings are responsible for nearly 40% of carbon emissions in the country. Biocycling, Maurer says, could reduce the embodied carbon footprint of a construction project, helping to address the changes wrought by global warming even as it cuts costs. Moreover, Maurer says, mushrooms can be used as a tool in mycoremediation, the use of fungi to degrade and sequester pollutants. Mycologists use mycoremediation to clean up waste sites and contaminated waterways. Because mushrooms can absorb contaminants and toxins such as lead , runs the argument, they’re ideal for converting construction waste to useful building materials. Mycoremediation is particularly relevant for cities like Cleveland, where children are exposed to lead at around four times the national average and the city’s air quality is ninth worst in the nation, according to a report from the American Lung Association. The detoxifying properties of mushrooms are also one of the reasons that biocycling “could be especially useful in disaster areas or crisis situations”, says Maurer, and could be used to build sustainable bioshelters for populations displaced by natural disasters – a crucial intervention given that in the US, climate-related disasters killed at least 362 people and cost $306bn in 2017. Maurer and his team believe the benefits of biocycling in Cleveland could serve as a model for other cities, depending on the climate, the organic materials on hand, and specific local needs. Still, the effort to make biocycling a scaleable and profitable venture is a daunting one. Some of the barriers to overcome along the way include potential pushback from material manufacturers, as well as scepticism and a possible lack of acceptance in the building industry and from the public. Proving that biocycling is both safe and sustainable – and thus bringing buildings built with these new materials up to code – will take time, funding, education and long-term testing. And, adds Maurer, when it comes to biocycling, his team are asking a lot: namely, a paradigm shift in how people view construction materials. “This work is hard,” admits Maurer. “We’re asking our collaborators to be farmers, architects, engineers, and biologists, and we’re asking microorganisms to help us build. It’s difficult to get the organisms to grow the way you want. They don’t always do what they’re told.” Even so, he’s confident that with more time and practice, “we will continue to develop symbiosis with our little friends” in order to find more innovative ways to build sustainably. Indeed, mycelium could soon be used to build sustainable technology, which Redhouse is currently discussing with MIT and the University of Akron, and even structures on the moon, about which Maurer says he’s currently in conversation with Nasa. “So – Cleveland, then the moon,” Maurer laughs. “But first, we’re focusing on Cleveland.” Follow Guardian Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, and explore our archive here"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/jun/08/sloane-stephens-simona-halep-french-open-final","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-08T16:36:32Z","webTitle":"Sloane Stephens happy to avoid talk of pressure before French Open final","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/jun/08/sloane-stephens-simona-halep-french-open-final","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/jun/08/sloane-stephens-simona-halep-french-open-final","fields":{"headline":"Sloane Stephens happy to avoid talk of pressure before French Open final","bodyText":"When young athletes on the rise get close to a big moment they can turn into robots, as if erecting an invisible wall to avert all unwanted distractions that might disrupt their carefully assembled programme. Sloane Stephens, affable and interesting all fortnight, tried to pull the shutters down, ever so politely, on Friday as she contemplated the challenge of beating the world No 1, Simona Halep, in the French Open final on Saturday. But she allowed some light in. Once one of the angry young brigade on the Tour, cavilling at the smallest perceived slight in misinterpretation, the 25-year-old American has been a singular beam of contentment – although she did say she would be happy if no one wrote a single word about her. “I just try to go day to day, take it moment by moment,” she said. “I try not to put too much pressure on myself. That’s the easiest way to compete, when you’re not thinking about too many things. If you’re struggling with things and you’re not happy, it makes it a lot more difficult to have good results or success.” Since returning last year from 11 months out with injury, Stephens has blossomed, winning her first major title in New York against her good friend Madison Keys, whom she also beat in the semi-finals here. “Yeah, I’ve had some great results. A lot of hard work went into it, a lot of adversity, a lot of ups and downs. A lot of emotional stuff: am I ever going to be the same, am I ever going to play good again at a high enough level, am I a protected ranking? There were so many things that went into it. “Now I’ve matured a little bit and have recognised the opportunities when they have been presented. The most important thing is that I have taken those opportunities and done a lot with them. “When you have confidence, you can do anything. When you’re calm and relaxed and you don’t panic and you stay steady, you allow yourself to work through obstacles and adversity – or anything that might happen on the court that you were not prepared for.” It is the fear of the unexpected that keeps Stephens – and all athletes – wary of intrusion. So, while guarded about analysing her opponent’s tennis, she did say: “She’s a great player. She’s No 1 in the world for a reason.” If anything, Halep is more complex than Stephens. Her courtside contretemps with her Australian coach, Darren Cahill, are becoming set pieces of legend on the WTA Tour, although she, too, has been relatively cool here. Reaching the final has secured her No 1 ranking and she brings the experience of two previous finals here – losing to Maria Sharapova in 2014 and Jelena Ostapenko last year – and one in Melbourne, where she lost to Caroline Wozniacki. She has had some crazy ups and downs for a good player, dropping first sets here to Alison Riske and Angelique Kerber, but finding a rhythm again in the semi‑finals against Garbiñe Muguruza. “It’s my favourite grand slam,” she said. “I feel like home here.” She did not offer a lot else, except to say she is hoping for a fine day and a nice crowd, but she did concede she is happier now than she once might have appeared. The nerves might not jangle so loudly or the head drop so quickly as it used to. “I’m a little bit different now because I have more experience,” she said. “I’m more relaxed about this situation. I expect to give everything I have and to try to play my best tennis. “It’s nice that in 12 months I have played one more final in Melbourne. I feel good. I feel great in this position. Hopefully tomorrow I will be better than previous ones.” So, a happy, smiling final: that would be a fitting conclusion to what has been a pretty good tournament. And Halep might just wear the bigger smile at the end."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"politics/2018/jun/10/jeremy-thorpe-scandal-labour-cover-up-peter-hain","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-10T05:00:45Z","webTitle":"Labour politicians ‘covered up Thorpe affair for 15 years’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jun/10/jeremy-thorpe-scandal-labour-cover-up-peter-hain","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/jun/10/jeremy-thorpe-scandal-labour-cover-up-peter-hain","fields":{"headline":"Labour politicians ‘covered up Thorpe affair for 15 years’","bodyText":"Senior Labour politicians knew about Liberal leader Jeremy Thorpe’s relationship with Norman Scott for a decade and a half before it became public in the mid-1970s, but orchestrated a cover-up amid fear that it would be exploited by foreign intelligence agencies, according to a newly unearthed memo. The revelation will reignite speculation about the extent to which the establishment sought to protect Thorpe, even during his trial for conspiracy to have Scott murdered, which was dramatised in the BBC’s A Very English Scandal, starring Hugh Grant. Peter Hain, then a well-connected Labour activist, now Lord Hain of Neath, wrote a private memo in July 1978 – shortly before Thorpe was charged – that was copied to several senior Labour politicians, including Tony Benn and Neil Kinnock. Suggesting, correctly, that Thorpe was about to be charged, Hain told his Labour colleagues that he had seen evidence that there was “indeed” a plot to murder Scott “and that its principal instigator was Jeremy Thorpe, working through his close friend David Holmes (the best man at Thorpe’s first wedding).” At the time Hain wrote the memo, the Liberal party had agreed to a pact to prop up the Labour government, and there were concerns that a Thorpe trial could damage both parties, to the benefit of the Tories. Hain warned: “The Labour party and its leadership ought to consider this all very quickly but there must be no pressure for a further cover-up on electorally expedient grounds.” The memo, marked private and held in the National Archives, explained: “There is also clear evidence that leading politicians over the past 15 years, together with civil servants, the police and the security services, have been party to a cover-up surrounding the affair. Most of the politicians involved are Labour.” Last week, the Observer reported that Scott believed there continued to be a widespread cover-up of his relationship with Thorpe and the apparent plot to murder him. Hain’s memo stated: “It is likely that a number of leading Labour politicians – eg Harold Wilson, Barbara Castle, Alice Bacon etc will need to be interviewed by the police in order to fill in the political background to the cover-up, even if they may have no direct role in it.” The memo eventually made its way to the prime minister, Jim Callaghan, who asked his officials to look into allegations that members of the Wilson government had examined Scott’s social security file for evidence to corroborate his claims that he had been in a relationship with Thorpe, including one that the MP had paid his national insurance contributions. Wilson feared that South Africa’s Bureau of State Security, known as Boss, had collected information about his friend Thorpe, a critic of apartheid, that could be used to blackmail him or ruin his career. “I think Wilson was genuinely trying to help Thorpe,” Hain told the Observer. A journalist, Gordon Winter, who worked for Boss, had interviewed Scott and had enough material to destroy Thorpe. He eventually published a lengthy account of Scott’s relationship with Thorpe, albeit after the scandal broke. Hain, a prominent opponent of apartheid, had concerns about Boss that were later justified when, in 1987, former MI5 officer Peter Wright confirmed in his book Spycatcher, that there had been a plot by the South African security services to disrupt the UK’s Liberal and Labour parties – both trenchant critics of apartheid. “The South African security services worried that there would be a Lib-Lab pact and wanted to undermine that prospect,” Hain said. “The fact that it [the pact] happened showed their fear was a real one.” But Hain’s memo concluded that attempts by the Labour left to continue covering for Thorpe could not continue, given “what is in effect not just a criminal but a political conspiracy”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2018/jun/10/dementia-campaign-carers-welcome-nhs-wards-johns-campaign","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-10T07:00:48Z","webTitle":"Four years after my father died, we’ve reached a milestone in dementia care","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jun/10/dementia-campaign-carers-welcome-nhs-wards-johns-campaign","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/jun/10/dementia-campaign-carers-welcome-nhs-wards-johns-campaign","fields":{"headline":"Four years after my father died, we’ve reached a milestone in dementia care","bodyText":"Not long ago, I met an old woman whom I can’t get out of my mind. She was wandering a residential street asking people where her husband was – she needed to find him so he could take her home. But her husband had died many years ago and was buried in a nearby churchyard. Another woman I came across in a nursing home stumbled toward me saying over and over: “Hymns of comfort, hymns of comfort.” I held her arm and said someone would come to help her soon. Her reply was a lament: “No one is coming. No one is coming ever.” No one and never: what must it be like to feel so helpless, so lost and alone? Against these forlorn images I set more hopeful ones: the merry birthday tea party in a hospital dementia ward, say, where patients, carers and nurses sang Happy Birthday around a treacle tart. Or the boy walking with his grandfather in the dementia garden of a provincial hospital. Or the middle-aged daughter sitting by her mother’s bed in a ward, softly singing to her as she fell asleep; perhaps they were songs the old woman had heard as a child. Dementia – the disease of our century, the sniper in everyone’s garden now – makes us ask what it is to be human, and what we owe each other. Dementia is pitiless, but people are not. John’s Campaign, which fights for more compassionate care for those who live with the illness, is rooted in a belief in our collective responsibility and essential kindness. It began with an individual ending, as an act of grief and mourning, when my old father died. It bears his name, and his particular story – which is also the story of thousands of men and women up and down the country – was its catalyst. He had a long and good life, but he did not have a good ending. In his last nine months, he was alive but not exactly living, rather existing in a strange, twilit world, like a ghost. My mother was bereaved before she became a widow – and then she was bereaved all over again. Mourning the living is a hard kind of sorrow. I’ve written about my father’s death in this paper before: how he lived for many years with dementia, but contentedly, at home, kept safe in the circle of family and friends. How he went into hospital for leg ulcers, stayed too long in a ward full of people with dementia where hard-pressed nurses could not possibly give him the attention he needed, where visiting hours were restricted and an outbreak of norovirus meant he went for days on end with no one allowed to visit. How in that month, immobile, malnourished, dehydrated and often alone, he lost all capacity – lost his bearings, his connection with the world, became untethered and slid away from us, out of the harbour and into the wild open sea. How he came home (but never really came home, never fed the birds again or walked by the river) and spent the next nine months dying, and there was not a thing to be done except watch over him as he slowly left us, because it was too late. We were too late. A few weeks after my father was released from dying into death, my friend and the co-founder of John’s Campaign, Julia Jones, asked me why on earth hospitals ever restricted access to carers. Carers are not visitors. They are the voice, the memory, the familiar face, the home that follows a person with dementia should they have to leave home. Julia’s question startled and shamed me: it was so obvious but had never occurred to me. There are rules, and largely we obey them, a culture, and largely we don’t notice or challenge it, but live inside its invisible walls. Of course carers of those with dementia should have the right to accompany those they love into hospitals or any other institutions. A growing body of evidence demonstrates how beneficial the presence of carers can be in hospital: fewer falls, less malnutrition and dehydration, shorter stays – above all, less catastrophic cognitive impairment. But even without this, it’s a matter of common sense, of compassion, of human decency. And so, three and a half years ago, in this paper, a campaign was born, and the Observer’s generous and steadfast support has been vital to its success. We started from zero: no track to follow, no knowledge of how to run a campaign, no real sense of how the NHS works or how to negotiate its labyrinthine bureaucracy, no idea of who to contact or how, no time to do it in anyway, no budget, no clue. We knew the problem: hospitals and similar institutions are very dangerous for people who are frail, confused and scared, especially when they are there alone. We had a solution, costing nothing, harming no one, benefiting everyone, clear as water, plain and right: give carers unrestricted access, and welcome them as valued team members. We had the necessary outrage: how can thousands of frail men and women be wrecked in the very places that are trying to heal them? We had hope – though sometimes it got a bit dented, when well-meaning people told us kindly across their sleek desks that it couldn’t be done and we’d burn out within a year. Innocence was our secret weapon: if we had known more, we probably wouldn’t have started out on this journey to push open closed doors and, in so doing, help change the culture of the NHS. Hospitals are traditionally places of cure, but many people in hospital today cannot be cured. They need to be cared for. People who have dementia and frailty must be treated as precious beings, not just objects in a bed. In the end, we are all vulnerable and at the mercy of each other; we have to help those in need, and be helped in our turn. At first, Julia and I thought that because what we wanted was so simple, it would be simple to bring it about: a law could be passed, an edict issued. Someone very senior (Jeremy Hunt, where were you?) could say “let this be done” and hey presto. There were moments when we felt we’d found the magic key: when I went on The Andrew Marr Show alongside David Cameron, then PM all those light years ago, and he supported our aims; when NHS England officially endorsed the campaign; when Norman Lamb (then minister of state for care and support) and Professor Alistair Burns (then and still NHS England’s national clinical director for dementia and older people’s mental health) co-wrote a letter to every acute hospital’s chief executive urging them to implement the principles of the campaign; when the MP Valerie Vaz tabled an early day motion in parliament; when Andy Burnham promised to implement the campaign when he became health minister; when one by one all the medical bodies supported us; when Sir Mike Richards, chief inspector of the Care Quality Commission, supported us; Professor Jane Cummings, the chief nursing officer of England, gave us her generous help; when senior men and women in leading charities reached out to us… . In the end, these commitments weren’t actually magic keys, but they all helped build our rickety raft into a solid vessel. For change to become embedded in the culture, it had to happen at grassroots level. The success of our campaign has come about because of overwhelming voluntary support from the carers, the nurses, the organisers, the doctors, the people who worked for charities, the doers and the thinkers – and from those who live with dementia. A great army of good, kind, generous, tireless people, led by those individual nurses who became passionate advocates for the campaign and put it into practice on the frontline, in the hospital wards. We have met many heroes and heard many stories: some of these are of tragedy and loss, but there are also ones of courage, kindness, redemption and hope. Three years ago, the Observer published a list on its website of all the wards and hospitals that had signed up to John’s Campaign, along with their individual pledges. Our single criterion is that carers should be made welcome; after that, hospitals can implement the campaign in whichever way they want: carer’s passports; posters on doors; reclining chairs; rooms set aside should they need to stay the night; welcome in the pre-op room; meals or cups of tea. Reduced or free parking. Leaflets. Maps. Posters. Pets allowed to visit. Countless, imaginative ways of making carers feel recognized and of making vulnerable patients’ lives less scary– ways of making hospitals safer and kinder places to be. At first, the list was rather short. We felt jubilant when it passed the 100 mark, thrilled when it went to 200. Julia tirelessly approached dementia leads and chief nurses, and worked out where the largest gaps were (she would ring me to say things like: “I’m feeling rather cross with the north of England today”). Her son Bertie created and updated our website. Ward by ward, hospital by hospital, the list got longer, the gaps smaller, the geographic inequality a little bit less. More than 1,000 wards, hospitals and other institutions have now pledged their support. Today, as the NHS approaches its 70th birthday and on the eve of Carer’s Week, we can announce that all the NHS acute trusts in England have now made pledges to unrestricted visiting hours for people with dementia. Tomorrow, we will present a book of pledges to Jane Cummings. The victory is inevitably partial – we are talking about England not the UK, acute trusts not all trusts. Within each acute trust there are hospitals and wards that have not yet signed up. The ones that have vary in the quality of implementation. The right we demand is still not universal, and such inequality is unacceptable. But this a real, tangible milestone, and also a demonstration that the culture around care for those with dementia and frailty is changing. Hospitals that do not welcome carers are the exception rather than the rule. I understand that I started out three and a half years ago trying to rescue my stoic, modest, honourable, maverick father, who was beyond all rescue and harm. My way of mourning (or perhaps of holding mourning at bay) was to do something, rather than simply to endure the natural buffets of grief, and let the great old world turn and time carry me through. I needed to atone. But John’s Campaign very quickly shook itself free of my personal guilt and sadness and took on a grand momentum. It has a life of its own now, beyond Julia and me, because it belongs to everyone who supports and believes in it. It’s about recognizing the unquantifiable value of carers, about giving dignity and respect to people who are vulnerable, about helping people have good endings. It’s about how we live, how we die, and how we help each other on this journey."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/jun/09/g7-summit-canada-remote-locations","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-09T06:30:15Z","webTitle":"'One way in, one way out': why G7 summits are in such remote locations","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/09/g7-summit-canada-remote-locations","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/09/g7-summit-canada-remote-locations","fields":{"headline":"'One way in, one way out': why G7 summits are in such remote locations","bodyText":"Until the leaders of the seven most economically advanced nations in the world descended on it, the Charlevoix region of Quebec was perhaps best known for the beauty of its landscapes and the opulence of its state-run casino in La Malbaie. It is also a remote tourist destination, reached by way of an often perilous one-lane highway, and has a population density lower than the (already sparse) national average. This is no coincidence. Though it poses certain logistical issues, Charlevoix’s isolation is perhaps its greatest asset when it comes to staging a meeting of these world leaders. In an era where mass protests of such things are a given, Charlevoix offers a key security feature: it is difficult for protesters to get there, harder still to circulate and near impossible to escape the eye of law enforcement. “One way in, one way out,” says Alan Bell, president of the Toronto-based security consulting firm Global Risk International. “If you go back to some recent G7 and G20 meetings, the downtown core always gets trashed. What they want to do is zero in on the protesters. If they want to come, they basically have to walk in.” The practice of holding such huge and consequential meetings in hard-to-reach places is relatively new. The first G6 summit was held in 1975 in the Parisian exurb of Rambouillet. The meeting was a low-key affair that dealt almost exclusively in global economic matters. Protests were non-existent; the only delay, it seems, was a result of the Soviet general secretary Leonid Brezhnev’s perpetual exhaustion, according to news clippings of the day. Canada, which joined the group in 1976, held subsequent G7 meetings in Ottawa (in 1981) Toronto (in 1988) and Halifax in 1995. (Russia was admitted in 1998.) Everything changed with the teargas-drenched spectacle known as “the Battle of Seattle”. In 1999, 60,000 protesters demonstrated at the meeting of the World Trade Organization, fomenting what has become an enduring anti-globalization movement. This large and diffuse group of trade unionists, NGOs, workers and black bloc members managed to disrupt the proceedings. The ensuing damage, and the images of police phalanxes doing battle with mostly unarmed protesters, were a headache for the city, law enforcement and world leaders alike. “World leaders were taken off guard. A lot of planning and organization went into the protests, and it all aligned in Seattle,” says Barry Eidlin, an assistant professor of sociology at McGill University in Montreal. “The retreat from the city is itself a response to these mass mobilization tactics.” The G8 meetings held in Canada since Seattle have taken place in Kananaskis, Alberta, and Muskoka, Ontario – like Charlevoix, remote locations to which access can be tightly controlled. In Charlevoix, a designated red zone restricts entrance to residents and summit participants, with a larger fenced-in “green zone” surrounding it, accessible only to those with accreditation. Beyond this is the white zone, the notable home to the summit’s so-called “free speech zone” where protesters can vent – 2km from where Donald Trump and his six peers will gather. The summit and associated meetings will cost Canadian taxpayers more than $600m. In 2010, Toronto provided a Canadian cautionary tale to the pitfalls of urban-held trade meetings. That year, police “kettled” more than 1,000 protesters –corralling then holding them outdoors for hours on end during a torrential downpour. It led to the high-profile disciplining of a senior Toronto police officer and an enduring black eye for the force. There probably won’t be a similar event this weekend. Though there have already been limited protests in Quebec City, a massive police presence and the sheer distance to Charlevoix has apparently dulled the outrage. Of course, those who would like to hark back to the old days of protest-free trade meetings can look forward to the 2020 G20 summit in the Saudi capital of Riyadh, where access is all but impossible given foreigners need permission to visit, and free expression is often outlawed completely."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jun/10/sullen-no-more-scots-have-plenty-of-reasons-to-be-cheerful","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-10T05:00:46Z","webTitle":"Sullen no more, Scots have plenty of reasons to be cheerful – unlike the English | Kevin McKenna","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/10/sullen-no-more-scots-have-plenty-of-reasons-to-be-cheerful","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/10/sullen-no-more-scots-have-plenty-of-reasons-to-be-cheerful","fields":{"headline":"Sullen no more, Scots have plenty of reasons to be cheerful – unlike the English","bodyText":"Are Scots born with grievances or do we acquire them on life’s carousel, eternally vigilant for people who might be looking at us the wrong way? Do English people, bred on a diet of chippy and sullen Scots popping up in their television crime dramas and soaps, tremble at the thought of their first visit north of the border? When Hollywood directors seek to portray disdainful wickedness they always reach for a cut-glass English accent. In the UK, they choose from among a familiar troupe of Scots character actors when they wish to convey a sense of bleak unpredictability. Their personal relationships are often chaotic and they drink and swear a lot. There is nothing like a profanity delivered in a Glasgow accent to shift the atmosphere in a scene from benign indifference to malevolent intent. We Clydesiders are both blessed and cursed by our elocution. Our kind will not be featuring in the BBC’s next Jane Austen adaptation. You will not see us in gentle English sitcoms ordering peppermint tea with our alfalfa crepes in an artisan cafe in Shoreditch. But if the script calls for the peace to be shattered by a violent robbery taking place next door and the cornered vagabonds to be forced to take hostages, then there is a good chance the accent underneath the chief balaclava will be pure Possil with a hint of edgy Barmulloch. A messy relationship, followed by a problematic employment history will have propelled him down a desperado’s path. A sense of grievance will have consumed him. I’d be reluctant to condemn this as racist or in any way indicative of wretched stereotyping. Very often, we Scots will use these grim caricatures to our advantage. The brilliant Glaswegian comedian Kevin Bridges has a routine in which a Scot visiting England is bashfully proud of his city’s reputation for breeding hard men and gangsters. Many of us like to trace the perception of Scots as dark and irascible characters to PG Wodehouse’s observation that “it is never difficult to tell between a Scotsman with a grievance and a ray of sunshine”. But it goes much further back than that. The great 18th-century English writer Samuel Johnson gently besmirched us when he said: “The noblest prospect which a Scotchman ever sees is the high road that leads him to England!” A combination of ugly weather and the commonly held perception of old Presbyterianism as a joyless and austere creed controlling all aspects of Scottish culture contributed to the distortion. This gave birth to my all-time favourite Scottish joke: why do the Wee Frees hate having sex standing up? Because it might lead to dancing. Only a few years have elapsed since Gordon Brown was lampooned as a latterday embodiment of the dreich Scotsman labouring under his own personal rain cloud. In my family, a tale has been passed down of a much-loved uncle who travelled to Lisbon in 1967 to watch Celtic become the first British club to lift the mighty European Cup. Amid the euphoria that greeted this, my uncle was heard to say: “Aye, but I still think John Hughes should have been in the team.” In the Lowland Scotland of my childhood, it seemed that every family had an uncle like that, sitting in the corner like Tam o’ Shanter’s wife “nursing her wrath to keep it warm”. A few years ago, I saw the main speaker at an Edinburgh convention for the GlobalScot group of entrepreneurs chide his compatriots for too often failing to look on the bright side of life. He felt that we were gloomy or noncommittal, even when we had cause to celebrate. In answer to:“How are things going?”, too many of us, he felt, were inclined to answer” “Aye, no’ bad”, even when life couldn’t be sweeter. One well-known academic has built a career telling us that we have confidence issues and that sardonic Scottish wit encountered in the playground has bred a nation of emotionally fragile snowflakes destined never to fulfil their potential. It’s all nonsense and fails to grasp that traditional Scottish rectitude and caution are prized assets in the worlds of finance, business and politics. We were never meant to wear baseball caps back to front or do high-fives and fill the pockets of mendicant motivational speakers by loosening our emotions on firewalks at midnight. Thus, there was surprise last week at the results of a UK-wide BBC survey measuring attitudes about identity. It found that more Scots felt the country’s best days were in the future (36%) than in the past (29%). In old Albion, meanwhile, optimism has taken a dip. Almost half the number of respondents said England was better in the past and only 17% expressed hope about the future. This is what happens when a cast of privileged old Etonians channelling Nelson, Wellington and Churchill lead England on a crusade out of Europe, proclaiming isolation, suspicion and fear. In Scotland, we haven’t changed that much. Our essential characteristics, which have always been valued in England and across the world, will remain. It’s not that we refuse to regard a glass as being half full – it’s simply that we will always want to know how it came to be so. Five years ago, as England began to turn in on itself, in Scotland we let the genie out of the bottle during the referendum on independence. Multitudes of people, accustomed to being patronised and dismissed, found their voices and discovered that they were as wise and eloquent as those in the political classes. Everything is up for grabs again and anything is possible. • Kevin McKenna is an Observer columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2018/jun/13/maya-angelou-and-me-adapting-i-know-why-the-caged-bird-sings-radio-4","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-13T12:41:11Z","webTitle":"Maya Angelou and me: adapting her memoirs brought me eye to eye with an icon","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/jun/13/maya-angelou-and-me-adapting-i-know-why-the-caged-bird-sings-radio-4","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2018/jun/13/maya-angelou-and-me-adapting-i-know-why-the-caged-bird-sings-radio-4","fields":{"headline":"Maya Angelou and me: adapting her memoirs brought me eye to eye with an icon","bodyText":"I’ve been adapting novels and plays for radio for well over a decade. And I’ve adapted wonderful work: Beloved, The Darker Face of the Earth, Small Island, The Color Purple. But adapting the work of Maya Angelou for BBC Radio 4 was the first time I dramatised a memoir. I am used to ferreting out the intentions of the writer between the lines of a play and among the events in a novel. With Maya Angelou’s memoirs, she was right there in front of me, looking me in the eye. It is a bold adapter who wouldn’t feel intimidated. It would also be a foolish one who didn’t grab the opportunity to bring her words to the ear. The intimacy of radio meant that having Maya’s words spoken by a narrated version of herself was a given. Without the distraction of visuals, life in the deep south during Jim Crow, the characters hustling on the streets of postwar San Francisco, a teenaged Maya driving over the Mexican border having never driven before, and her life as an expat in Ghana can all be imagined and savoured. But there were decisions to be made about which moments would take to being dramatised, which ones should be reported, and which should not be included in this adaptation. I can’t tell you how difficult it was to make these omissions. Some adaptations involve giving the audience a series of glimpses of the core events in the story and tying them together as best you can. Others are like producing the best line drawing you can achieve from your observations of an oil painting. About halfway through the process of recording the episodes of Maya’s first and most famous volume, I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings it occurred to me that what we were producing this time, in great and careful detail, was a quilt: a stitching together of vivid scraps of the story of her life to create a representation for the audience that we hoped was both complex and subtle. An adaptation is not a purely academic exercise. It can also be a deeply emotional experience. There are huge recognisable commonalities between the historical black American and Caribbean experiences: the transatlantic slave trade and its aftermath, discrimination, racism, learning to exist and thrive in societies where the financial and social structures are biased against progress. These are also societies that created cultures that protected, strengthened and uplifted themselves; that created new musical and dance forms, that blended languages, that invested in passing on a body of rich folk wisdom, that transformed religious worship from obedience to resistance. I was born and raised in the Caribbean. I recognised these aspects of Maya’s story. As a black woman, she spoke directly to me about everything from body consciousness (I, too, am tall and gap-toothed) to the difficulty in negotiating relationships with black men. She pulled no punches in describing the choices she made in her life. Born Marguerite Annie Johnson, she was raised by her grandmother, raped by her mother’s boyfriend, was a teenage mother, worked as a short-order cook, a waitress, a dancer, a brothel madam and a prostitute – all before she was 20. Sensational as all that sounds, there is not a word of self-pity in her memoir. Compassion for her youthful self, perhaps, but never self-pity. Instead, what shines through is her powerful intellect and incredible talent, her ability to observe the world around her and to look inside herself with the same compassionate objectivity. There is also a grand and dangerous idea at the centre of her work. She grants herself what the world around her was unwilling to: equality. It is what Beyoncé does when she performs the Black Power salute at the Super Bowl. It is what Childish Gambino does when he creates a video in which he personifies his country in This Is America. When Stormzy calls the government to account, or David Lammy lambasts the Home Office treatment of the children of the Windrush generation. Angelou is part of the wellspring from which these public figures drank. They have assumed their equality and not waited for it to be granted to them. Quotes from Maya Angelou pop up on my Twitter feed at regular intervals. She is very quotable. The story of how Marguerite Annie Johnson became famous worldwide, forged careers as a memoirist and poet, singer and composer, civil rights activist, lecturer and public speaker, and downright national and international treasure, is well known and gives hope to many from all backgrounds and persuasions. She is inspirational. Her death was mourned worldwide. Her work, though absolutely rooted in place and time, is timeless in its celebration of our common humanity. My job was to find her in the pages of her books, to help put her words into the mouths of some of the UK’s leading actors, and not to look away from the fierceness of her gaze. To instead bring the audience into the celebration of the human spirit in all its complexity and glory that drives and defines the words of Dr Maya Angelou. BBC Radio 4’s Maya Angelou dramas start on Monday 18 June at 10:45am with I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings.

We have a certain way we want to play and, unfortunately, John doesn’t fit into that at the moment. The door is always open for any player to fight their way back in but I haven’t seen anything this season that would make me want to pick him instead of Chris Smalling and Michael Keane. I couldn’t give a shite if Pep Guardiola thinks I’m wrong. You can bang on about him all you want but do you think I would have lost a Champions League semi-final to Roberto Di Matteo? Not bloody likely!” Falls out with Guardiola, Klopp and Pochettino Tired with being asked about the positive effect foreign managers have had on young English players, Allardyce points out he also has a strong track record in youth development. “Ravel Morrison wouldn’t be the man he is today if it wasn’t for my guidance,” he said. “And I’m not taking any more questions on Pep, Jürgen and Mauricio. Do you know who Dele Alli reminds me of? A young Kevin Nolan. And who brought Kevin through at Bolton? Exactly. Pochettino hasn’t done anything special with Dele. He’s just watched old videos of how I taught Kevin to make late runs into the box back in 2001. But the press don’t talk about that.” Hires Brown as his celebrity No 2 Fabio Capello had David Beckham as a talismanic figure on the bench; Allardyce has Phil Brown. The perma-tanned lover of life has already made his presence felt around the camp, announcing himself by delivering a half-time team talk on the Wembley pitch during the 3-0 friendly defeat to Italy in March. “The players appreciated my honest approach,” Brown said. “Joe Hart told me I am a breath of fresh air. Raheem Sterling said it was a bit different to how Pep operates, which I took as a compliment.” But pundits cast doubt over Brown’s methods and Allardyce finds himself under pressure to part with his most trusted ally after it emerges that the former Hull manager has hired Danny Dyer to deliver motivational talks to the squad during the tournament. “I just think Danny will help the players connect with the man on the street,” Brown explained. Builds attack around Carroll More problems develop when Harry Kane retires from international football after being dropped for Andy Carroll. “We needed more physicality,” Allardyce said. “We just need to get the ball to Andy and make sure the midfielders support him properly. If Andros and Theo can supply him with quality service, defences won’t be able to handle us. Then it’s up to Wayne to feed off Andy in the positions of maximum opportunity.” Pundits round on Allardyce, accusing him of dragging England back into the dark ages, but he responds by pointing out that he has a Plan B. “There aren’t many strikers with as strong a record for England as Peter Crouch,” he said. Agrees deal to launch the Allardyce Aggregator Having named a provisional 30-man squad for the World Cup, Allardyce faces accusations that he created needless trouble by agreeing a deal with a notorious betting company to lend his image to a website that allows members of the public to rank each England player. Word of unrest in the squad spreads. Several players pull out with minor knocks and the Allardyce Aggregator (tagline: ‘Help Big Sam Make The Big Calls!’) goes the way of the Capello Index. The mood calms down after a while – until footage emerges of Allardyce criticising FA bigwigs and making off-colour remarks about Harry and Meghan during a lucrative speaking tour in the Far East, sparking a public outcry and a debate in parliament. It is announced that Allardyce will step down after the World Cup. He is immediately linked with a move to Hebei China Fortune on a contract worth at least £10m a year.

Coverage has focused little on the realities of life after Carillion in situations like ours, and the human cost of outsourcing. Our overcrowded school was promised two new classrooms by September 2017. From the beginning, there was a failure on the part of Carillion to engage with the realities of running a school. After false starts and delays, temporary classrooms were delivered in late August, leaving us in chaos at the start of term. The autumn was exhausting as we negotiated holes in the playground, lack of internet, weeks without heating and hot water, and electricity cuts. The site is severely compromised, with the building compound and temporary classrooms taking almost half the play area. We cannot fit all the children outside at one time, so we have staggered breaks and stressful lunchtimes where half the children have to remain in the hall for far too long. Sports provision is also challenging. Since January, there has been no activity on site. The project is still 20% off completion, and although new contractors have been found, the project is so far over budget that the county council seem frozen. It is only when news coverage focuses on such stories that ordinary people will engage with the shocking waste of taxpayers’ money that all this represents.

You make an incontrovertible case for “the decentralising of economic power” and “government spending to take up the slack”. But there are risks, which need to be thought through. The immediate effect of a deficit spending programme will be a fall in sterling and rising import prices. This will be boosted into a “crisis” by Tory commentators pointing to past precedents (in Latin America, as well as 1979 and 2008). The best counter is to set out a fiscal programme to tax wealth – a land value tax, a progressive reform of council tax on higher-value houses, and stronger taxes on companies extracting monopoly profits and share values in IT and elsewhere. Because the rich would pay mainly out of savings, this would still “take up the slack” without deflating consumer demand, productive investment or productivity. Alan Bailey London • Your editorial on Corbynomics says “Today’s Tories seem to be ditching their austerity rhetoric”. But the March Office for Budget Responsibility report shows that the chancellor has no plans to abandon austerity. Quite the opposite. He plans a further fiscal squeeze between now and 2020 equivalent to 1% of GDP, a further £20bn of spending out of the economy in a combination of public spending cuts (including cuts in in-work benefits) and tax rises. The only silver lining is that Philip Hammond’s squeeze will be less severe than the one planned by George Osborne in his last budget in 2016. The overall fiscal squeeze under the Tories since 2010 has taken over £130bn of spending out of the economy in a combination of public spending cuts and tax rises; 80% of that squeeze fell on public spending. Eight years of austerity (and the UK Brexit vote) have brought Britain to the bottom of the growth league among the advanced economies. Peter Hain Labour, House of Lords • It’s welcome to see your leader supporting the Polanyi-inspired ideas on the economy currently being put forward by Corbyn and McDonnell, but as soon as you proffer congratulations, you grudgingly withdraw them by accusing Corbyn of reticence, an absence of creative ideas and timidity. After years of weathering unpleasant and unfair attacks, both personal and political, and the impugning of his integrity across a range of issues, surely Corbyn is to be praised and encouraged for staying in there, consistently principled, despite it all. Why don’t you let him – nay, even encourage him – to keep “his edge”, as you call it, rather than side so often with those who seek to engineer his downfall? Gillian Dalley London • As you note, much of Corbynomics is based on the work of the late Austrian economist Karl Polanyi. Before he died in 1964 he noted that his politics were close to those in the New Reasoner, published 1957-59. The journal was run by two historians, John Saville and EP Thompson, after they quit the Communist party in the wake of the crisis of 1956. Thompson became – and remains 25 years after his death – the foremost theorist of a moral economy. If, as you suggest, the Tories are moving away from austerity economics, perhaps it’s time for those Labour MPs for whom it is an article of faith to acquaint themselves with Thompson’s work. Keith Flett London • It is very encouraging that leading Labour politicians are responsive to contemporary new left thinking. Your editorial usefully draws attention to this important development. However, my concern is not that the Conservatives will attempt to adopt a debased version of Corbynomics; rather, that the application of an expansionary policy which is not related to the political, economic and environmental context in which it will be applied is likely to lead to disaster for a socialist Labour government. The huge scale of the problems bequeathed by over 30 years of Thatcherite neoliberalism – underinvestment, low productivity, widening inequalities of income and wealth, and a shredded social fabric – certainly demands a change of direction, away from the promotion of corporate power and marketisation to a system based on cooperation, equality and decentralised power. But the accumulation of social problems and the demands for remedial action, together with costs of Brexit and the threat of environmental degradation, are likely to swamp a Labour government that is not prepared and result in it being “set up to fail”. Keynes appreciated that there is a limit to deficit spending, even when guaranteed by the authority of the state. It is not a financial conjuring trick but requires careful application, if the result is not to be runaway inflation. Unlike academic economists, Jeremy Corbyn and John McDonnell need to set out very clearly not only their “creative fiscal and monetary ideas” but also the means by which they will be pursued in a precarious global context.

Samantha Bee had apologised on Thursday for an “inappropriate and inexcusable” remarks about Ivanka Trump on Wednesday night. But on Friday the president protested directly for the first time, alluding on Twitter to “double standards” because Bee was still in a job with her TBS TV channel while ABC canceled the Roseanne sitcom revival after eponymous star Roseanne Barr posted a racist tweet about former Obama administration senior aide Valerie Jarrett. “Why aren’t they firing no talent Samantha Bee for the horrible language used on her low ratings show? A total double standard but that’s O.K., we are Winning, and will be doing so for a long time to come!” Trump tweeted. On her TBS show, the late-night host savaged the president’s daughter for her role in her father’s immigration policy – but Bee’s expletive-filled comment drew condemnation, particularly among conservatives, and a rebuke from the White House. In her apology, Bee said: “I would like to sincerely apologize to Ivanka Trump and to my viewers. I crossed a line, and I deeply regret it.” Bee began her show Wednesday by saying: “We are going to talk about racism: I just popped an Ambien, so buckle up, everyone.” Bee showed a news segment about migrant children being taken into government custody at the border, and the Department of Justice’s plan to prosecute 100% of people crossing the border illegally, including asylum seekers and undocumented workers. Bee said: “Tearing children away from their parents is so evil, it’s the inciting incident in almost every movie we’ve ever cared about. According to haunted marionette Jeff Sessions, these babies are actually baby criminals.” In a clip Bee played, Sessions, the attorney general, said: “If you don’t want your child to be separated, then don’t bring them across the border illegally. It’s not our fault.” Bee continued: “Don’t worry. The Trump administration has a really good explanation for why they’re treating migrants like animals. It was all Obama’s idea!” She then showed pundits claiming that it was the Obama administration that instituted the policy of separating migrant children from their parents. Bee replied: “They’re half right. We have had awful immigration practices since, well, always, even under presidents we like seeing shirtless. A recent report from the ACLU describes hundreds of abuses of migrant children while in custody of the US government during the Obama administration. And just last week, this image circulated of children being kept in an Arizona holding facility in 2014.” Bee said: “No, Donald Trump didn’t invent this issue – he’s just making it so much worse. Now everyone who even approaches the border is treated like a criminal. She continued: “So now, after decades of ignoring the issue, Americans are finally paying attention. Well, most of us. Ivanka Trump, who works at the White House, chose to post the second most oblivious tweet we’ve seen this week.” Bee, showing a photo Trump posted of her and her son, addressed the president’s daughter directly: “You know, Ivanka, that’s a beautiful photo of you and your child, but let me just say, one mother to another, do something about your dad’s immigration practices, you feckless cunt.” Bee added: “He listens to you. Put on something tight and low-cut and tell your father to fucking stop it.” On Thursday morning, many conservative media figures denounced her language and asked that the host be held to the same standard as Roseanne Barr, whose sitcom was canceled by ABC after a racist tweet that compared Valerie Jarrett to an ape. “The language used by Samantha Bee last night is vile and vicious,” said White House press secretary Sarah Sanders in a statement. “The collective silence by the left and its media allies is appalling.” Sanders added: “Her disgusting comments and show are not fit for broadcast, and executives at Time Warner and TBS must demonstrate that such explicit profanity about female members of this administration will not be condoned on its network.” NBC’s Megyn Kelly, once a primetime anchor at Fox News, compared Bee’s comments to Barr’s. “This is disgusting. How is this acceptable?” Kelly tweeted. “And how are we expected to take any of these publications seriously if they gleefully repost something like this at the same time they (rightfully) condemn Roseanne? You know the saying Love is Love? Well Hate is Hate.” Early Thursday afternoon Bee, 48, in a statement issued by TBS, which airs Full Frontal, said: “I would like to sincerely apologize to Ivanka Trump and to my viewers for using an expletive on my show to describe her last night. It was inappropriate and inexcusable. I crossed a line, and I deeply regret it.” TBS issued its own statement. “Samantha Bee has taken the right action in apologizing for the vile and inappropriate language she used about Ivanka Trump last night,” the network said. “Those words should not have been aired. It was our mistake too, and we regret it.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/may/31/chelsea-shelve-stamford-bridge-investment-climate","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-31T14:55:00Z","webTitle":"Roman Abramovich shelves £1bn Chelsea stadium after visa delays","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/may/31/chelsea-shelve-stamford-bridge-investment-climate","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/may/31/chelsea-shelve-stamford-bridge-investment-climate","fields":{"headline":"Roman Abramovich shelves £1bn Chelsea stadium after visa delays","bodyText":"Roman Abramovich has put a £1bn scheme to redevelop Chelsea’s Stamford Bridge stadium on hold in response to suffering delays in the renewal of his visa to enter the United Kingdom. The club confirmed that plans to transform their home of 113 years into a 60,000-seat arena had been mothballed. A 49-word statement published on their website on Thursday pointed to the “current unfavourable investment climate” as a key factor in their reasoning, yet the Home Office’s delay in renewing Abramovich’s visa, which had expired, is understood to have prompted the owner’s decision to shelve the scheme. Abramovich is apparently reluctant to invest heavily in a major project in the capital of a country where he has been denied a visa. The oligarch, who has been a regular visitor to Britain since buying Chelsea in 2003 but does not hold an employment position at the club, was unable to attend his team’s victory in the FA Cup final at Wembley this month with the process unresolved, and has since secured Israeli citizenship. An Israeli government spokesperson confirmed this week that the 51-year-old was to move to Tel Aviv. Although he would be able to visit the UK visa-free for up to six months at a time on his Israeli passport, Downing Street has confirmed he would not be permitted to work in this country. The Jerusalem Post reported on Thursday that the billionaire had withdrawn his request for a British investor visa, quoting a source close to Abramovich as saying: “He understands and respects that the UK are reviewing their processes and has therefore chosen to withdraw until a new process is in place.” Once a new policy was in place, the source added, Abramovich would “want to clarify any misunderstanding and speculations. He has spent many years in the UK and is a legitimate businessman, nothing has changed.” The issue has flared at a time of heightened tensions between Britain and Russia since the poisoning of the former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia in Salisbury in March. Britain has blamed that act on Russia, though the Kremlin denies involvement. Abramovich’s previous tier one visa, which allows anyone who invests more than £2m in the British economy to stay for 40 months, had been granted before tighter regulations were introduced in April 2015. The government has since launched a further crackdown on wealthy investors coming to the UK and, it is believed, would have required some financial disclosures if Abramovich’s UK visa were to be renewed. Chelsea, who finished outside the lucrative Champions League qualification places last season, insist Abramovich remains as committed to the club as ever, and will continue to invest funds for transfers. However, the desire to redevelop Stamford Bridge had been motivated primarily by the prospect of increased match-day revenues, which would allow the Premier League side to be more competitive in the transfer market while complying with Uefa’s Financial Fair Play regulations. The ground’s 41,631 capacity leaves them in the smallest stadium of the current top six given Tottenham Hotspur will return to a redeveloped White Hart Lane next season. In that regard, the decision to put plans on hold would appear to damage the club’s long-term ability to compete financially with the Premier League’s elite. Chelsea had previously explored purchasing the Battersea Power station site and land around Earl’s Court, before opting to transform Stamford Bridge into what the architects, Herzog and de Meuron, described as a “cathedral of football”. Planning approval was received from Hammersmith and Fulham council last year, with the mayor of London Sadiq Khan also giving the green light, and Chelsea had hoped to move to Wembley for up to four years while work was carried out. Costs for the ambitious scheme had escalated wildly, doubling to around £1bn largely because of the time allocated to the build and its complexity. Chelsea had started the process of sounding out banks and blue-chip companies over commercial deals and to seek a potential naming-rights partner, though they would have leant heavily upon Abramovich to fund the project. “Chelsea has put its new stadium project on hold,” the club said. “No further pre-construction design and planning work will occur. The club does not have a time frame set for reconsideration of its decision. The decision was made due to the current unfavourable investment climate.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"money/2018/jun/08/car-repair-stolen-from-workshop-dealer-liable-insurance-claim","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-08T06:00:04Z","webTitle":"Who is to blame if a car sent in for repairs is stolen?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2018/jun/08/car-repair-stolen-from-workshop-dealer-liable-insurance-claim","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2018/jun/08/car-repair-stolen-from-workshop-dealer-liable-insurance-claim","fields":{"headline":"Who is to blame if a car sent in for repairs is stolen?","bodyText":"Two months after I took possession of a £40,000 factory-ordered VW Golf R, I was involved in an accident that was not my fault. It was taken for repair by the dealership I bought it from, Inchcape in Macclesfield, and was subsequently stolen, along with two other cars, from its workshop. Inchcape has refused to accept liability and advised me to claim through my insurer, thus incurring an excess and affecting my premiums and no-claims discount. It provided me with a loan car after the accident, but was quick to demand it back the day my car was stolen “as it was no longer being repaired”! DS, Knutsford Most garages display disclaimers stating that owners leave their vehicles at their own risk and they are only liable for a theft if it can be shown they did not take reasonable care. However, your car was towed to the premises without you and none of the paperwork you were given included this important caveat. At first, Inchcape claimed it had resolved the issue to your satisfaction. What that turned out to mean was that it had told you it wasn’t to blame and you should claim on your insurance. After further wrangling, it decided to refund your insurance excess and some of the items that vanished with your car, but says that since the car and workshop were locked on the night of the theft, it took “all reasonable steps” to keep it safe. This was four months after the incident. Your insurer has paid the full value of the car and you have a replacement.

For this the gods punished him. He was shackled to a rock where, every day, an eagle tore out his liver, which then grew back overnight. Around this grim allegory Akram Khan has fashioned a profoundly moving new work, Xenos. A solo performance of an hour’s duration, danced by Khan himself, the work reflects on the suffering of soldiers in the first world war, and particularly on the experience of the Indian colonial troops, many unrecognised and unnamed, who answered the empire’s call. The piece opens at an Indian wedding, where a Kathak dancer is to entertain. The setting is spare and ambiguous, the lighting provided by a makeshift tangle of wires and bulbs that references the trenches as well as Indian wedding decorations (lighting design is by Michael Hulls, to whom unstinting praise). As Khan’s dance unfolds, there are power cuts and brownouts, and the crackle and rumble of artillery bombardment. The dancer, we learn, is a former soldier, reliving the horrors of war. The wedding scene dissolves. The dancer’s world is now bounded by a rampart of earthworks, and the decorations are replaced by a searchlight scanning a frozen no man’s land. The percussion becomes a series of reports from a sniper’s rifle, which repeatedly lift Khan from his feet and pitch him to the ground, limbs akimbo. Five musicians, meanwhile, occupy an Olympian dais behind the performer. “This is not war,” a voice track announces hopelessly. “It is the ending of the world.” Dance is unequalled as an expression of vitality, of life force, but it takes an exceptional choreographer to show the body as the fallible, frangible thing that it is. As Vincenzo Lamagna’s fine score builds in volume and intensity, Khan gives us the failing body, the breaking body, the body as repository of physical and psychic pain. Xenos is an endurance test for his shell-shocked character, endlessly driven up the trench parapet to meet the staccato chatter of the guns, and also for Khan himself. At the age of 43, he talks of the “inner battle” he had to fight to create this work, which will be his last as a solo performer. His body, he says, has “shut down”. Not that you would know it, for this is a mighty hour of dance. Xenos (the title comes from the Greek word for “foreigner”) is a physical tour de force, but it’s also as taut as a drumskin conceptually. Granted control of his destiny, mankind chooses to wage war and is punished by moral evisceration. Khan’s unknown soldier is pinned out on that parapet for all time, condemned to endlessly relive his suffering at the hands of his fellow men. Khan draws an implicit, if not explicit, parallel with the fate of other xenoi, other foreigners, scattered to the winds by circumstances beyond their control, and eternally trying, and failing, to scale the ramparts of a world that rejects them. This is a work of defining greatness, and a fitting farewell to a stage career that has illuminated British dance. • Xenos is at Sadler’s Wells, London until 9 June"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/may/31/alexander-zverev-speak-yorkshire-double-fault-wimbledon-tennis","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-31T14:20:45Z","webTitle":"Dear Alexander Zverev, here’s what to say in Yorkshire after a double fault | Andrew Martin","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/may/31/alexander-zverev-speak-yorkshire-double-fault-wimbledon-tennis","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/may/31/alexander-zverev-speak-yorkshire-double-fault-wimbledon-tennis","fields":{"headline":"Dear Alexander Zverev, here’s what to say in Yorkshire after a double fault","bodyText":"Dear Mr Zverev, I am writing to you because, in a press conference at the French Open tennis tournament, you expressed approval of the Yorkshire accent, as spoken by one of the journalists. I know the Yorkshire tourist board has already been in touch – and for all I know you might by now be the new face of Tetley tea, or some other firm that (unlike Tetley’s, which has long gone international) is still based in Yorkshire. But I thought you might appreciate a few tips as you begin your journey into speaking Yorkshire. I myself was born in York, by the way, which is the true capital of the county (whatever people from Leeds might think). It was particularly gratifying that you expressed your “love” of the accent, because most people who love the Yorkshire accent are actually from Yorkshire. The subject is much discussed, for example, in the Dalesman magazine, regarding which a word of explanation is in order. Yes, there are Daleswomen … and the Yorkshire Dales is one of the most beautiful areas of countryside in the world, although this is not the place to boast about our county, just because it happens to have a population greater than either New Zealand or the Republic of Ireland and is widely known (in Yorkshire) as “God’s own country”. Where was I? Yes, I recently read quite a long article in the Dalesman about the pronunciation, in Yorkshire, of the word “hole”, which is one of the most useful Yorkshire words, and frequently pronounced hoil except without the “h”. (H, it must be admitted, has a rather hard time of it in Yorkshire.) Yorkshire folk see holes everywhere. A mouth, for instance, is a “cake hole”; an ear is an “ear hole” … and so we already have an opportunity to combine two phrases, hence: “Shut your cake hole, or I’ll belt you round the ear hole.” (“Please be quiet or I will belabour you about the side of the head.”) Another very useful Yorkshire word is nowt, meaning “nothing”. A famous Yorkshire maxim (of which there are literally hundreds, traditionally inscribed on tea towels) runs: “If in doubt, say nowt.” Of course, in your own field of tennis, the word for nothing is “love”, and I would encourage you to pronounce this in the Yorkshire way – luv– rather than larve, as they do at Wimbledon. Vowels are usually short in Yorkshire, partly to save time. So at Wimbledon you will be playing on grass (rhymes with “ass”) – rather than grass (rhymes with farce) – courts. (I should stress, Mr Zverev, that Wimbledon is not in Yorkshire.) Unfortunately, the tyro Tyke (or trainee Yorkshireman) must confront the technical matter of the glottal stop, which is employed in place of the definite article. Before a vowel, there is a grudging acknowledgement of the banished “the”: hence “in t’end” (“in the end”). Where a consonant is involved, “the” all but disappears, replaced by a quick opening and shutting of the glottis, hence “on t’ bed” – though without the “t”). I can see that these complications might be dispiriting to a beginner, even one who – like yourself – speaks German, Russian and that variant of Yorkshire known as English. But I would urge you to clog on (keep going) and I wish you all the best for Wimbledon. I hope you will not be plagued unduly by the collywobbles (nerves) and I might I suggest that, if you really can’t say nowt after double-faulting, an exclamation of flippin ’eck! would fit the bill nicely.

Emmanuel Macron launched the plan for special €15 “heritage” scratchcardsafter visiting the €9m (£8m) restoration Voltaire’s chateau in Ferney, near the Swiss border. Voltaire was fiercely proud of the property, acquired in 1759 after he had fallen out of favour with the French court. The philosopher talked of transforming the village of Ferney from what he called “a miserable hamlet surrounded by marshes” into a place where key figures in Europe would flock to see him. It was here that Voltaire wrote his Treatise on Tolerance, published in 1763, whose ideas would later be paraphrased as “I disapprove of what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it”. Macron was advised on the heritage plan by his friend Stéphane Bern, a TV historian and royal commentator. A commission sifted through hundreds of applications to choose the sites that would benefit from proceeds from the scratchcards. Those selected include the Caribbean home of Aimé Césaire, the Martinican intellectual, poet and politician, and the eccentric, fantasy-filled home of the writer and adventurer Pierre Loti in Rochefort, on the west coast of France – particularly to fix the roof of its second floor, decorated with artefacts from Syria and Turkey. Other places include an 18th-century fortress on a tiny Brittany island, a 12th-century Burgundy castle and a Roman aqueduct in eastern France. France has a heritage budget of €326m a year. The culture minister, Françoise Nyssen, said she saw the lottery – which could raise €15m-€20m – as extra funding for sites in particular need. The lottery will be held in September for a limited period and repeated the following year."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/may/31/arkady-babchenko-fake-murder-questions-need-answering","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-31T15:38:42Z","webTitle":"Arkady Babchenko's fake murder: questions that need answering","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/31/arkady-babchenko-fake-murder-questions-need-answering","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/may/31/arkady-babchenko-fake-murder-questions-need-answering","fields":{"headline":"Arkady Babchenko's fake murder: questions that need answering","bodyText":"The “murder” of Arkady Babchenko plunged his friends and colleagues into mourning until it emerged the Russian reporter had not been killed after all but had in fact played an active role in a staged shooting orchestrated by Ukrainian authorities. A day after the stunning revelation, much remains unclear. Luke Harding and Christopher Miller look at what we know – and what we don’t. What exactly happened? For about 20 hours, friends, colleagues and fellow journalists were mourning the death of Babchneko. On Tuesday night Ukraine announced he had been fatally shot in the back while returning to his Kiev flat. It blamed his murder on Russia. On Wednesday, Babchenko appeared at a press conference held by Ukraine’s SBU security service, very much alive. He explained he had decided to hoax the world after the SBU detected a real plot organised by Moscow to kill him. A middleman who had hired a former soldier to carry out the hit was now in custody, the SBU said. News of Babchenko’s miraculous resurrection astounded the world. At a news conference on Thursday, Babchenko described how he was ferried out of his house on a stretcher and brought to a morgue. There he got up, washed, changed his T-shirt, and watched reports of his “death” on TV. The SBU’s methods triggered widespread criticism. The agency had discredited journalism and handed Russia a massive propaganda victory, critics claimed. What don’t we know? Quite a lot. Russia’s security services have been involved in political murders before, including the 2006 assassination of Alexander Litvinenko with a radioactive cup of tea. In this case, however, no proof has been produced linking Moscow to the apparent Babchenko hit. We do not know who masterminded the operation. Nor do we know the identity of the middleman or his alleged shadowy contacts. There are no details of other “terrorist” acts the middleman was seemingly plotting. The one thing we learned on Thursday was that Babchenko’s wife was in on the hoax from the beginning. She was aware he was alive, at a time when everyone else believed him to be dead. What does Ukraine say? Not much. The head of the SBU, Vasyl Grytsak, who on Wednesday produced the Lazarus-like Babchenko, had nothing to add. It was left to Ukraine’s embassy in London to mount a defence of a special operation that fooled everybody, including the British foreign secretary, Boris Johnson. It said “unorthodox approaches” were needed to counter Russia’s ongoing “hybrid war” in Ukraine, which has resulted in the annexation of Crimea and a covert Kremlin takeover in the east of the country. “As a result of the skilfully conducted covert operation, the journalist’s life was saved, the perpetrator of the assassination attempt detained, and its organisers discovered,” the embassy said. What does Babchenko say? Babchenko appears to be seriously fed up with the criticism against him. In his first post since coming back to life, published before his Thursday news conference, the journalist hit out at “moralisers”, and wrote: “God, it got so boring being dead.” He pledged “to die at 96 while dancing on Putin’s grave” and to drive an Abrams tank down Tverskaya, Moscow’s main boulevard. Babchenko was also unimpressed with British journalists, who wondered if his actions had done more harm than good. “Dear British press, will you, please, go fuck yourselves,” he posted on Facebook. He continued: “If you want to do something useful, you can give me a British passport and British sanctuary. Then you will have earned the right to lecture me on how I should save myself and my family. Fucking smart arses!” What does the world think? Governments have expressed relief that Babchenko is not dead, but are confused by Ukraine’s dramatic tactics. Germany’s foreign minister, Heiko Maas, said the case raised many questions and that he would try to get some answers during a trip to Kiev. Russia’s foreign ministry said it was happy Babchenko was alive, and noted darkly that Ukraine was a dangerous place for journalists. The reaction from media groups and reporters has been largely negative. The stunt, they argued, would allow Russia and other unscrupulous governments to dismiss real events as fake. The International Federation of Journalists (IFJ) called Babchenko’s hoax murder “intolerable”. “By falsely spreading the news ... the Ukrainian authorities have gravely harmed the credibility of information,” complained the IFJ president, Philippe Leruth. In a long, sympathetic piece, Babchenko’s former newspaper Novaya Gazeta said it was pleased to see him back. It paid tribute to his “hilarious and uncompromising nature” and said: “It would be much better if we just lived and worked boringly, and eastern Europe wasn’t turned into a field for operational games.” What does the internet say? Babchenko’s return sparked dozens of memes and online jokes. One shows the face of Vitkor Tsoi – a popular Soviet singer who died in a car crash aged 28 – superimposed on Babchenko’s head. Standing alongside is Grytsak, who presided over Wednesday’s bizarre press conference. The journalist Lucian Kim noted that the “Elvis meme” was currently in production."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/jun/09/launderette-police-sunny-saturday-bim-adewunmi","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-09T05:00:13Z","webTitle":"Why have the police come to my launderette this sunny Saturday? | Bim Adewunmi","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jun/09/launderette-police-sunny-saturday-bim-adewunmi","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jun/09/launderette-police-sunny-saturday-bim-adewunmi","fields":{"headline":"Why have the police come to my launderette this sunny Saturday?","bodyText":"My neighbourhood in Brooklyn is just perfect. Gentrification will make its sure‑footed way to my little corner eventually, but for now that’s still a way off. This means I can afford my rent and enjoy the bang for my buck in square footage and transport links. Some mornings, when I get my coffee with a side order of small talk at the independent, black-owned coffee shop three minutes from my front door, I let my mind wander. This would be a cute scene in the utterly mundane but somehow compelling biopic based on my life. Then there are days that feel like a very different sort of movie. The type of movie that sees the police in attendance at the laundromat on a sunny Saturday afternoon. There is no pub culture here, so I’ve learned to find the pleasure of community in the launderette; this is the place through which all human life passes. As I separated my darks and lights, Elaine complained about her “giant freak head” on a Seinfeld repeat on the telly. A few metres away, something rather more bruising was brewing. The powder keg’s constituent parts: a man; his rambunctious young children; a woman just trying to get through her mountain of laundry in peace; and the type of bright sunshine that begets elation and/or rage. Today’s lesson? Do not admonish a stranger’s kids, even when the father appears to be oblivious of the noise his offspring are creating. Insults were traded, slurs were yelled, threats made as children cried. The only thing to dull the excitement was the arrival of the police.

We need to set boundaries with her, because she’s stressing us to the point where it’s affecting our health. We have differing relationships with her: she looks to me for comfort and support, and to my sister, who is younger, for things to pick apart. I have always looked after my sister (who says she feels a bit like my daughter) and we are rock solid. But mum judges her constantly. Currently my sister has a toddler and a baby, and has turned to our mum for some help. She criticises my sister’s parenting and then gloats when the “bad” things she predicted happen (all trivial incidents). My mother worries at me incessantly and seems to require more emotional support than a mother should. I have managed to dial back weekly interactions to a 10-minute call twice a week, with texts and emails on top. We have tried a number of ways to get her into therapy, most recently CBT to help with her anxiety. We feel that we cannot change anything without it either getting worse or, in the case of my sister, losing the support she needs to raise her two children. Her husband is fairly old-fashioned and tends to leave her to it. We are slowly turning to mental mush in this pressure-cooker environment. Neither of us feels that we can really effect change: when we talk to her, she acknowledges what she does and then goes right back to doing it. We wish we could limit or remove her from our lives, but feel unable to do so. I don’t think I can cut off contact unilaterally without causing my sister further suffering. My brother-in-law appears to see my mum as a necessary evil, while my partner doesn’t like her, based on the effect she has on me. My mum’s partner discourages her from seeking the help that we have been pushing for, and is now just as anxious as she is. What’s really clear is the level of resentment (especially from you towards her) and enmeshment (key word) you all have with one another. And untangling the latter can lessen the former. I’m sorry that you felt you were the parent growing up – that must have been hard. But you’re an adult now, and you can step back and think, “I’m not doing this.” You are not responsible for your mother, or your sister; only yourself. Does your sister feel the same way about your mother? My guess is not quite, but she probably doesn’t want to go against what you think. Your sister has children (it isn’t clear if you do) and when you become a parent you become at once more appreciative – and more judgmental – of your own parents. Your sister may be struggling with feeling grateful to your mum for what she did do for you growing up (presumably there was something?) and for the help she is now giving her. There’s also, for her, the relationship with her children and their grandmother to consider. Some not-so-great parents can seek redemption by trying to become excellent grandparents. Is she? Your sister has entered into some sort of contract with your mum for childcare, so she needs to decide if it’s recompense enough for the snipes and criticism, or if it would be a better idea to look for alternative childcare (which she won’t need for ever). It seems to me that your mum has stepped up where your brother-in-law hasn’t, or won’t. So it’s all very well him calling her a necessary evil, but I note she’s good enough to look after his children. I see you’ve already started minimising contact with your mother, and that’s clearly the right thing for you to do at the moment. There’s a world between cutting her out of your life and continuing with the way things are. What you want may differ from what your sister wants, and I hope you can respect that. You can’t force your mum into therapy, and she may not feel she needs it. It may be something you want to explore, however, to help you lighten the “pressure-cooker” atmosphere. • Send your problem to annalisa.barbieri@mac.com.

Supermarkets spy on them now","bodyText":"Until a few years ago, if a patient with a diagnosis of paranoid schizophrenia told you that they were being watched by the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP), most mental health practitioners would presume this to be a sign of illness. This is not the case today. The level of scrutiny all benefits claimants feel under is so brutal that it is no surprise that supermarket giant Sainsbury’s has a policy to share CCTV “where we are asked to do so by a public or regulatory authority such as the police or the Department for Work and Pensions”. Gym memberships, airport footage and surveillance video from public buildings are now used to build cases against claimants, with posts from social media used to suggest people are lying about their disabilities. More and more private companies are being asked to send in footage. The atmosphere is one of pervasive suspicion, fuelled by TV programmes such as Benefits Street and successive governments’ mentality of “strivers v skivers”. The DWP argues that video and social media footage is only used in extreme circumstances, and some are happy to brush this off as no big deal. But that ignores a key psychological truth. One does not need to have done anything wrong to feel that one has done something wrong. You know that feeling one has of getting caught out when going through airport security? That need to “perform” innocence, even though you know that you don’t have a kilo of cocaine in your hand luggage? It is this, a thousand times worse, 24 hours a day, seven days a week for claimants, whose homes and leisure time are being invaded in unprecedented ways. To make sense of this, it can be useful to think of the metaphor of the panopticon. The social reformer Jeremy Bentham designed the panopticon in the 18th century as a building with a tower surrounded by cells which allowed a watchman to observe occupants – workers, prisoners or children – from above without them being aware if they were being watched or not. The shining light from the tower was so bright that people had to act as if they are always under observation, permanently exposed, isolated and paralysed under the gaze of potential judgment (for how could they know if there was a watchman there). The philosopher Michel Foucault took up this metaphor in Discipline and Punish to describe how disciplinary power functions, as people internalise the idea that they are being watched, monitoring their behaviours accordingly and shaping their sense of themselves. This produces what Foucault called a compulsory visibility. “It is this fact of being constantly seen, of being able always to be seen,” Foucault wrote, “that maintains the disciplined individual in his subjection.” Claimants today live this subjection, this sense of visibility and targeted surveillance, with devastating effects on their mental and physical health. They often feel unable to go out, attempt voluntary work or enjoy time with family and friends for fear this will be used as evidence against them. The atmosphere is so hateful, so degrading, so ill-informed about the vicissitudes of energy and ability with regard to mental and physical disabilities, that they become imprisoned in their homes, or in a mental state wherein they feel they are constantly being accused of being fraudulent or worthless. There is little escape from this environment, as speaking freely on social media has become increasingly dangerous for claimants, and society at large has internalised many of the messages transmitted by the government and the rightwing press - the citizen-watchman on every street corner. Half of Britons now believe that out-of-work benefit claims have risen in the past 15 years, when they have fallen remarkably. Hate crimes against people on benefits have increased, with 15% of them – 800,000 people – having experienced verbal abuse, and 4% physical abuse. Cuts in welfare are presented as necessary evils by the government, undesirable but unavoidable. Yet the figures do not back this argument. The number of benefits investigators has increased substantially in recent years, from 2,600 to 3,700 from 2015 to 2016, while only 700 people investigate the super-rich. This is despite the fact benefits fraud costs the government around £1.3bn a year compared to around £34bn for tax evasion. Yet the propaganda from government has been such that a survey showed Britons believe 24% of benefits claims are fraudulent – 34 times higher than the official estimate of 0.7%. Nearly everyone that I come across on benefits now lives in a climate of such fear that life often seems unbearable. Attempted suicide rates for disabled claimants doubled between 2007 and 2014 as a result of changes to the welfare state, with universal credit only likely to make things worse given the claimant commitment people are required to sign. “Hostile environment” would be too kind a phrase to describe what the Tories have done and are doing to claimants. It is worse than that: it is the post-apocalyptic bleakness of poverty combined with the persecution and terror of constantly feeling watched and accused. It is the government who should be ashamed, not those who need benefits. Jay Watts is a clinical psychologist, psychotherapist and senior lecturer.

His body had been returned from California because he represented New York in the Senate; after the service, his coffin was loaded on to a train and taken to Washington for burial. Paul Fusco travelled on board, assigned to photograph the interment at Arlington National Cemetery. He found, however, that the cortege had an unexpected audience: as the train slowly travelled for eight hours through derelict New Jersey or ragged rural Delaware, a million locals turned out to watch this rite of passage. Fusco’s documentation had to be snatched from a jerky railway carriage, with his camera awkwardly aimed westward into the glare of the declining sun. But his impromptu images add up to a conspectus of America, its people united – in a way that is nowadays inconceivable – by a shared emotion. Boys dripping in their swimming trunks stiffly saluted; bridesmaids tossed bouquets; African Americans sank to their knees and sobbed. In Philadelphia, 20,000 bereft citizens crammed into the station and sang the Battle Hymn of the Republic. By the time the train crossed Baltimore, where Fusco took this photograph, the mood had altered. Here the crowds in their summer clothes are waving, and children perched on immobilised police cars merrily grin. A teenager has stopped twirling her candy-coloured hula hoop, but not for long. Constitutionally pledged to pursue happiness, Americans prefer festivity to mourning; if the train had made a detour to New Orleans, there would have been a jazz band in the jiving streets. Even before Kennedy was in the ground, recovery had begun, and a political martyr was enjoying the very different afterlife of a celebrity.

Now, with plans being drawn up to for a Scottish islands passport, a new task for tourists could be on the horizon: visiting the country’s inhabited islands – 93 of them. The Scottish islands passport scheme was proposed in a recent report by regional transport body the Highlands and Islands Transport Partnership (Hitrans). Travellers would be encouraged to collect a stamp for visiting each island, which could then be linked to travel discounts. It was inspired by Ireland’s Wild Atlantic Way passport, which encourages visitors to complete the 2,500km route and collect 188 stamps along the way. The Wild Atlantic Way has proved successful since its launch in 2014, attracting an estimated 1.3 million visitors last year. Hitrans hopes a passport scheme could have a similar impact on the Scottish islands, boosting tourism and supporting the “lifeline” transport services to the remote islands in the process. Writing in the report, Hitrans partnership manager Neil MacRae said the marketing possibilities around the concept were “endless”. “For example, the passport could be issued to everybody in Scotland to encourage them to visit as many of the islands as possible over their lifetime,” he wrote. According to the 2011 census, Scotland has 93 inhabited islands with a population of 103,700, served primarily by ferry but also air services. The passport scheme hopes to work in partnership with the different transport operators in the region, boosting local economies, while encouraging more visitors to the smaller and less-accessible islands. VisitScotland’s Islands Visitor Survey shows that trips to Shetland, Orkney and the Outer Hebrides have seen a 22% increase since 2012-2014, which has brought an extra £36.9m to local economies. It has voiced its support for the passport idea. A spokesperson for VisitScotland said: “The Scottish islands passport idea is at a very early stage but we would be supportive of any initiative that brings more visitors to our islands, with a unique stamp to represent each individual island as a strong call to action.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/lostinshowbiz/2018/may/31/love-island-danny-dyer-dani-jeff-goldblum","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-31T15:35:24Z","webTitle":"Beware, Dani Dyer and all Love Islanders – the fourth series is where it gets dangerous","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/lostinshowbiz/2018/may/31/love-island-danny-dyer-dani-jeff-goldblum","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/lostinshowbiz/2018/may/31/love-island-danny-dyer-dani-jeff-goldblum","fields":{"headline":"Beware, Dani Dyer and all Love Islanders – the fourth series is where it gets dangerous","bodyText":"Once again, as sure as day turns to night, the pulsating slime-drenched Love Island ovipositor has retched into action, heaving out another phalanx of contestants. For many of us, Love Island Contestant Announcement Day is the highlight of the entire year; essentially a version of Apprentice Contestant Announcement Day that’s kinder on the soul because you know the assembled people haven’t thunk their way into an aneurysm trying to origami a double windsor in a mirror. This year brings us Eyal, a model and former member of a boyband you’ve never heard of; Laura, a cabin crew member who once saw Channing Tatum on a flight; Niall, a student who likes to boast about what a noisy eater he is; Wes, who enjoys having lots of followers on Instagram; and there is Hayley, a model who “says what she thinks”. And, of course, there is Danny Dyer’s daughter. Her name – arguably the best celebrity offspring name since Jermaine Jackson took leave of his senses and called his son Jermajesty – is Dani. Dani Dyer. God bless us. Collectively, these contestants do nothing to dispel one’s belief that Love Island exists as a kind of overflow pipe for Take Me Out auditionees. But then that’s what everyone always thinks about Love Island contestants at first sight, isn’t it? They are younger than us, they have better haircuts than us and they are going to spend the summer dancing around the peripheries of sexually transmitted infection like Fred Astaire on rollerskates. Of course, your first instinct is going to be blind hatred. You’re only human. But as we should all know, this is just the first stage of a long and complicated relationship. For Love Island tends to come at us in waves. This sense of disgruntlement, this sense of being tied to a chair and helplessly watching civilisation burst into flames, is always how it starts. But when Love Island actually begins next week, we’ll slowly get to know these people. And that’s when things will get complicated. Wave two will be empathy. As the days wear on, we’ll begin to see past the sixpacks and blowdries, and start to see ourselves. We’ll see cracks of vulnerability. We’ll see their mistimed jokes and unconvincing bravado and think of all the times we’ve ever accidentally detonated a potential romance purely with the power of our own awkwardness. We’ll see kernels of genuine affection bloom one glance at a time, and we’ll remember what it’s like to be young and in love, and then without warning we’ll suddenly be rooting for them. In this crazy, mixed-up world, who are we to deny these people happiness? Even if it’s fleeting. Even if it’s ill-advised. These people are humans, and all humans deserve to feel some semblance of joy. Wave three comes a fortnight before the end of Love Island, and it’s where all the broadsheet columnists pile on and over-intellectualise the programme in a doomed attack on the pulse of the nation. We shan’t dwell on this stage. And then comes wave four, when Love Island ends and the contestants – now paired up and blissfully happy – try to pivot their notoriety into genuine celebrity. They will go to parties. They will give interviews to magazines. They will singularly fail to realise that we only liked them in the self-contained bubble of Love Island. They will push things a millimetre too far and then we will violently reject them for something newer. Expect this last wave to happen faster than usual this year. Gone will be the breathless reportage about cheating scandals, the horrifying swimwear weddings on breakfast television and the inevitable, harrowing, dead-on-arrival musical careers. Because this is the fourth series of Love Island, and fourth series tend to mark a tipping point for shows like this. In the first, celebrities are created from novelty alone. The second improves on the formula, casting people with actual charisma. The third is the one that breaks all the viewing records because people want to see what all the fuss is about. And then, in the fourth, we look around and realise we can’t move for former contestants refusing to relinquish their 15 minutes, and everyone is instantly banished to obscurity as a result. Big Brother 4 gave us Cameron Stout. The fourth X Factor was won by Leon Jackson. The breakout star of the fourth Apprentice was Raef Bjayou, a man subsequently most famous for appearing on Ready Steady Cook once. And so it will be with Love Island. Society is already brimming with fake-tanned people clinging on to the sidebar of shame like their lives depend on it, and the last thing we need is any more of them. So farewell Dani Dyer, we barely knew ye. The secret of jazzy Jeff Goldblum’s success? A wife half his age It says something awful about 2018 that, when Jeff Goldblum starts to trend on Twitter, your first question is essentially, “Is he dead or is he a pervert?” But this time, the truth is arguably worse. Jeff Goldblum is a jazz pianist. At some point in the near-to-mid future, Goldblum will release his debut jazz album on Decca. It might be a solo album, or it might be recorded with his jazz group The Mildred Snitzer Orchestra. We just don’t know. All we really know is that this feels inevitable. Because, with his tics and quirks and the way he delivers lines like a man watching a confused moth circle a lampshade, Goldblum is essentially jazz incarnate. So irrepressible is he, in fact, that cries of “vanity project” turn to ash as soon as they leave our mouths. Even if you don’t like jazz, the simple joy of Goldblum’s existence should be enough to forgive him for indulging his hobbies like this. This is perhaps down to Goldblum’s late blooming as a style icon. Look at any recent photoshoot of his and you will see rings on his fingers and volume in his hair and clothes in colours that are rarely worn by 65-year-old men. Out of nowhere Goldblum is the internet’s boyfriend, assuming that the internet has deep-set daddy issues. Goldblum has become a lifeline for men of a certain age; a clarion cry to rage against the dying of the light, a neon sign reading, “You too can be like this”. He’s interested and interesting and he refuses to be constrained by the limits of age. We can all be like Goldblum, and all we have to do is marry a woman half our age. It’s no coincidence that Goldblum’s recent uptick coincides with his marriage to 35-year-old Canadian gymnast Emilie Livingston. They seem blissfully enamoured, and he has been reinvigorated beyond words by the relationship. In this dark and dismal time, it’s refreshing to know that true happiness can transform us all, and all we need to get there is to shack up with a woman who was only 10 years old when we made Jurassic Park. Jeff Goldblum, you are an inspiration to men everywhere."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/jun/01/my-husband-has-become-angry-and-we-argue-about-everything","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-01T11:00:47Z","webTitle":"My husband has become angry and we argue about everything","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jun/01/my-husband-has-become-angry-and-we-argue-about-everything","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jun/01/my-husband-has-become-angry-and-we-argue-about-everything","fields":{"headline":"My husband has become angry and we argue about everything","bodyText":"My husband of nine years and I end up arguing about everything.

Rupa Huq, who represents Ealing Central and Acton, accused the home secretary of sitting on a review started by his predecessor Amber Rudd, which she and 160 other MPs and peers from all parties believe could halt emotive anti-abortion protests that take place outside an estimated 42 clinics. The Labour MP said evidence to the review had been submitted by interested groups in February. “I understand that he has a busy in-tray, but this could be an easy win for him early on in his career and massively improve the lives of women not only in the mainland UK, but in Northern Ireland and the Republic, who make daily journeys to clinics like that in my seat in Ealing,” Huq said. Last month, Ealing council introduced the the first exclusion zone in England around a Marie Stopes clinic in Ealing, where 7,000 abortions are carried out a year, to stop continuous picketing by anti-abortion campaigners, who were at times opposed in the street by pro-choice demonstrators. However, the legality of the council’s public spaces protection order is the subject of a legal challenge by two women linked to the Good Counsel Network, who say they provide “peaceful, prayerful witnesses which help hundreds of women to choose life every year”. The high court is due to hear the case next Thursday. Several councils around the country, including Manchester, Leeds, Birmingham and Portsmouth, have passed motions in support of introducing exclusion areas and could do so if the Ealing zone is upheld. But campaigners say it would be better to implement a 100-metre (330ft) exclusion area around every clinic so the law is not uneven. Anti-abortion campaigners have stood outside clinics holding up large signs showing images of aborted foetuses, while women entering and leaving clinics have complained of being filmed and handed false medical information. But Clare McCullough, the director of the Good Counsel Network, wrote to Rudd in November to say that in Ealing, her group offered “a leaflet detailing help, support and alternatives to abortion” and ran a “witness against abortion” consisting of a small number of people “standing away from the abortion centre and praying quietly”. Theresa May and her government have come under intense pressure over abortion in the aftermath of the Irish referendum result, with Conservative MPs demanding that Westminster force Northern Ireland to liberalise its restrictive laws. Huq also complained that Javid had failed to reply to a cross-party letter sent to him three weeks ago, which was signed by about 150 MPs, including the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, and the Conservatives Sarah Wollaston and Ken Clarke. The letter called on Javid to commit to completing Rudd’s review and “move forward with finding a solution”. When contacted by the Guardian about the letter, the Home Office said Javid was “committed to the in-depth assessment of protests outside abortion clinics” and work “is continuing”. It was “completely unacceptable that anyone should feel harassed or intimidated simply for exercising their legal right to healthcare, advice and treatment”, a spokesperson said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/bike-blog/2018/jun/01/the-festival-putting-edinburgh-on-the-international-cycling-map","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-01T06:00:42Z","webTitle":"The festival putting Edinburgh on the international cycling map |  Kim Harding","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/bike-blog/2018/jun/01/the-festival-putting-edinburgh-on-the-international-cycling-map","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/bike-blog/2018/jun/01/the-festival-putting-edinburgh-on-the-international-cycling-map","fields":{"headline":"The festival putting Edinburgh on the international cycling map","bodyText":"In theory, Edinburgh might not look like the perfect city for cycling. Apart from the weather there are the (in)famous hills, then there’s the … (add your own excuses here.) But things are changing. Currently the city council is committing 10% of its transport budget to cycling, a first for a UK city, as well as introducing 20mph speed limits across a large area. And in September, Edinburgh will finally be getting its own bikeshare scheme, which will include a proportion of e-bikes to help beat the hills. The city also hosts the Edinburgh Festival of Cycling, or EdFoC for short, now in its sixth year. A mix of talks, organised rides and workshops, it tries to focus on cycling as everyday transport, as well as sport, a leisure activity and a cultural entity. This year’s edition begins next week. When I first moved to Edinburgh as a mature student, I gave up my car, which at the time felt like a great sacrifice. I thought I’d get another when I graduated. I hadn’t really thought about how I’d get around and had been complaining about getting to morning lectures on time. It was a throwaway comment from my tutor that changed my life – he took his pipe from his mouth (he wasn’t smoking it, the university had just banned that, but still liked to suck it) and said: “Better get yourself a bicycle then.” I have never looked back. Owning a bike opened up the city to me in a way I had never experienced before. Edinburgh is a fairly compact city, with the sea to the north and (even bigger) hills to the south. You soon learn to rely on a range of gears for ascents, and good brakes for heading down again. The city has notoriously fickle and changeable weather, and it is windy. One of my earliest experiences of cycling here was a wind so strong it blew me up a hill, which was fine until I reached a red light. That said, it has about as much sunshine as London, on average, and is one of the driest places in the UK. Plus, in the summer it doesn’t really get dark. On cycling there is ambition. In 2009 it was the first UK city to sign the Charter of Brussels, committing to achieve a 15% bicycle modal share by 2020. Sadly this is a target that Edinburgh currently has no hope of hitting, not least because of the current lack of dedicated cycling infrastructure, limiting access to people of all ages and abilities. Currently the total share of trips made by bike is static at about 3% or 4%, depending who you ask, though this is much higher in rush hours – some studies have indicated up to 25% of vehicles heading into the city centre in the morning are bikes. But while the numbers of cycle commuters has risen over the last decade, these are generally people who ride despite the conditions, not because of them. Major opportunities to make real improvements have been missed, such as the redevelopment of Leith Walk, one of the city’s primary streets, which is now a mishmash of infrastructure which pleases no one. Will it change? We can only continue to hope and campaign. And until it does, next week’s EdFoC can celebrate all that is great about riding a bike here – or anywhere.

At this point we usually do a summary of events, a bitesize breakdown of what has occurred, but on this occasion it should be quite simple... Zinedine Zidane has stepped down as Real Madrid head coach, citing the need for ‘change’ at the club to continue their success. More details here. Florentino Perez had no idea this was coming. Nobody knows what will happen next. Fin. Thanks for reading, and thanks for your emails. Oh, lovely shout here from Joseph Lam: “Xabi Alonso is getting into management: maybe he could jump right into the deep end.” Sounds like (most of) the Real players had quite a nice time under Zizou... Tony Sullivan (an Evertonian) went there... “Left field suggestion...Jürgen Klopp, right playing style and would probably bring Salah and maybe Firmino with him.” Holy hell... Michael Edgar has a suggestion: “Ronaldo pretty much won the European Championship as interim coach for Portugal for all of 70 minutes or so? No?” It would be entertaining if one of the Real players tweeted ‘Good riddance, let’s get a manager in who knows what he’s doing.’ But for now, we’ll have to make do with this... Any left field nominations that haven’t already been mentioned here? And would just like to head off at the pass any ‘banter’ suggestions: I’ve set a filter on my email to block any emails mentioning the names Allardyce (Allardici), Pardew or Curbishley. Email me here. Some other names in the betting: Massimiliano Allegri, Joachim Löw, Diego Simeone (!), Laurent Blanc, Carlo Ancelotti...and then from that point it starts to get really silly. As I was saying about the look on Florentino’s face... And here’s Sergio... Social media’s Toni Kroos is - I think - the first Real player in with the appreciation post. So attention turns to who comes next, and inevitably there will be some nervous clubs in the Premier League. Well, nervous club. Mauricio Pochettino is the favourite with some bookies, while Antonio Conte is also in the running. The sentimental might think Arsene Wenger could do it, having been approached a few times before, while Mauricio Sarri is technically currently unemployed. Guti is also high up in the betting - he’s their under-19s coach - as is Santi Solari, who has Zidane’s old job as coach of Real Madrid Castilla. Nobody saw this coming. If you believe him, not even Florentino Perez. But what a move it is: you sort of hope that Zidane now retires from coaching altogether, because what will top winning three Champions League titles in two-and-a-half seasons with Real Madrid, the club at which you were already a hero? Maybe picking up the shambolic pieces from France after their disappointing first round exit under Didier Deschamps at this summer’s World Cup, and winning in 2022? Actually, definitely that...but probably only that. And that’s the press conference over. There’s a hearty round of applause from the assembled media, and Zidane disappears through the press room door. Well then. Zidane is asked if this has anything to do with Cristiano Ronaldo. The question gets short shrift. “I think it would be difficult to keep winning if I stayed.” Interestingly, he says he was close to signing a new contract, but changed his mind. Zidane has spoken to Sergio Ramos, who supports him, and has sent a message to the rest of the squad. He says he doesn’t have plans to coach next season. If anyone has earned a long lie down, it’s him. He also mentions that he’s pretty tired, which tallies with this, as he said a few months ago: ““Being a coach is extremely tiring - more so at a club like Real Madrid, When I feel there is nothing more to give, I’ll walk away.” Zidane has repeated the line that he thinks change is required. “Big players need change,” he says. Which is true enough. Stop blubbing excessively, Madridistas, he could be back: “Of course, I could return, I’ll always be near to this club as it’s close to my heart. I think many won’t understand but I know it’s the right time. Time for a change. And for the players too.” Zidane said he “doesn’t forget the hard times” as he reflects: as he’s won the Champions League in all three of his seasons in charge, there weren’t that many hard times, Zizou... Floretino Perez is next to Zidane and has that look on his face of a man trying to stay calm but panicking under the surface. He said they didn’t see this coming and have no earthly idea who will replace him. Paraphrasing, obviously. Ch-ch-ch-changes. Well then. Zidane, wearing a blue jacket with jeans, said: “I’ve taken the decision to not continue next year as Real Madrid coach.” Zidane has resigned from his post as Real Madrid manager, having won three consecutive Champions League titles, and the 2016-17 Liga title, it was announced at a news conference at the Santiago Bernabéu stadium"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"fashion/2018/jun/16/best-self-tanning-products-sali-hughes","type":"article","sectionId":"fashion","sectionName":"Fashion","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-16T07:00:38Z","webTitle":"The best new self-tanning products | Sali Hughes","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2018/jun/16/best-self-tanning-products-sali-hughes","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/fashion/2018/jun/16/best-self-tanning-products-sali-hughes","fields":{"headline":"Sali Hughes: the best products for tanned legs","bodyText":"Bare-legs weather arrives so abruptly in Britain that one day I can be wondering if 100 denier will be enough to calm the shivers, and the very next have people I barely know telling me I must be boiling in tights (please stop). All well and good for them, with their naturally golden limbs, year-round tanning regime or “screw it” attitude, but I have neither the genes nor the inclination to be shorts-ready whenever the sun deigns to show its face. My legs are white, dry and not fastidiously shaved (unless I know they’re to appear before anyone but my family), so I seek products to give them an instant, relatively thoughtless makeover. The best I’ve found in 30 years is Vita Liberata Body Blur (£29.50, 100ml), a gift to anyone who’d like to add instant, realistic, streak-free colour while disguising moderate scars, veins and birthmarks. Its silicone base means it doesn’t rub off on clothing and sheets, or cause my legs to look like melted candles when heavy rain hits. The peerless texture means that one blob on a tanning mitt (buy cheap: they’re all the same) strokes effortlessly on to limbs in seconds. It helps if you’re not freshly basted in thick body cream, which I usually am, but I get around the problem by using Nivea In-Shower Lotion (£2.99, 250ml), which rinses off, leaving a light, fake-tan-friendly coating of moisturiser. If Body Blur is too rich for you (and I hear you, though would add that one tube should last the summer), try to score some scarcely stocked Garnier BB Body Wash-Off Bronzer (£7.99, 150ml), which works in the same way and almost as well (the colour and indelibility aren’t quite as good, but I’m pernickety). If wash‑offs don’t appeal, I enthusiastically recommend Self Tanning Drops (£19.95, 30ml) from celebrity tanner (yes, it’s a thing) Jules Von Hep’s excellent new vegan brand, Isle of Paradise. These eliminate everything women hate about self-tanning – the smell, the faff, the orange – by working with the skincare products you use every day. Just mix one to 12 drops into your favourite face or body cream and apply as usual before washing hands. The fewer drops you use, the lighter the tan, so start low and increase. Four drops were just right to tint my milky legs for a solid three days."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"environment/2018/may/31/tell-us-how-you-are-rewilding-or-improving-nature-in-your-area","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-31T10:50:29Z","webTitle":"Tell us how you are rewilding or improving nature in your area","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/may/31/tell-us-how-you-are-rewilding-or-improving-nature-in-your-area","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/may/31/tell-us-how-you-are-rewilding-or-improving-nature-in-your-area","fields":{"headline":"Tell us how you are rewilding or improving nature in your area","bodyText":"Naturalist Patrick Barkham wrote in the Guardian this week about the principles of rewilding – stepping back and allowing natural processes to occur, and encouraging wild plants and insects.

Don’t read on if you haven’t seen episode four of the fourth series – and if you’ve seen further ahead, please do not post spoilers. You can read the previous recaps here. To Saga, deaths – even avoidable ones – are data. By the end of a bloodthirsty episode in which a former prime suspect opted to take his own life and a bad dad was cruelly tricked into murdering his daughter, she had intuited a working theory to link the seemingly random killings filling up the Copenhagen evidence wall. For Saga, it is some sort of gift. But for her partner Henrik – so shaken by recent turns in the Margrethe Thormod stoning case that he sought out his old drug dealer – the rising body count is taking a toll. We have a new suspect, at least. Morgan Sonning, owner of the black Audi that picked up Margrethe on the day of her death and a slick Stewart Lee haircut. Despite a tense late-night encounter with Taariq Shirazi, Sonning seemed unflappable, even smug, when questioned by police. He had a handy alibi for the night of the stoning: his car was getting worked on at his brother’s garage in Sweden while he and his wife, Malene, were on a (suspiciously cash-only, mobile-free) Hamburg city break. That did not stop Saga and Henrik kicking the tyres of his story as they nosed around his brother Tobias’s garage to see who else might have accessed the Audi. The burning fuse throughout this episode took place almost entirely away from the main investigation. Arms dealer William Ramberg, who we had previously seen carrying himself with the menacing air of someone used to getting their own way, was dispatched on a berserk Malmö mercy mission that would not have felt out of place in a Saw movie. After receiving a video message portraying his daughter Leonora being injected with some mysterious yellow compound by the creepy clown from last week, William believed he only had four hours to raise a ransom and acquire the antidote (delivered by drone). The callous twist – that the antidote was a lethal neurotoxin, and that by injecting it he had killed Leonora – seemed to snap William’s sanity like a breadstick. Poor Taariq. After slipping police surveillance in Copenhagen, he had ditched his wild hair, shaved off his beard and was making a desperate break for Sweden, only to be challenged by a diligent border guard. The resulting armed standoff ended swiftly and violently, but it seemed notable that even after only knowing Saga for a brief time, Taariq instinctively knew she would tell him the bald truth about his limited options rather than string him along with hostage negotiation tactics. Seeing a man blow his brains out in front of you feels like something you might want to discuss with your therapist, but Saga’s latest session skipped over all that to burrow a little deeper into her knotty relationship with her parents. Her psychiatrist brightly encouraged Saga to analyse her feelings rather than rocket past them, and received a heroically furrowed brow in return. Even if she struggles to analyse her own emotions, Saga was still the only one able to see the emerging pattern on the evidence wall. Deaths by stoning, electrocution and poison are just three of the various ways state executions are carried out around the world. If Saga’s predictive model is correct, there are now at least four more (presumably harrowing) deaths to come, by firing squad, hanging, gas chamber and decapitation. Looks like Henrik’s dealer could end up being very busy. Life in the village Far from the carnage, Christoffer continued to settle in at the rural, but suspiciously serene, gated community, bonding over rifle shooting with would-be father figure Frank and playing a pheromone-charged game of truth or dare with Astrid, the local manic tricksy dream girl. Things look far less fun for mum, Sofie, after her ex, Dan Brolund, the unpleasant fists-first cabby, unexpectedly confronts her in their new refuge. Hard to imagine Dan will be cool with the whole socialist/commune/hippy thing. Playing house with Henrik and Saga If witnessing Taariq’s suicide wasn’t enough to send Henrik into a tailspin, the fact that teen runaways Julia and Ida had trashed his flat, nicked his family heirlooms and done a bunk pushed him deeper into despair. Saga’s non-reaction to his anguish – “I’m hungry, are you still making dinner?” – did not help, although eventually she did seem to try to reach out. Reassessing her pregnancy, she offered to have the baby, but sign over all rights and duties to him. “The child becomes yours, not mine,” she says. “And we can have sex sometimes.” What do we know? Morgan Sonning is implicated by Taariq Shirazi’s internet search history. It was his Audi that picked up Margrethe Thormod on the day of her death. Morgan, who has no criminal record, claims he was on holiday at the time. The car was in his brother’s garage in Sweden. Analysis shows the Audi has not been hot-wired, suggesting whoever used it had a key. During a hostage standoff at the Swedish border, Taariq kills himself rather than face imprisonment and eventual extradition to Iran. The Thormod investigation is expanded to include the death of Leonora, murdered by her father, William, in bizarre circumstances. Leonora was recovering from a kidney transplant in the hospital where Patrik Dahlqvist, victim No 2, worked as a clown. The neurotoxin that killed Leonora was snail-derived, but could be sourced from an aquarium or a laboratory. The working theory linking the stoning of Margrethe Thormod, the electrocution of Patrik Dahlqvist and the poisoning of Leonora Redberg is that the killer is echoing methods used in state executions, suggesting there will be at least four more. Thoughts and observations Lots to unpack with the Sonnings and their in-laws. Wife Malene is linked to Margrethe through them both working with a woman’s health charity, plus there was that weird question mark over the parentage of Morgan’s brother’s baby. Not a big week for Margrethe’s sketchy widower, Niels, but we did see him burning his wife’s possessions, including an important-looking notebook, in a BBQ pyre. Poor Lillian. After some typically direct sex chat with Saga in the police station lift, she ditched her hot date in favour of a jumbo glass of wine and watching old videos of her late husband, Hans. Has grumpy Jonas warmed to Saga? Even if their joint questioning did not rock the Sonnings, he seemed to quite enjoy their unexpected team-up and debate about small talk. If the bleakness in this season is all getting a bit too much, this recent Scandi noir spoof may raise a chuckle. Finally! The origin story of Saga’s 1978 Porsche 911: she won it from her instructor at police college, who foolishly wagered that she would not finish top of the class."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2018/jun/04/when-good-tv-goes-bad-american-horror-story","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-04T12:00:15Z","webTitle":"When good TV goes bad: American Horror Story","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/jun/04/when-good-tv-goes-bad-american-horror-story","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2018/jun/04/when-good-tv-goes-bad-american-horror-story","fields":{"headline":"When good TV goes bad: how American Horror Story got Trumped","bodyText":"Get Out may have grabbed an Oscar last year but the trend for horror being taken seriously again by critics began with American Horror Story. The horror anthology series has taken more trophies than a hoarding serial killer. Each season takes place in a new time and place and each reinvention gives the chance for the show to try something disturbingly new. So far, we have seen the cast locked up in an asylum, running a haunted hotel, and even facing the terrors of American suburbia. Linking the seasons are a repertory company of stellar actors, many of whom return to play new characters each time. Jessica Lange steals every scene, whether as the supreme witch of New Orleans, a sadistic nun, or a circus performer being dragged across a stage on a rocket singing Life on Mars in a German accent. With the show’s success, other stars were soon attracted to the campy horror. Angela Bassett played a Voodoo queen. Lady Gaga won a Golden Globe for her turn as a vampiric hotel owner. You never knew when the likes of James Cromwell might pop up as a Nazi doctor with an amputation fetish or Kathy Bates would appear as an immortal racist’s disembodied head. For six seasons of bonkers storylines, American Horror Story could do no wrong, but there was a sinister clown lurking in the bushes that would gut the show of all its perverse joy. Donald Trump was elected president of the United States in 2016. This was a problem for the world in general and American Horror Story in particular. Horror and satire died that day. Nothing the writers could imagine comes close to the visceral shock of that moment – but they decided to offer their hot take anyway. The seventh season of AHS opens with Trump’s victory being announced. Subtitled Cult, the series and the subtext is anything but subtle. Sarah Paulson plays a liberal lesbian, while Evan Peters plays a basement-dwelling troll, both reacting to Trump. Paulson’s character screams at the television; Peters’s alt-right villain crumbles Cheetos over his face to mimic the president’s trademark orange complexion. Take that Trump! The show seems to want to suggest that both left and right are simply cults, each as bad as the other. In tackling the real world, Cult left out all the supernatural chills that had made the show unique. Out went the ghosts in gimp costumes, the reanimated babies, and even the spirit fondly known as “Drilldo” who sported a gruesome strap-on. Without the supernatural horror, the formerly entertaining terror becomes tedious. Earlier seasons featured people being pickled and sold to medical schools, a witch burned at the stake and a magician’s assistant being cut in half for real. Season seven gave us deaths by gun, gun and – for a change of pace – nailgun. Sociopaths might enjoy any old homicide but surely everyone else wants original and inventive slaughter? Season two had Maroon 5’s Adam Levine bleeding out after having an arm ripped off. All we want is pop stars murdered wittily on TV for our amusement. Is that too much to ask?"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"football/2018/may/31/frank-lampard-manager-derby-zinedine-zidane-real-madrid-fiver","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-31T16:05:28Z","webTitle":"A magic football and battles with pirates | The Fiver","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/may/31/frank-lampard-manager-derby-zinedine-zidane-real-madrid-fiver","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/may/31/frank-lampard-manager-derby-zinedine-zidane-real-madrid-fiver","fields":{"headline":"A magic football and battles with pirates","bodyText":"WON’T SOMEBODY THINK OF SOL? Management is about making decisions, and the decisions made by former members of England’s golden generation have generally looked dodgy from the start. Gary Neville opted to begin his career as a gaffer at a struggling club in a country where he couldn’t understand a word of what anyone said, and Steven Gerrard has gone and done the same. Silly old Sol Campbell, meanwhile, went and got himself all badged up without realising there is something about him that seems to make many potential employers consider him unworthy of becoming a peer of Steve Evans and Joseph Barton. Frank Lampard has become the latest ex-England underachiever to venture into management, armed with lesser qualifications than Campbell but a reputation as a top, top lad. He has got himself a three-year contract at Derby County. “This is my first job as a manager but I’ve worked closely with some of the best coaches in the game,” boomed Lampard, who has also worked with Avram Grant. At 39, Lampard has left it late to join the management game: by that age Brian Clough had already led Derby out of the second tier and turned them into English champions. On the other hand, Clough hadn’t penned a series of best-selling books about a magic football and battles with pirates, so everyone finds their own path in the end, unless they don’t. “I know it won’t be easy – managing a football team never is – but I’m really looking forward to the challenge,” blarted Lampard, drawing quizzical looks from a relaxed, freshly-shaven gent in Madrid. “Management not easy?” Zinedine Zidane seemed to be thinking as he totted up the number of Big Cups won during his two-and-a-half years at the helm of Real Madrid. Three! More than Lord Ferg, Franz Beckenbauer, Arsène Wenger and Barry Fry combined! And three, it turns out, is enough for Zidane, who decided to call an impromptu press conference later on Thursday to announce his resignation, either by headbutting each and every member of the hackery or, failing that, by pronouncing a short and dignified message to the effect of: “My work is done here”. He plumped for the latter, sadly. “I have taken the decision to not continue into the next season. A change is needed, a new voice, a different message,” explained Zidane, as if he’d been reading the Fiver’s inbox for years.

More than 100 years after its invention, we’re addicted. To pass a day without encountering some form of plastic is nearly impossible. We’ve always been eager to embrace the promise of a product that could make life cheaper, faster, easier. Now, after a century of unchecked production and consumption, convenience has turned to crisis. Beyond a mere material amenity, today you’ll find plastic where you least expect it, including the foods we eat, the water we drink and the environments in which we live. Once in the environment, it enters our food chain where, increasingly, microplastic particles are turning up in our stomachs, blood and lungs. Scientists are only beginning to study the potential health impacts. That’s why we urgently need consumers, business and governments to step up with urgent, decisive action to halt this crisis of consumption of single-use, throwaway plastics. If we do that, we’ll also help fight climate change, create a new space for innovation and save some species in the process. Since we began our love affair with this now ubiquitous material, we’ve produced roughly nine billion tonnes of plastic. About one-third of this has been single-use, providing a momentary convenience before being discarded. The straw in your average drink will be used for just a few minutes, but in the environment, it will last beyond our lifetimes. In your shopping trolley, a plastic bag will be used for less than an hour, but when they find their way to the ocean they kill more than 100,000 marine animals a year. Whales have been washed up in Norway and Spain choked with indigestible shopping bags – part of the 13m tonnes of plastic litter that end up in the ocean each year. Unlike other environmental challenges, sceptics are hard-pressed to refute the reality of what we can see with our own eyes. Instead, the counter-narrative aims to undercut the urgency of efforts to beat plastic pollution – sometimes by painting the problem as a waste management issue, as if we had infinite landfill space. But let there be no doubt: we are on edge of a plastic calamity. Current projections show that global plastic production will skyrocket in the next 10-15 years. This year alone, manufacturers will produce an estimated 360m tonnes. With a booming population driving demand, production is expected to reach 500m by 2025 and a staggering 619m tonnes by 2030. So the next time you see scenes of plastic choking a river or burying a beach, consider double that impact in just over 10 years. Avoiding the worst of these outcomes requires more than awareness, it demands a movement. A wholesale rethinking of the way we produce, use and manage plastic. That’s why United Nations Environment is now focusing on a simple yet ambitious goal: beat plastic pollution. First, citizens must act as both responsible consumers and informed citizens; demanding sustainable products and embracing sensible consumption habits into their own lives. Individuals are increasingly exercising their power as consumers; turning down plastic straws and cutlery, cleaning beaches and coastlines, and rethinking their purchase habits. If this happens enough, retailers will get the message and look for alternatives. The private sector must then innovate by adopting business models that reflect responsibility for the downstream impact of their products, and bring about scalable alternatives. Ultimately our plastic problem – much like the state of the global economy – is one of design, both in the plastics themselves and the linear economic model that makes throwing things away profitable. Public and private investment in the fields of green design and green chemistry need to be increased and manufacturers must be held to account for the life cycle of their products. And finally, governments must lead by enacting strong policies that mandate responsible design, production and consumption of plastics. Kenya has banned throwaway plastic bags recently, and the result is that its stunning national parks are even more attractive and city drains are less blocked, helping reduce flooding. Rwanda has done it too, making Kigali one of the world’s cleanest cities and the kind of place people choose to live and do business. Those who say there are more important environmental crises to tackle are mistaken. In today’s world, protecting our environment is not about choosing one issue above another.

The Frenchman announced his decision at the Valdebebas training ground on Thursday afternoon, insisting he and the club needed a change and admitting he was not convinced Real would continue winning if he remained in charge. The club’s president, Florentino Pérez, described it as a “sad day” and said the decision was “totally unexpected”. Zidane would not say exactly when he made the decision to depart. Pérez said Zidane had communicated his decision on Wednesday and a press conference was hurriedly called on Thursday morning. At the same time the players were informed of the decision by text message. Zidane said he had spoken to the Real captain, Sergio Ramos, and he would speak to the other club captains, Cristiano Ronaldo and Marcelo, in due course. He said he had no plans to manage another club but was not tired of coaching. Real did not say anything about a successor but Mauricio Pochettino is among those they have long identified as candidates. Zidane had been due to discuss plans for the coming season – plans that would include the futures of Gareth Bale and Ronaldo, both of whom had suggested they would leave immediately after the Champions League final. Instead, it is the manager who walks away. “I would have liked to convince him [to stay] but I know how he is,” Pérez said at the start of the press conference. “I have taken the decision not continue as coach of Real Madrid next year,” Zidane said. “I spoke to the president to explain what I thought. I think it is the moment, for me and for the squad. I know it is a bit of a strange moment but I think it is the right moment. This is a team that should keep on winning and it needs a change for that. After three years, it needs another discourse, another working methodology, and that’s why I took this decision.” “There are complicated moments in the season when you ask: ‘Am I still the right person? I don’t forget the hard moments too. There are lovely moments and we ended with a spectacular moment but there are hard moments that make you reflect.” He identified Real’s defeat in the Copa del Rey as one of the key moments. “I think it’s the moment to go,” he added. “I also think the players need a change. They’re the ones who fight on the pitch. It’s not easy for them. It’s a demanding club, a club with a huge history and the players are always squeezed. We always want more and more and there is a moment when you think: ‘Well, what more can I ask from my players?’ I want to win and if I don’t see clearly that we’re going to keep on winning, then it is best to change and not do anything stupid.” Zidane leaves having won nine titles, including three consecutive European Cups, although he said the title that gave him the greatest satisfaction was last season’s league win. Asked if he might have stayed on had Real not won the Champions League final against Liverpool, he replied: “I don’t know. Could be, could be.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2018/may/31/transfer-latest-west-ham-fulham-ryan-fredericks","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-31T13:09:00Z","webTitle":"West Ham confident of signing Fulham defender Ryan Fredericks","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/may/31/transfer-latest-west-ham-fulham-ryan-fredericks","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/may/31/transfer-latest-west-ham-fulham-ryan-fredericks","fields":{"headline":"West Ham confident of signing Fulham defender Ryan Fredericks","bodyText":"West Ham are confident of signing the right-back Ryan Fredericks, whose contract with Fulham expires this summer. Fredericks is also a target for Crystal Palace, among other clubs, and Fulham are trying to persuade the 25-year-old to extend his contract after they were promoted to the Premier League. The defender is due to hold talks with West Ham next week. Fredericks, a product of Tottenham’s academy, has never played in the top division. He joined Fulham from Bristol City in 2015. West Ham are emphatic that Marko Arnautovic will not be sold to Manchester United if José Mourinho, who watched the forward play for Austria on Wednesday, moves for him. They regard Arnautovic as too important to be allowed to go. The Lazio winger Felipe Anderson features in West Ham’s thinking but Manuel Pellegrini’s priority is to strengthen a defence that conceded 68 goals last season. The club are weighing up whether to pursue their interest in Barcelona’s Marlon Santos amid concerns that the Brazilian centre-back is too short for the Premier League and have also targeted Genoa’s Armando Izzo.

A captain. A fighter. Someone in the trenches. They’re describing GI Joe, and until recently, 93% of the directors they hired fit that masculine mold. Women didn’t, so – consciously and subconsciously – female directors weren’t imagined as being hardy enough to helm a big blockbuster. The stereotype has been tough to shatter. Yet, the movies are an art form stitched together from creativity, empathy and connection. “What we need is a communicator who can lead,” says film-maker Karyn Kusama in Amy Adrion’s inquisitive documentary, Half the Picture, which screens this weekend at the Sundance London. “This isn’t a war.” It isn’t. But it has been as the women of Hollywood have publicly waged a battle for fair hiring practices, with a boost from the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and the ACLU who led separate investigations into the drastic gender disparity in 2013 and 2015, which culminated in official government letters informing the studios they must correct the imbalance or risk lawsuits. Two months into the EEOC inquiry, Adrion started filming Half the Picture, interviewing over 40 female film-makers, and her feisty documentary feels like getting the inside scoop. “The problem gets logged as this Hollywood elitism, that it’s a privilege to work in this industry at all,” says Adrion on a drizzly afternoon in Los Angeles. “The bottom line is, you can’t just hire white men for jobs when there are qualified women. Whether that’s for a cashier or a bank teller or for Hollywood movies, it is illegal.” “For a long time, it took people who were at the end of their career to tell their stories because they were like, ‘What do I have to lose?’” says Adrion. Today – and together – the women are able to be brave. Half the Picture sparkles with star power: Ava DuVernay, Jill Soloway, Catherine Hardwicke, Miranda July, Lena Dunham, Gina Prince-Bythewood, Kimberly Peirce, Sam Taylor-Johnson and Penelope Spheeris make up just a fraction of the wattage. “Women at the top of their game don’t have to talk to me on the record about how the system is broken,” says Adrion. After all, Half the Picture is her first feature. “It’s not like, ‘You have to speak to me!’” she says with a laugh. “Things are changing, and they’re leading that change.” Half the Picture plays like a cocktail party where everyone’s had a glass of wine and is ready to get real. Adrion bounces between interview clips as though the women are having a conversation. It’s not a screed – it’s fun and surprising, and Spheeris, a self-described “smart-ass punk attitude bitch” has the best zingers. They joke about macho meatheads challenging their authority on set and questions they’ve parried – Do you want a family? Are you willing to insert four scenes of naked breasts? Can you start a week after you give birth? (Answers: yes, yes and yes) – and in a lovely through-line, point to the other women in the documentary who inspired them to push forward. DuVernay applauds Prince-Bythewood for advising her to deal with on-set sexism in public so that everyone can see the offender grovel. Otherwise, notes DuVernay, “I would have lost control of the set.” The women trade stories about the tiny ways female directors get undermined even after they manage to land a job. Chris Hegedus sighs that after 40 years making Oscar-nominated docs with her husband and partner, DA Pennebaker, journalists still only want to interview him. Lucy Walker’s own Oscar campaign for her doc Waste Land was dinged by reporters who accused her of not directing it at all. American Psycho’s Mary Harron rolls her eyes at critics who assume her male editors and cinematographers “saved” her films. “I didn’t sit around doing nothing!” she groans. Brave’s Brenda Chapman opens up as much as she legally can about proving herself in the all-male meetings at Disney, only to have Pixar strip her from her passion project and attempt to ban her from speaking at the Academy Awards. And in a jaw-dropping anecdote, Patricia Riggen recounts how her producers on The 33, a drama about the Chilean miners, prioritised the schedule around pleasing the second unit AD – and when he squandered three weeks of filming, gave her three days to redo his unusable footage. “A lot of the women were pretty vulnerable in talking about their experience,” says Adrion. “We interviewed Patricia Riggen the day after the presidential election, so the whole crew was emotional wrecks. Everybody was wearing our heart on our sleeves.” In one of the film’s most raw segments, Me and You and Everyone We Know’s Miranda July fends off tears admitting that motherhood is currently crippling her career: “I wanted to be a director just as much as my husband [Beginners’ Mike Mills] did, so it’s also the first time in my life that I’ve had a real wrench in the plans.” Half the Picture is hunting for solutions. (Adrion notes that the EEOC is now overseen by attorney general Jeff Sessions, who’s no champion of equal rights.) Film festivals play a major part in amplifying new voices, especially Sundance, which premiered Half the Picture in January (and recently hired Kim Yutani as its new director of programming). “If you get into Sundance, that is the golden ticket, period,” says Adrion. “Our experience with this film has been kind of meta that way,” with her debut about how to fix filmmaking taking the same path her subjects described. In fact, it’s been too meta. Half the Picture includes a section where her directors explain that the crucial trade publications that make or break a movie are mostly written by a small group of male critics who are inclined to connect less to female-driven stories. Adrion inserted an image of one important critic’s review, and then heard he’d been assigned to review. “At a few of the Q&amp;As, men have said, ‘How do we be allies?’” says Adrion. Listening to these directors speak is a good first step. These smart, resolute women make their own argument for success. In 2018, we should all question the tough-guy stereotype of leadership. On, off and behind the screen, it’s time for GI Joe to retire. • Half the Picture premieres at Sundance London on 1 June. •This article was amended on 31 May to correct the surname of the director of Waste Land."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"animals-farmed/2018/may/31/animals-farmed-big-beef-salmon-safe-and-small-abattoirs","type":"article","sectionId":"animals-farmed","sectionName":"Animals farmed","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-31T13:52:57Z","webTitle":"Animals farmed: big beef, 'salmon-safe' and small abattoirs","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/animals-farmed/2018/may/31/animals-farmed-big-beef-salmon-safe-and-small-abattoirs","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/animals-farmed/2018/may/31/animals-farmed-big-beef-salmon-safe-and-small-abattoirs","fields":{"headline":"Animals farmed: big beef, 'salmon-safe' and small abattoirs","bodyText":"News from around the world It’s clear that the radical ideas of conservation agriculture are gaining traction everywhere – it’s incredibly exciting to watch. An article from Down to Earth looks at its spread in Malawi, while another discusses no-till in the US. In the US, one woman whose father is a conventional farmer has come to believe in a different way of farming, as detailed in this fantastic piece. Also from the US comes this fascinating story about the ‘salmon-safe’ label which means farms take care of their rivers and waterways. And, according to numerous periodicals, the China/US trade dispute could cut $2.2bn from hog trade this year. Elsewhere, in New Zealand 150,000 cows are to be culled with the aim of wiping out Mycoplasma bovis. And on the German website DW a scientist argues we’re not paying the correct cost of our food. “The worst is food that is produced conventionally from or by animal products … [which] should be about 10 percent higher priced than now,” said scientist Tobias Gaugler. News from the UK There is growing pressure from all sides for the government to address the collapse of our small abattoirs (down from 1900 in 1971 to 49 in 2017). The Sustainable Food Trust has produced a really excellent report on this. Interestingly the Countryside Alliance has now called on ministers to support the creation of more small abattoirs instead of banning live exports. It remains to be seen how animal welfare campaigners – who have been trying to get that ban for years – will respond. Imports of food produced using techniques banned in the UK will happen “over my dead body” said environment minister Michael Gove to an audience at Hay, according to Farmers Weekly. There will be no race to the bottom, he said: “We will succeed on the basis of consumers knowing that our food is of the highest quality and they can trace the journey from farm to fork and they can have absolute confidence that what they are buying is ethical and sustainable as well as being delicious and good value.” Highlights from the Guardian This week we revealed the arrival of intensive US-style farming in the UK, and named the supermarkets who were being supplied. The piece has already sparked a national discussion: Oliver Milman went to North Carolina, where pigs outnumber humans 36 to one in some counties, and spoke to the groups that are fighting back. We examined whether the international meat and drink companies are taking their social responsibilities seriously; the answer, according to the really fascinating new Coller Index, appears to be mainly “no”. Photographer Carolina Arantes talked to us about her experiences of shooting the million-dollar beef breeding industry in Brazil. And we covered the shocking undercover footage that revealed pigs being kicked and beaten on a UK farm. Quote of the month: “A nation that destroys its soils destroys itself.

Images of trussed-up women and imperious men. Recently though I’ve been wondering if perhaps they had things right when it comes to etiquette and dating. I’m currently in Oslo at the Freedom Forum, an annual conference where the world’s most engaging human rights advocates, artists, tech entrepreneurs and world leaders meet to share stories. Last night I was sitting in the hotel bar with two female film-makers. We were having a brilliant and enthralling conversation … with prosecco. The best kind of chat. At the table next to us was a man on a business trip. He wasn’t part of the festival, but the kind of boorish English man I hate meeting abroad. He leaned in and said: “What is this event then? Why is everyone wearing badges?” I knew immediately his question wasn’t one of genuine interest but rather an attempt at an in with us. One of the women I’m with politely explains what is happening. He replies: “Oh, that’s why I couldn’t get a room tonight!” His friend repeats, in case we missed it: “He couldn’t get a room tonight.” My level of interest in his problems with hotel booking websites is minimal. So I reply: “Actually we are in the middle of a work chat.” His friend thinks this is some kind of invitation and sidles over to our table: “So what is this thing then?” These guys know how to repeat a question, maybe they’ve been watching Jeremy Paxman. Slightly exasperated I repeat what the festival is and elaborate slightly, mentioning activists from Sudan before repeating: “Sorry we are just in the middle of work chat.” I’m annoyed at myself for apologising but I’m trying to stay polite. He looks irritated, as if he can’t understand why we wouldn’t want him there. The boorish friend starts offering drinks. NO WE DON’T WANT DRINKS DO NOT BRING YOUR DRINKS OVER HERE!!! “In my London residence I have a painting by a Sudanese artist, it says ‘Freedom’ underneath it,” he continues. Now the conversation has become all over the place, none of it makes any sense. I think he’s trying to tell me he is rich. I still don’t care , what I care about is the conversation I was having before he interrupted us. Boorish man and the art collector mean nothing to me (although it would be a great name for a detective duo). He still won’t leave – maybe the floor is too sticky? We tell him that if he is interested he should find the organiser of the festival at the bar. He didn’t. Eventually we had to call it a night because of the persistence of these men. They wouldn’t leave, so we had to. It comes down to consent. We didn’t invite those men to join us and we made that perfectly clear. Everything was met with such base entitlement. Bar screaming in his face that he should go procreate with himself I don’t know what more I could have done, and even that doesn’t always work. On a similar night in Soho a year ago, I was out with fellow comics Roisin Conaty and Jen Kirkman. Some men offered us drinks in a bar, we refused. They wouldn’t accept that. We tried every tactic – polite, firm, funny, angry; yet the men followed us from bar to bar. Eventually Jen flipped out, screamed in their faces and we nearly got arrested. One of the men told us his girlfriend had died in the bath and that we were horrible women. More emotionally manipulative than a Pixar film. It’s no wonder society has a problem with consent – it starts in bars, and clubs, in apparently innocent meetings where men just won’t take no for an answer. This isn’t a case of flirty persistence but an absolute demand to have the attention and energy of women. If a man can’t pick up social signals in a bar, what hope is there for the bedroom? I shared the Oslo incident on Twitter and had so many other women tell me their stories. One said that after explaining she was married a persistent man had said: “Why the hell are you out then? If you don’t want men to talk to you.” Her attention was his divine right. In Victorian times if a young woman saw a gentleman friend, she would have to take the initiative and offer her hand. The gentleman had to wait for the lady to recognise him before lifting his hat – using the hand farthest from her. These days men don’t really wear hats unless they want to appear interesting or not bald. However, letting the woman take the initiative is a great first step. Ask if they mind you joining the table. If they say no or the sentence begins with “Actually …” then take the hint. Better still wait for an invite from them. That way you can be certain that your company is wanted. According to Victorian etiquette, if a gentleman was calling he would bring his hat and riding whip to indicate that he didn’t intend to stay long. The gentleman would keep his hat in his hand. Sure if we did that now most people would assume it was some weird cosplay, but I think we can translate. If you have invited yourself over to a table maybe don’t take your coat off and start ordering beers until a member of the group has said: “Join us.” How long has it been this way? Maybe it is getting worse? Now “incels” have appeared, pushing the old idea that women “owe” men sex. I refuse to believe that women need to adjust their behaviour to accommodate men with rampant horniness and no boundaries. We know where that ends up … Gilead. So perhaps the way forward is to start educating the next generation of men – with a pinch of Victorian etiquette thrown in. • Tiff Stevenson is a standup comedian.

The performance was a serious disappointment, wonderfully played – as you would expect, but all on the surface and with little interpretative depth. What a change the intervening 16 years have wrought. Here, in the first of two London concerts marking Rattle’s departure from Berlin, was a performance for the ages of that same Bruckner symphony. It showed how much Rattle has come to terms with Bruckner during his Berlin years but, above all, it displayed the deep musical rapport between players and conductor that has matured during his long tenure in the German capital. Rattle got the Berlin job in part because of his commitment to new music. True to his lights, both of this week’s farewell concerts open with UK premieres. This first unveiled Hans Abrahamsen’s Three Pieces for Orchestra of 2014-17, three vivid and contrasting miniatures, by turns high energy, icily still and, the incomparable Berlin double basses to the fore, sighing. Back in 2002, Rattle performed the familiar three-movement torso of Bruckner’s ninth. Since then, he has embraced (and recorded) the 1986 completion (by Nicola Samale and a quartet of scholars) of the finale that Bruckner left in sketch form when he died in 1896, and it was this version which they performed now. At the very start it felt as if Rattle was still pushing the musical argument a touch too fast to allow for Bruckner’s characteristic uncertainties, but this doubt soon passed because of the sheer depth and range of expression, often in the tiniest details of phrasing and interplay, that marked this magisterial performance. With such an orchestra, the development sections were special glories but the whole thing was peerlessly played. Traditionalists will feel a pang that the symphony no longer ends with the hard-won serenity of the close of the adagio, with its unanswered question hanging in the air. But the blazing conclusion of the finale is movingly and authentically Brucknerian.

Here, she is at the centre of a love triangle between cousins Palamon and Arcite. Running at a tight two hours 15 minutes, this tragicomedy still squeezes in a lot of Shakespearean tropes: a tyrant king, a last-minute death, and a young woman driven to madness by love. Commonly attributed to both Shakespeare and John Fletcher, the source material is erratic at best, but Barrie Rutter’s direction keeps the play together. Coupled with Jessica Worrall’s design, which leaves the grass-covered stage looking like an enchanted forest and the characters leaping between jewel-toned block colours and fringed dance costumes, the production is both lighthearted and light on its feet, with choreographer Ewan Wardrop’s work particularly standing out. The production is played for laughs, but the jokes don’t always land. Francesca Mills has great comic timing as the jailer’s daughter, as do Paul Stocker and Bryan Dick when they bounce off each other as Palamon and Arcite. However, individually it’s hard to care about either of them, which leaves the climax distinctly lacking in tension, despite the imaginatively staged fight scene. Taking place on a balcony crowded with musicians and half the cast, Emilia is left on the vast stage, looking lonely and uncertain in a play that rarely suggests her admiration for her suitors’ exploits ever crosses into love. The emphasis on the comedy also means that the tragic aspects fall by the wayside, with Emilia’s quandary about her suitors and Arcite’s dying declaration holding little dramatic weight. Two Noble Kinsmen is performed rarely, and this production, while fun, makes only a mixed case for this to change. At Shakespeare’s Globe, London, until 30 June.

On Wednesday it responded to a disgruntled passenger who had tweeted an image of a departures board showing cancellations. Thameslink’s social media team replied: “Very sorry Kevin. Appreciate at the moment the service is less Ferrero Rocher and more Poundland cooking chocolate.” Poundland’s retail director, Austin Cooke, tweeted that Thameslink had “no right to use our name to describe poor service”. He said Poundland had served 8 million shoppers last week and had a “pretty good idea about what great customer service is”. “If you don’t want to hear from our extremely twitchy legal team, we suggest you remove your tweet,” Cooke said in a message addressed to Charles Horton, the chief executive of Thamelink’s parent company, Govia Thameslink Railway (GTR). Thameslink deleted its original message and sent another tweet that read: “Very sorry team for using your name here. I have removed the offending tweet.” GTR services have been plagued by disruption since redrawn timetable was introduced. On Wednesday more than 450 Govia Thameslink Railway trains – 13% of the total – were either cancelled or at least half an hour late. On some of its routes as many as half of all trains were cancelled. This week MPs and rail passenger groups demanded “emergency measures” from the Department for Transport to end the disruption Thameslink services in and out of London over the past 10 days. Crispin Blunt, the Conservative MP for Reigate, said on Wednesday: “It is clear that neither GTR nor Network Rail were sufficiently resourced or funded to manage such a huge operation.” In a letter to MPs who had raised concerns, the transport secretary, Chris Grayling, claimed the rail industry had “failed the passengers it serves”. He wrote that the new timetable had been finalised “much too late to permit adequate logistical planning” due to delayed Network Rail infrastructure works."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"higher-education-network/2018/jun/01/academics-candidates-outstanding-application-recruitment","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-01T06:30:42Z","webTitle":"I struggle to hire academics, because candidates are too good | Anonymous academic","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/2018/jun/01/academics-candidates-outstanding-application-recruitment","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/higher-education-network/2018/jun/01/academics-candidates-outstanding-application-recruitment","fields":{"headline":"I struggle when hiring academics – because the candidates are too good","bodyText":"Some employers complain about not having enough good candidates to fill roles. I envy them. Imagine working in an industry where entry-level jobs require “world-leading” research records, where far more people are graduating from PhD programmes than the academy will ever employ. The problem is that nearly everyone on the long list for your new permanent lectureship is amazing. How on earth do you choose between them? This might be the case not even just for applications to permanent lectureships. It might be for just a two or three-year contract, or even maternity cover or a 10-month teaching fellowship. Whatever it is, your candidates have been diligently preparing themselves for their whole careers. They’ve gained teaching and admin experience, published books and papers (and planned the next ones), thought about impact and outreach, and earned an impressive set of references and student feedback in addition to their outstanding formal qualifications. They’ve probably not been paid for all of this work. They’ve been juggling their considerable achievements with part-time (or sometimes even full-time) jobs outside academia, or they’ve been relying on financial support from a parent or partner. And they’ve still found time to write a decent application for your post, which we all know takes days. Resourcefulness, persistence, creativity, time management – essential qualities in a potential hire! How lucky the academy is. Whittle your 15 down to five and nearly everyone you see on interview day will be better than you were at their career stage. Some will be better than you are now. Whenever I attend job presentations at my own institution, I feel ashamed to have a permanent post. Whomever you hire will be a credit to your institution. With that in mind, why do you have to pick the best one? Surely any hiring process should be aimed solely at retaining the best candidate. But best is a meaningless word when you have five people this good. We have an impossible decision to make. They’re all good: so who is the most exceptional overachiever? I’ve sat in many discussions and heard this kind of question. The problem with them is that they encourage the hiring of self-martyring researchers, people habituated to toxic and even harmful levels of overwork. Not every individual appointed as a result of these questions necessarily comes with all that baggage, of course, but the underlying attitude makes for an unhealthy environment. Lately, I’ve been wondering what would happen if we instead asked: who needs this job the most? Who has been on temporary contracts for the longest? Whose expertise is so specific to our needs that they have less chance of another interview elsewhere? Whose background – age, race, ability, or health – makes it less likely that more bigoted panels will pick them up? Before you speak of charity, remember what I said earlier: they’re all amazing. Whomever you hire will have exceeded the overbearing demands laid on them by the 21st-century academy. The second best research excellence framework plan will still do way more for your department’s submission than many of your current colleagues’.But what if the candidate who is less invested in current frameworks is better at thinking beyond them? When the government changes policy in the future, might they be more adaptable? It could turn out that the candidate who is most in need is also the top-ranked by traditional measures. I’ve been present for one such happy collision of priorities, but it is far from guaranteed. And besides, does your institution really deserve the best hire? Is it planning to treat them like the best employee? Will it give them proper mentoring? Appropriate academic freedoms and teaching resources? Reasonable work-life balance? A decent pension? Alongside those questions, consider these: has your institution contributed to the toxic state of the early career? Has it accepted anybody on to a PhD programme on the false premise that the qualification is vocational? Employed anybody on a zero-hours contract? Hired anybody to teach through the academic year and then left them without an income over the summer? Overloaded anybody with teaching and then refused to consider them for permanent work because they have no monograph? In your department, is it more important to be productive than kind? You don’t deserve the best. You deserve a chance to fix the broken system. Lift someone amazing out of the academic precariat, and watch them soar.

Now a “successful hedge fund with a passion for literature” is offering wannabe novelists the chance to turn literature itself into the nine to five, by offering a salary to its writers. De Montfort Literature, a new publishing company that is part of London hedge fund De Montfort Capital, is offering a £24,000 starting salary to writers who pass its selection process, which includes an algorithm that is “designed to identify career novelists”, psychometric tests and interviews. With up to 10 places initially available, De Montfort will also offer mentors and editors to provide advice and support, as well as designing, promoting and publishing the work. Authors would receive 50% of profits. Founder and author Jonathan de Montfort said that “holding down a full-time job is not conducive to writing fiction. So, it occurred to me, if we pay a salary that allows writing to become a full-time occupation, then we should free up lots of talented authors.” He added: “The traditional publishing models for fiction writers are littered with obstacles. Securing a literary agent is a lottery, and self-publishing is costly and time-consuming. These routes also lend themselves to the affluent, who can afford mentoring, education, copy editors and proof readers. Our model is more accessible and de-risks the process.” De Montfort acknowledged that his proposed method of finding authors using tests and an algorithm may sound “a little sinister” to some, but said he believed it was fairer than traditional publishing methods. “The algorithm is oblivious to your background, culture, wealth, race or gender. There’s no bias – it only cares that you have what it takes to be a top-selling novelist.” The publisher’s website says that while traditional publishers “can pick and choose the best manuscripts they have without having to pay anything for them”, writers “have to do all the work, take all the risk and then hope their manuscript gets accepted. De Montfort Literature is backed by a hedge fund, so it has more money at its disposal to invest in authors”. “I really believe there are lots of great authors out there frustrated by the existing routes to market,” said De Montfort. “We are offering a genuine alternative. We are prepared to invest in authors over a long period of time – five to 10 years, if necessary – with our expectation of return at the end of that period, once they become established.” The Society of Authors’ director Nicola Solomon said the writers’ organisation was “always happy to see new publishing models that give choice to authors. A salary of £24,000 a year for writing novels would probably be attractive to any new writer and is more than the advances that many would receive in traditional publishing.” But she expressed concern about aspects of the company, including De Montfort’s intention to share copyright with an author, to claim copyright in “ideas”, not just the work, as well as the requirement for an author not to write for another publisher for two years after leaving De Montfort. She saidDe Montfort had been in touch with the society about working with the organisation to offer better terms and conditions. “I am hopeful that we can help them improve the model,” said Solomon. “De Montfort Literature is risking capital on this project and obviously we want to see a return,” the hedge-fund founder said. “My ambition is to build a stable of bestselling novelists. We will not achieve this by exploiting authors. It is a partnership and we want to make it work for everyone involved.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/jun/01/tax-reporting-exemption-for-1498-private-companies-could-be-torn-up","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-31T18:00:27Z","webTitle":"Tax reporting exemption for 1,498 private companies could be torn up","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/jun/01/tax-reporting-exemption-for-1498-private-companies-could-be-torn-up","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/jun/01/tax-reporting-exemption-for-1498-private-companies-could-be-torn-up","fields":{"headline":"Tax reporting exemption for 1,498 private companies could be torn up","bodyText":"A secret list of private companies that has enjoyed a tax reporting exemption since 1995, under a deal done by the Keating government during a legislative overhaul, could finally be torn up. Labor has agreed to support a Greens push to abolish a unique exemption for 1,498 private companies associated with Australia’s business elite that has allowed the companies to avoid sharing their financial reports with the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (Asic). The private companies have been enjoying the historical secrecy provision since 1995 when they were “grandfathered” by the Keating government during a legislative overhaul. That grandfathering arrangement was only intended to be temporary and subject to a review in a few years, but it was cancelled by the Howard Government shortly after its election victory in 1996 and the companies have enjoyed the tax reporting exemption ever since. In 2015, Guardian Australia revealed the names of the 1,498 private companies and the list was a who’s who of corporate Australia, including private companies associated with the Myer family, the Pratt family’s Visy Industries, media proprietor John B. Fairfax, chicken producer Inghams, the Moran Health Care Group, and construction giant Grocon. Some companies on the list have ceased to exist or become dormant, including one of Malcolm Turnbull’s former companies, Allcorp Property Services, through which he ran a cleaning business with the late Neville Wran. Being on the list does not imply a company has done anything wrong, but it does mean the company is not subject to the same requirements to file information as other similar firms. Now Labor has agreed – for the first time – to support a Greens amendment to a private senator’s bill that will abolish the unique exemption. Labor says it will use the last fortnight of parliament before this year’s winter break – between 18 June to 28 June – to bring the bill on for debate in the senate. The bill in question was introduced by former Labor senator Katy Gallagher, and the amendment was moved by Greens senator Peter Whish-Wilson. Whish-Wilson’s amendment is similar to an amendment pushed by former Australian Motoring Enthusiast Party senator Ricky Muir in 2015, which failed to pass the senate at the time but which was supported by Labor. Labor’s decision to back the Greens’ new amendment will revive interest in the list of specially exempted private companies. For the bill to pass the senate it will need support from four other cross benchers, and it will then go to the House of Representatives where 76 votes will be required to suspend standing orders to bring the bill on for debate. The government controls the House, but Labor hopes the government will be open to the idea after Coalition MPs’ contribution to this week’s corporate tax avoidance report. “We know Australians want more tax transparency and will support bringing almost 1,500 large companies into the Asic financial reporting regime,” shadow assistant treasurer Andrew Leigh told Guardian Australia. “It was the Gillard government five years ago that passed laws boosting tax transparency. We voted for this financial reporting change last time it appeared, unlike the Liberals and the Greens.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/may/31/brexit-northern-irish-police-funds-recruitment-protect-border","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-31T10:30:17Z","webTitle":"Brexit: Northern Irish police ask for more funds to protect border","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/may/31/brexit-northern-irish-police-funds-recruitment-protect-border","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/may/31/brexit-northern-irish-police-funds-recruitment-protect-border","fields":{"headline":"Brexit: Northern Irish police ask for more funds to protect border","bodyText":"Up to 500 officers would need to be recruited and decommissioned police stations reopened to protect the post-Brexit border on the island of Ireland. Rank and file police warned on Thursday that the 6,621-member Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) was not adequately staffed to enforce even a soft frontier after the UK exits the European Union next year. After Brexit the 300-plus mile frontier from the north-west Atlantic shoreline to the Irish Sea in the east will be the UK’s only land border with an EU state. The Police Federation for Northern Ireland also predicted it was “reasonable to assume” that any officers deployed to monitor the post-Brexit border would become “terrorist targets” from the anti-ceasefire, hardline, dissident republican factions. At the federation’s annual conference outside Belfast on Thursday, its chair called on the government to immediately increase the PSNI’s budget to cope with the effect of Brexit. Referring to the Troubles, when many B-roads spanning the border were closed and key routes blocked by militarised checkpoints, Mark Lindsay said: “We are painfully aware that even when we had 13,500 officers, supported by 26,000 soldiers, it proved a daily challenge to police the border. “So, if we were stretched in the 70s, 80s and 90s, is it not fair to say that we will be well and truly incapable of performing the task with officer numbers of 6,621, or a sixth of what we had then?” “By this time next year – despite talk of a two-year transition period – the border will assume greater importance. We don’t possess the numbers, the security apparatus or specialist resources for increased counter-terrorist search and support duties along the border.” On planned station closures, Lindsay said “additional real estate will need to be retained” if the government was serious about deploying the PSNI, particularly to protect UK border and customs staff on any new Brexit frontier. “I would anticipate that stations previously earmarked for closure will now need to be retained,” he added. In a speech to 100 officers, Lindsay repeated returned to the theme of the PSNI facing attack despite the peace process. He said one way the the service had come under attack was in the debate about the legacy of the Troubles and how to deal with thousands of unsolved crimes connected to the conflict. Lindsay said 302 police officers had been murdered and thousands injured during the Troubles, adding that the federation would never accept any plan for a general amnesty for all those responsible for murder and mayhem. “Let me be clear: this organisation is totally opposed to any legislation which proposed an amnesty for any crime,” he said. “That’s any crime, whether committed by a police officer or terrorist from any side of the divide.” Referring to officers murdered during the Troubles, Lindsay said: “Our colleagues did what was right. They must not be treated the same as the people who pulled the trigger or planted the bomb. “They saved tens of thousands of lives while terrorist groupings wrought havoc and misery. It would be intolerable and massively offensive if their good names were to be used in the same breath as the killers who sought ‘parity of esteem’ by using a warped parity of misery and pain.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2018/may/31/adrift-review-shipshape-shailene-woodley-keeps-survival-drama-buoyant","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-31T13:00:20Z","webTitle":"Adrift review – shipshape Shailene Woodley keeps survival drama buoyant","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/may/31/adrift-review-shipshape-shailene-woodley-keeps-survival-drama-buoyant","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/may/31/adrift-review-shipshape-shailene-woodley-keeps-survival-drama-buoyant","fields":{"headline":"Adrift review – shipshape Shailene Woodley keeps survival drama buoyant","bodyText":"Call her Tami. Some years ago (never mind when in the 1980s precisely) having little or no money in her purse, and nothing particular to interest her in San Diego, she thought she would sail about a little and see the watery part of the world. And does she have a story for you! Tami is played by Shailene Woodley, one of the producers of Baltasar Kormákur’s effective lost-at-sea survival drama Adrift. Woodley is in almost every shot of this based-on-a-true-story film. She’s a free spirit falling in love with fellow far-from-home drifter Richard (Sam Claflin) on the way up, and holding on for dear life before nature’s violent indifference on the way down. Adrift’s screenplay moves back and forth in waves, so we open in medias mess; the fancy yacht she and Richard were hired to sail from Tahiti to California has been almost completely destroyed and is meandering somewhere in the Pacific. We learn how our two nautical heroes ended up in such a predicament just in time for the well-plotted twin climax. The interlaced plotting is quite clever, and those story smarts are mirrored in Kormákur’s shooting style. When most of your movie is set on a very small boat you’ve got to get creative, and his camera is constantly plunging overboard or framing Woodley and Claflin in peculiar ways. The storm sequence is terrifying to the point that my head soon throbbed, and I almost became nauseous. I hope the effects team will take this as a compliment. But it wasn’t just due to the effects. The high seas terror had such impact because, by this point, we’ve grown to really care for Tami and Richard. Their French Polynesian courtship isn’t revolutionary film-making, but it is sweet and sincere. Kormákur lets the far-flung setting and a particularly romantic Tom Waits cover do a lot of heavy lifting, and one can’t ignore that Woodley and Claflin, who are rarely seen in anything other than swimwear, are quite appealing frolicking in the surf or smooching in the fo’c’sle. Then there are the moments of great peril, in which horrifying gashes are revealed, and the audience all inhales through their teeth as one. (This phenomenon, for which I don’t think there is a proper name, happened at least three times during the New York mixed press and public screening.) Adrift works best when we’re watching smart people confront their next obstacle before time runs out, be it a tripped-up rudder or decreasing water supply. A bad injury keeps Richard on his back, so Tami is the one left to do all the hard work as they hope to steer their nearly collapsed vessel to Hawaii. Adrift doesn’t have quite the existential gut-punch of JC Chandor’s similar All Is Lost or the recent Cannes debut Arctic , but what it lacks in the department of pure howling cinema, it makes up for with the emotion of its central relationship. Woodley, whom I’ve never considered a great thespian, pushes herself to the limit, and runs the gamut from traumatised to triumphant. It is leagues ahead of anything she’s done before. The row of sobbing teen girls behind me suggests this might even be a hit. I, for one, am now more committed than ever to travelling by rail. Adrift is out in the US on 1 June and in the UK on 29 June"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"football/2018/may/31/football-transfer-rumours-marko-arnautovic-to-manchester-united","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-31T07:30:57Z","webTitle":"Football transfer rumours: Marko Arnautovic to Manchester United?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/may/31/football-transfer-rumours-marko-arnautovic-to-manchester-united","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/may/31/football-transfer-rumours-marko-arnautovic-to-manchester-united","fields":{"headline":"Football transfer rumours: Marko Arnautovic to Manchester United?","bodyText":"José Mourinho was spotted watching this week’s friendly between Russia and Austria, and that immediately set tongues wagging about which player, in particular, he was interested in. Since Kevin Wimmer didn’t start and has just agreed to flee Stoke for Hannover, anyway, the obvious answer is David Alaba, who is gifted and versatile enough to solve at least three of Manchester United’s problem positions. But the word from more enlightened sources is that Mourinho was, in fact, running the rule of Marko Arnautovic, whose strength and spikiness makes him more palatable to Mourinho than callow youths such as Marcus Rashford and Anthony Martial. West Ham’s owners are not keen to sell Arnautovic but it is believed that they would be prepared to let him go in return for around £50m and the promise of a few thousand more followers on twitter. On the other hand, maybe Mourinho wasn’t watching any player in particular and was instead doing some homework before he takes up his role as an analyst for Russian television during the World Cup. The Portuguese knows his performances on the screen are in turn going to be analysed far and wide and has apparently decided that if he’s going to move into punditry, then he’s going to do it properly. He’ll be damned if he lets the likes of Chris Sutton beat him in the vinegary naysayer stakes. Meanwhile, Tottenham Hotspur are planning to offer a route back into the Premier League for Florian Thauvin, the French winger who is remembered by Newcastle United fans solely because he occasionally wore a tuxedo to matches during a stint at St James’ Park. Since heading back to Marseille Thauvin has reminded folks that he is, in fact, a classy player as well as a snappy dresser, and Mauricio Pochettino likes what he sees. You never know, Thauvin could become the new Moussa Sissoko. You will have heard by now that Chelsea, meanwhile, are keen on Robert Lewandowski and Liverpool want Lyon’s Nabil Fekir. You may also be aware, somehow, that Liverpool are on the look out for a new goalkeeper. Roma have let it be known that they would have to fork out a world record fee to get Alisson, especially as Chelsea have also joined the chase. That is because Thibaut Courtois is said to be edging towards Atletico Madrid. If Liverpool put two and two together they may save themselves some money - not much, mind - and bag Atletico’s current custodian of the sticks, Jan Oblak. Barcelona’s Jasper Cillessen is also said to be on their radar. Fresh from pledging his future to Huddersfield Town, David Wagner is rumoured to be keen to liberate Xherdan Shaqiri from Stoke. Rafael Benítez, meanwhile, fancies taking Joe Allen to Newcastle. Everton are plotting a swoop for Patrick van Aanholt just to troll Sam Allardyce, who worked happily with the player at Sunderland and Crystal Palace but will never get the chance to do so at Everton. The Goodison Park outfit also want William Carvalho, who has been linked with English clubs for each of the last 437 transfer windows. Aston Villa are hoping to replace John Terry with Tobias Pachonik, a German who is available for free after letting his contract run down at the Italian second-tier side Carpi. And finally, Brazil legend Ronaldo is contemplating the purchase of the Spanish side Real Valladolid, which is said to be available for less than the £26m that Spurs once paid for Roberto Soldado."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"us-news/2018/jun/05/trump-prison-reform-first-step-act-tension","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-05T10:00:41Z","webTitle":"Trump's prison reform: Republicans on side but some progressives hold out","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jun/05/trump-prison-reform-first-step-act-tension","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/jun/05/trump-prison-reform-first-step-act-tension","fields":{"headline":"Trump's prison reform: Republicans on side but some progressives hold out","bodyText":"In the increasingly partisan realm of American politics, criminal justice reform stands practically alone as the magical issue on which most of the right and left can still agree. It’s a political movement that’s managed to put the rightwing Koch Brothers in league with the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU). And where the libertarian senator Rand Paul can find common cause with the California Democrat Kamala Harris. Even Donald Trump, who ran a campaign soaked in the rhetoric of “tough on crime” and delivered an inaugural address that warned against encroaching waves of “American carnage”, found something to like in the politics of reform. Trump is throwing his support behind a prison reform bill that improves some conditions for inmates and provides incentives to get involved in programs that reduce the risk of recidivism after release. The bill passed easily in the House last month, earning up votes from virtually all Republican members, and more than two-thirds of Democrats. It’s also earned the stamp of approval from conservative groups like the Charles Koch Institute and the Faith and Freedom Coalition. But this Trump-backed legislation, nicknamed the First Step Act, has also caused a fracture among progressive reformers. Some, like the DNC co-chairman Keith Ellison, have championed the legislation as an imperfect step forward while others, such as former attorney general Eric Holder, see it as a missed opportunity to do more. ‘Say yes where we agree’ The scale of the problem, and the political and legislative challenges involved, is evident from a cursory glance at the numbers. The US incarcerates more citizens per capita than any nation on earth. As of 2015, the US still had an incarceration rate about six times that of China, and 12 times that of Sweden. Numerous studies have shown that incarceration in the US rarely succeeds at rehabilitation, and in many cases destabilizes inmates’ lives by making them less employable, dissolving family bonds, and damaging their mental and emotional health. These poor human outcomes, and the exorbitant cost – one study by the Prison Policy Institute recent pegged it at $183bn a year – have driven the cross-party push to decarcerate in the US. It’s also a cause that has caught on in pop culture attracting the attention of entertainers like John Legend and Jay-Z. Last week even saw Kim Kardashian West discussing prison and sentencing reform with the president in the Oval Office. But none of that has been enough to get any federal reform legislation off the ground, in part because of all the financial interests – which scholars have termed the prison industrial complex – tied up in keeping people behind bars. Companies who provide facilities, food, healthcare, even telephone services – which bring in more than $1bn annually from prisons and jails alone – have all sought to protect those markets with lobbying on Capitol Hill. So for some advocates, there are plenty of reasons to take a win where they get it. “When we started out we wanted to see one bill that would fix the entire criminal justice system,” said Jessica Jackson-Sloan, the policy director for reform advocacy group Cut50. “After years of fighting over that it’s become clear that that’s not going to happen. We should say yes where we agree – and right now we agree on prison reform.” Jackson-Sloan says the bill is imperfect, but says it would immediately release 4,000 federal prisoners, expand compassionate release of sick and elderly inmates and invest tens of millions in re-entry programs. Jackson-Sloan, who worked with Jared Kushner on the legislation, said the bill’s detractors were failing to recognize the “new political reality” reformers are facing in a Trump presidency. “There is a constant tension in legislating, where some people argue that it’s better to take half a loaf and then come back for the rest,” said Michael Steel, a former top aide to the retired House speaker John Boehner. Jackson-Sloan, along with other prominent reform groups like Families Against Mandatory Minimums and the Equal Justice Initiative, have all come out on that side of the coin. ‘Sloppy and dangerous’ Missing from this piece of legislation is the crucial issue of sentencing reform – as distinct from prison reform. While prison reform deals with how people who are already incarcerated are treated and may give them some faster pathways out, sentencing reform is the piece of the puzzle that dictates how many new people are going into prison – and for how long. Most experts say the high US rate of incarceration is a result of the dramatic increases to sentencing length that took place after crime waves in the 1970s and 80s. However, that’s an issue that Republicans, who control both houses of Congress and the White House, are less sold on. Bipartisan Senate legislation that would have addressed prison and sentencing reform failed in 2016, after Trump’s election put the issue on the back burner. But the logic of doing the easier one first is not as straightforward as it sounds, Steel points out. “We tend to do big pieces of legislation on these big topics very rarely, so if you don’t get as much as you can, or you don’t get what you actually want, you may lose the opportunity to make any further progress for a decade or a generation,” he said. That was the argument made by Holder in an Washington Post op-ed opposing the legislation. “By choosing a tepid approach, the prison bill abandons years of work and risks making it harder for Congress to advance more serious legislation in the future,” Holder wrote. Todd Cox, policy director at the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, called the rapid pace of the law “sloppy and dangerous”, noting that there had been no hearings or floor debate on the bill, nor any budget scoring or analysis of the bill’s social impacts. Joining Cox and Holder in opposition are the ACLU as well are Democratic senators Cory Booker, Dick Durbin and Harris, who said in a joint statement that the bill would mark “a step backward from our shared goal of ending America’s mass incarceration crisis”. Some of that may have as much to to with optics or with the upcoming midterm elections as any specific grievance with the bill, Steel said. “I think that there are definitely progressive groups that don’t want to let Trump have a win on anything. There are also probably progressive groups that think that the House is going to flip this year.” If Democrats take control of the House, they could fashion something more robust. In the end, though, it may be splits among Republicans, rather than Democrats or progressives that hamstring First Step. In the Senate, all roads for the legislation pass through the judiciary chairman, Chuck Grassley. In yet another irony, this senior Republican goes against many in his party by believing firmly that sentencing reform will be a necessary component for any bill to advance past his committee. “This is necessary for practical as well as political reasons,” Grassley said in a speech last week. “First of all, it’s the right thing to do.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2018/may/31/muslim-council-calls-for-inquiry-into-conservative-party-islamophobia","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-31T17:39:07Z","webTitle":"Conservatives under fire for failing to tackle party's Islamophobia","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/may/31/muslim-council-calls-for-inquiry-into-conservative-party-islamophobia","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/may/31/muslim-council-calls-for-inquiry-into-conservative-party-islamophobia","fields":{"headline":"Conservatives under fire for failing to tackle party's Islamophobia","bodyText":"The Conservatives have been accused of failing to take the issue of Islamophobia seriously by the Muslim Council of Britain (MCB), which is calling for an independent inquiry into a problem it said had “poisoned” sections of the party. Conservative party officials insisted they were treating the issue seriously, but the MCB cited nine cases of anti-Islam sentiment from Tory politicians and candidates since April, calling it “the tip of the iceberg”. Sayeeda Warsi, the party’s former chair, said she had spent more than two years trying and failing to get her successors and Theresa May to engage with the problem, and warned that the Tories faced a wider institutional problem of Islamophobia. Labour, which has faced its own recent controversy over antisemitism, said the Conservatives had shown a “systematic leadership failure” on the issue. A letter to the Tory party chair, Brandon Lewis, from the head of the MCB, Harun Khan, called for a “genuinely independent inquiry”. He listed two months of incidents involving members, including one who shared a message which called Muslims “parasites” and another who posted a photo of bacon hanging from a door handle with the caption “protect your house from terrorism”. Khan questioned why no action had been taken against Bob Blackman, the Harrow East MP, after he re-tweeted an anti-Islam message from the hard-right activist Tommy Robinson, and hosted a hardline Hindu nationalist, Tapan Ghosh, in parliament. Blackman said he accidentally re-tweeted the Robinson post and had not known in advance that Ghosh was being invited to last October’s event. Warsi, now a Tory peer, said she backed the MCB’s call, adding that it was “a shame” that it could potentially require such a public rebuke for the Conservatives to start treating the subject with proper seriousness. “What I would like to see is, first of all, people within the party stopping denying this is an issue and then starting to acknowledge the extent of the issue, and then setting out a clear pathway of how we’re going to deal with it,” she told Sky News. Warsi said she had raised the problem with “successive chairmen” and had written personally to May to seek action. She said: “Each time it kind of seems we’ve said, ‘Yes, we take these issues very seriously’ and then shrugged our shoulders and moved on.” She said the problem went beyond the actions of a few candidates, saying the party must also look at the “terrible Islamophobic, anti-Muslim campaign” run in 2016 when Zac Goldsmith stood for London mayor against Labour’s Sadiq Khan. The MCB letter also cited Goldsmith’s campaign as evidence of a wider problem in the Conservatives with “dog whistle anti-Muslim racism”. Labour MP Rupa Huq said the cumulative record of the Conservatives pointed to “the very definition of institutional racism - not merely bad apples, but a systematic leadership failure to address both personal prejudice and systemic unfairness”. She said: “The Tories’ failure on Islamophobia is desperately disappointing. But for Britain’s Muslims it’s worse than that. If the people who claim to be leading this country are shirking their responsibility to protect all the communities living here, it sends an appalling message. It makes racists inside and outside their party think they can get away with it.” Huq said she felt there had been “a glaring difference between how Labour is responding to antisemitism and how the Tories have reacted to this”, saying Jeremy Corbyn and Labour officials had taken notably more action. A number of Muslim Conservative party members told the Guardian that they felt the issue had been marginalised, with one saying his reaction to the MCB letter was: “How refreshing - this is something that all Muslim Conservatives are feeling.” Khan’s letter to Lewis called for an independent inquiry into Islamophobia among not just Tory members but also the party’s structures and campaigns. The MCB is pushing for the publication of a list of incidents where action has been taken, the launch of an education programme and a public commitment to tackle bigotry. In response to the letter, a Conservative spokesman said: “We take all such incidents seriously, which is why we have suspended all those who have behaved inappropriately and launched immediate investigations.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/may/31/centrelink-call-waiting-times-blow-out-for-jobs-and-family-lines","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-31T08:35:20Z","webTitle":"Centrelink call waiting times blow out for jobs and family lines","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/may/31/centrelink-call-waiting-times-blow-out-for-jobs-and-family-lines","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/may/31/centrelink-call-waiting-times-blow-out-for-jobs-and-family-lines","fields":{"headline":"Centrelink call waiting times blow out for jobs and family lines","bodyText":"The waiting times for several key Centrelink phone lines have blown out, although the number of busy signals has dropped dramatically, new figures show. Data on the Centrelink call centre was provided to Senate estimates late on Thursday, showing its performance between July last year and the end of March. It shows 36.3 million people received a busy signal. If the trend holds, the department estimates about 45m busy signals by the end of the financial year, 10m fewer than the year before. The human services department secretary, Renee Leon, said the problems were being addressed. “I’m not declaring ‘mission accomplished’ yet but we are saying we’re seeing a positive trend in the right direction,” Leon told Senate estimates on Thursday. Sign up to receive the top stories in Australia every day at noon The total average wait time across all Centrelink lines remained largely static, compared to roughly the same period the year before. The average wait time for Centrelink’s phone lines was 15 minutes and 56 seconds between July last year and the end of March, compared with 15 minutes and 58 seconds between July 2016 and the end of April 2017. But the wait times blew out on a number of Centrelink’s phone lines. The average wait was up by two minutes on the employment services line, and five minutes for the family and parenting, older Australians, and youth and students lines. Wait times were cut significantly for the disabilities, sickness and carers line and the participation line. Both lines saw a five-minute drop in average wait times. More than 4m calls were abandoned. The federal government has announced several measures designed to address problems with the Centrelink call centre. It paid a US consultant $430,000 to review the system, and estimates heard that one of his key recommendations was to reduce the dizzying complexity of the system, largely by reducing the number of separate business lines. Software to block automatic dialling apps is being used, and the government brought in 250 Serco contractors to work in the call centre, a move that prompted a furious response from unions and Labor. The Coalition is also seeking to contract another 1,000 staff to work in the call centre. But the opposition spokeswoman on human services, Linda Burney, has pointed to recent staff cuts to the human services department, which she said would make contacting and accessing Centrelink more difficult. “Ask any Australian who has had to contact Centrelink, and they will tell you their own personal nightmare,” Burney said. “We have heard stories of people waiting hours just to speak to someone at Centrelink. “The truth is Centrelink is understaffed and under-resourced, and staff lack support.” Greens senator Rachel Siewert said she welcomed the cuts to busy signals, but said the number was still far too high. “At the end of those busy signals were exasperated members of the community trying to get through for support,” Siewert said. “Let’s be clear, there are still 36,360,094 busy signals this year to date. “In addition wait times are still too long. People should not be waiting on average over 15 minutes for someone to answer. The wait times on some lines are over half an hour. Across the board that is just too high and on some lines those call wait times have actually increased.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/live/2018/may/31/market-rebound-italian-fears-ease-business-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-31T20:19:11Z","webTitle":"World leaders hit back at Trump over 'totally unacceptable' tariffs – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2018/may/31/market-rebound-italian-fears-ease-business-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/live/2018/may/31/market-rebound-italian-fears-ease-business-live","fields":{"headline":"World leaders hit back at Trump over 'totally unacceptable' tariffs – as it happened","bodyText":"And here’s what you need to know: Our full story on the day’s trade fears is here: After a momentous day on the international trade front, the Dow Jones industrial average closed the session 251 points down as investors sold off shares in manufacturers and corporations with global reach. Other US index were also lower, with the S&amp;P 500 falling for the fourth time in five days. The tariff issue had “cast a pall over the animal spirits,” explained Libby Cantrill, managing director and the head of public policy for PIMCO, on Bloomberg TV. Some investors expressed concerns that trade tariffs could interrupt synchronized global growth. “The hard thing about protectionism, the hard thing about tariffs and quotas, is that you can almost think of it as it’s a slow moving disease, but it’s deadly,” Kristina Hooper, Invesco’s chief global market strategist, told Bloomberg. “When I look at protectionism, I don’t believe the market truly can price it in at this point because there’s still so many potential iterations. But right now it’s certainly moving further to the extremes when it comes to protectionism and that can be very problematic.” That’s code for expect trouble ahead. Thanks for reading – we’re going to wrap up this blog now. US jobs report on Friday – stay tuned. South of the border, Mexico’s ministry of economy has also issued a statement, saying it “deeply regrets and disapproves” the US decision to impose tariffs on imports of steel and aluminum from Mexico as of 1 June but reiterated “its openness to a constructive dialogue with the US”. The statement read in part: “In response to the decision of the United States to impose tariffs, Mexico will adopt equivalent measures on a variety of products, including flat steel (hot and cold foil, including coated and tubes and pipes), lamps, pork legs and shoulders, sausages and food preparations, apples, grapes, cranberries, various cheeses, and other products, up to an amount comparable to damage caused by the United States’ action. “This measure will be in force for as long as the US government maintains the imposed tariffs.” Canada’s list of proposed counter measures is here. Freeland concluded her remarks saying: “I want to be very clear about one thing: Americans remain our partners, friends, and allies. This is not about the American people. We have to believe that at some point their common sense will prevail. But we see no sign of that in this action today by the US administration.” Canadian officials said they would impose tariffs against up to C$16.6bn worth of imports of steel, aluminium, whiskey, orange juice and other products from the US. “We are imposing dollar for dollar tariffs,” said Chrystia Freeland, Canada’s foreign affairs minister. The tariffs are expected to take effect on 1 July. The tariffs violate Nafta and WTO trade rules, added Freeland, who said that Canada plans to launch dispute settlement proceedings under Nafta Chapter 20 and the WTO. Canada’s foreign minister Chrystia Freeland says Canada will impose retaliatory measures against US steel, aluminium and other products – but subject to a 15-day consultation. Freeland also said Canada would continue to defend “free, open rule-based trade” but would also challenge US tariffs under both the North American Free Trade Agreement and the Word trade Organisation. Trudeau said the tariffs will harm industries and workers on both sides of the Canada-US border. “They are an affront to the long-standing security partnership between Canada and the United States, and in particular an affront to the thousands of Canadians who have fought and died alongside their US comrades in arms. The ties of commerce, friendship and in many cases family between Americans and Canadians are undiminished. We are confident that shared values, geography and common interest will ultimately overcome protectionism.” Canada’s prime minister Justin Trudeau has hit back strongly at the imposition of tariffs, calling them “ totally unacceptable” at a news conference. French President Emmanuel Macron said the United States’ decision to impose tariffs on European metals exports is illegal and a mistake. The French leader said he would talk to President Donald Trump on the subject later on Thursday Canada’s prime minister Trudeau and Mexico’s president Enrique Peña Nieto have reportedly spoken and agreed to co-ordinate retaliation efforts... A formal complaint by the EU at the WTO in Geneva is expected tomorrow, Friday. In joint statement the French minister and German finance minister, Bruno la Marie and Peter Altamira, said they regretted the “unilateral decision” taken by the White House and backed the European Commission’s retaliatory response. Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau is expected to speak at 1.30pm ET. In the meantime, we have Kathleen Wynne, the premier of Ontario, who has called Trump a “bully”, describing him as a “man who simply does not seem to get that his bluster and his bullying are costing real people real jobs”. The conservative business network backed by the wealthy industrialist brothers Charles and David Koch has also come out in opposition to the tariffs. Freedom Partners Chamber of Commerce and Americans for Prosperity warned there would be a tax increase on all Americans and would undermine the nation’s economy and low unemployment rates. Now for the reaction from Washington… Kevin Brady, the Texas Republican chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, has said the Trump administration is “hitting the wrong target” and officials will need to provide answers to Congress about the damage to US businesses. “When it comes to unfairly traded steel and aluminum, Mexico, Canada and Europe are not the problem – China is. These tariffs are hitting the wrong target.” Brady urged the administration to exempt allies from the new import tariffs. And he warned that administration officials “will need to come to Capitol Hill to provide answers about the indiscriminate harm these tariffs are causing our local businesses”. Continuing the denunciations of the US decision, Germany’s foreign minister Heiko Maas says the European Union “is ready to react accordingly with counter measure”. As Europe prepares to hit back with tariffs on a list of US exports worth €6.4 billion ($7.5 billion), Mexico’s economy ministry has said it will target several US goods in response, including some steel and pipe products, lamps, berries, grapes, apples, cold cuts, pork chops and various cheese products “up to an amount comparable to the level of damage” linked to the US tariffs. Canada is also expected to impose retaliatory measures, details of which are expected soon. Adam Marshall, Director General of the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC), called the US move “hugely disappointing” and warned that the tariffs “will hurt companies and communities in many areas of the UK, as well as their customers in the US”. “The UK government must reach out to and support the many supply chain businesses that face becoming the ‘collateral damage’ of the Trump administration’s protectionist push. British ministers must also work hand in hand with the EU to avoid any further escalation, and to find a long-term solution.” But he also warned that the US decision to impose punitive tariffs should serve as a reminder that self-interest looms large in trade negotiations. “Ministers should reflect on this carefully before they pursue any future trade deal between the UK and the USA.” More from Boffey: Manfred Weber, the leader of the European People’s Party, the largest group in the European Parliament, and a key ally of the German chancellor, warned that treating the EU as the “enemy” would lead to US consumers hurting too. He said: “Europe does not want a trade conflict. We believe in a fair trade regime from which everybody benefits. We have tried everything to make dialogue and mutual understanding prevail. If President Trump decides to treat Europe as an enemy, we will have no choice but to defend European industry, European jobs, European interests.” But he warned his party would not accept “this highly regrettable decision without reacting. This will have consequences for the American people too. In a trade conflict there are only losers.” The situation, he added, “has to be a wake-up call for us Europeans.” “With the US closing in on itself, we should be bridge-builders and reliable partners for the rest of the world. Europe now has to act with a clear message and remain united, calm and proportionate.” Gareth Stace, director of UK Steel, called the US decision “a bad day for the steel sector, for international relations and for free trade.” He said it is vital that the EU and US continue discussions to find a way through the current impasse and reach an agreement that works for all parties. But he called on the EU to forge ahead with safeguard action. And from the Guardian’s political correspondent Jessica Elgot: A UK government spokesman said they were “deeply disappointed” by the outcome. “The UK and other European Union countries are close allies of the US and should be permanently and fully exempted from the American measures on steel and aluminium,” the spokesman said. “We have made clear to the US government at the highest levels the importance of UK steel and aluminium to its businesses and defence projects. We will continue to work closely with the EU and US Administration to achieve a permanent exemption, and to ensure that UK workers are protected and safeguarded.” May will raise the tariffs with Trump directly when the pair meet at the G7 in Canada next week, where the issue is likely to figure prominently. May has personally lobbied the US president repeatedly in recent weeks and months. The Guardian’s Daniel Boffey from Brussels: Brussels has been preparing a retaliatory hit on an array of US goods, both industrial and agricultural, ranging from Harley Davidson motorbikes to blue jeans and American bourbon. Ambassadors from the 28 member states were in immediate communication with the European Commission following the announcement from the Trump administration. Speaking at a conference in Brussels, Juncker said the EU would launch retaliatory action “in the coming hours”. “This is a bad day for world trade,” Juncker. “It’s totally unacceptable that a country is imposing unilateral measures when it comes to world trade. What they can do, we are able to do.” Susan Danger, chief executive of the American Chamber of Commerce to the EU (AmCham EU), said the White House did not have any justification for imposing the tariffs. “American companies in Europe oppose the US government’s decision to impose tariffs on EU imports of steel and aluminium. We urge the US government to revisit its plans and the EU to take a balanced approach in responding to these measures. We are very concerned by the damage a tit-for-tat dispute would cause to the transatlantic economy and its impact on jobs, investment and security across the Atlantic.” Mexico’s Undersecretary of Foreign Trade, Juan Carlos Baker, tweeted: Ramón Beltrán, the president of Mexico’s National Chamber of the Aluminium Industry, told ‘Aristegui En Vivo’: “Nobody will win [the trade war that is beginning]. The US will lose.” “Frankly, we do not like this at all,” Beltrán added. Beltrán claimed the US move was designed to pressure Mexico over NAFTA negotiations. “[But] we shouldn’t contaminate one thing with the other.” Mexico’s Secretariat of Economy said it “profoundly regretted” the US move and announced it would hit back with tariffs on products including including grapes, apples, pork legs and shoulders, blueberries, some cheeses as well as flat steel. “Mexico has repeatedly made clear that these kinds of measures based on national security are neither appropriate nor justified,” the secretariat said in a statement. The former Belgian prime minister, and leader of the liberals in the European Parliament, Guy Verhofstadt, said: “Unfortunately, these steps weaken the transatlantic alliance. Instead of imposing punitive tariffs on their closest allies, the US and EU should work together to tackle China’s unfair trading practices.” He continued: “As with Brexit, what is most important now is unity within the EU. If we are united, we will have a strong position to face this wave of protectionism, which will benefit no one. The EU has proven to be a strong and reliable global trading partner. In recent months, the EU secured major free trade deals with partners like Canada, Japan and Mexico. This shows what we can achieve when Europe speaks with one voice. We need to continue in this spirit and work with partners around the globe to preserve the rules-based multilateral trading system.” In his statement, EU commission president Juncker said: “I am concerned by this decision. The EU believes these unilateral US tariffs are unjustified and at odds with World Trade Organisation rules. This is protectionism, pure and simple. Over the past months we have continuously engaged with the US at all possible levels to jointly address the problem of overcapacity in the steel sector. Overcapacity remains at the heart of the problem and the EU is not the source of but on the contrary equally hurt by it. US equities fell on the news, with the Dow Jones industrial average dropping 250 points. Mexican stocks also fell, while the Mexican peso and Canadian dollar hit their lows of the day against the dollar after news of US tariffs broke. Author and historian Simon Schama has also weighed in, posting on Twitter that “Europe now has to show some real spine or else it will just become Trump’s doormat”. The president of the European commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, has issued a statement and commented on Twitter: “It’s a bad day for world trade. US leaves us no choice but to proceed with a WTO dispute settlement case and the imposition of additional duties on a number of US imports. We will defend the EU’s interests, in full compliance with international trade law.” Markets have edged into negative territory despite earlier rises on hopes of a resolution to the Italian political crisis. The moves came as the US imposed steel and aluminium tariffs on the EU, Mexico and Canada. Investors are also fretting about other geopolitical problems, including Friday’s vote of no confidence in Spain, the continuing concerns about North Korea and Iran, the prospect of a trade war between the US and China. Italy’s FTSE MIB is currently down 0.13%, while Spain’s Ibex is 0.2% lower and Germany’s Dax is down 0.75%. France’s Cac has managed to edge up 0.03% while the FTSE 100 is 0.18% higher. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 145 points or 0.62%. On the economic front, eurozone inflation came in higher than forecast in May. UK consumer credit rebounded in April, as the City regulator ordered a clampdown on high cost credit. In the US, consumer spending and weekly jobless claims both came in better than expected. Finally, the Bank of England has appointed academic Jonathan Haskel to its rate setting monetary policy committee, the only man on a shortlist of five candidates. US commerce secretary Wilbur Ross has confirmed that it will impose steel and aluminium tariffs on the EU, Canada and Mexico from midnight tonight. The tariffs will be 25% for steel and 10% for aluminium. Amid fears of a trade war, Ross said if any party retaliated that did not rule out further negotiations. He said talks with the EU had made progress, but not enough to continue an exemption from tariffs, which was due to expire tomorrow. While European markets are still just about holding onto gains in the hope that Italy can come up with a plausible government after the recent turmoil, Wall Street has opened lower on worries about trade wars. With the US set to impose tariffs on steel and aluminium from the EU, Canada and Mexico, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 112 points or 0.4%. The S&amp;P 500 opened 0.28% lower and the Nasdaq Composite has lost 0.08%. Here’s our story on the appointment of the only man on a five person shortlist to the Bank of England’s monetary policy committee: The Bank of England interest rate setting committee, which has only one woman among its nine members, will continue to be male-dominated after the Treasury opted to appoint the only man from a shortlist of five candidates. In a move that immediately sparked protests from women’s groups, the chancellor, Philip Hammond, said Jonathan Haskel, an Imperial College economist, would join the Bank’s governor, Mark Carney, on the monetary policy committee (MPC) for a three-year term starting in September, when he will succeed the outgoing Ian McCafferty. The Treasury said four women were on the shortlist, but an internal panel made up of two women and one man chose Haskel as the best candidate. Clare Lombardelli, first female chief economic adviser to the Treasury, chaired the panel. She was joined by the former MPC member Kate Barker and Richard Hughes, the Treasury’s director of fiscal policy. A Women’s Equality party (WEP) spokeswoman said the appointment of Haskel sent the wrong message- about the Treasury’s commitment to improving diversity in important areas of public life. “It suggests that even if they had an all-female shortlist, they would probably still appoint a man,” she said. The full report is here: Shares in troubled Deutsche Bank are down around 5% following reports that US authorities have put its business in the country on a list of troubled institutions. More signs of the strength of the US economy. Weekly jobless claims fell by more than expected, down 13,000 to a seasonally adjusted 221,000. Analysts had forecast a fall to 228,000. The jobless rate at 3.9% is a near seventeen and a half year low and close to the Federal Reserve’s target of 3.8% by the end of the year. The news comes ahead of Friday’s non-farm payroll report, where economists expect around 188,000 jobs to have been created in May. Meanwhile US consumer spending rose by a higher than expected 0.6% last month, the biggest increase in five months. The forecast was for a 0.4% increase. Back in Italy: Meanwhile over in Spain, the no confidence debate is taking place. Our latest report: The future of the Spanish prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, is hanging in the balance as parliament prepares to debate a motion of no-confidence tabled after his Partido Popular (People’s party) was found to have profited from a huge kickbacks-for-contracts scheme. A defiant Rajoy addressed MPs early on Thursday, accusing the opposition Partido Socialista Obrero Español (Spanish Socialist Workers’ party) of opportunism and reminding the PSOE of its corruption scandals. “With what moral authority are you speaking? Are you perhaps Mother Teresa of Calcutta?” he asked. “There have been corrupt people in the PP, but the PP is not a corrupt party.” The no-confidence vote, scheduled to take place on Friday, is likely to be very close. The PSOE needs the support of 176 of the 350 MPs in congress of deputies. The votes of the five MPs of the Partido Nacionalista Vasco (Basque Nationalist party) will prove decisive, with the PNV saying it would meet and hear what the PSOE leader, Pedro Sánchez, had to say before announcing its decision. Sánchez called for “democratic regeneration” as he sought the backing of MPs, saying: “Resign, Mr Rajoy. Your time is up.” The full story is here: With European markets drifting - but mainly still managing to stay in positive territory - Wall Street is expected to open marginally lower. There is an eerie sense of calm after all the ructions caused by the Italian political crisis, with investors hoping a new government can be formed after all without the need for another election campaign. Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at Oanda, said: Not too long ago, a coalition government in Italy consisting of two eurosceptic populist parties was a feared and unlikely prospect that many believed would majorly concern investors. While much of this remains true, it is also currently viewed as the least unattractive and feasible outcome for markets, with the other alternative being fresh elections and the possibility that the parties are given an even stronger and potentially less euro-friendly mandate. Italy’s President, Sergio Mattarella, may have believed he was acting in the best interest of the country when he rejected to populists choice of Finance Minister but the reality is that in doing so, he has given both parties more ammunition with which to attack the euro. Mattarella has already been accused of acting on behalf of Germany and others while Brussels has been accused of interference, it all feeds very well into the eurosceptics message that the country no longer even has control over its domestic politics. Should the country move straight on to another election, both Five Star Movement and Lega will look to take advantage of any fury linked to perceived meddling and could significantly add to their numbers. All of a sudden, the worst case scenario prior to the election looks tolerable compared to what could come from another. With both parties now in discussions again, there is a hope that the political impasse can be resolved which is helping to lift sentiment in the near-term. That said, a positive outcome now poses many further risks in the long-term. While Italian assets have bore the brunt of the pain from the latest period of political instability and uncertainty, there has been a negative impact on the wider markets including the euro which dropped to a 10-month low against the dollar. While we’re still far away from the days of the debt crisis and the risk of a breakup, a second election was being portrayed as a vote on the euro which seems drastic and probably overhyped but it certainly hit the single currency. Markets are still managing to hold onto their gains - just - on hopes that the Italian political crisis can be resolved before too long. Here is our latest report on the developments: The leader of the Italian far-right party the League, Matteo Salvini, cancelled political rallies to return to Rome early on Thursday, in what was seen as a sign that a weeks-long political impasse that has left the country without a fully-functioning government for months might soon be coming to an end. Salvini was heading back to the capital to meet with his coalition partner, Luigi Di Maio, the 31-year-old head of the anti-establishment Five Star Movement, after the Italian president gave the pair more time to form a government. Italian press reports indicated that any agreement to form a new populist government involving the League, formerly known as the Lega Nord, and M5S would include the nomination – again – of Giuseppe Conte, a formerly obscure law professor, to serve as prime minister. But the two populists, Di Maio and Salvini, were expected to back down on their earlier insistence that the 81-year-old Eurosceptic Paolo Savona, who had called Italy’s adoption of the euro a “historic mistake”, serve as finance minister. There were also small indications that the populists would try to assure markets that they were not planning any big moves to try to hasten an Italian exit out of the euro, a fear that roiled markets this week. The full story is here: Given the controversy over the comments from male executives making excuses for why there are now women on their boards, the fact that the new member of the Bank of England’s MPC is male hardly helps matters. Worse - the shortlist for the appointment included four women and one man. And the man was given the job. From the Treasury release: The release also says: The Treasury is committed to appointing a diverse range of people to public appointments, including at the Bank of England. The Treasury continues to work to attract the broadest range of suitable applicants for posts. As part of this recruitment process, the Chief Economic Advisor at the Treasury and chair of the interview panel contacted 87 potential applicants to inform them of the vacancy, of whom 44 were women. Could Haskel also be hawkish? David Owen, chief european financial economist at Jefferies, says: His expertise will also be invaluable when it comes to assessing how much spare capacity there is in the UK economy, as well as trend GDP growth, both key when looking at monetary policy. Jonathan Haskel’s recent book “Capitalism Without Capital: The Rise of the Intangible Economy” highlights the growing use of things that we cannot really measure accurately in the production process in the UK. Everything being equal, this would suggest that labour productivity is stronger than official estimates suggest and like Ian McCafferty (who leaves the BoE in August) will vote for a rate rise when he joins the MPC. The government has appointed Jonathan Haskel, a professor of economics at Imperial College Business School, as the newest member of the Bank of England’s rate setting Monetary Policy Committee. Haskel will serve a three year term as an external member and will start on 1 September, when Ian McCafferty’s term ends. In his Imperial College profile, Haskel says: My main research interests are productivity, innovation, intangible investment and growth. I currently study (a) how much firms investment in “intangible” or “knowledge” assets, such as software, R&amp;D and new business processes (b) how much such investment contributes to economic growth as whole and (c) what public policy implications there might be, especially for science policy. This work uses a mix of data at the levels of company, individual, industry and whole economy. Economist Bert Colijn at ING Bank said the eurozone inflation figure puts the European Central Bank in an awkward position: As this jump in inflation just thinly masks underlying core weakness and uncertainty about the economy is high, it is unlikely to convince the ECB to normalise policy more quickly.... [The] core inflation reading is still below where we would expect it to be with the improving labour market and increased selling prices indicated in business surveys. And, as selling price expectations have been weakening in the recent soft patch of economic data, it does not seem like we are at the start of a marked increase in inflation. The understatement of recent months was also helped by a weakening euro, which dampened some of the effects from the higher oil price. Petrol prices jumped significantly in May, on the back of an oil price of around $80 per barrel for most of the month and a weakening euro. Be careful what you wish for, ECB. After years of pushing for inflation to return to just under 2%, it could not have come at a more difficult time. Eurozone financial market turmoil has returned because of Italian politics this week and it is very difficult to see how the Italian political situation is going to play out. Economic data has been weakening over the past months, and the ECB is eager to determine whether this is just a soft patch. Finally, the US seems on the brink of announcing tariffs on European steel and aluminium, which clouds the exports outlook and could have an additional inflationary impact if the trade conflict gets out of hand. The ECB therefore now has to decide whether it will provide certainty straight away by announcing an extension to QE or take a “wait and see” approach at the June meeting. Then it could just hint at an extension while taking another six weeks to see how the political situation in Italy and the trade conflict with the US play out, and take in more economic data. Eurozone inflation rose by more than expected in May, partly due to the recent surge in oil prices. The increase towards the European Central Bank’s target comes as it wants to run down its stimulus programme, but faces the prospect of market turbulence disturbing its plans. The cost of living in the 19 eurozone countries rose from 1.2% in April to 1.9% in May, according to an initial estimate from Eurostat, higher than the forecasts of around 1.6%. Energy prices rose by 6.1% compared to 2.6% in April, while food was 2.6% higher, uup from 2.4%. Excluding energy and food prices, inflation rose from 1.1% to 1.3%. Meanwhile unemployment in the eurozone fell from 8.6% in March to 8.5% in April. A UK interest rate rise in August is by no means a done deal, says ING Bank economist James Smith. Commenting on the credit figures, he says: It’s not something markets or analysts typically spend much time looking at each month, but the unexpectedly sharp fall in consumer credit in March was probably a key factor in the Bank of England’s decision to keep rates on hold in May. Admittedly the reasons for this sudden decline were fairly unclear, and the latest figures released today show that the amount of unsecured consumer credit supplied fully recovered in April, rising by £1.8 billion. This tentatively suggests that the fall was simply a blip, perhaps related to the wider economic slowdown in March (although it’s not entirely clear why the bad weather would have resulted in such a sharp change). We still think this is a story worth keeping an eye on over the next couple of months. A net 39% of banks said they tightened up on credit availability in the first quarter according to a Bank of England survey. If credit growth were to slow further, it would no doubt be a bad omen for growth - particularly as, of what little spending there has been over the past year, much of it appears to have been financed by borrowing. Meanwhile consumers continue to remain cautious. While household incomes are no longer being squeezed quite as much as before, shoppers are now being confronted with higher petrol prices, and the latest confidence surveys suggest individuals remain pessimistic about the economic situation overall. These cracks forming in the retail sector remain a big risk to the Bank of England outlook. While we are inclined to think policymakers have a preference to hike rates again in August if economic data allows (particularly given the better wage growth trend), this is certainly not a done deal. As one committee member said recently, the cost of waiting a bit longer before hiking rates is relatively low. The independent economist is referring to remarks made earlier this month at at select committee hearing, when Sir Dave said there was a risk households were spending less than the Bank had expected - as reported by the Financial Times (£). Speaking of credit, there has been a spike in borrowing by UK consumers in April after a slowdown the previous month blamed on the snowy weather. Consumer credit lending rose by a higher than expected £1.832bn, the biggest increase since November 2016, compared to an increase of just £425m in March. Economists polled by Reuters had expected a rise of £1.3bn. The number of mortgages approved slipped from 62,802 in March to 62,455, less than the expected 63,000. Net mortgage lending rose by £3.894bn. Here’s our story on the Financial Conduct Authority clamping down on high cost credit: The City watchdog is planning a price cap for rent-to-own retailers as part of a crackdown on high-cost credit and overdrafts to save consumers more than £200m a year. Although stopping short of capping charges on overdrafts, the Financial Conduct Authority outlined a series of measures on Thursday amid growing calls to protect vulnerable consumers. The changes, the result of an 18-month review by the regulator, come as the Bank of England becomes increasingly concerned about rapid growth in personal borrowing, which is returning to levels unseen since the financial crisis. The Hollywood actor Michael Sheen, debt charities and the Labour party have applied significant pressure on the regulator to act. The FCA said it would consider introducing a price cap for the rent-to-own sector, which includes firms such as BrightHouse, from as early as April next year, although it warned it would need to consult on the measure with the industry first. The full report is here: More positive news for Italy: Germany’s Dax has dipped into the red but other European markets are holding up as investors await the latest developments in the Italian political crisis. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: Further steps in the right direction in regards to Italy avoiding another snap election – even if it does result in the Five Star Movement and League parties forming a Eurosceptic government – allowed the European markets to hold steady on Thursday. Rising 0.4% the euro managed to put a bit more distance between it and the 10 month lows it struck against the dollar on Tuesday night, the single currency climbing back towards $1.17 after the bell. Against the pound it was a bit more sluggish; however, flat at just under €1.14, it is trading at the top end of its recent bracket. The Eurozone indices, meanwhile, were broadly positive as well. Though the DAX dipped into the red, the CAC and FTSE MIB both continued to rise, the latter especially expressing its relief that things – for now, at least – appear to be calming down. It’ll be interesting to see what role the Eurozone’s May inflation reading plays in the day’s trading. The surge in oil prices means analysts are expecting a sharp month-on-month jump, from 1.2% to 1.6%; that could give the euro a bit more room to breathe, but only if investors are willing to overlook the fact that the increase isn’t really due to anything going on in the Eurozone. Italian bond yields - which soared on Tuesday as the price fell on political concerns - continue to fall back. The two year yield is now down at 0.9% as calm returns - for the moment at least. Two days ago the yield hit 2.84%. Australian shares ended the month on a positive note, helped by the hopes for a solution to the Italian crisis and a rise in mining shares on the back of higher commodity prices. The S&amp;P/AX index rose 0.5% on the day, helping it to a similar increase for the month as a whole. Markets are likely to remain volatile, says Neil Wilson, chief market analyst for Markets.com: European equities are firmer in early trade and yesterday’s rebound for stocks may well hold if we see the two populists form a government, though longer term any such government faces a clash with the EU/ECB. They may also face a considerable backlash from bond markets again – calm for the moment – if they push ahead with plans to increase debt-to-GDP... Reports this morning suggest Paolo Savona could become foreign minister in a Lega-M5S government, a move that could be palatable for all the sides. In the near term the avoidance of snap elections would be positive for risk, but longer-term concerns remain. It does look as though the main risk being priced in earlier this week when bonds and stocks sold off sharply was the threat of another election that could have been framed in a more anit-EU light. Again we must reiterate that stock and bond markets will remain volatile and highly sensitive to the political situation in Rome. Added to this we have the prospect of a no-confidence vote in Spanish prime minister Mariano Rajoy, a move that would likely bring down the centre-right government. The debate, which starts today, adds to investor concerns that Europe is in a very rocky patch politically at the moment. It is indeed a positive start for European markets, albeit a slightly tentative one given all the geopolitical tensions at the moment. With hopes of a resolution to the Italian political impasse, the country’s FTSE MIB is up 0.38%, while Germany’s Dax is 0.12% better and France’s Cac has climbed 0.18%. In the UK, the FTSE 100 is up 0.19%. Economist Paul Donovan at UBS said: We are not back to normal, but markets have reacquainted themselves with what normal might look like. Italian bond yields fell and the euro recovered yesterday. A consensus is forming that there will not be elections in Italy until September at the earliest. Italian President Mattarella is waiting to see if the two anti-parties can in fact form a coalition. Ahead of the eurozone inflation figure we have had an update from France. Reuters reports: French inflation rose in May to its highest level since August 2012, according to data from the INSEE national statistics agency, adding to a raft of strong inflation readings across the euro zone as the European Central Bank considers whether or not to tighten its monetary policy. French consumer prices rose from April due partly to higher energy and food prices. The year-on-year inflation rate came in at 2.3 percent, according to EU-harmonised data from INSEE, above a forecast for an inflation reading of 2.0 percent according to a Reuters poll. Earlier this week, data had also shown inflation in Germany, the euro zone’s biggest economy, surging more than expected in May to its highest level in more than a year, while data also showed inflation picking up in Spain. Germany’s May inflation of 2.2 percent also surpassed the European Central Bank’s (ECB) target of just under 2 percent for the euro zone as a whole. ING Bank economist James Smith says the UK credit numbers could be interesting: Here’s more on the Financial Conduct Authority’s clampdown on high cost credit. FCA chief executive Andrew Bailey said: High-cost credit is used by over three million consumers in the UK, some of who are the most vulnerable in society. Today we have proposed a significant package of reforms to ensure they are better protected including the possibility of a cap on rent-to-own lending. The proposals will benefit overdraft and high-cost credit users, rebalancing in the favour of the customer. Here is the full FCA announcement. Eurozone inflation is expected to move sharply higher, partly due to the recent surge in oil prices. UniCredit economists said: We expect headline inflation to rebound strongly in May, from 1.2% to 1.8% year on year. We see two main drivers: a rebound in core inflation and a jump in energy prices. Core inflation probably reversed its April drop and rose to 1.1% year on year from 0.7%. This would reflect normalization in the price of holiday-sensitive items, with the April reading having been distorted to the downside by the early timing of Easter. Surging oil prices are likely to push energy prices up strongly, adding 0.3 percentage points to headline inflation . Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Optimism that the Italian political crisis can be resolved without new elections is expected to see markets continue their revival today. The 5 Star and Lega parties are making renewed efforts to form a coalition, which has eased fears that a new vote could give a mandate for the country to leave the euro - Italexit or Quitaly, take your pick. So Italian bond yields have fallen back from their highs earlier in the week, while European markets are expected to make a positive start. CMC Markets UK’s opening forecasts show The FTSE 100 up 3 points Germany’s Dax 20 points higher France’s Cac climbing 8 points Italy’s FTSE MIB up 50 points. CMC’s chief market analyst Michael Hewson said: [Market] optimism was reinforced by a call from the Five Star movement for Paolo Savona to withdraw his candidacy for the position of finance minister. This would appear to be at odds with the position of the League and its leader Matteo Salvini, whose pick Savona is. The differences of opinion between the two parties certainly don’t bode well for any future relationship in government, if Salvini does change his mind about Savona and put someone else forward as finance minister... Even though investors have significant concerns about the recent steep rise in Italian borrowing costs it should be noted they still remain well below their long-term averages prior to the financial crisis, when they were on average in and around the 4% level for most of the noughties. This means that while Italian borrowing costs now are high relative to the last few years, they still remain low by historical standards. Still, investors would be right to be cautious. Italy is not the only potential problem in the eurozone, with Spain’s prime minister Rajoy facing a no confidence vote on Friday. On the same day, the EU’s temporary exemption from the US steel and aluminium tariffs is due to expire although developments could come as soon as today, while there are also the continuing concerns about a trade war between the US and China, as well the situation in North Korea. It’s set to be a busier day all round, with news already that the UK regulator the Financial Conduct Authority is clamping down on high cost credit. Meanwhile Nationwide’s latest house price index has shown weaker than expected growth in May, with prices up 2.4%, down from a 2.6% increase in April and below the expected figure of 3%. Jonathan Samuels, chief executive of property lender, Octane Capital, said: Tight supply and subdued demand are the key contributors to the ongoing limbo gripping the UK property market. A lethargic economy populated by cautious and squeezed consumers has created a property market lacking both momentum and direction. And on the corporate front, the chief executive of train and bus business FirstGroup is leaving with immediate effect. As the company reported a poor set of results, Tim O’Toole said: The time is right for me to step aside. Today’s results clear the way for the new approach sought by our Chairman and the Board. Investors will also be watching out for European inflation figures after Wednesday’s higher than expected consumer price index from Germany.

The Financial Conduct Authority’s 18-month review into high-cost credit stepped back from a cap on overdraft fees because of fears it could be challenged in court by the banks, triggering sharp criticism from charities and MPs pushing for tougher action. Customers will instead be given more alerts via mobile phones, warning of charges as well as requiring the introduction of online tools to make the cost of overdrafts clearer. Messages on cash machines that customers have “available funds” that include their overdraft will be banned. John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, called the steps from the FCA “deeply disappointing”, while Rachel Reeves, the Labour chair of the business select committee, said: “While the FCA ‘consult’ on some meagre remedies and ‘discuss’ further action, banks are allowed to continue to rip people off. This is not good enough.” The FCA said it would consider introducing a price cap on rent-to-own, where stores such as BrightHouse sell cookers and household appliances on weekly payments. It found that customers ended up paying more than £1,500 for ovens that sell in other high street shops for less than £300. The price cap, estimated to benefit about 400,000 people, is likely to come into force next April after consultation with the industry. It follows a drive by debt charities and campaigners, including the actor Michael Sheen, who put intense pressure on the regulator to act. Andrew Bailey, the chief executive of the FCA and the frontrunner to be the next governor of the Bank of England, told the BBC “we don’t want to screw up” on price caps following a supreme court challenge that went in favour of the banks in 2009. However, he left the door open to a possible price cap in future, saying it could form part of a wider retail banking review due later this year. “Our immediate proposed changes will make overdraft costs more transparent and prevent people unintentionally dipping in to an overdraft in the first place,” he said. “However, we believe more fundamental change is needed in the way banks charge customers for overdrafts.” The FCA’s main recommendations were: Mobile alerts warning of potential overdraft charges. Stopping the inclusion of overdrafts in the term “available funds”. Requiring online tools to make the cost of overdrafts clearer. Introducing online tools to assess eligibility for overdrafts. Making it clear that overdrafts are credit or borrowing. The FCA said it would introduce rules preventing home-collected credit firms, such as Provident Financial, from offering new loans or renewing old ones during home visits without a specific request from customers. Catalogue and store credit firms will be forced to do more to help customers avoid persistent debt. In total, the FCA said the crackdown will save consumers about £200m a year but campaigners said it had not gone far enough. Gareth Shaw of Which? said some overdraft charges could be seven times more expensive than a payday loan and called on the government to intervene as the FCA “continues to drag its heels”. He said: “It’s wrong that the regulator continues to delay taking action, leaving consumers affected by this unfair practice trapped in debt.” The Bank of England has become increasingly concerned about rapid growth in personal borrowing, which is returning to levels unseen since the financial crisis amid sluggish wage growth and rising levels of inflation since the EU referendum almost two years ago. The latest figures show Britons increasing their borrowing at the fastest rate since November 2016 during April, when about £1.8bn worth of debt was racked up on credit cards, personal loans and car finance. On the stock market, shares in banks and doorstep credit providers were largely unmoved. Goodbody Stockbrokers said: “The high-cost credit market will face little turbulence as a result of new regulation, a bit of a relief for the major players in this space.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/may/31/us-presses-north-korea-for-historic-plan-to-disarm-as-pompeo-meets-kim-aide","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-31T05:55:02Z","webTitle":"US presses North Korea for 'historic' plan to disarm as Pompeo meets Kim aide","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/31/us-presses-north-korea-for-historic-plan-to-disarm-as-pompeo-meets-kim-aide","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/may/31/us-presses-north-korea-for-historic-plan-to-disarm-as-pompeo-meets-kim-aide","fields":{"headline":"US presses North Korea for 'historic' plan to disarm as Pompeo meets Kim aide","bodyText":"The North Koreans will have to lay out a disarmament plan in the next few days if a planned summit between Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un is to go ahead on schedule in two weeks’ time, a senior US state department official said on Wednesday. The official was speaking in New York as the US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, and a top North Korean official, Kim Yong-chol, met over a dinner ahead of a day of talks on Thursday aimed at defining negotiating positions and narrowing differences before the summit. In a letter to Kim last week, Trump declared he was calling off the summit scheduled for 12 June in Singapore, after a spat broke out between Washington and Pyongyang over military exercises the US conducted with South Korea, and expectations of the outcome of the unprecedented meeting between the two national leaders. But since then, the two governments have engaged in a flurry of diplomacy aimed at salvaging the summit: in Singapore, the demilitarised zone between the two Koreas, and at Pompeo’s New York meeting with Kim Yong-chol, a former spy chief and vice-chairman of the ruling Workers’ party. Preparations for the summit broke down last week over the insistence from leading US officials that North Korea would have to dismantle its nuclear weapons programme fully and rapidly before receiving any benefits, a position Pyongyang rejected as one-sided. Asked what the regime would have to do for the summit to go ahead, a senior state department official said: “Between now and if we’re going to have a summit, they’re going to have to make clear what they’re willing to do.” The US was looking for CVID, “complete verifiable, irreversible denuclearisation”, the official said, but did not specify the timing of such a process or whether it would have to be carried out all at once, or in phases. “I think we are looking for something historic,” the official said. “I think we’re looking for something that has never been done before.” In return the US was offering “the security guarantees they feel they need” and help for North Korea to achieve greater prosperity. If the North Koreans were not prepared to take unprecedented steps to disarm, the official added: “We will ramp up the pressure on them and we’ll be ready for the day that hopefully they are.” The official said that the New York talks were being conducted by the “two top dogs” in the preparatory negotiations. Pompeo tweeted that he had had a “good working dinner” with Kim on Wednesday night of steak, corn and cheese. “I will remind you that the secretary of state is from the heartland and likes American food, and he’s hosting someone who’s never been to our country,” the senior state department official said. The Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, meanwhile met his North Korean counterpart, Ri Yong Ho, on Thursday in Pyongyang, a trip seen as an attempt by Moscow to make its voice heard in its neighbour state’s push for diplomacy. Lavrov invited Kim Jong Un to Russia and passed on best wishes from president Vladimir Putin, the Russian foreign ministry said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2018/may/31/donald-trump-holds-summit-with-kim-kardashian-west","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-31T07:38:16Z","webTitle":"Trump holds prison reform summit with Kim Kardashian West","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/may/31/donald-trump-holds-summit-with-kim-kardashian-west","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/may/31/donald-trump-holds-summit-with-kim-kardashian-west","fields":{"headline":"Trump holds prison reform summit with Kim Kardashian West","bodyText":"Donald Trump took time out from bashing his attorney general Jeff Sessions and making the Roseanne Barr racism storm all about himself to meet Kim Kardashian West and discuss the justice system. Traversing the whole gamut of notable Kims – the president is seeking to solve a nuclear crisis with a potential meeting with Kim Jong-un soon – Trump met the fellow reality TV star in the White House on Wednesday, where she is reported to have asked for Alice Marie Johnson to be pardoned. Johnson is a 63-year-old grandmother who is serving a life sentence for a first-time non-violent drug offence. Following the meeting, Trump tweeted a picture of the pair inside the Oval Office. He captioned it: “Great meeting with @KimKardashian today, talked about prison reform and sentencing.” It is unknown exactly what was discussed during the meeting but afterwards Kardashian West tweeted her thanks to the president and said she hoped Johnson would be freed. She wrote: “I would like to thank President Trump for his time this afternoon. It is our hope that the President will grant clemency to Ms. Alice Marie Johnson who is serving a life sentence for a first-time, non-violent drug offense.” She added: “We are optimistic about Ms. Johnson’s future and hopeful that she – and so many like her-will get a second chance at life.” Vanity Fair magazine first reported Kardashian West was due to speak to Trump and his son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner. Kardashian West is thought to have been involved in private discussions with Kushner and Ivanka Trump for several months. Johnson is serving a life sentence without parole after being convicted of drug-related charges in 1997. An online petition to grant clemency to Johnson, started by her daughter, currently has more than 250,000 signatures. Kardashian West’s husband, Kanye West, has drawn criticism for his support of the president, and was pictured wearing a cap bearing the slogan, ‘Make America Great Again’, a phrase associated with Trump. Earlier this month, Trump pardoned the heavyweight boxer Jack Johnson, who was convicted in 1913 of violating the Mann Act for transporting a woman across state lines for “immoral purposes”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/may/31/abbotts-wind-commissioner-has-been-a-boon-for-renewables-climate-body-says","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-31T05:12:50Z","webTitle":"Abbott's wind commissioner has been a boon for renewables, climate body says","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/may/31/abbotts-wind-commissioner-has-been-a-boon-for-renewables-climate-body-says","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/may/31/abbotts-wind-commissioner-has-been-a-boon-for-renewables-climate-body-says","fields":{"headline":"Abbott's wind commissioner has been a boon for renewables, climate body says","bodyText":"The role of Australia’s windfarm commissioner has been a success and should be expanded to include solar and other large-scale renewables, a report by the Climate Change Authority has recommended. It says the post, set up under the former prime minister Tony Abbott to handle complaints and investigate potential risks, has actually facilitated the uptake of wind energy by helping to address community concerns. The controversial role of national windfarm commissioner was established by the Coalition in 2015 as part of a deal with anti-wind senators in response to complaints about turbine noise. Andrew Dyer was appointed to the position on an annual salary of $205,000. A report published on Thursday by the Climate Change Authority found that there had been 163 complaints to the commissioner since the establishment of the office in late 2015 and most of those related to proposed windfarm developments, not windfarms that were already operational. Eighty-four of the complaints were addressed by providing information to the person making the complaint or referring the complaint to the developer or a government agency. Fifty-two cases were closed because the person making the complaint decided not to pursue it. The report said the commissioner had “exceeded expectations” and that the windfarm industry and state governments “told the authority that the commissioner has facilitated uptake of wind energy by helping to address community concerns”. The report recommends the role be expanded to include other developments such as large-scale solar and battery storage because there is likely to be a significant amount of new renewable energy development in Australia during the next few years. In relation to solar farms, the chairwoman of the Climate Change Authority, Wendy Craik, said objections “generally relate to amenity, noise during construction and glare from the panels” as well as impacts on agricultural land, while complaints about batteries could relate to noise and visual impacts. The report said the commissioner role was likely to be needed for at least the next few years and expanding it would be “an efficient and relatively low-cost way of helping to manage community concerns about large-scale solar, wind and storage (such as large-scale batteries) in the short to medium term”. It recommends the post be funded until 2021 with a “modest” budget increase. Andrew Bray coordinates the Australian Wind Alliance, which represents community supporters of windfarms. He said the commissioner had, in some cases, helped resolve long-running negotiations between windfarm developers and landholders on neighbouring properties. “When companies are negotiating with neighbours around noise and changes to the visual landscape, he’s able to introduce realistic expectations of what neighbours can expect and that has allowed agreement to occur,” Bray said. “There are massive opportunities for regional communities from windfarms but it’s important the development is done right so any concerns are managed and financial benefits are shared appropriately.” Another industry group, the Clean Energy Council, agreed with the report’s conclusions and echoed the call for the commissioner’s role to expand. “Technology aside, many large-scale renewable energy projects share common challenges and community expectations,” energy generation director Anna Freeman said. “It makes sense to make the most of the commissioner’s expertise to inform the renewable energy sector as a whole.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2018/may/31/trump-with-better-hair-how-obama-white-house-saw-boris-johnson","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-31T04:54:52Z","webTitle":"'Trump with better hair': how Obama White House saw Boris Johnson","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/may/31/trump-with-better-hair-how-obama-white-house-saw-boris-johnson","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/may/31/trump-with-better-hair-how-obama-white-house-saw-boris-johnson","fields":{"headline":"'Trump with better hair': how Obama White House saw Boris Johnson","bodyText":"The Obama White House viewed Boris Johnson as a British version of Donald Trump “with better hair”, according to a forthcoming memoir by a former top presidential adviser. In the World as It Is: A Memoir of the Obama White House, Ben Rhodes, a deputy national security adviser and speechwriter for the former president, describes eight years of domestic and foreign policy making, culminating in the shock of Trump’s victory in November 2016. In the book, due to be published on 5 June, Rhodes recounts a “hastily arranged” trip to London in April 2016 aimed at bolstering the then prime minister, David Cameron, and argue the case for remaining in the EU, two months before the UK referendum on Brexit. “It was unusual to coordinate so closely with a foreign government, but the Brits were different, and Brexit would be calamitous, a crucial piece of the post-world war two order drifting off into the sea,” Rhodes recalls. Obama agreed to fly to London after Cameron’s chief of staff, Ed Llewellyn, now ambassador to Paris, emailed Rhodes appealing for a presidential visit, pointing out that the polls were finely balanced and Obama had an approval rating in the UK of over 70%. As part of his contribution to the campaign, Obama published a pro-Remain commentary in the Daily Telegraph to coincide with his arrival. But Johnson, who was then mayor of London, published an opposing commentary in the Sun, saying that Obama had had a bust of Winston Churchill removed from the Oval Office, and attributing the move to “the part-Kenyan president’s ancestral dislike of the British Empire – of which Churchill had been such a fervent defender”. Johnson’s comments were denounced by Labour politicians as “dog-whistle racism” and the mayor was derided by Churchill’s grandson, Nicholas Soames, as, “unreliable and idle about the facts”. According to Rhodes’ account, Obama was also taken aback by the racial connotations of the attack from Johnson, who three months later would become foreign secretary, in the wake of the Brexit victory. “Really?” the president is quoted as saying and being read Johnson’s comments. “The black guy doesn’t like the British?” When Rhodes suggested to Obama that his critics were “more subtle back home”, the president replied: “Not really ... Boris is their Trump”. “With better hair,” Rhodes added. At a joint press conference with Cameron during the three-day visit, Obama went out of his way to refute Johnson’s claims about the Churchill bust, pointing out it had been moved to the entrance of his private White House study, known as the Treaty Room, a place where he saw it every day. “I love the guy,” Obama said. Churchill’s place in the Oval Office was taken by a likeness of Martin Luther King. In the course of the same press conference, Obama said that if the UK left the EU, it would be “at the back of the queue” when it came to negotiating a new trade agreement with the US. According to Rhodes, the phrase had been used by a British official in an earlier private meeting in Downing Street, and Obama had repeated it publicly at Cameron’s specific request. Rhodes recalls that Cameron’s aides were “congratulating one another” on Obama’s intervention, and hoped that it would be enough to “inch them over the finish line”. Brexit leaders later claimed Obama’s visit to London backfired and helped them win the June 2016 referendum due to a backlash against foreign meddling in British politics. Johnson insisted he had no regrets about raising Obama’s Kenyan ancestry and rejected Obama’s claim that the UK would be at the back of the queue for a US trade deal as “absurd”. The Trump administration has given mixed signals over where the UK would stand in negotiating a post-Brexit trade pact. Trump himself has suggested the UK would have to take second place to the EU, while the Treasury secretary, Steve Mnuchin has said the UK would be “at the front of the line”.

The review by research consultancy Kantar Public for the education department found that parents have a “lack of knowledge regarding the actual role” of chaplains, with most unsure how chaplains deal with the most serious issues including sexuality, alcohol and drug abuse, self harm and suicide. Despite the review showing majority support for the program, secular activists have seized on indications from both supporters and opponents that faith is discussed in schools despite its rules banning proselytising. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The report was released in a tense Senate estimates session in which Greens senator Sarah Hanson-Young probed education minister Simon Birmingham about the government’s decision to extend the program’s funding with $247m over four years. Overall support for the program was high, with 91% of parents in favour. The review found that two-thirds of parents felt there was no disadvantage to chaplaincy services, but support was lower in government schools (58%) and among students themselves (54%). Some 11% of parents overall objected to religious views being shared with their children, rising to 18% of parents in government schools. Some 5% of students surveyed wanted chaplains to be more present, while some objected to the religious aspect of the program (5%) and others said it detracted from learning time (3%). “There were a proportion of parents and students (particularly from government schools) who preferred religious views were not shared,” the report said. “This was driven by the perception that chaplaincy services included sharing or teaching of religious views and values, and therefore, felt better suited to private schools or religious families.” When asked how the program could be improved, most parents asked for more information about the program (24%), many asked for extra funding (10%) and others called for the program to be removed outright (4%) or objected to its religious nature (3%). The school chaplains program, which is federally funded but delivered by state governments, requires chaplains to be recognised by an organised religion, which secular activists argue is discriminatory and will soon be the subject of a challenge in the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal. The survey found students said the advantages of the program were an accessible figure to talk to (24%), support with problems (22%), guidance to help them understand or “figure things out” (13%), and “being encouraged in their faith” (13%). Parents said the key advantages of chaplains were provision of extra support (31%), providing a figure students can trust (24%) and encouraging students in the faith/spiritual aspect of their lives (15%). The Rationalist Society of Australia president, Meredith Doig, seized on those findings, telling Guardian Australia “the fact these statistics appear at all is proof that the prohibition of proselytising is simply not working”. “At the Rationalists, we are not calling for the abandonment of the program,” she said. “It is clear there is a need and that need should be filled. But there is no reason why this work cannot be done by suitably qualified non-religious pastoral care officers.” The report found that chaplains were involved in delivery of religious studies in 26% of the Catholic and independent schools and 7% of government schools surveyed, which is permitted in opt-in religious instruction classes. When asked to evaluate the effectiveness of the program on various issues the majority of parents, principals and chaplains rated it “extremely well” on issues including fostering a sense of purpose and self-esteem, peer relationships and social inclusion. But on many issues more parents were unsure of the program than those who rated it highly. On alcohol and drug abuse 24% of parents rated the program an 8-10 on a 10 point scale while 66% said they didn’t know. On sexuality 26% rated it extremely well compared with 63% who didn’t know. The report was based on a survey of 477 principals, 498 chaplains, 1,038 parents and 134 students in October and November 2016 and was received by the government in March 2017. Peter Monk, a National Secular Lobby board member, said the report “confirms that chaplains, even in our secular independent and public schools, are proselytising to students”. Paul Willis, a spokesman for the National Secular Lobby, said the report emphasised the need for “properly trained councillors in our schools”. “It is absolutely outrageous that suitably qualified councillors cannot operate within the [chaplains’ program] unless they are part of a religious organisation,” he said. In Senate estimates on Thursday Birmingham defended the program, saying he was “quite struck in the lead-up to this year’s budget by the number of communications I had from principals, chairs of school councils, students” who had supported it. He said they had “outlined a range of personal circumstances where chaplains have assisted them in times of bereavements, treatment for issues such as cancer, family breakdowns, [and] bullying issues”. Under questioning from Hanson-Young about what constituted proselytising, Birmingham said it was an “attempt to convert someone to a particular religion or belief”. He said that quoting the Bible is not necessarily proselytising. In a statement Hanson-Young said if “nobody knows what’s prohibited [by the rule against proselytising], nothing is prohibited”. “Schools are not recruiting grounds ... scrap [the program] and put real counsellors in schools. Australian kids deserve better than this.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/may/31/big-four-banks-quit-coal-only-to-invest-in-other-fossil-fuels-research-finds","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-31T07:44:59Z","webTitle":"Big four banks quit coal only to invest in other fossil fuels, research finds","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/may/31/big-four-banks-quit-coal-only-to-invest-in-other-fossil-fuels-research-finds","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/may/31/big-four-banks-quit-coal-only-to-invest-in-other-fossil-fuels-research-finds","fields":{"headline":"Big four banks quit coal only to invest in other fossil fuels, research finds","bodyText":"Australia’s big four banks have significantly increased investment to projects that will expand the fossil fuel industry as they claim to support efforts to limit global climate change, according to new research by the environmental finance group Market Forces. The report shows the banks have effectively walked away from coal, after years of increased pressure from the environmental lobby and customers wanting to deal with sustainable companies. None of the big four banks has invested in new coal projects since 2015. But a spike in finance for new oil and gas projects has, according to Market Forces’ head of research, Jack Bertolus, put a significant dent in those green credentials. “It’s all well and good to commit to ‘two degrees’ [the Paris target to limit climate increases above pre-industrial levels] but you’ve got to back it up with action, and it’s plainly obvious that we can’t be expanding the size of the fossil fuel industry. That’s what the science says but it’s also common sense.” Market Forces found that big bank lending to new fossil fuel projects increased by 50% in 2017, a total of $2.265bn up from $1.509bn the year before. ANZ topped the list, lending $905m, an increase of 93% from 2016, which included investment in gas fields in North Sumatra and in the Ichthys field off the northern Australian coast. The report says ANZ, CommBank, Westpac and NAB banks have provided direct project finance for 17 new fossil fuel projects since making commitments to the Paris target. “Over their lifetimes, these projects are expected to enable 4.9bn tonnes of CO2, enough to cancel out Australia’s emissions reduction target more than five times over,” the report says. Bertolus said banks had clearly realised that investment in coal was not worth the damage to their reputation. But he said it was hypocritical to get public relations mileage on one hand, and on the other continue to fund oil and gas projects. “In a sense it doesn’t matter if you’re funding coal or oil and gas – if it’s inconsistent with two degrees it’s essentially a race to the precipice,” he said. The report is particularly critical of ANZ and CommBank’s funding for fossil fuels. NAB is the best of the big four, putting considerably less into fossil fuels but still more than on renewable energy projects. “There are plenty of choices outside of the big four that don’t fund fossil fuels at all, and in some cases have active policies about not funding the fossil fuel industry,” Bertolus said. ANZ has publicly stated it supports the goal of attempting to limit climate increase to 2C above pre-industrial levels. “ANZ as a responsible and sustainable business is playing its part to support the transition to a decarbonised economy,” it has said. A spokesperson for the Commonwealth said the bank’s coal funding had been “trending down for some time” and was relatively small. The bank described gas as “a transition fuel”. “We expect that trend to continue over time as we help finance the transition to a low carbon economy. “CBA has been supporting the shift in the Australian economy towards low carbon energy alternatives, with a significant movement from coal towards renewable energy, and gas as a transition fuel.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/jun/25/tobacco-companies-child-labour-pressure","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-25T05:00:53Z","webTitle":"Tobacco: activist investors pressure £20bn companies over child labour","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/25/tobacco-companies-child-labour-pressure","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/25/tobacco-companies-child-labour-pressure","fields":{"headline":"Tobacco: activist investors pressure £20bn companies over child labour","bodyText":"The world’s biggest tobacco companies are coming under mounting pressure over child labour and working conditions in fields globally, from Zimbabwe to North Carolina. The firms are facing intense scrutiny from unions, NGOs and academics. While all have child labour policies in place and have formed organisations such as the Eliminating Child Labour in Tobacco Growing Foundation (recognised by the UN), their actions have brought little change and are largely cosmetic, claims Marty Otañez, associate professor at the University of Colorado Denver. He has been working on the subject for 20 years and has done research in Malawi, Bolivia, Argentina, Tanzania, India and Kenya. “There is a disconnect between what company representatives say they do and what they actually do,” he alleged. “In every segment during the tobacco production process, you find different magnitudes of child labour.” Otañez said governments were often complicit because they did not want to deter overseas investors and relied on tobacco tax revenues. Tobacco companies wouldn’t be able to maintain their current rate of profits without the use of cheap labour, he added. British American Tobacco (BAT), which became the world’s biggest listed tobacco company following its $49bn (£42bn) takeover of Reynolds American last year, the Marlboro maker Philip Morris International (PMI), the Virginia-based Altria, Japan Tobacco International (JTI), and Britain’s Imperial Brands made combined profits before tax of nearly £20bn last year. A report entitled Bitter Harvest published in April by Human Rights Watch (HRW) said there was widespread child labour in tobacco farms in Zimbabwe, where multinationals such as BAT, JTI and Imperial buy tobacco. The NGO said this was consistent with its findings in Kazakhstan, the US and Indonesia. A 2016 report by the not-for-profit organisation Swedwatch revealed widespread child labour across BAT operations in Bangladesh. BAT said its follow-up review last year found no evidence of child labour in Bangladesh, and that its main supplier in Zimbabwe, Northern Tobacco, would undergo an external review this year by AB Sustain. The HRW report is based on interviews with 64 small-scale tobacco farmers and 61 hired workers in Zimbabwe, one of the world’s largest producers of tobacco. It reported many farmers and workers, including children as young as 11, complained of symptoms consistent with acute nicotine poisoning, such as sickness, headaches and dizziness, from absorbing nicotine through their skin while handling tobacco plants. They had not been told how to prevent and treat the condition, HRW said. Workers also handled pesticides without adequate protective equipment, the report said. All the tobacco firms say they have training policies. At BAT’s annual general meeting (AGM) in London in April, the company’s board was grilled over its record on child labour. Sunniva Guatvik from the UK responsible-investment charity ShareAction said the two studies “show a gap between BAT’s policy commitments and continued, severe impacts on children in tobacco cultivation communities”. The BAT chairman, Richard Burrows, said the board was “very sympathetic” to the issues raised. But, he added, “you will find BAT has not got any questions to answer in respect of these issues”. He insisted: “Human rights is something we take very seriously as a company and as a board.” Guatvik asked BAT to publish more detailed information on how the situation was being monitored. Burrows said the company was meeting all the objectives set out by ShareAction, but the charity told the Guardian this was not the case. Hazel Cheeseman, director of the anti-smoking charity Ash, also weighed in at the AGM, asking the company to clarify its position on child labour. BAT said its policy explicitly prohibited anyone under the age of 18 from undertaking tasks that involve direct contact with green tobacco, but it allowed those under 18 to carry out “non-hazardous tasks associated with tobacco growing”. Jacqueline Baroncini of the International Union of Food and Allied Workers asked how the company could be sure that no children under 18 were working on farms supplying tobacco to BAT. Burrows reiterated that the programmes in place and the audits carried out assured him the policy was adhered to. Otañez proposes an action plan that calls for tobacco companies and leaf buyers to allow better monitoring of their supply chains; fairer labour arrangements on farms, including collective bargaining rights; and help for farmers to switch away from tobacco to growing food crops. In its report, HRW said most of the tobacco companies it had contacted now had policies banning children from activities involving direct contact with green tobacco. However, none of the companies prohibited children from handling dried tobacco, which has been linked to respiratory symptoms, such as coughing, difficulty breathing or tightness in the chest. BAT told the Guardian that it does not allow under 18s to handle dried tobacco when there is a risk to their health. Baldemar Velasquez, who in 1967 set up the Farm Labor Organizing Committee (Floc), which represents 10,000 migrant workers across several US states such as Kentucky and North Carolina, said the union had been talking to BAT for the last four years about improving pay and working conditions for those working in tobacco fields. “We as farm workers do the most arduous jobs in this industry,” he told shareholders at the AGM. Floc is pushing for collective bargaining, higher tobacco pricing, better accommodation and better shower facilities for farm workers. Some farms have showers, but not enough, Velasquez told the Guardian after the AGM. “There are three to four showers for 30 to 40 workers, and the heating unit runs out after two to three showers and it takes a couple of hours to heat up again. So workers wait or don’t shower at all.” Velasquez, 71, started working on farms at the age of six, picking fruit and later tobacco – one of hundreds of thousands of children who joined their migrant parents working long hours in the fields in the US. He stressed the “need for proper bathing facilities to wash nicotine off in order not to get the green tobacco sickness”. A BAT spokesperson said Reynolds American took farm worker welfare “extremely seriously” and was committed to ensuring its supply chain was fully compliant with relevant laws. “All farm workers have access to washing facilities, and Reynolds American also ensures that workers receive the required training and personal protective equipment to protect them from green tobacco sickness.” Farm labourers have no collective bargaining rights in the US, and child labour is legal on farms. Children as young as 12 can start working unlimited hours outside of school, and children of any age can work on small or family-owned tobacco farms. Velasquez said the stagnant tobacco price was a major problem, arguing that if farms were paid a fair price for their tobacco, they could invest in better facilities. The five big tobacco companies said child labour was unacceptable and that they were working hard to stop it happening in their supply chain. They said they were encouraging farmers to grow other crops, but added that tobacco gave farms a better income. A BAT spokesperson said: “We agree contracts with farmers at the beginning of each growing season – this not only guarantees that we buy their tobacco crop at a fair price, but also ensures farmers have a regular and secure income throughout the season, protecting them from market fluctuations.” He added: “Growing tobacco for BAT is something the farmers we work with choose to do, and 90% of our farmers also grow other crops such as fruit, wheat and cotton.” JTI said a contracted farmer in Malawi would earn three times more harvesting one hectare of tobacco compared with one hectare of groundnuts. Altria, which sources 70% of its leaf in the US, told the Guardian it was committed to addressing concerns about child labour and had taken “significant steps”. It said last year it had distributed 75,000 isolation gowns to tackle risks of green tobacco sickness and that its contracts required growers to comply with laws and regulations that protect workers. PMI said it had been “making progress” in tackling complex issues on farms supplying to the company and had been working with partners to make improvements for workers. Contractors in the US must meet labour requirements, it added. International labour standards state that children under 18 should be prohibited from hazardous work. According to the latest International Labour Organization estimates, 152 million children are still involved in child labour around the world. The vast majority, 108 million children (71%), are working in the agricultural sector, including tobacco growing."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/jun/05/the-martyrs-did-it-bloody-end-to-indian-copper-plant-saga","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-05T04:00:36Z","webTitle":"'The martyrs did it': bloody end to Indian copper plant saga","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/05/the-martyrs-did-it-bloody-end-to-indian-copper-plant-saga","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/05/the-martyrs-did-it-bloody-end-to-indian-copper-plant-saga","fields":{"headline":"'The martyrs did it': bloody end to Indian copper plant saga","bodyText":"David and Goliath are familiar characters in Tuticorin. The south Indian city, home to one of the country’s oldest Christian communities, has been fighting a giant. Days after 13 protesters were fatally gunned down by police, including a teenage girl, activists won a key victory over one of the world’s largest mining companies. For more than two decades, Sterlite, a subsidiary of the London-listed Vedanta Resources, has been operating a copper smelter on the outskirts of the city. Over the same period, activists have been arguing the site is fouling Tuticorin’s air and water, and has caused unnaturally high cancer rates in surrounding villages. Last Monday, Fatima Babu, a leader in the movement, had been touring affected villages when she got the news the Tamil Nadu chief minister was ordering the plant permanently closed. “Until last week I never thought it could happen so easily,” she told the Guardian minutes after finding out, as people around her wept and cheered. “Only after the loss of lives did I think things could take a turn. The martyrs have done it.” Victory did not come cheap. On 20 May, tens of thousands of residents turned out for the largest protests against Vedanta ever staged in the city. Police allege the protesters became violent, hurling stones, torching cars and threatening to burn public buildings. Officers opened fire, killing 13 people over two days, including a teenage girl. It was a bloody climax to a 23-year struggle that began in fishing boats on the Indian ocean, frequently faced defeat, and was at times kept alive by Babu alone, a teacher who spent years pursuing the campaign in the evenings after work. Against them was one of India’s most powerful corporations, run by the billionaire Anil Agarwal, which was frequently accused of running roughshod over the small communities that surround its bauxite mines, alumina refineries and copper smelters. Though it does most of its business in India, Vedanta is listed on the London stock exchange, where its most recent half-yearly profits were $1.7bn. In Pandarampatty, a village not far from the plant, residents claim 200 people have been diagnosed with cancer since 1996. That was the year the Vedanta plant opened in Tuticorin, after pressure from villagers in Maharashtra state forced a shift from its original site there. The morning after the announcement of the plant’s closure, few in the village were celebrating. Rosalin, who like others would only give her first name, was still recovering from her latest dose of chemotherapy. Last year she was diagnosed with breast cancer, and underwent a mastectomy nine hours’ drive away in Chennai. “It doesn’t feel like we’ve won,” she said. “I’ll be living with this for the rest of my life.” Jasmine, a friend, agreed: “We feel this [the closure announcement] was a publicity stunt from the government. It was just for TV. In six months, they will let them re-open.” Vedanta says it has not decided whether to appeal against the government’s decision to close the plant. A few metres away, their neighbour, Mary, lay on a charpoy bed in the shade, taking shallow breaths. She had been diagnosed with emphysema, which she blamed on decades of breathing air polluted by the chimneys of the nearby factory. Whether Vedanta is to blame for their illnesses is difficult to establish. The plant has been temporarily shut several times after suspected leaks of noxious chemicals. In 2013 it was closed again and Vedanta was fined £10m after a court ruled the plant was operating without the consent of environmental authorities. It re-opened after a team of experts judged it was not polluting beyond its legal limits. A Tirunelveli medical college study 10 years ago found villagers around the plant had higher rates of asthma, bronchitis, and ear, nose and throat infections, and that iron levels in their groundwater were up to 20 times higher than acceptable limits. Vedanta denies any link between its plant and health problems in surrounding villages, maintaining the facility “has been operating within all applicable environmental regulations and standards”. It says cancer rates in Tuticorin are lower than the state average. “Any allegation linking the incidents of cancer and marine pollution with Sterlite Copper are unfounded,” it said in a statement. “We are a zero liquid discharge company and do not affect the marine ecosystem in any manner.” Nor do monthly water samples, taken from around the plant by environmental authorities, show any trace of copper, zinc or other pollutants, it says. Tuticorin is a hub for a number of other polluting industries including fertiliser, thermal power and caustic soda. The difficulty, say environmental scientists, is that a study has never been carried out looking into the health impact of these industries. The Tamil Nadu government also lacks the expertise to seriously monitor and mitigate most environmental damage. “There is no capability in this state to undertake a rigorous and scientific environmental impact assessment,” says Jayshree Vencatasan, a scientist and managing trustee at the Care Earth Trust, a conservation group. “We just don’t have organisations with the scientific and technical capability to do it.” The first in Tuticorin to turn against the smelter were the fishermen, who feared its wastewater was being dumped in the ocean. In 1997, hundreds of fishing boats formed a shield around the port, preventing two Australian vessels from berthing with copper ore. The same year, activists say gas from the plant leaked into a neighbouring flour mill, hospitalising about 20 people and prompting the government to briefly shut the smelter. By that time, Babu, a literature teacher at a local college, was spearheading a campaign against the facility, organising protests and trying to fuse disparate concerns about the smelter into a larger movement. “Whenever we heard of some misdeed by Sterlite we would come out in the streets, make a lot of noise, go on fasts,” she recalls. She maintained her opposition even as the protests died down, running what she calls a “single person struggle” from her home, “hoping and trusting something good would come out of it”. “The lowest point was in 2013, when there was a gas leak and the entire town was impacted,” she said. “I believed we were finally at the end of the road, Sterlite was going to go, but somehow, it fizzled out. People thought you can’t do anything about this company, it was too powerful for us. “They got over the impact and went on as if nothing happened.” Then, in September 2016, Vedanta applied to double the capacity of the plant, making it the largest copper smelter in the country. It ignited latent anger in the city, which Babu says was compounded by mounting health problems in many families. Social media, another new factor, helped spread information and coordinate protests. Early this year, activists launched a 100-day campaign to stop the government granting Vedanta approval to expand the plant. Its final day was 21 May, when tens of thousands of people marched in the streets and were fired on by police. Outrage over their killings turned the smelter in Tuticorin into a national issue. One week later, its gates were sealed. In the city’s government hospital this week, dozens of people were still in beds recovering from injuries they sustained during last week’s violence. “All because this one company has polluted our air, water and soil, we’ve had to suffer like this,” one woman, Nandini, says. Her husband lies nearby, his face still bruised from being struck by police clubs. “I will fight more if I have to,” she says.

Even so, his solution to the problem of co-owners having opinions is severe: Sorrell’s complete control of S4 Capital, his new quoted venture, will be cemented via his sole ownership of a “B” share with the power to silence all formal dissent. As the document detailing the reverse takeover of cash shell Derriston puts it, the “B” share will give Sorrell the right to “ensure no shareholder resolutions are proposed (save as required by law) or passed without his consent”. That will make the annual meetings dull affairs and, in Sorrell’s shoes, you can understand why he would prefer things that way. In his many “I am an owner” outbursts at WPP, he always seemed to resent the fact that his stake was diluted down from 15% at launch in 1985 to 2% in the later years. At S4 he will start with 75% of the regular class of share but, if the acquisitions roll in as intended, he can be diluted to minority status but still retain absolute authority. The “B” share arrangement will last for 14 years, or until he retires or dies. The backers, including Schroders, Miton, Lombard Odier and Lord Rothschild, are therefore taking a calculated gamble that it is worth their while to sign away their normal voting rights in the hope that an unchained Sorrell will succeed in his attempt to build “a multinational communication services business focused on growth”. The plot may indeed turn out happily but the fan club is taking a few obvious risks. The first is that S4 will achieve lift-off. During the turn-of-the-century market mania, four famous business figures led by Archie Norman, now the chair of M&amp;S, took over a cash shell called Knutsford with the aim of buying a major retailer but got precisely nowhere. S4’s investors have signed non-binding commitments to supply another £150m of capital on top of the initial £50m but that doesn’t buy much in today’s advertising world. Second, you have to believe Sorrell’s deal-making skills are as sharp as they were in WPP’s glory years. Lest we forget, WPP’s share price fell by a third in his final year in charge. It’s one thing to talk about the theoretical model for a 21st century digital marketing agency; it’s another to assemble the best pieces from scratch at decent prices. The third risk comes from the undisclosed allegations of personal misconduct against Sorrell, which he denied, but which preceded his resignation last month. WPP and Sorrell have signed non-disclosure agreements and the backers can comfort themselves that their new leader departed with “good leaver” status. Yet the investors cannot possibly judge the business or reputational risks for S4 that would flow from eventual disclosure, which is probably more likely to happen than not. In the circumstances, surrendering basic rights to hold the boss to account is extremely generous. There is no need for RBS rush job So much for theory that the Royal Bank of Scotland chief executive, Ross McEwan, would quit now that the bank has settled with the US Department of Justice and can contemplate paying dividends again. It is the other member of the double act, the finance director, Ewen Stevenson, who has resigned “to take up an opportunity elsewhere”. McEwan could still follow Stevenson out of the door, of course, but one must assume the chairman, Howard Davies, has secured a pledge that he’s staying. Near-simultaneous departures are not the done thing and would probably delay the government’s plan to flog a few RBS shares. Even as things stand, the sell-off may be on hold until upsets in the Italy bond market, which have knocked banks’ share prices across Europe, have cleared. RBS has slipped from 296p to 276p since the middle of last week and the odd 20p matters when the nation’s stake is worth the thick end of £25bn. Wait for a rising market, chancellor. We’ve owned RBS for a decade and clearing the stock will take another five years at least. There is no need to rush."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"}]}}
