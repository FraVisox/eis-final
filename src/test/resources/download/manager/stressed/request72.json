Senior figures in Scottish Labour, the Liberal Democrats and Scottish Greens have written to ministers questioning their decision to give the royal family extra rights to read all freedom of information requests (FoI) that refer to them and to then screen responses before they are issued. The rules, seen by the Guardian, wrongly imply this is an absolute requirement for all Scottish public bodies and government agencies. The rules state: “You must liaise with the royal household whenever the information requested relates to any royal matters,” adding this must happen as soon as possible. The then Scottish information commissioner said the rules went further than legislation required. Rosemary Agnew opposed the Scottish government’s decision to apply special privileges to the royal family, saying the proposals were unnecessary and misleading. Ministers nonetheless introduced them last December. Her objections came to light after the Guardian revealed last month that Scottish ministers refused to release correspondence with the Prince of Wales showing that he lobbied them by letter and in person to support the charity Teach First. Agnew twice told ministers these rules went beyond statutory requirements to consult with third parties set out in legislation agreed by the Scottish parliament. In a joint letter to ministers, Neil Findlay for Labour, Patrick Harvie, the co-leader of the Scottish Green party, and Tavish Scott, the former Scottish Lib Dem leader, said they feared these rules could also allow the royal family to sidestep controls coming into force soon to ensure all lobbying of ministers and Scottish parliament is transparent and recorded. Agnew told ministers their FoI code of conduct rightly made clear that it was not always appropriate or necessary for outside bodies or third parties to be consulted about a request under the Freedom of Information (Scotland) Act 2002 (FoISA). “The new text suggests that the royal household should always be consulted. This is not a requirement under FoISA and the suggested text could misleadingly create the impression that it is,” she said. Agnew is now Scotland’s public services ombudsman, and her replacement as information commissioner, Daren Fitzhenry, is due to take office in mid-October. The three MSPs asked Joe Fitzpatrick, the Scottish government’s minister for parliamentary business: “Can you please explain why such special privileges have been built into the code despite there being no statutory requirement to do so, and why you ignored the advice of Rosemary Agnew on this matter?” They said the issue should be included in an independent review of the Scottish government’s FoI policies, which Fitzpatrick and SNP MSPs agreed should be set up in a vote at Holyrood in June but has not yet begun. On Tuesday, Holyrood’s standards and procedures committee wrote to Fitzpatrick asking when the inquiry would take place. The committee’s chair, Clare Adamson MSP, told him the committee felt the new commissioner should be asked to conduct a full review once he takes up his post. Scottish ministers insist the FoI system in Scotland is more liberal than UK government legislation, which has a blanket ban on the release of any correspondence relating to the three most senior members of the Royal family. A Scottish government spokesman said the legislation in Scotland was “the broadest in the UK and ensures that there is no blanket exemption for the Royal Household, and that no veto can be applied to the release of such information.” “All FoIs are considered in line with the independent information commissioner’s code of practice and FoI legislation, including contacting third parties. It is for MSPs to determine any post-legislative scrutiny of the Freedom of Information Act not the government.” The total exemption for the royals at UK level was introduced when the Guardian challenged in court a refusal by ministers to release dozens of letters from Prince Charles to ministers, known as the “black spider memos” due to his scrawling handwriting."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2017/sep/09/post-brexit-uncertainty-views-from-the-hospitality-industry","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-09T07:00:01Z","webTitle":"A hotel with a view: 'Brexit could tip us over the edge'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/sep/09/post-brexit-uncertainty-views-from-the-hospitality-industry","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/sep/09/post-brexit-uncertainty-views-from-the-hospitality-industry","fields":{"headline":"A hotel with a view: 'Brexit could tip us over the edge'","bodyText":"The Queensberry, a boutique hotel in Bath, has 38 full-time employees, about half of whom are foreign nationals. French, Germans, Lithuanians and Spaniards work in harmony together. But amid continuing uncertainty about European Union citizens’ right to remain in the UK after Brexit they are reconsidering the future. Some fear they may be forced to leave; while others do not see how the businesses such as the Queensberry will continue to thrive if the proposals come into force. Peter Gosi, 33, porter, Hungary I think Brexit is the most stupid thing ever. I just can’t take it seriously. The UK will suffer. The EU needs the UK but I think the UK needs Europe more. There are a lot of European people who bring skills to the UK. I moved to England in 2010. I had a job to go to at hotel in the Lake District. I was a stonemason in Hungary but my qualification wasn’t recognised here so I came to Bath to go to college. I did a three-year diploma and since then have worked as a stonemason, also as a fisherman and now back at a hotel. During my time in England I’ve only been out of a job for two weeks tops. I’ve blended in, I’ve paid my taxes, my national insurance. I feel I do useful work. There is no proper information about what is going to happen next. I know people who have been here for 25 years and they are worried they’ll be sent home. I’ve got friends from Hungary who talk about coming over but I advise them not to. There was that leaked information about some workers only been able to stay for two years. That will stop people from coming. It feels strange at the moment. I was walking around Bristol and saw this man in a T-shirt that said: “Send them all back.” That was odd to see. I’ve got a son here now so in a good way I think I’m stuck here. I feel I’ve got experience so will be able to stay. I can always go to sea again if I need to. But it’s the UK that will lose out. I feel the government has no clue what to do. They are lost. I don’t think they can handle the situation. Magaly Etter, 32, hotel manager, Switzerland At first when Brexit happened I thought, oh well, I’m Swiss. We’re not in Europe anyway, I thought it might take a few years to sort out but it would be all right. I’m not so sure now. All kinds of people from all sorts of nationalities work in our industry. If European nationals can’t come here as easily it will be very difficult. Hotels will definitely struggle – we already fight to get the right staff. I’m not sure we’d find enough British people to do this work. You have to be welcoming and willing and prepared to work long hours. You need to love working in hotels and serving people to work in hospitality. It might get difficult. There are lots of skills needed in the hospitality industry – technical skills and human skills. Of course, there are British people with those skills but I’m not sure there’s enough. I’ve been in England for more than three years and I love it. But I’m a globetrotter. If it doesn’t work here, I can go somewhere else. I’ve worked in six, seven countries already. I’m happy but if things change and I begin to feel more insecure I can move on – and possibly take someone with me. I’ve joked with my [British] partner that we may have to get married to allow me to stay. But in reality he may leave too. He’s a clinical researcher and can apply his skills in another country. That would not be good for the UK. Lucas Galvao, 26, chef, Portugal I hadn’t heard of Brexit when I arrived four months before the vote. Lots of Portuguese people moved to France or Switzerland to work. I wanted to come here. I wanted to improve my English, learn about British culture and I’ve enjoyed my time here; it’s been a good experience. It can be hard work. Some days we work 16 hours a day, sometimes I don’t have time to eat but it’s a good challenge. I think it’s true that a lot of people wouldn’t do that kind of work. I think British people don’t always understand how skilled hospitality workers are. My girlfriend is also Portuguese and she came after Brexit. I think I’m okay, I’ll be able to stay but we’re not sure about her. We don’t know if she’ll have to get a visa. We’re waiting to hear what will happen but I don’t think our embassy knows. I think everyone was surprised when Brexit happened – English people, foreign people, everyone. I’ve thought of settling here, making my future here. Perhaps buy a house and open my own restaurant. But things are getting better economically in Portugal so I may move back there. Like the Portuguese, the English love their restaurants. They’ll spend a day in the pub, talking with friends, talking of serious things, like politics. In 20 years maybe the chefs won’t be here and British gastronomy will suffer. Laurence Beere, owner, UK I’m terrified at what is happening. I’ve been in this industry for almost 30 years. We’ve always had recruitment challenges but it’s as bad now as it’s ever been and that’s before Brexit kicks in. It’s hard enough now to fill vacancies. Right now we are advertising for a porter, a room attendant, a part-time turn-down attendant, two chefs, a kitchen porter and two full-time restaurant staff. At one stage as the owner of this business I spent four months working in the kitchen while trying to recruit staff. The industry has always been built on international labour. Restaurants were serviced by Italians, Germans were in the back office. A lot of it is to do with hospitality being treated as much more of a profession in Europe. In the UK we struggle with the difference between service and servitude. It is a highly skilled industry. You go in the kitchen and see what skill is involved. There is a complete misconception that we have a whole lot of foreign nationals who have taken our jobs and there is this huge population that is desperate to get work. Here in Bath unemployment is virtually non-existent. You hear people saying the Poles have come and taken our jobs. I’m very glad they have come. They’ve left their homes and country to work here. I don’t see anyone from Merthyr Tydfil coming here to do that. British people don’t see hospitality as a career or profession. I don’t think anyone is listening to us. The mentality seems to exist that we’ll be okay – stiff upper lips lads, we’re British, we’ll be fine. I don’t think it will be. I can’t say to my staff it’ll be all right because I don’t believe it. By voting for Brexit we’ve put up a big signpost saying: ‘We don’t want you.’ The arrogance that our political leaders are showing beggars belief. The industry is already struggling; Brexit could tip us over the the edge."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/sep/11/nus-president-shakira-martin-tuition-fees-single-mother-working-class-students-middle-class-feminism","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-11T14:23:55Z","webTitle":"NUS president Shakira Martin: ‘This goes way beyond tuition fees.

We are talking about class’","bodyText":"The new president of the National Union of Students (NUS) has not yet met the universities minister, but it would be fun to be a fly on the wall when they finally come face to face. Shakira Martin and Jo Johnson could not come from more contrasting backgrounds: Johnson went to Eton and Balliol College, Oxford, Martin studied at a comprehensive in Catford and Lewisham Southwark College, a further education (FE) college. And although much of what Martin says will be familiar to the minister – on tuition fees, student debt and mental health – she clearly has her own priorities and her own way of articulating them. A single mother of two who left home at 16, Martin finished school with one GCSE in Religious Studies. After several false starts, she returned to college where she became active in student politics and is now determined to represent the working-class community she grew up in; she is the first woman from an African-Caribbean background to become NUS president and only the second not to have studied at university. When she talks about the barriers facing poorer students and overcoming adversity, she quotes the Canadian rapper Drake (“Started from the bottom, now we’re here”). When you ask her about government claims of record-breaking numbers of disadvantaged students at university, she retorts: “I find that very disrespectful. God save the minister that comes to me and says: ‘Shakira, widening participation has gone up in university.’ Um, excuse me? How many of those [students] are staying in university, how many are getting firsts at university, how many of those are going into quality jobs?” Not enough, is the implication. And she has some advice for the UK’s two most elite universities, which recently topped the Times Higher Education World University Rankings: “Oxbridge, get a proper strategy to get more BME [black and minority ethnic] students in your institutions. It’s just not good enough. People like me, I would never think I could get to those type of universities.” Martin agrees that sexual harassment and violence against women is a major issue in higher education and commends the work done by her NUS colleagues. But her concern extends beyond university campuses. “I have spoken to FE students who have been victims of sexual harassment, but they have not even identified it as that.” She describes the case of a young college student who has been thrown out by her mother and is staying at the house of a friend who is pressurising her for sex. “She’s feeling like she has to sleep with a boy to keep a roof over her head. This young girl is being sexually harassed and doesn’t even know that’s what it is.” Asked about her views on feminism, Martin says: “I call myself a feminist. I believe in equality. I will stand up for women all day every day.” But she says the language of feminism belongs to the middle class. Go to Brockley and Peckham in south London, she says, and the young women in her community are more likely to be talking about Femfresh than feminism. “The terminology of feminism is a very middle-class terminology. What we need to do is start breaking down the terminologies that represent people, but they don’t even know that it represents them.” She jokes about muddling up intersectionality and intersexuality, and says she only understands all this stuff because of her work in the sector. “There are a lot of things we shouldn’t assume that people already know. We are very elitist.” Martin is especially concerned about student mental health and she quotes recent research by the Association of Colleges that found that 100% of FE colleges had reported students diagnosed with depression. “One hundred per cent,” she says with emphasis, “Not even a condom is 100%. That is an epidemic.” Martin represents a genuinely fresh voice in the NUS. While she is vehemently opposed to tuition fees and spiralling vice-chancellor pay, her mission is to highlight the economic, cultural and social barriers that deter poorer students from going to university, and the poverty and adversity they face if they do. “This goes way beyond tuition fees,” she says. “We are talking about class. The government does not talk about class, it talks about poverty. Working-class people and those from marginalised backgrounds, even if they go on to education, it doesn’t mean they have made it – they still have to struggle every single day. “I am NUS president now,” she says. “If I don’t use this opportunity and try to make the most of it – when I leave here, I will be Shakira Nobody, and nobody will care about me. This job brings a certain social capital that I will never have when I am back in my community.” It seems unlikely she will ever be Shakira Nobody. It is still early in her term in office at the NUS but the mother of two nurtures ambitions to become principal of an FE college and she would like, at some point, to go to university to study. “Forget Mrs,” she says. “The only title I want is PhD or MA. No man can take that away from me.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"environment/2017/sep/11/campaigner-challenges-ineos-in-court-over-order-curbing-fracking-protests","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-11T14:43:09Z","webTitle":"Campaigner to fight Ineos in court over order curbing fracking protests","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/sep/11/campaigner-challenges-ineos-in-court-over-order-curbing-fracking-protests","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/sep/11/campaigner-challenges-ineos-in-court-over-order-curbing-fracking-protests","fields":{"headline":"Campaigner to fight Ineos in court over order curbing fracking protests","bodyText":"A second campaigner is challenging a sweeping injunction obtained by a petrochemicals giant against anti-fracking activists that has been criticised for profoundly limiting protests. Joe Boyd, an anti-fracking campaigner, is going to the high court in London on Tuesday in an attempt to stop the injunction which has been secured by the multinational firm, Ineos. He is appealing to the public for donations as he could face a large bill if he loses. Another campaigner, Joe Corré, the son of the fashion designer Vivienne Westwood, announced last week that he was challenging the legality of the injunction that he denounced as “draconian, anti-democratic and oppressive”. Whether the injunction is allowed to stand may have implications for the ability of campaigners in general to protest against the conduct of corporate firms. The injunction secured by Ineos warns protesters that they face being imprisoned, fined or having their assets seized if they obstruct the firm’s fracking operations. Addressed to “persons unknown”, it applies to all campaigners and forbids them from harassing Ineos staff and contractors in any way or interfering with their lawful activities. Ineos, which is seeking to become one of the biggest frackers in the UK, secured the temporary injunction in July at an unpublicised high court hearing, at which no campaigners had the chance to challenge the legal move. The hearing to consider whether to make the injunction permanent comes at a time of frequent protests against the fracking industry, which is struggling to attract widespread support. Ineos said the injunction was justified to “protect people on and around our sites and supply chain”. It said it had presented extensive evidence showing that unlawful protests were “both imminent and real”. A spokesman said: “It is our duty to prevent risks to the safety of the public as well as our staff. We also will not accept our staff and contractors being intimidated and threatened. Taking this action was the responsible and right thing to do.” It said the injunction had not altered anyone’s right to peaceful protest. However this claim is disputed by protesters. Boyd said the injunction would be “an unprecedented and long-term affront to our right to lawful protest”. He highlighted how the injunction specifically prohibits a campaigning tactic in which protesters walk slowly in front of lorries to delay deliveries. “An arrest for breach of this injunction, which could simply be for slow walking on a public pavement outside a protest site, will be in contempt of court and the protester will be liable for up to six months imprisonment and/or a fine up to £5,000,” Boyd said. Campaigners who challenge the injunction could face a legal bill to pay for all the lawyers at any court hearing if they lose. Boyd, a 44-year-old student from Liverpool, said he would be unable to pay such a bill and so he is asking for donations from the public through a crowdfunding appeal on Crowdjustice, which funds legal cases. Campaigners from the environmental group Friends of the Earth and the human rights group Liberty have also warned that the injunction could have a chilling impact on lawful protests. They have written to Ineos demanding that they urgently clarify its scope. Friends of the Earth campaigner Guy Shrubsole said grassroots campaigners had been left “confused and fearful of falling foul of its broad yet vague terms. We’re talking about grandmothers with placards being afraid of getting locked up for years, simply for trying peacefully to protect their local environment.” • If you would like to pass on information in confidence, you can send a message via the Guardian’s SecureDrop service (see how here)."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2017/sep/09/jacob-rees-mogg-is-a-deadbeat-dad-says-harriet-harman","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-09T05:00:01Z","webTitle":"Jacob Rees-Mogg is a 'deadbeat dad', says Harriet Harman","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/sep/09/jacob-rees-mogg-is-a-deadbeat-dad-says-harriet-harman","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/sep/09/jacob-rees-mogg-is-a-deadbeat-dad-says-harriet-harman","fields":{"headline":"Jacob Rees-Mogg is a 'deadbeat dad', says Harriet Harman","bodyText":"Harriet Harman has accused Jacob Rees-Mogg of being a “deadbeat dad” and demanded that parliament change its rules to allow MPs six months of paid leave after having a child. Labour’s former deputy leader criticised the Tory MP after he said he was no “modern man” and had never changed a nappy following the birth of his sixth child, Sixtus. “Men who don’t change nappies are deadbeat dads – and that includes Jacob Rees-Mogg,” said Harman, who is campaigning for MPs to be allowed to have a formal maternity or paternity leave system for the first time. She said MPs had reformed workplaces across the UK but failed to sort their own house out. “What model of fatherhood do we want parliament to portray? The ‘Rees-Mogg model’ or the modern father who – as well as the mother – is involved with a newborn,” said Harman. Rees-Mogg hit back immediately, saying he would “lose little sleep over Harriet Harman’s disapproval”. The Tory MP, described by some as a future leader of his party, added: “I should’ve been surprised if it was otherwise.” The spat between the MPs comes in same week that the increasingly high-profile Rees-Mogg said he was against same-sex marriage and abortion in all circumstances – even rape – pitching himself firmly on the hard right of Conservative opinion. Harman, who has been named mother of the House of Commons due to her length of service, argued that Westminster was hypocritical on the parenting issue. “Parliament sets the framework for maternity and paternity leave but we don’t practice what we preach. We have to walk the talk.” First elected to her south London seat in 1982, Harman was one of the first MPs to breastfeed her children in the Commons. But she said she felt she had lost out by not being able to take any paid time off after the birth of her three children. “Eighteen months maternity leave within that time for three children doesn’t seem too much to ask. Without maternity leave I lost out. I felt my babies lost out. It’s long overdue to sort this out” she said. She said MPs who were new parents should be allowed to nominate a Westminster colleague to cast their votes in parliament in their absence and appoint a representative within the constituency to handle meetings and casework. Other female MPs agreed that parliament’s system needed reform. Rachel Reeves, a Labour MP, said she was shocked to open her payslip and realise that her wages had suddenly been slashed with no warning after her staff asked for permission to sign off letters for her soon after she had given birth. She also faced an email campaign against her for failing to turn up to a vote, resulting eventually in an apology. “I would welcome clarification and a more formal system would be better for children, parents and constituents,” she added. Lucy Powell, who was elected to Manchester Central in a 2012 byelection when she was 14 weeks’ pregnant, said she faced media criticism because it was not understood that she had taken time off for maternity. She said the Sun newspaper had branded her Britain’s second-laziest MP because they looked at her voting record and didn’t realise she was on leave. “They had to issue a full apology,” she said. She returned to Westminster when her baby, Tom, was four months old. But Powell said it was not always simple to expect that somebody else could take over the MP’s role on a temporary basis. “The difficulty is the accountability and representation. You are an elected representative and you are an MP even when you are not at work. It is not a normal job,” she said. Harman is hoping that she will get her reforms though with the support of the Speaker, John Bercow, and leader of the House, Andrea Leadsom, both of whom have been supportive of making parliament more family friendly."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"global-development/2017/sep/12/smugglers-make-test-runs-with-migrants-across-even-more-deadly-black-sea-route-romania","type":"article","sectionId":"global-development","sectionName":"Global development","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-12T06:00:27Z","webTitle":"Smugglers make test runs with migrants across deadly Black Sea route","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2017/sep/12/smugglers-make-test-runs-with-migrants-across-even-more-deadly-black-sea-route-romania","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2017/sep/12/smugglers-make-test-runs-with-migrants-across-even-more-deadly-black-sea-route-romania","fields":{"headline":"Smugglers make test runs with migrants across deadly Black Sea route","bodyText":"A dangerous new route for refugees trying to reach Europe is thought to have opened up in the Black Sea, which coastguards in Romania are warning could prove more deadly than existing Mediterranean crossings. As neighbouring countries struggle with the refugee crisis that has prompted millions to flee conflicts in the Middle East, Romania has largely been bypassed. However, events over the past few days suggest its waters are being eyed by smugglers keen to avoid crackdowns elsewhere. On Saturday, the Romanian coastguard intercepted a fishing boat in the Black Sea with 97 migrants on board, 36 of them children. Border police said that they were Iranian and Iraqi nationals, picked up close to the Romanian-Bulgarian sea border. The evening before, coastguards had spotted another boat heading for Romanian territorial waters. The fishing boat, carrying about 120 people, was intercepted by border police and handed over to Turkish coastguards. On 3 September, a fishing boat carrying 87 migrants, was stopped as it sailed towards the Romanian coast on the Black Sea. That boat is believed to have set out from the northern coast of Turkey. The coastguard also intercepted a boat with 68 asylum seekers off the Romanian coast on 21 August. A few days later, 150 Syrian refugees were discovered boarding a fishing boat in Turkey heading for Romania. On 13 August the coastguard had found 69 Iraqi migrants in a boat in Romanian waters. While these numbers remain small compared with the hundreds of thousands who have made the perilous crossing between Turkey and Greece, it could still be a significant development. Romania’s interior minister, Carmen Dan, visited the Black Sea border police last week. “We treat migrants as people who need help, not criminals,” she said. Krzysztof Borowski, a spokesperson for the EU border protection agency Frontex, said it was too early to discuss the incidents as a change in trend, pointing to the limited number of episodes over a short period of time. But he said Frontex was viewing the incident as an attempt by smugglers in Turkey to reactivate the Black Sea route. “In the past it has been used. In 2014 we had 430 people arrive by the Black Sea to Romania and Bulgaria. In 2015 it was 68. In 2016 it was one. Perhaps there is a move to reactivate, for smugglers to put people through there and test it,” he said. According to Borowski, weather conditions on the Black Sea are often worse than in the Mediterranean, with stronger winds. “Migrants are in bigger danger, especially if they take smaller vessels. It is a rough sea and a difficult one to cross,” he said. Gabriela Leu, a spokesperson for UNHCR Romania, says that while it was difficult to draw a conclusion from a handful of incidents, “what is clear is that when legal avenues are closed, people fleeing war and persecution take desperate measures to find safety”. She said that the agency was very concerned about all refugees and migrants who take to the sea in unseaworthy boats, and especially about people who entrust their safety to human smugglers. “The likelihood of dying while trying to reach Europe along people-smuggling routes is alarmingly high.” Romanian authorities have so far taken into custody six individuals on suspicion of human trafficking related to the incidents, including two Turks, a Bulgarian, a Syrian, an Iraqi and a Cyprian. Sea routes are notoriously dangerous. Between January and July 2017, 2,224 migrants died trying to cross the Med, according to the International Organisation for Migration. Border police say no one has died trying to cross into Romania in recent years. Romania, which is outside the Schengen zone, has largely escaped the refugee crisis; few migrants have targeted Romania as an end destination and most have chosen more well-trodden routes to western Europe. However, the number of people trying to cross Romania’s land borders illegally has also been on the rise. According to data from the Romanian border police, in the first seven months of 2017, 2,800 people were caught trying to illegally cross Romania’s borders, up from 1,624 in the whole of 2016. The majority, 1,370 people, were from Iraq, followed by 525 from Syria and 319 from Pakistan. Questions remain over Romania’s preparedness to handle an influx of refugees. The country was one of the nations that initially resisted the setting up of an EU-wide quota in 2015 to redistribute refugees among member states. However, it later agreed to take in around 4,200 asylum seekers. As of the end of August, 727 people had been relocated to Romania, though there are suggestions that many are choosing not to stay in the country due to the limited opportunities. “They don’t want to come to Romania to stay, they just want to get into the EU and then move on,” said Răzvan Samoilă, executive director at Arca, an NGO in Bucharest that offers assistance to refugees and migrants. “It is the same thing with the resettlement procedure,” he said. “Already, we’ve had four groups coming to Romania and none of them are now in Romania.” Samoilă said these latest incidents on the Black Sea are test runs by smugglers, although he believes that the water and weather conditions are against them. “The Mediterranean is not like the Black Sea.

While many of these events are genuine and well attended, others will lead to disappointment on a near-empty dance floor. “Each year, external companies start [advertising events] much earlier than student unions, hoping to lure students into buying unofficial tickets to freshers’ events,” says Angus Carter, marketing manager for Bournemouth University students’ union, who adds that competitors to student unions in the freshers’ industry have learned loopholes that prevent pages being removed for being deceptive or fake. Lucy Tonge, studying at the University of Westminster, was left disappointed after buying tickets to five freshers’ events in London. “My friends and I felt pressured by constant posts saying that 70% of tickets were sold out. The posts then continued for six weeks, so obviously weren’t true,” she says. “We felt he had to buy tickets before they ran out, but it turned out no one was going to them – I don’t know anyone who actually went. We tried to contact the company for a refund but had no luck. I ended up spending over £30.” Thomas Gravatt, studying at the University of Southampton, has a similar story. “I bought tickets in the lead up to freshers’ week. When I got to uni, I realised that all the hype was for nothing – no one else in my flat had bought tickets.” So how can you ensure freshers’ week events won’t leave you out of pocket? Here are some tips: Don’t panic-buy Your students’ union will be working hard to ensure that there will be a range of events for you at your university during freshers’ week. You don’t need to panic about buying tickets before they run out, since organisers should have planned for the right capacity of students. These official events will usually be well attended and are a great opportunity to meet your new flatmates and coursemates. Your union may have also set up a Facebook page, group or event to help you meet people in the lull before university starts and get advice from current students. These official channels are the safest way to connect to others. Don’t allow yourself to be pressured by claims events will run out soon – try to speak to current students to see what they enjoyed during freshers’ week and find out what events your flatmates and coursemates are going to. Look out for misleading advertising Some events companies targeted at freshers use misleading branding to lure in students by creating an illusion of credibility. Private events companies use savvy online branding which can easily deceive. India Edwards, welfare officer for the University of East Anglia’s students’ union, says that UEA has “caught clubs pretending to be students’ union staff and accommodation advisors”. This leaves nervous new students “baffled”, says Edwards. Be careful what information you share online Some unofficial freshers promoters have groups and websites that require users to submit personal information such as phone numbers and email addresses in order to use their services. Jack Robinson, a students’ union officer at the University of East Anglia, says: “[Events] are often attempts to gain personal information from freshers, and tickets never seem to materialise.” Similar warnings have been sent from Lancaster University SU and University of Plymouth SU. Many companies offer no information on how they comply with the Data Protection Act. Follow Guardian Students on Twitter: @GdnStudents.

No other country has five representatives in the competition, not even Spain or Germany, and it is tempting to wonder whether the Premier League really deserves such prominence when actual results in Europe have been generally disappointing in the last few seasons. Yet Manchester United cannot be faulted for taking the Europa League seriously, something English teams have not always done, and though the rather plodding progress towards success in an unmemorable final seemed the upper limit of José Mourinho’s ambition last season the club have not stood still since. A combination of summer strengthening – more than £100m on Romelu Lukaku and Nemanja Matic – and improved performances from last season’s captures Paul Pogba and Henrikh Mkhitaryan have ensured a promising start to the domestic season for United and they now look equipped to compete with the best in Europe. That is not to say Mourinho and his players will be the most successful English side in this Champions League edition, but they probably will not be the first out either. Aside from the uplift in confidence since finishing six points behind Arsenal last season United find themselves in a relatively forgiving group, as do Liverpool. Manchester City, Chelsea and Tottenham are drawn against more illustrious opponents, with the two London clubs facing the stiffest challenge and Spurs in particular tasked with finishing above the holders in Real Madrid and quarter-finalists last season in Borussia Dortmund. Given what happened last year, and Spurs’ continuing acclimatisation to playing at Wembley, it would not be an enormous surprise to see Mauricio Pochettino’s side stutter again. The time to prove otherwise is on Wednesday, when Spurs begin their Champions League campaign with a “home” tie against Dortmund. Win that and they would have more than the Wembley monkey off their back, it would represent a European statement that could be followed up. Drop points, on the other hand, and a familiar scenario would begin to reassert itself. There is no reason why this talented Tottenham side should not make progress in Europe, except that perhaps more than any other member of the English quintet there appears to be conflict within the club about what the season’s priorities should be. All Premier League clubs in Europe have to make their own compromises on this issue, the top end of the domestic league is far too competitive and unrelenting to allow anyone to take their eye off the ball in order to concentrate on their travels in midweek. Indeed it is permissible to speculate whether even Manchester United would have made such regular visits to Champions League summits had the home front been as difficult to dominate as it is at the moment. With at least five credible title contenders in the Premier League it is a tall order for anyone to succeed at home and abroad – even Pep Guardiola and his well-resourced Manchester City side ended up empty handed last season – and for a club such as Spurs, frustratingly close to a first table-topping finish in over half a century, it is easy to see how Europe can be a distraction. That is not to say Pochettino and his players are dismissive of Champions League commitments, just that they will be naturally wary of putting the cart before the horse. It could be argued that Liverpool, without a title in 27 years, are in a similar position, though the key difference is that European football is something of a passion on Merseyside, and, despite the domestic drought, the club saw Champions League success as recently as 2005. Liverpool are past masters in Europe and it usually shows when Champions League football comes around. Any supporter would tell you the priority is the Premier League, and Jürgen Klopp would doubtless agree, but it never feels like that on European nights, especially at Anfield. What Liverpool almost always have going for them in Europe – it might be best to draw a veil over what happened under Brendan Rodgers at Real Madrid three years ago – is desire, belief and a powerful conviction that history can still be made, all of which adds up to a motivation few opponents can match. Klopp is the perfect manager to reinforce the club tradition. Liverpool will always be respected in Europe simply because they respect Europe so much. Chelsea, as runaway English champions, ought to be able to make an impression in Europe, even if Atlético Madrid will act as an uncomfortable reminder of what has gone wrong since Antonio Conte switched formation to win a title in his first season. The Italian clearly made a mistake in telling Diego Costa his time was up, and since then a few more have followed, most notably in missing transfer targets such as Lukaku, Fernando Llorente and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain. The result, particularly with Eden Hazard out injured, is a squad that looks too thin to battle on two fronts, and like Guardiola, who does not have a thin squad, Conte will have to decide at some point what he feels is his best route to success. Had City managed to land Sánchez on the last day of the transfer window they would theoretically have boasted a squad capable of overcoming any challenge, though anyone who has witnessed Guardiola’s side in action knows that it does not always add up to the sum of its parts. Sánchez did not come in any case, and neither did Jonny Evans, and over the course of a season the old failings in defence could prove more significant than the luxury of an extra striker. City will be a force at home and in Europe, though they still look more of a work in progress than genuine candidates to finish on top in either."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"teacher-network/2017/sep/28/how-can-teachers-support-vulnerable-children-at-school","type":"article","sectionId":"teacher-network","sectionName":"Teacher Network","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-28T06:00:31Z","webTitle":"How can teachers support vulnerable children at school?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/teacher-network/2017/sep/28/how-can-teachers-support-vulnerable-children-at-school","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/teacher-network/2017/sep/28/how-can-teachers-support-vulnerable-children-at-school","fields":{"headline":"How can teachers support vulnerable children at school?","bodyText":"In almost every class, there will also be those who find learning a challenge – the children who perhaps cause teachers to wake in the night, or to feel that they are having to manage certain behaviours beyond their usual areas of expertise. In my role working to improve the educational outcomes of vulnerable children and young people – specifically those in care and looked-after by the local authority – I have become aware that many will not be in a good place, emotionally, socially or developmentally, to learn. Although the children I work with represent the tip of the “vulnerable” iceberg, there are numerous other children who are on protection plans or identified as children in need. There will be those, too, who are not known to any service but come to school every day having faced significant hardships.Teachers I work with often report that schools’ more general behaviour policies don’t seem to work for these particular students – so what can we do to best support these children? Here are some pointers. Focus on why Behaviour is always a communication, even though we may not always realise it. Imagine a really bad day – you go home and within minutes you find yourself arguing with someone in your family. You probably didn’t plan to take out your frustration on those closest to you, but that’s effectively what happened. Many vulnerable students are likely to have had times when they haven’t felt safe – and end up reacting to all sorts of triggers in order to keep themselves safe or feel safe (which of course may be very different things). Similarly, they’ve often experienced multiple rejections. Many will have accompanying attachment issues and sometimes will “reject” before they can be rejected. They may push you away because this may be less painful than allowing you to reject them. Or it may be that certain behaviours give them access to a person they are developing an attachment to, so their message is “I need that person”. By acknowledging this, and recognising that what a student needs more than anything is to build relationships that help them feel safe, we may be able to adjust our reactions appropriately. Consider their age and stage Social and emotional levels of development and maturity in vulnerable children often won’t match their chronological age. In schools, we’re usually good at supporting children when they have gaps in their academic learning – and many of the vulnerable students will have these – but they will almost all have some gaps in their social and emotional development. They may not have developed the skills their peers have, and also by virtue of their experiences have developed certain “street-wise” skills that can lead a teacher to think they are much more mature than they are. Bring nurture into itAll children need boundaries, and some of these students either won’t have had those or will have had a lot of inappropriate, overly severe boundaries. But while consistent, firm boundaries can help a child to feel safe, it’s important to remember that nurture also plays a part. By nurture I mean the consistent care that we would expect a parent to give a child. If any of your students end up being among the tiny minority of children who are actually taken into care (approximately half a percent) it seems reasonable to assume that they will not have received the consistent, nurturing parenting that enables physical, mental and emotional wellbeing (it’s also worth noting that the rate of mental disorder among looked-after children is 46.4% as compared to 8.5% in non-disadvantaged children and young people). Some children may need therapeutic intervention but all children, especially those who are vulnerable, would benefit from schools that promote emotional well-being. As teachers, we shouldn’t underestimate the power of smiles, kind words, acceptance following behavioural incidents and appropriate physical proximity. Pick your battles carefully The behaviour of many vulnerable students will be driven by emotions, and their former experiences may impact on how they react to situations. There may also be very few sanctions that will influence them, simply because they may have experienced far worse in their lives to date. I would always avoid a public showdown in front of the class. If you need to talk to a student, choose the time and environment carefully to lessen the conflict, and give yourself space to go over the issues. There may also be some things that they will find hard to do, because of the impact that attachment issues and trauma has had on them. Things like maintaining eye contact or regulating their impulses might be incredibly difficult. There will be children who have experienced issues with attachment in almost every school, so ensuring school staff understand the impact of this would seem an important part of staff development. Virtual schools, focused on the education of looked-after children, will run training on such topics. Look after yourself It might sound obvious, but what vulnerable students need more than anything is consistency. Those students need you to stay well and keep turning up every day to be their teacher or teaching assistant. They need you to be physically present and emotionally robust enough to support them - so it’s important to look after yourself by eating well, exercising, and sleeping well. It’s helpful to make sure you create some form of support group so you have opportunities to discuss with colleagues what went well, what went less well and what new approaches could be tried the next day. Be aware of how you’re doing with the vulnerable children in your class, and seek input from other professionals or further training if necessary.

It beeped. Instead of searching him, he said officials summoned him to one side, demanded to see his passport and, when he repeatedly asked why, threatened to call the police. The reason was eventually explained loudly, he says, in front of other passengers: security staff were unclear whether he was male or female and wanted proof of his sex before deciding which official should search him. “I identify as a gay male,” says Liang. “If you benchmark me against a cage fighter you might consider me to be a bit on the feminine side. ‘Gender-neutral’ is probably the best way to describe me. The protocols of Eurostar St Pancras seem to have an issue with processing passengers like myself. I was treated like a criminal by security pulling me aside and shouting rudely and I was publicly humiliated by being asked private information in front of a large audience.” Liang, who is not transgender, fears that his treatment exposes wider discrimination faced by LGBT travellers . “I was told by the supervisor that he was ‘following company protocol’. If that is the case, Eurostar is doing something really wrong,” he says. “They could have respectfully asked me to verify my sex/gender in private and they didn’t need my passport to find out my preferred choice of male or female attendant for a full body pat down – I told them from the start I was happy to be searched by a male. If I were indeed transgender I would have been humiliatingly outed in public.” Liang’s claims highlight potential difficulties across the international transport network, as bureaucracy and individual security staff attempt to keep pace with gender rights. “We receive many complaints from people who have experienced harassment and discrimination because their presenting gender doesn’t correspond with their passport details,” says Zhan Chiam, gender identity and expression programme officer at ILGA, a federation of international organisations that campaign on LGBT rights. “Policing of gender needs to stop, and security staff sensitised to people’s needs.” Eurostar insists both to Liang and The Observer that its staff are not legally allowed to search passengers of opposite gender. However, when asked to cite the relevant legislation it amends its response and declares that its security processes operate within regulations and industry best practice. “We have a duty of care to protect our teams and the request for travel documents is part of this,” says a spokesperson. “It is carried out to identify gender in a discreet and sensitive way. On this occasion, Mr Liang did not comply with providing the travel documents requested by our teams to resolve the issue.” Liang points out that his passport was inaccessible on the conveyor belt while he was being held behind a cordon. He was eventually patted down by a male officer and allowed to board his train to Brussels. “I was trembling and so distressed by this traumatic experience,” he says. “It kind of ruined my holiday.” Security controls are supposed to check for weapons or illegal substances, but gender becomes an issue when body scans or pat downs reveal an unexpected attribute. Some scanners used in the UK, and all of those at US airports, have to be programmed according to sex and staff are alerted if the scan shows a prosthesis, chest bindings or what the industry refers to as a biological “anomaly”. A transgender writer, Shadi Petosky, live tweeted her ordeal when a scanner at a US airport revealed her genitalia was male. She was forced to be screened a second time after the scanner had been reprogrammed to “male” and missed her flight. Her story prompted dozens of tweets from other travellers who report having had their anatomy publicly questioned and examined. Security firms are privately employed by airports and stations and follow their own protocols, although they have to comply with the Equalities Act which forbids discrimination against trans people. According to the Airport Operators Association, all UK airports allow transgender passengers to be searched in private by staff that correspond with the gender they identify with, and evidence of gender is only rarely required. However, border control, where identities are verified, is where most problems arise for those whose appearance seems at odds with their passport face, according to the LGBT charity Stonewall. The Home Office admits searches may cause “practical difficulties”, and guidance states that the dignity of the individual is paramount. It also recognises a potential conflict of rights and declares that officers must not be forced to search a person who, whilst living in the same gender as the officer, does not share their physical attributes. The UK government, which last year announced that medical evidence is no longer a requirement when changing the gender on a passport, is reviewing the obligation to specify gender at all. This is, however, a requirement by the International Civil Aviation Organisation and any changes would need the agreement of other member countries. Stonewall would like to see the gender options expanded. “Trans people can face unnecessary obstacles because of the way gender is recorded on official documents,” says spokesperson Kim Sanders. “Many are afraid to travel abroad for fear of intrusive questioning or difficulties at passport control. We would like to see legal recognition of non-binary people, including an X category on passports.” Liang continues to press for an official apology from Eurostar in the hope it will change its procedures. “If they wanted to search me it should have been done in private,” he says. “Their reluctance to apologise shows how far we still have to travel. True equality comes not when LGBTQ couples are allowed to marry, but when basic humiliations stop happening in everyday life.” ADVICE WHEN GOING OVERSEAS In large parts of the world LGBT travellers face risks – 72 countries outlaw same-sex relationships and many refuse to allow people to change their gender marker on legal documents. Transgender travellers should therefore be aware of laws and attitudes in their destination country. In some cases it might be wise to take a relevant doctor’s letter or gender recognition certificate, in case officials question perceived disparities between appearance and travel documents. All flight reservations require gender to be specified along with your name, and these details must match those on the passport even if you identify as a different gender. If you have not yet had your passport amended, you will have to book and travel as the name and gender recorded on it. When you pass through security, some items such as prosthetics and bindings may be flagged as an “anomaly”. Official advice is to explain calmly and clearly what the item is. You should never be asked to remove or raise clothing to display it. Gel-filled prosthetics are classed as medical items and are not included in the 100g liquid limit, but they may be examined during the screening of hand luggage. If stopped, most Western airports allow passengers to specify which gender they prefer to be searched by, and to request that it be performed in private with a witness."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"sport/blog/2017/sep/08/england-test-cricket-jimmy-anderson-500-wickets-five-best","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-08T16:28:06Z","webTitle":"Jimmy Anderson at 500: the England bowler’s five best Test wickets | Ali Martin","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2017/sep/08/england-test-cricket-jimmy-anderson-500-wickets-five-best","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/blog/2017/sep/08/england-test-cricket-jimmy-anderson-500-wickets-five-best","fields":{"headline":"Jimmy Anderson at 500: the England bowler’s five best Test wickets","bodyText":"1 Brendon McCullum – Trent Bridge 2008 Anderson’s “second coming” in international cricket began during the 2-1 victory in New Zealand when he removed their first five batsmen on his recall to the side in Wellington. It was cemented in the summer’s follow-up victory at home to the Kiwis with a career-best seven for 43 in the third Test. Among the carnage was the detonation of McCullum’s off-stump – a ball that angled in and then nipped away as the right-hander went to clip it through leg. 2 Ricky Ponting – Adelaide 2010 Anderson compounded a miserable start for Australia in the second Test (Simon Katich had been run out from the fourth ball of the match through Jonathan Trott’s direct hit) when a classic outswinger to Ponting first up was edged to Graeme Swann at second slip. One suspects Ponting’s thoughts rhymed with “golden duck” and from none for two (0.5 overs) there was no coming back. Anderson would end the 3-1 series win as the leading wicket-taker with 24. 3 Sachin Tendulkar – Kolkata 2012 No bowler got the better of the “Little Master” in his Test career more than Anderson’s nine dismissals, the eighth of which came at Eden Gardens as Tendulkar, on 76 in India’s first innings, prodded forward to a ball that held its line and diving wicketkeeper Matt Prior clung on. It was the first of a six-wicket Test by a player written off by many in subcontinental conditions. The tourists went 2-1 up – a lead they would hold for their first series win in India for 27 years. 4 Michael Clarke – Trent Bridge 2013 Nestled within a 10-wicket performance on his happiest hunting ground at Nottingham – one that secured a 1-0 Ashes advantage for England through a nerve-tingling 14-run triumph – was a peach of a delivery to remove Australia’s captain in their first innings. Clarke, who fell nine times to Anderson in Tests, moved to defend a ball shaping into his stumps, only for a smidgeon of seam movement to beat the outside edge and see off-stump kissed. 5 Denesh Ramdin – Antigua 2015 A leg-cutter fenced to first slip through a defensive shot sent the West Indies wicketkeeper on his way – not the highest-profile scalp but the big one nevertheless, taking Anderson past Sir Ian Botham’s 383 Test wickets to become England’s most prolific bowler of all time.

Many of our village schools are “faith” schools, though probably at least half of the pupils who attend them (and their parents) have no religious faith. On 11 November we remember those who died in war. Around the country this act of remembrance will take the form of a religious service, though perhaps a majority of those who wish to take part do not believe in God.

The dog’s owner, Mario Perivoitos, died at his home in Wood Green, north London, in an incident in March that was seen but not filmed by BBC journalists making a programme about drugs. An inquest at North London coroner’s court heard that the behaviour of the dog, called Major, could have been triggered by crack cocaine. Nicholas Carmichael, a veterinary toxicologist, told the inquest that samples indicating high levels of cocaine and morphine were discovered in the dog’s urine.Mail Online quoted Carmichael as saying: “It is very likely that this dog had consumed drugs, probably eaten them. It is almost impossible to say whether that will make the dog attack, but it does make them respond abnormally. “They become very excited and agitated. It is more likely that this attack happened because this dog had taken cocaine.” Julie Higgins, a pathologist, told the court that Perivoitos’s body “included injuries to the neck and face, with extensive haemorrhaging, and the larynx was crushed”. The BBC crew were at his home filming Drugs Map of Britain when he began having a seizure. The programme’s producer, Joshua Haddow, managed to wrestle Major off his owner, but it was too late to save him, the court heard. During the attack, Major crushed Mario’s larynx and caused him to lose so much blood he was given ten pints to try and revive him later in hospital, the court heard. The senior coroner, Andrew Walker, concluded that Perivoitos died as a consequence of injuries received from the dog. He pointed out that the victim had taken cocaine before the attack. “It is likely that he was experiencing an epileptic shock, which caused the dog to nip his face before biting his neck. The film crew telephoned an ambulance while attempting to get the dog off Mr Perivoitos,” he said. “It is likely that the dog had consumed cocaine by eating it and it is likely that this was an additional factor in the dog’s behaviour. Mr Perivoitos suffered serious injuries and was taken to a major trauma hospital, and died shortly after midnight.” Walker thanked the BBC crew for their attempts to save Perivoitos.

Speaking to Fortune Magazine, Cook said that he felt the company’s reputation for expensive products was over-emphasised, noting that wouldn’t use the word “high-margin” to describe Apple. “There’s a lot of companies that have much higher margins. We price for the value of our products. And we try to make the very best products. And that means we don’t make commodity kind of products. And we don’t disparage people that do; it’s a fine business model. But it’s not the business that we’re in,” Cook said. “If you look across our product lines, you can buy an iPad today for under $300. You can buy an iPhone, depending upon which one you select, for in that same kind of ballpark. And so these are not for the rich. We obviously wouldn’t have over a billion products that are in our active installed base if we were making them for the rich because that’s a sizeable number no matter who’s looking at the numbers,” he added. Cook’s words may appear oddly timed, given the expectation that Apple will launch its most expensive iPhone yet, believed to be called the iPhone X, at a press event on Tuesday. The phone will likely cost at least $1,000 in the US, compared to rivals like Samsung’s Galaxy Note 8, which is selling for $929. Cook also used the interview to hammer home Apple’s long-running message that it, and only it, is a technology firm dedicated to preserving users’ privacy. “We try to advocate for people’s privacy because we are living in a world where technology can do lots of things, but there’s things that it shouldn’t do. And so we try very hard to protect people’s privacy and security and hopefully keep some of these bad things at bay for them,” he said. In its 10 years of existence, the iPhone has never had a major malware outbreak, a fact noted by security experts on the smartphone line’s 10th anniversary, and something Cook was keen to capitalise on. “The importance of security is exponentially increasing,” he said. “And that’s because of all of the hacks, all of the reports of things that have gone on. You would be hard pressed to find very many people that haven’t had a problem I think, or heard of a problem from credit cards to whatever.” Addressing credit cards in particular points to one area of opportunity for Apple: payments. With its Apple Pay service, it has achieved a small foothold in contactless retail transactions, and a larger one in in-app payments, but the company is set to push further, to person-to-person payments, with iOS 11, expected to be released in certain regions this week. The memory of Steve Jobs is also very present in the interview. At one point, Cook readdresses one of Jobs’ most controversial decisions as chief executive, in not creating a charitable foundation under Apple’s name. Cook reviewed the choice in 2012, he says, and came to the same conclusion as Jobs had previously: better not do it at all than do it in a way that didn’t live up to Apple’s ethos. “I looked at it in early 2012,” he said, “and I decided not to do it. And here’s why. When a company sets up a foundation, there is a risk, in my judgment, of the foundation becoming this other thing that is not connected to the company. It has a separate board of directors. They make reasonably independent decisions sometimes. It becomes a separate thing. “I don’t want that for Apple. I want everybody involved. Because I think that the power that we bring, the things that we can do is because we’re stronger—it’s with our unity there. It’s when we put all of ourselves in it.” Not every legacy from Jobs has carried over in quite the same way, however. Cook mentioned the co-founder and chief executive’s desire to transform the education market with the iPad, a goal that the company never quite achieved. Jobs “saw what iPad could unleash, he wanted to get all the textbook guys on the iPad because he saw kids walking with these 50lbs of books, this little kid that weighs 50lbs trying to carry 50lbs of books. And also that the book was flat. That there was nothing exciting. So he went out and spent $10m on one textbook to show what was possible.” Jobs’ multimillion dollar textbook was never released to the public, but in January 2012, three months after he died, the company revealed a stripped-down version of his plan: iBooks Textbooks, a partnership with the publishing industry to sell $15 high school textbooks for the iPad in the US. iPhone X: everything we think we know about the new Apple smartphone"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2017/sep/12/boris-johnson-flies-to-caribbean-amid-storm-of-criticism-over-uk-response","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-12T15:34:24Z","webTitle":"Boris Johnson flies to Caribbean amid criticism over UK response","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/sep/12/boris-johnson-flies-to-caribbean-amid-storm-of-criticism-over-uk-response","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/sep/12/boris-johnson-flies-to-caribbean-amid-storm-of-criticism-over-uk-response","fields":{"headline":"Boris Johnson flies to Caribbean amid criticism over UK response","bodyText":"Boris Johnson, the UK foreign secretary, has bowed to political pressure to fly to the Caribbean to visit the British territories devastated by Hurricane Irma amid continuing criticism of the government’s response to the disaster. The Foreign Office said Johnson would spend “the coming days” in the Caribbean to see UK’s relief effort first-hand, less than a day after Labour called for him or the prime minister to visit the region. He is expected to visit the British Virgin Islands [BVI] and Anguilla, two of the British dependencies worst hit by Irma. On Monday, Kate Osamor, the shadow development secretary, urged Johnson or Theresa May to visit survivors on the islands, “look them in the eye and put their concerns at the centre of her government’s response plan”. Johnson visit will follow a trip by the French president, Emmanuel Macron, to St Martin, the Franco-Dutch island that neighbours Anguilla to the south. Britons stranded in the Caribbean have contrasted the French government preparations and quick response to Irma with the way the UK government has tackled the aid effort. Macron was due to touch down in St Martin as Foreign Office confirmed Johnson’s plans to visit the Caribbean. The foreign secretary’s visit came after billionaire Richard Branson called for a “Marshall Plan” to help the Caribbean recover from the storm. The Marshall Plan was a US aid programme to help rebuild western European economies after the end of the second world war. Writing in a blogpost, Branson, who weathered the storm on his private island of Necker, said: “We must get more help to the islands to rebuild homes and infrastructure and restore power, clean water and food supplies.” More than 700 British troops and 50 police officers have been sent to the British Virgin Islands after they were battered by the most powerful storm recorded in the Atlantic Ocean. Johnson will meet with governors and other officials leading the recovery work, and will visit some of the worst affected areas. On Monday, he defended the government’s response against claims the UK had done less to evacuate its citizens than other nations. He said: “This is a very big consular crisis and I am confident we are doing everything we possibly can to help British nationals.” In the British Virgin Islands, expats and tourists have spoken of their shock at the extent of the damage. Briton Claudia Knight, who returned to the UK before Irma hit,said her partner, who is still on the island of Tortola, carries a knife for protection as “it’s turning really nasty”. Knight, 33, runs an arts school on Tortola but managed to return to the UK with her two-year-old daughter, Dottie, before Irma unleashed devastation. Her partner, Leo Whitting, 38, a marine engineer, stayed behind. After seeing images of the awesome power of the storm, Knight said she thought he had died. She told the Press Association: “I honestly thought he was dead. Before I was making jokes like ‘make sure you park my car’, it was quite light-hearted because we didn’t know the storm was going to be that bad. “The military is everywhere with machine guns. Everyone’s turned feral and no one’s going out without being armed. You can’t drive your car without a weapon, it’s turning really nasty. Leo carries a knife with him.” Knight, originally from Dorset, has lived on the island for the past four years. She managed to speak with Whiting thanks to “brief flickers of internet”, adding: “He phoned me shortly after and said: ‘I’m alive – Tortola isn’t.’ “He looked like he has been touching death’s door, he’s very pale and gaunt. My house and my business have been blown away and destroyed. Nothing is left standing on the island. But we love it, and we want to go out and rebuild eventually.” Knight said people were beginning to evacuate but you had to “pay through the nose” to be shuttled off, adding Whitting would hopefully manage to leave in the next few days. Adding to concerns about safety on the island, it has also emerged that about 100 prisoners escaped from the BVI prison in the aftermath of Hurricane Irma. Foreign minister Sir Alan Duncan told the Commons that the convicts pose a “serious threat of the complete breakdown of law and order” on the overseas territory. He told MPs: “The prison was breached, over 100 very serious prisoners escaped.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"crosswords/quick/14779","type":"crossword","sectionId":"crosswords","sectionName":"Crosswords","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-18T23:00:01Z","webTitle":"Quick crossword No 14,779","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/quick/14779","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/crosswords/quick/14779","fields":{"headline":"Quick crossword No 14,779","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"business/live/2017/sep/12/world-stock-markets-record-highs-uk-inflation-data-business-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-12T14:53:08Z","webTitle":"Pound hits one-year high as UK inflation rate jumps to 2.9% - as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2017/sep/12/world-stock-markets-record-highs-uk-inflation-data-business-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/live/2017/sep/12/world-stock-markets-record-highs-uk-inflation-data-business-live","fields":{"headline":"Pound hits one-year high as UK inflation rate jumps to 2.9% - as it happened","bodyText":"Right, time for a recap. The cost of living squeeze in Britain just became more uncomfortable, after inflation unexpectedly rose in August. The consumer prices index spiked to 2.9% in last month, from 2.6%, equalling May’s four-year high. Shoppers suffered a big jump in clothing prices, particularly for womenswear, plus pricier petrol at the pumps. Economists blamed the weak pound, which has made imports pricier. Core inflation rose to 2.7%, its highest level since 2011, putting more pressure on the Bank of England to consider an interest rate hike. Speculation that the BoE could raise borrowing costs sent the pound soaring. It’s currently trading at a one-year high against the US dollar, at $1.327, and a six-week high against the euro at €1.11. As this chat from the Bond Vigilantes team at M&amp;G shows, inflation is almost a whole percentage point over the BoE’s 2% target. Unions have renewed their calls for the public sector pay cap to be abolished for all workers; otherwise staff such as nurses and teachers will continue to suffer a significant real wage cut. The jump in the pound pulled shares down in London (as it could hurt exporters). But other markets have continued to rally, sending global markets to their highest ever levels. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx says: The markets remained dominated by the reaction to the morning’s UK inflation reading, with a bit of North Korea/Hurricane Irma relief thrown in for good measure. That relief has sent the MSCI All Country World Index to a new alltime high this afternoon. Here’s our latest inflation news story: And that’s all for today. Thanks for reading and commenting. GW Newsflash: Britain’s next budget will be delivered on 22nd November. This will be chancellor Philip Hammond’s opportunity to announce new tax and spending plans, perhaps tear up the public sector pay cap, and try to guide the economy through the Brexit process. It’s worth noting, though, that police and prison staff only make up 6% of the total public sector work force. Plus, the pay increases announced today are unfunded, so savings or cuts must be made elsewhere to pay for them. Here’s another depressing, and informative, chart from the Resolution Foundation, showing how public sector workers have suffered falling real wages for much of the last decade. In the last hour, the government has announced that the 1% pay cap will be lifted for the police and prison workers. They’ll get pay rises of 2% and 1% respectively -- still not enough to keep up with inflation. Trade unions have already warned that it’s not enough. Depressingly, the rise in UK inflation will fall particularly hard on poorer families. That’s because they spend a greater proportion of their income on food, clothes and housing, where prices have risen above average this year. Stephen Clarke of the Resolution Foundation has tweeted the details: Important media news: Rupert Murdoch’s attempt to take control of Sky has hit a potentially serious hurdle. Culture secretary Karen Bradley has just announced that she’s ‘minded’ to refer the bid to the competition authorities on the grounds of broadcasting standards (basically, whether Fox is a fit owner). That’s a new development; Bradley is also planning to refer the bid on the grounds of media plurality. Here’s the full story: Sky’s shares have fallen by almost 3%, to their lowest level since Murdoch made his bid last December, as traders digest this new development. Today’s inflation figures will be high on the agenda when the Bank of England meets later this week to set interest rates. Last month, the MPC voted 6-2 to leave borrowing costs unchanged, with the majority judging that the economy was too weak to justify a hike. On Thursday, the committee will be up to full strength of nine policymakers as new deputy governor Dave Ramsden joins the throng. So could policymakers decide ‘enough is enough!’ and raise interest rates from their record low of 0.25%? City experts are divided on this issue. Emanuele Canegrati of BlackPearlFX argues that the BoE should use the levers of monetary policy to get inflation down to its 2% target, and ease the cost of living squeeze. Ben Lord of M&amp;G predicts that the Bank’s chief economist, Andy Haldane, will vote for a rate hike on Thursday, resulting in a 6-3 split but no rate rise. Lord believes that the Bank should sit tight, as inflation may peak soon. “Increased disagreement on the MPC will likely lead to some sterling strength, in the short term at least... But if we are a month or so away from peak inflation, to hike rates and strengthen the pound....would be overly myopic and pro-cyclical in my view. Kathleen Brooks of City Index points out that the City believes there is a greater chance of a rate rise before Christmas. The Overnight Index Swaps market has already rushed to price in a greater probability of a rate hike from the BOE by year end. The market now expects a 30% chance of a hike in December, this compares with 20% a week ago. It’s too late for most British holidaymakers, but the pound is rallying against the euro this morning, as well as the dollar, Sterling has gained 1% against the European single currency to €1.112, the highest level since the start of August. That means one euro is worth 89.9p, having hit 93p at the end of last month. We also have fresh evidence that the housing boom in Britain’s capital is faltering. London house prices rose by just 2.8% in the 12 months to July 2017, much slower than the national average of 5.1%. Indeed, that makes the London the slowest region in England. London continues to be the region with the highest average house price at £489,000, followed by the South East, at £321,000, and the East of England, at £290,000 respectively. Public sector workers will see their real wages shrink by around 2% this year, unless the pay cap is dropped. Liberal Democrat leader Vince Cable says Theresa May’s government needs to act urgently: “Rising inflation shows how urgent it is to address the sense of unfairness around the pay cap. “With these numbers our nurses, teachers and other public sector workers will experience a 2% pay cut in the coming year. This will only aggravate the recruitment and retention crisis we are facing. “The government must take urgent steps to lift the pay cap for all public sector workers, and increase wages in line with inflation.” Andrew Sentance of PwC (and a former Bank of England interest-rate setter) fears that inflation will keep rising as the full impact of the weak pound ripples through the economy. He predicts that the consumer prices index will rise over 3% later this year, weakening growth. With very well-developed and complex supply chains, it can take a number of years for a decline in the exchange rate, which raises import prices, to feed through fully to consumers. “This suggests that the recent squeeze on consumer spending from higher inflation will continue to dampen growth in the UK economy in the second half of this year and next year. There is not much sign yet that consumers will get any early relief from the surge in inflation following the Brexit vote last summer.” The pound has now clawed back half of the losses suffered after the Brexit vote, but is still worth 10% less than in June 2016. Britain is now suffering its SECOND cost of living squeeze in a decade. As thus chart shows, inflation (in pink) outpaced wage growth once the financial crisis began in 2008. Real wages didn’t turn positive until 2014, but have been shrinking since early 2017. The Treasury have sent a comment over, but it doesn’t reveal whether the public sector pay cap is being axed.... ‘We know some families have concerns with their day to day cost of living. That’s why we are boosting take home pay with tax cuts for over 30 million people and a National Living Wage that is giving the lowest earners their fastest pay rise for 20 years.’ Ranko Berich, Head of Market Analysis at Monex Europe, says Britain’s inflation rate has “smashed expectations”, which is why the pound spiked to one-year high. He fears that it will hurt consumer spending in the coming months (which will be bad for growth). Berich adds: “The breadth of today’s inflation surprise is striking. All of the headline price indices, including Core CPI, PPI and RPI printed higher than median forecasts. The record 4.6% increase in clothing and footwear indicates that retailers are passing cost increases straight to consumers. On the whole, today’s figures highlight just how hard inflation is continuing to bite into real wages, although it will be interesting to see how nominal wages perform in tomorrow’s labour market data. As real wages fall, consumer spending is likely to come under further pressure this year, after a wobble in the first quarter. City economists are concerned to see that Britain’s ‘core’ inflation rate has hit a six-year high, at 2.7%. Core inflation strips out volatile factors like petrol and food, and is meant to give a better picture of economic pressures. Andreas Wallström of Nordea Markets predicts that this makes an early interest rate rise more likely. Economist Rupert Seggins agrees that the Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Committee will be concerned. He’s tweeted a chart, showing how core inflation typically lags behind the exchange rate by about two years. If that relationship holds, the Brexit impact hasn’t arrived yet.... Edward Hardy, economist at currency firm WorldFirst, blames bad weather and geopolitical worries for driving inflation up. Hardy says: “Petrol prices have come back to bite: after two months of stagnant energy costs, weather disruption in the Gulf of Mexico twinned with geopolitical tensions on the Korean peninsula have lit a fire under commodity prices . The recent recovery in the eurozone is also a factor. The euro hit an eight-year high against the pound in August, which makes imports from Europe more expensive. Britain’s inflation rate has been driven up by the slump in the pound in the summer of 2016, after the Brexit vote. Ben Brettell, senior economist at Hargreaves Lansdown, suspects that UK inflation may now be peaking. The public will hope he’s right, as wages are certainly not keeping pace with the cost of living. Brettell says: Inflation ticked up again in August, with increased petrol and diesel prices contributing to a year-on-year figure of 2.9%, up from 2.6% in July and matching May’s four-year high. This will inevitably raise questions about the UK’s ongoing cost of living squeeze. Data released tomorrow is expected to show pay increasing at 2.2% in the three months to July, meaning wages are still shrinking in real terms. Yet it looks likely that inflation will fall back in the coming months, as the effect of Brexit-induced sterling weakness falls out of the year-on-year calculation. Trade unions say the UK government must now drop its pay cap on public sector workers, to give them more protection against inflation. TUC General Secretary Frances O’Grady says: “The cost of living squeeze continues, with rising inflation outpacing wages. “The government needs to get a grip and get pay rising across the economy. A good start would be to scrap the pay cap for all public sector workers. There is speculation that Theresa May’s government is preparing to lift the cap, for police officers and prison workers. That’s not enough, though, O’Grady warns: “Our dedicated public servants are a team. A pick and mix approach, that rewards some and not others, would be cynical and plain unfair.” Boom! The pound has hit a one-year high against the US dollar, following the spike in the cost of living. Sterling has gained a whole cent against the dollar to hit $1.3280, the strongest level since mid-September 2016. Traders are calculating that August’s inflation surge means the Bank of England is more likely to raise interest rates soon. On an annual basis, clothing and footwear inflation in Britain has hit 4.6%. That’s the highest level since the last days of the Thatcher administration, according to City economist Simon French of Panmure Gordon. Buying clothes became rather pricier last month.... Clothing and travel costs drove the cost of living up in August. Average clothing prices jumped by 2.4% between July and August 2017, with women’s clothing becoming particularly pricier. Fuel costs also rose -- with petrol prices jumping by 1.8 pence per litre. Air fares rose as usual between July and August, by 10.9% (because it is peak holiday time...) This chart shows how the consumer prices index (in yellow) has risen sharply over the last year - back to levels seen in May this year, and in June 2013. BREAKING: Britain’s inflation rate has jumped to 2.9% in August, from 2.6% in July. That equals the four-year high struck in May this year. It means British households are still facing a cost of living squeeze, as wages are currently rising by around 2.1%. More to follow! The pound just hit a four-week against the euro, at 90.605p..... Economist Marc Brütsch of Swiss Life predicts that UK inflation spiked to 2.9% in August, from 2.6% in July. Royal Bank of Scotland predict that the Consumer Prices Index rose by 2.8%, but will spike over 3% this autumn. Just 15 minutes to wait.... Expectations that Britain’s inflation rate rose in August are pushing sterling higher this morning. The pound is up almost half a cent at $1.321 against the US dollar. A high inflation reading puts more pressure on the Bank of England to raise interest rates from the record lows (making it more lucrative to hold money in pounds). It says something about the financial markets that shares can rally on the back of a devastating storm that was only slightly less awful than feared. But what? Analysts at ING told clients this morning that investors are remarkably relaxed: “Whether that equity reaction is Panglossian complacency or a sign of wonderful underlying fundamentals remains open to question. Even Category 5 storms can now be added to the list of things that ’Don’t Really Matter’. If in doubt, blame the media..... European stock markets are pushing higher in early trading, as the momentum from Wall Street’s rally ripples back to the City. Naeem Aslam of Think Markets says traders have regained their appetite for riskier assets. Investors are surely feeling less concerned about the potential hurricane damage cost. This has brought back the traditional risk on trade. The new (and watered down) sanctions on North Korea agreed by the United Nations last night are also boosting the markets today, says Matt Simpson, senior market analyst at Faraday Research. World stock markets are at record highs this morning, thanks to relief that the economic cost of hurricane Irma will probably be lower than feared. Last night, America’s S&amp;P 500 index finished at its highest ever level, with insurance firms surging. Asian stocks have hit a 10-year high today, and European markets are also up in early trading. This has driven the MSCI All Country World Index - a broad measure of stocks around the globe - up to a new alltime peak of 484.12 points. Overnight, most powerful storm in Atlantic history has been downgraded to a tropical depression after causing terrible damage in the Caribbean, and in the Florida Keys region. The repair bill will run into many tens of billions, but is likely to miss the worst-case estimates - because Irma changed course and didn’t strike a direct hit on the cities of Miama and Tampa. That’s a relief for the insurance industry, who were looking at a £150bn bill for Irma at one stage. But traders should remember that 10 fatalities have been reported in the US, and another 37 in the Caribbean. Irma has still been a monster. US officials are warning of a possible humanitarian crisis unless power and water can be restored, and the clean-up job will be huge. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial market, the eurozone and business. Britain’s cost of living crisis will rear up again this morning, when new inflation figures are released. Economists predict that inflation jumped to around 2.8% per year in August, up from 2.6% in July. That’s close to the four-year high of 2.9% which the consumer prices index struck in May. If so, that would mean that the average Briton’s real pay is falling. Earnings only rose by 2.1% in the three months to June (we get new figures tomorrow), meaning inflation is more than eroding any wage increases. That’s a particular blow for nurses, doctors and other public sector workers, thanks to the government’s 1% pay cap. The weak pound is driving inflation higher, by making imports more expensive. Higher fuel prices are also pushing the cost of living up, according to James Brown of consultancy firm Simon-Kucher: “For road users, petrol prices are up after the respite given by lower prices over the summer. “Driving to work cost 5% more in August and early September than last year.” Separate house price figures will show how Britain’s housing sector performed in July. It’s a big day for the car industry too, as the Frankfurt Motor Show kicks off. We’ll also be watching for comments from the Bank of England’s markets director, and the vice-president of the ECB: The agenda: All day: The Frankfurt Motor Show 9.30am BST: UK inflation for August 9.30am BST: UK house price figures for July 10.20am BST: Bank of England markets director Chris Salmon speaks in Barcelona 3.45pm BST: European Central Bank vice-president Vítor Constâncio speaks in Frankfurt"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2017/sep/12/roman-j-israel-esq-review-denzel-washington-toronto-film-festival-tiff","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-12T13:57:16Z","webTitle":"Roman J Israel, Esq review – Denzel Washington captivates in unusual legal drama","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/sep/12/roman-j-israel-esq-review-denzel-washington-toronto-film-festival-tiff","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2017/sep/12/roman-j-israel-esq-review-denzel-washington-toronto-film-festival-tiff","fields":{"headline":"Roman J Israel, Esq review – Denzel Washington captivates in unusual legal drama","bodyText":"The movie star charisma of Denzel Washington has led him, deservedly, to the top of the A-list but has also steered him away from showcasing his considerable and transformative talents as an actor. As his fame has increased, there have been crumbs left along the way but too often he’s been stuck in substandard action territory, an understandable business decision but a regrettable one nonetheless. Last year, his adaptation of Fences allowed him to show just how equipped he still is, and would have made a far more deserving best actor winner than a sleepwalking Casey Affleck in Manchester by the Sea. He’s probably hoping for better luck this season with yet another meaty role in unusually quick succession. But his latest, the poorly titled Roman J. Israel, Esq., might prove a little too unusual for the Academy and for audiences too. Israel is a socially awkward, idealistic lawyer who is relegated to an office-based position within the law firm he co-partners, his eccentricities and rigid adherence to the law better suited to a role behind the scenes. But when tragedy strikes his partner, Israel is left without a job and forced into a world that’s unfamiliar and unwelcoming. He finds himself tapped for a position by the slick head of a larger firm (Colin Farrell) and, through an unlikely set of circumstances, Israel’s life rapidly begins to change. Like writer/director Dan Gilroy’s previous film Nightcrawler, Roman J. Israel, Esq. works best as the character study of a man who never usually gets to take centre stage. Initially, Israel seems like the sort of semi-autistic legal genius that we’ve come to expect on the small screen, a brilliant renegade wowing courtrooms with his unlikely charm on some repetitive CBS procedural. But there’s far more here to chew on and Gilroy isn’t interested in cliche or providing us with a series of satisfying gotcha moments. Israel is a by-the-book, true believer in the importance of following the letter of the law. When he’s finally allowed inside a courtroom, he’s dismayed that in practice those around him aren’t quite as steadfast, and there’s a lingering poignancy as he gradually loses touch with his core values in a bid to survive in the real world. He’s a relic of sorts, a civil rights activist from another era who believes that the system is in need of widespread reform and in another package, those he meets might be impressed with this. But he’s an odd proposition, uncomfortably dressed and almost always wearing headphones, a savant lacking in social skills. It’s not a role we’re used to seeing Washington play, his hugely underrated performance as a haunted soldier in The Manchurian Candidate probably coming the closest, but he’s never been better. There’s nothing overly mannered or visibly rehearsed about his work here, he just disappears into the character, a difficult task for a star as familiar as Washington. He’s so captivating to watch that at times I wished he was headlining a 10-part Netflix series, his daily trials proving endlessly fascinating. Given the career renaissance he’s recently enjoyed, it’s a somewhat regressive role for Farrell, playing the sort of hotshot he was stuck with in his early Hollywood career and there’s a subplot with Carmen Ejogo as an activist that doesn’t always ring true, but even in the film’s less successful moments, I admired the loose shagginess of it all. It’s structured in a way that will frustrate many viewers expecting an involving Nightcrawler-esque thriller, but it’s the sort of patiently plotted mid-budget drama that rarely gets made nowadays. Gilroy’s script is alive with detail and deft characterization, and it’s become a cliche to compare a film like this to the cinema of the 70s, but Gilroy almost forces the comparison with a score and soundtrack that, like Israel, live in the past. It’s a haunting and timeless American tragedy that feels ever prescient given the current administration’s foggy understanding of morality. It might prove to be a tough sell thanks to an awkward title and a strange plot trajectory, but Roman J. Israel, Esq. is a richly rewarding drama blessed with one of the best, most lived-in performances of the year. Roman J. Israel, Esq. is screening at the Toronto film festival and will be released in US cinemas on 3 November and in the UK on 1 December"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"business/2017/sep/13/rising-inequality-risks-creating-society-of-working-poor-top-australian-union-warns","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-12T22:26:47Z","webTitle":"Australia risks becoming Americanised society of working poor, union warns","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/sep/13/rising-inequality-risks-creating-society-of-working-poor-top-australian-union-warns","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2017/sep/13/rising-inequality-risks-creating-society-of-working-poor-top-australian-union-warns","fields":{"headline":"Australia risks becoming Americanised society of working poor, union warns","bodyText":"The Turnbull government’s unwillingness to take rising inequality seriously means it is increasingly at odds with conservative global economic institutions like the International Monetary Fund, Australia’s peak union body has warned. The Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) has released a new report on rising inequality of wealth and income warning Australia is at risk of becoming an Americanised society of working poor if people are not given a pay rise. It is the union body’s first paper on inequality since Sally McManus, the ACTU secretary, called on unionists three months ago to start campaigning hard on the issue, saying workplace rules needed to be repaired in Australia to reverse the damage to workers caused by three decades of neoliberalism. “It has taken the right 30 years of union bashing and neoliberalism to take us where we are now,” McManus said in June. “Inequality is at a 70-year high. Wage growth hasn’t been this low since records starting being kept.” The ACTU paper, released on Wednesday, shows income inequality in Australia has been steadily rising in recent decades, “since neoliberal approaches began to dominate economic policy in the 1980s”. It says inequality in wealth has also been rising, and in recent years it has been occurring at a much faster pace. It says technological change has been one factor, but the trend of attacking the basic protections of workers has had a huge impact in Australia. It calls on the government to arrest the decades-old growth in inequality by rebuilding a “relevant, modern and strong safety net” for workers, restoring a fair and independent industrial umpire, and taking away incentives for employers to casualise work. It also calls on the government to dump its planned $65bn worth of corporate tax cuts, saying they will end up hurting workers because they will have to be funded by cuts to essential services. “We should reverse the cuts to penalty rates, raise the minimum wage, change our industrial relations laws and look at ways we can help support trade unions,” the paper says. “Industrial laws have always existed with one primary purpose, that is to address the inherent power imbalance that exists between capital and labour. That imbalance has never been greater. Our laws need to change.” On Tuesday, on the eve of the paper’s release, McManus criticised the Turnbull government’s new industrial relations proposals, saying they were an “attack on democracy”. The Coalition wants to amend the Registered Organisations Act to make it easier for union officials to be disqualified and for unions to be deregistered. McManus said instead of addressing inequality Malcolm Turnbull and his employment minister, Michaelia Cash, were obsessed with attacking unions. “There are two ways the Turnbull government can act to turn around inequality: make sure everyone pays their fair share of tax; and act so working people have strong enough rights at work to get decent pay rises and secure jobs,” she said. “But instead the government is going in the opposite direction. Every day they think up new ways to hurt working people and weaken their rights while they are giving corporations $65bn in tax cuts. “These are the same failed policies that have caused inequality in the first place.” The treasurer, Scott Morrison, recently dismissed the suggestion that income inequality had worsened in Australia in recent years, claiming inequality had “actually got better”, but was contradicted by economists. Philip Lowe, the Reserve Bank governor, argued in July that inequality had increased in Australia. “Wealth inequality has become more pronounced, particularly in the last five or six years, because there have been big gains in asset prices,” he said. “So, the people who own assets, which tend to be wealthy people, have seen their wealth go up. “[O]n income inequality, it’s drifted up a little bit, but not very much. The movement in wealth inequality is a bit more pronounced because of the rise in asset prices.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/sep/12/the-coal-club-can-huff-and-puff-but-its-too-late-to-blow-the-renewable-house-down","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-12T01:23:18Z","webTitle":"The coal club can huff and puff but it's too late to blow the renewable house down | Peter Lewis","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/sep/12/the-coal-club-can-huff-and-puff-but-its-too-late-to-blow-the-renewable-house-down","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/sep/12/the-coal-club-can-huff-and-puff-but-its-too-late-to-blow-the-renewable-house-down","fields":{"headline":"The coal club can huff and puff but it's too late to blow the renewable house down","bodyText":"The prime minister has been upping his rhetoric on energy security and power prices to eleven as he struggles to regain control of the runaway train he let loose when he turned his back on climate action. The cheap shots on renewables, the stern words with energy company executives, even the prime minister’s newfound love of coal, may be portrayed by the conservative media as a shrewd political counterpunch. But make no mistake, the shrill tone betrays a sense of panic within a government that has lost control of energy prices. This is a government paying the price for putting ideology ahead of considered policy, a government that has seen power prices nearly double since it made its bellicose promise to “axe the (so-called carbon) tax”. This is a government whose agrarian flank wants to ban government support for renewables – one of Australia’s fastest-growing industries – and channel taxpayer funds into coal projects that even the big banks won’t touch. This is a government, led by a PM who once put his commitment to climate action ahead of his job, who can’t even agree to set a modest clean energy target in order to give the energy market the certainty it needs to make the investments required for us to have the energy we need. That this government sees rising power prices as an opportunity to attack its opponents shows a degree of political chutzpah that, if the stakes weren’t so high, would be worthy of grudging respect. But the reality – as it usually is with bullying – is that this is more about the insecurities of the bully than the particularities of the bullied. And as questions over the past two weeks’ Essential Reports show, the public isn’t spooked by the renewable energy scare. Clearly punters know how to read a power bill. They also have lived through waves of privatisations that have seen energy transformed from an essential service to a national market. For the majority of voters, increased prices are regarded as a natural consequence of a private market. So when the prime minister hauls in energy executives to lecture them on prices, it’s a bit like a zookeeper entreating its scorpions to keep their venom to themselves. And there’s a sting in their tails when they rightly argue back that in failing to come up with any sort of long-term energy transition plan the government is fuelling the price rises. The government has amped it up this week, lecturing AGL for making the commercial decision to retire one of its coal power plants. Given that AGL valued this particular coal power plant at zero when it bought it a few years ago, this is mainstream business practice taking account of both financial and reputational risks and opportunities. But for a government desperate to divert the attention of angry consumers, this can be portrayed as akin to national sabotage. They should know. Now like a Soviet regime struggling to revise its five-year plan after a couple of years of chaos, the Coalition proposes seizing the means of energy production and belching out more coal themselves – and if Labor refuses to back them, well, that is proof that a Labor government would be a recipe for higher prices. While the Coalition desperately tries to regain control of energy politics, Labor remains in the box seat when it comes to a showdown between coal and renewables. Forced to choose – on the environment, on prices, on the economy and on jobs – renewables are seen as a better bet. While the debate is still contested with high “don’t know” and “no difference” responses, the public does not see coal as an elixir. What they actually want is government to step up and retake control of an energy market that has ceased to serve the public interest. The public will support anything that looks like leadership on energy. But behind the headline numbers there are some cautions for Labor about how to prosecute its own energy response. While people want to see the transition to renewables, they have no more appetite for an ideological war against coal than they do in favour of it. The message is clear: address climate change, take measures to control the private energy companies and make the transition to renewables in an orderly, pragmatic and predictable manner. Australians aren’t anti-coal. If clean, smart energy wasn’t taking off and the coal power industry could point to actual, cost-effective coal capture and storage, then a lot more people would happily support coal. But, of course, the opposite is true. Clean energy is plummeting in cost, and the smart technology solutions that will make it work are proving themselves. Meanwhile, coal generation CCS is a nice idea with no real prospect of being part of the market without a high carbon price, and the health impacts of coal are getting more attention. Australians understand that when it comes to the shift from coal to clean, the train has left the station and it isn’t going back. And they would much prefer the government drive the train rather than the energy companies, whom they don’t trust at all. Despite an extraordinarily concentrated, concerted and expensive campaign by the coal club, Australians are not buying the idea they can turn back the energy clock. In what could be the ultimate battleground that will determine the next government, despite the bluster and positioning, Labor holds a significant, if not decisive lead, on who will deliver lower energy prices. As prices continue to rise and Australia continues its interminable climate policy circle-work, as the coal club throws more millions at persuasion, the government will no doubt continue to huff and puff. But all indications are it’s too late for the coal club to blow the renewable house down."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"film/2017/sep/11/unicorn-store-review-toronto-film-festival-tiff","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-12T00:29:19Z","webTitle":"Unicorn Store review – Brie Larson's comic skills can't save this twee trifle","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/sep/11/unicorn-store-review-toronto-film-festival-tiff","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2017/sep/11/unicorn-store-review-toronto-film-festival-tiff","fields":{"headline":"Unicorn Store review – Brie Larson's comic skills can't save this twee trifle","bodyText":"Brie Larson’s directorial debut, Unicorn Store, is a film about embracing your idiosyncrasies without letting the dull conformity of life strip you of your originality. But the film itself often takes this message too literally, with glitter-strewn whimsy taking precedence over boringly necessary little things like plot and characterization. Larson stars as the lead, Kit, a woman stuck in a rut. She’s still living with her parents (the amusing double act of Joan Cusack and Bradley Whitford) and trying to make it as an artist, struggling to convince the art world to embrace her childlike paintings. When she finally decides to grow up and get a job as a temp, she starts receiving mysterious notes, inviting her to “the store”. She succumbs and finds a mysterious man (Samuel L Jackson) offering her exactly what she’s always wanted: a unicorn. However, there are a few important things she needs to do first ... If it all sounds insufferably twee, then at times it really is – but it’s not a total misfire. Larson is a competent director and unlike other recent actor turned film-makers (step forward Ryan Gosling), she doesn’t let her film drown in the aped style of others. Scenes are solidly staged and she resists the urge to overload the film with extraneous flourishes. But it’s a deceptively difficult task in a debut film, and the tonal shifts become too much for her to handle. The quirky setup becomes a route into a more dramatic look at a woman struggling to progress from adolescence to adulthood. It’s a surprise, given her largely drama-based background, that it’s in the more serious scenes that the film truly falters. The biggest takeaway from Unicorn Store is that Larson is a skilled comic presence. She just about keeps things tolerable, even in some of the sillier moments, and makes a convincing case to be cast in more comedies. Judd Apatow recognized this, casting her in Trainwreck, and she was an excellent host of Saturday Night Live, but we need to see more of her in lighter fare. Jackson is less successful in a small role and his Mr Magorium-esque figure grates whenever he’s on screen. The key messaging has been sold in other, better films many times before, and Larson’s film has little more to add, disappearing from the memory as soon as the credits roll. There’s also a failed attempt at romance between her character and a hardware store worker, played by the Patti Cake$ and The Get Down star Mamoudou Athie. He has presence, but his role is little more than an assistant, and it’s not entirely clear why he would help her in a quest to make a stable for a unicorn, her character coming off as someone with mental health issues rather than the manic pixie dream girl the film seems to think she is. She never feels like a real person, just a collection of quirks, which is especially jarring when the film tries to aim for pathos in the misjudged final stretch. As a film-maker, Larson shows promise, and as a comic actor she shows genuine talent. With a less affected, more genuine script, Larson could star in and direct a great comedy. Unicorn Store is not it. Unicorn Store is screening at the Toronto film festival and will be released at a later date"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"football/blog/2017/sep/12/sunderland-women-mens-youth-teams-womens-super-league","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-12T12:56:26Z","webTitle":"Sunderland prove elite women’s football plays second fiddle to men’s youth teams | Suzanne Wrack","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2017/sep/12/sunderland-women-mens-youth-teams-womens-super-league","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/blog/2017/sep/12/sunderland-women-mens-youth-teams-womens-super-league","fields":{"headline":"Sunderland prove elite women’s sides play second fiddle to men’s youth teams","bodyText":"The decision of Sunderland to relocate their women’s team miles from home – turfed off the Academy of Light training pitches and out of their Hetton Centre home ground – follows a worrying pattern. The move, from the club that kickstarted the careers of a host of England internationals now laden with silverware such as Lucy Bronze, Jill Scott, Demi Stokes, Jordan Nobbs and the Manchester City and England captain Steph Houghton, is a further blow to a team who seemed to be thriving in recent years. Promotion to the top tier of women’s football in 2015, having won the WSL 2, was followed by an impressive fourth-place finish – staying in the WSL 1 after promotion is increasingly difficult as the gulf between those arriving in the league and the professional teams at the top continues to grow. A challenging 2016 saw them drop to seventh, before they pulled up to fifth behind Chelsea, Manchester City, Arsenal and Liverpool – the top four professionalised sides – in the Spring Series at the start of the year. That Spring Series position was all the more impressive given the situation the players found themselves in four months before the interim league got under way. An announcement of reversion to part-time status after three years with a mixture of full-time and part-time players – misleadingly pitched as a positive move by the club chief executive, Martin Bain – reflected the commitment of the club to its women’s team. It forced out players such as the Northern Ireland international Rachel Furness, in search of full-time employment elsewhere. This latest change from the club, which will add lengthy journey times to evening training for a side made up entirely of part-time players and distances the women’s side from Sunderland AFC as a whole, is the first noticeable casualty of the FA’s decision to switch the league from a summer to winter season. The players are understood to be disappointed, partly because there will be a drop in the quality of the facilities. Although the seasonal change is beneficial to players’ personal lives, leaving fewer random intervals between games (maintaining momentum) and fits in significantly better with the international calendar, how clubs balance their women’s teams’ training and playing alongside the men’s timetables remains unknown. What we do know is that on the list of a club’s priorities, the men’s team will always come out on top. The women must clear off the official Sunderland training pitches and head to Northumbria University’s Coach Lane campus to make way for the men’s youth teams. It’s also what is happening in Paris, where according to Le Parisien the Champions League runners-up Paris Saint-Germain are being forced to find a new home, with pitch priority being given to the boys’ youth teams at the Camp des Loges training centre. Even at the top, women’s football doesn’t even play second fiddle. In north-east England, following on from the decision to switch back to part-time players, Sunderland’s commitment to its women’s team has to be questioned. The future for a Sunderland women’s team who reached the 2016 FA Cup semi-final looks bleak. A move so far from their home, within touching distance of their local rivals Newcastle, could be devastating. BBC figures showed the Black Cats were one of three WSL clubs in 2016 to see a drop in attendances on the previous year. Turnout at the Hetton Centre fell by 24%, the biggest drop in WSL 1, to an average of 710. A logistically problematic move for fans could well send those figures plummeting further, increasingly harming sustainability. Yes, balancing conflicting schedules is hard but in the men’s game solutions to problems are found. There is no challenge too big – a World Cup in the searing Qatari heat is doable, Tottenham can play a season at Wembley; there are many examples. In contrast the women’s game logistical barriers, even relatively small ones, become insurmountable. The regression of the Black Cats, alongside the collapse of Notts County on the eve of the Spring Series just weeks after the FA announced its impressive Gameplan for Growth – aiming to double participation and support for women’s football by 2020 – show some of the huge hurdles the still fledging sport faces on the road to sustainability. Tragically at present no club is safe. The news, broken by the BBC last week, that the FA is consulting on whether to change the Women’s Super League into a fully-professional one-tier league presents further challenges. Everyone with an interest in women’s football wants to see professionalism increase. The intention is correct: more professional sides in the top tier will help increase the competitiveness of the league across the board. Competitive leagues are more attractive for sponsors and spectators. However after a battle to open up promotion and relegation to and from the WSL in 2016, of which Women’s Premier League winners Tottenham are the latest beneficiaries, there is also a feeling that removing on-field rewards in favour of league placement based on meeting off-field criteria isn’t the way to go about solving these problems. Clubs lower down the ladder and at grassroots level, those crucial to the long-term growth of the sport, won’t be big beneficiaries of this move. In fact the gap between themselves and the top will look increasingly large. Clubs such as Sunderland would find their league status under threat. Whether this move would motivate them to meet the FA’s licensing requirements and seriously commit to the growth of women’s football or cut ties with their women’s team entirely is impossible to tell. But their recent track record offers an indication of attitudes at the club. With women’s teams reliant on men’s clubs it’s very difficult to see a time where the women’s team is the first thing to face the axe when the going gets tough. Tinkering with the set-up of the women’s leagues is necessary, from top to bottom. They are not perfect by any stretch. But wholesale change at this stage may be premature. The WSL was created in 2011, the WSL 2 in 2014. The switch to a winter season is taking place this year. It doesn’t feel like these leagues have had time to develop. Such frequent change means we haven’t had a period of stability to accurately assess how well these formats work. Ultimately these seemingly bold moves could be detrimental to the long-term viability of the women’s rickety pyramid. Talking points • Players competing in the top tier of Australian women’s football, the 10-year-old W-League, will receive pay increases and better conditions after a historic collective bargaining agreement between the Football Federation Australia, the Westfield W-League clubs and Professional Footballers Australia. The two-year deals guarantee all players a minimum $10,000 (£6,100) retainer, rising to $12,200 for 2018-19. The change would see the average for the 2017-18 season rise from $6,909 to $15,500. Previously many players have been considered amateur, receiving expenses only. The agreement also provides contractual certainty, a significantly increased salary cap, an agreed commercial framework to underpin the growth of the women’s game, improved minimum medical standards, the outline of the first ever formal maternity policy and the establishment of a formal partnership with the players through the Professional Women’s Football Committee. The highest earning Australian professionals are expected to now earn at least $130,000 a year. • Arsenal’s Jodie Taylor and Jordan Nobbs won Player of the Year and Goal of the Year awards respectively at the annual FA Women’s Football Awards last Friday. Nobbs also picked up players’ player of the year and Taylor was given a standing ovation for her golden boot win from England’s Euro 2017 campaign. The Bristol City forward Lauren Hemp took home Young Player of the Year having scored five goals in U-17 Euro 2017 qualifying as well as scoring once in the finals themselves. • Ellie Brazil, who was nominated for Young Player of the Year, has left Birmingham City to join the Serie A champions Fiorentina. The 18-year-old played for England in the U-19 European Championship finals, starring against Italy. • Scotland have named Rachel Corsie as their captain following the retirement of their most-capped player, Gemma Fay, after Euro 2017. Corsie, picked by the new head coach, Shelley Kerr, will lead out the team for the first time against Hungary on 14 September before the side embark on their campaign for World Cup qualification. The defender plays for Seattle Reign in the National Women’s Soccer League in the US. They are clinging to hopes of a play-off place after a 94th-minute equaliser against Orlando Pride kept them in the race. The Arsenal forward Kim Little, who devastatingly missed the side’s maiden European Championship finals through injury, has been named Scotland’s vice-captain. • The euphoria of Holland’s surprise Euro 2017 win doesn’t seeming to be wearing off. The Oranje’s World Cup 2019 qualifier against Norway on 24 October, taking place in Groningen’s 22,329-capacity stadium, sold out within three days."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/blog/2017/sep/12/travel-us-south-africa-newcastle-saracens-leinster-rugby","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-12T08:00:30Z","webTitle":"Travel can broaden game but club trips to US and South Africa make little sense | Robert Kitson","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2017/sep/12/travel-us-south-africa-newcastle-saracens-leinster-rugby","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/blog/2017/sep/12/travel-us-south-africa-newcastle-saracens-leinster-rugby","fields":{"headline":"Travel can broaden game but club trips to US and South Africa make little sense","bodyText":"Before this week the most absurd away fixture in European club rugby history was probably Connacht’s 12,000-mile round trip to Siberia in November 2015. The Irish province did manage to beat their Challenge Cup opponents Enisei-STM in temperatures as low as -18C but a technical fault with a charter plane caused such travel chaos some players were stranded for days. “Energy levels at all time low … BO levels at an all-time high,” read the memorable tweet from the Connacht back-rower John Muldoon. Once upon a time crossing the Severn Bridge was the most exotic cross-border club rugby experience available. Not any more. This week, Newcastle will abandon Kingston Park to face Saracens at the Talen Energy Stadium, a football stadium in Chester, Pennsylvania. On Sunday, in the unofficial Sir David Attenborough derby, the Cheetahs entertain Zebre of Italy in Bloemfontein. On Saturday, Leinster will meet the Southern Kings in Port Elizabeth. Where on earth is the logic of a struggling Italian side travelling all the way to southern Africa to play a team ousted from Super Rugby? Think of the extra costs, think of the carbon bootprint? There are not many Newcastle supporters in Pennsylvania either; cheering the Falcons in the United States tends to be confined to Atlanta. At first glance it is akin to Derbyshire or Somerset trying to sell tickets for a game of cricket in Osaka. Edward Griffiths, formerly the chief executive of Saracens and the South African Rugby Union, is among those who believe the additional air miles can be counter-productive. “In isolation these matches are just the circus that arrives in town, puts up the big tent and then leaves,” Griffiths says. “The financial position all depends on the deal you’ve done with the circus. Some are good, some are less good. In the absence of a short-term financial windfall or a long-term strategy, these sort of ventures are going to be pretty inconsequential really.” Much also depends on where you erect the big top. Griffiths has doubts whether America is the ideal place to host Premiership games and reckons Japan might ultimately be a better choice: “Rugby in America to me looks like a collection of individuals and companies looking to make a quick buck out of what they perceive as a growing game. No one is actually prepared to do the hard yards and build the structure of the game. It’s all very fragmented and short term. Until that changes, I can’t see it being much of a developing market. “Premiership Rugby would have to answer whether these fixtures are having any impact on rugby in America. Personally I would doubt it. With these games you’re planting a seed. If you plant a seed in the desert it’s not going to do very much. If you plant it in a fertile area you never know what might become of it.” The Pro14 venture into Africa makes slightly more short-term sense for both parties although Griffiths is not a million miles off when he describes it as “a marriage of the desperate and the desperate.” The Cheetahs and Kings are simply trying to stay in existence; the Pro14 badly needs to boost its profile and television revenues. “Strategically I’ve long thought there’s a future for north v south rugby in South Africa,” Griffiths says. “But when you do something for the first time you need to put your best foot forward. It’s just a pity the Cheetahs and the Kings, with all due respect, are not the best. There might be some novelty interest but beyond that it is going to be limited.” This week in the Free State, Leinster will also have to contend with temperatures of 32C with the southern summer fast approaching. “Playing rugby in Bloemfontein in December is bonkers,” Griffiths says. “There’s a reason they don’t play rugby there at that time.” And never mind the poor old away fans, not that Zebre supporters travel anywhere in mass herds. Those who insist TV eyeballs are now infinitely more important than paying customers backing the opposition are overlooking this year’s Lions tour to New Zealand; without the red Lions’ hordes, would the concept have felt as special or even continue to exist? Travel can broaden the mind but, equally, it helps to have a viable destination. More protection for No10s The Premiership is barely a fortnight old but there is one early concern. It did not require poor Demetri Catrakilis of Harlequins to be taken to hospital with a fracture to a bone in his throat to detect a trend; skilful No10s being forced off the field following wince-inducing collisions. Quins’s Marcus Smith against London Irish, Exeter’s Gareth Steenson at Gloucester, Worcester’s Tom Heathcote against Wasps … all felled by legal but ferocious hits that deprived their teams of their playmaker at crucial points. Pressurising the opposition 10 will always be part of the game – as George Ford is currently being reminded – but the old days of sidestepping a solitary wing forward a la Phil Bennett and finding acres of usable space are long gone. If rugby fails to preserve its diminutive baton twirlers, it will be an immeasurably poorer sport. One to watch this week … Good luck to all involved when the inaugural Tyrrells Premier 15s women’s domestic league kicks off this weekend. On the back of last month’s women’s Rugby World Cup – and with an investment of £2.4m from the RFU over the next three years – the aim is to improve standards within the women’s game and increase the talent pool available for selection for England. “We hope to double the number of women and girls playing the game over the next four years to 50,000 players and a lot of them will want to participate in this league,” said Nigel Melville, the RFU’s director of professional rugby."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"politics/2017/sep/11/eu-withdrawal-bill-brexit-parliament-debate-hearing","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-11T20:06:19Z","webTitle":"EU withdrawal bill enters parliament – one great illusion of power | John Crace","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/sep/11/eu-withdrawal-bill-brexit-parliament-debate-hearing","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/sep/11/eu-withdrawal-bill-brexit-parliament-debate-hearing","fields":{"headline":"EU withdrawal bill is no good. So we’re voting for it","bodyText":"As the second reading of the EU withdrawal bill neared its close, Conservative MP Bernard Jenkin tried to introduce a note of calm. Everyone on the Labour benches was getting much too worked up. The bill wasn’t some sort of crazed power grab by an insecure and incompetent government, it was just a dreary piece of necessary admin. So dreary that the government couldn’t even be bothered to amend the bill to take away the powers it hadn’t intended to give itself. He stifled a yawn. Parliament should just chill out a bit. Live and let live. Yes, the bill wasn’t perfect but what in life was? Better a bad bill, than no bill at all. In any case, a vote against the bill would be a vote for chaos. Labour’s Pat McFadden observed that it would be hard to come up with anything more chaotic than the current situation when no two cabinet ministers could agree on anything to do with Brexit. But this wasn’t enough to convince two of his colleagues. Frank Field was adamant anything that sought to improve the terms on which Britain left the EU would be seen as defying the will of the people. “We need a means for how we review which legislation we keep and which we don’t,” he said. Though not enough for him to actually do anything about it. As far as Field was concerned, anything that sought to improve the terms on which Britain left the EU was a fundamental betrayal. The only true Brexit was a punishment Brexit. So, much as he might like the government to have rethought its position, he felt obliged to let their bad legislation go through on the nod. To err is human, to suffer is divine. Caroline Flint was just as confused. “This bill is not hugely controversial,” she announced. In fact it was so uncontroversial that she was planning on abstaining in the vote. Her colleagues looked understandably surprised. Their idea of uncontroversial was a bill they could vote for or against with a clean conscience; not one where they couldn’t make up their minds what to do. The new look conviction politician is apparently one without the courage of her convictions. It took Conservative Edward Leigh to inject some reason into the debate. Not a sentence that gets written too often as Leigh is not known for being one of the sharpest minds in the Commons. But cometh the hour, cometh the man. Or take it as a symptom of how poor many of the contributions had previously been. Your choice. Leigh is an old school Brexiter, so if he thinks there is something seriously wrong with the country’s approach to its withdrawal from the EU then you know we’re in big trouble. He began by suggesting that Britain should try to be more magnanimous in its negotiations and be generous in its offer of a financial settlement. This was met with silence from the many on his own benches who would rather cut off other people’s hands than give the EU a penny. He then moved on to the bill itself. It was bad law and in urgent need of amendment. Even he had to admit that the Conservative government’s very obvious attempts to limit the powers of parliaments through so-called Henry VIII clauses was a step too far. “ Henry VIII was a bastard, but he was my kind of my bastard,” he shrugged, explaining why he would still vote for it regardless. A Brexiter couldn’t look a gift horse in the mouth, after all. There were limits to Leigh’s largesse. This emboldened several other Tories to voice their concerns; mildly and with deep regret, of course – “Please don’t think for a second we care about this enough to consider voting against the government” – but the government frontbench could sense which way the wind was blowing. A few amendments would have to be made. Not many, but some. More as a symbolic gesture than to make a real difference. Parliament must be given the illusion of power. Even as it was to be denied it."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"education/2017/sep/12/teachers-pay-in-england-down-12-per-cent-10-years-influential-study-reveals","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-12T09:00:31Z","webTitle":"Teachers' pay in England down by 12% in 10 years, influential study reveals","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2017/sep/12/teachers-pay-in-england-down-12-per-cent-10-years-influential-study-reveals","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/education/2017/sep/12/teachers-pay-in-england-down-12-per-cent-10-years-influential-study-reveals","fields":{"headline":"Teachers' pay in England down by 12% in 10 years, influential study reveals","bodyText":"Teachers’ salaries in England have dropped by more than a tenth in the last decade while their earnings have risen in comparable countries, according to an influential international study. The survey by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) shows that teachers’ salaries in England were worth 12% less in 2015 than in 2005 and 6% less in Scotland. This contrasts sharply with trends elsewhere in OECD countries, where teachers’ salaries have gone up in real terms by an average of 10% at pre-primary level and 6% at primary, with the rate of growth slightly slower – but still up – at secondary. The study, published on Tuesday, comes as pressure grows on the government to lift the 1% public sector pay cap that is holding down teachers’ salaries and contributing to a crisis in teacher recruitment and retention, according to unions. Union leaders attending the TUC conference on Monday demanded a 5% pay increase for all public sector workers, threatening coordinated strike action against the cap. According to the NASUWT teachers’ union, the average pay award for teachers last year was 0.6%. Amid growing expectation that the cap is about to be lifted for police and prison officers, representatives of 13 unions called for more money to be found to retain and reward teachers, as well as nurses, council staff and civil servants. In a separate report on Tuesday, the government’s spending watchdog, the National Audit Office, said secondary schools in England were struggling to recruit enough teachers to keep up with retiring staff and rising pupil numbers. Tens of thousands of teachers left England’s schools before reaching retirement age last year, and headteachers are finding it difficult to fill posts with good quality candidates. The decreasing value of teachers’ salaries in England is revealed in the OECD’s annual Education at a Glance survey, which provides a picture of the state of education around the world, comparing data in 35 OECD countries, plus a number of partner countries. The broad trend shows the impact of the economic downturn in 2008, with pay generally frozen or cut between 2009 and 2013, before starting to increase again, but England’s teachers appear to be falling behind. The report notes: “Among the half of the OECD countries with available data on statutory salaries of teachers with typical qualifications for 2000 and 2015 (and no break in the time series), teachers’ salaries increased overall in real terms in most of these countries during this period.” England was a notable exception, the report said. “On average across OECD countries and economies with available data for 2005 and 2015 reference years, salaries increased by 6% at primary level, 6% at lower secondary level and 4% at upper secondary level.” The increase exceeded 20% in Poland at pre-primary, primary and secondary levels, as a result of a 2007 government programme that aimed to boost teachers’ salaries and to improve the quality of education by providing financial incentives to attract high-quality teachers. There were also significant increases in Israel, Latvia, Luxembourg, Norway and Turkey, while teachers’ salaries decreased in Portugal and also in Greece, where they went down 28% in value. In England and Scotland, as in most OECD countries, teachers are paid less on average than other university-educated workers. The OECD report also shows that the UK spends the highest proportion of GDP on primary to tertiary educational institutions (6.6% compared with the OECD average of 5.2%) , while an above-average share of funding comes from private sources rather than public spending. While the UK allocates a larger proportion of public spending to education overall than the OECD average, at university level, only 28% of expenditure comes from public funding because students pay their own tuition fees, compared with the OECD average of 70%. The OECD survey also notes that tuition fees in England are among the highest among countries able to provide data."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/sep/12/nuclear-tensions-cast-chill-over-south-koreas-winter-olympic-build-up","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-12T04:30:33Z","webTitle":"Nuclear tensions cast chill over South Korea's Winter Olympic buildup","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/sep/12/nuclear-tensions-cast-chill-over-south-koreas-winter-olympic-build-up","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/sep/12/nuclear-tensions-cast-chill-over-south-koreas-winter-olympic-build-up","fields":{"headline":"Nuclear tensions cast chill over South Korea's Winter Olympic buildup","bodyText":"Nuclear tensions and public apathy are hitting ticket sales for 2018’s Winter Olympics in the South Korean town of Pyeongchang, casting a shadow over what had been billed as the “peace games”. Organisers hope to attract more than a million spectators to the Games in five months’ time. Events will be held 80km (50 miles) from the South’s heavily armed border with North Korea. But early ticket sales have been disappointing. In the first phase of sales between February and June only 52,000 tickets were sold inside South Korea – less than 7% of the 750,000 seats organisers aim to sell domestically. International sales were stronger, with overseas sport fans buying more than half the targeted 320,000 seats, but the rate is below that of most previous winter Games at this stage of preparations. Online ticket sales began last week. There is particular concern that so few tickets have been sold in China and Japan, which were expected to account for the bulk of all international sales. Economic ties and tourism have been hit by Chinese anger over Seoul’s deployment of a US missile defence system, while there is growing concern over the safety of Japanese residents and visitors to South Korea. North Korea’s recent nuclear test and launches of intercontinental ballistic missiles have also dented hopes that the two Koreas would embrace sports diplomacy and field joint teams during the Games, which run from 9-25 February. As recently as July, South Korea’s sports minister, Do Jong-hwan, suggested forming an inter-Korean women’s ice hockey team, and there were suggestions that the North could host some of the skiing events at its Masikryong ski resort. But those initiatives appear to have made little progress. South Korea’s president, Moon Jae-in, said North Korea would be given as much time as necessary to decide on its participation. Organisers said athletes from the North would be permitted to enter South Korea via the demilitarised zone as a peace gesture. The president of the International Olympic Committee, Thomas Bach, said in August there was “no reason for any immediate concern” about tensions on the Korean peninsula. But that was shortly before the regime fired a ballistic missile over Japan and detonated what it claimed was a powerful hydrogen bomb. Olympic officials played down the tense political backdrop to Pyeongchang and voiced confidence that the Games would prove as popular as other international sports events held in South Korea, including the 1988 Summer Olympics and the 2002 football World Cup. “Sports are sports, and we should not confuse sports with politics,” Lee Hee-beom, president of the Pyeongchang organising committee, told reporters in Seoul last week, adding that there were “signs” that North Korea would take part. “In the 1988 Seoul Olympics and the 2002 World Cup, the situation surrounding the Korean peninsula wasn’t that good, but we hosted the events well,” Lee said, according to Yonhap. South Korean officials believe participation by North Korean athletes would dramatically reduce the potential for disruption during the Games. But the state has a poor track record in the Winter Olympics, having won just a silver and bronze medal in eight appearances. It did not take part at the Sochi games in 2014."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/sep/13/there-is-no-harm-caused-by-same-sex-parenting-studies-suggesting-otherwise-are-skewed","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-12T18:00:42Z","webTitle":"There is no harm caused by same-sex parenting.

Studies suggesting otherwise are skewed","bodyText":"Children have been frequently brought into the debate around legalisation of same-sex marriage. Some individuals have asserted that same-sex couples should not marry or have children, because they believe a child has a fundamental right to both a mother and father. Others suggest that same-sex parenting leads to children who have poor outcomes, or who are abused. It has also been suggested that the social validation of one child’s family, by allowing their same-sex parents to marry, would cause harm to school friends through increased awareness that homosexuality exists, or becoming gender fluid themselves as a result. It behoves any good society to look after the welfare of its children and to ensure that potential harms to those children are researched, quantified and avoided. Paediatricians specialise in child welfare, and it is our responsibility to understand the relevant research data. On review of a large body of research, paediatricians and other experts repeatedly come to the same conclusion: children raised by same-sex parents are no different from those raised by heterosexual parents. Of 79 research studies on this topic, 95% support no difference between same sex or heterosexual parents. However, much attention has been drawn to the results of the outlier 5%, which suggest poorer outcomes in same-sex parented families. It is important to look at these outlier studies in detail. While in academia anyone should be able to analyse and publish data, it’s unusual that recent papers reporting outlier outcomes have been led by non-expert authors, including an economist, a sociologist with particular interest in religious matters and an academic whose stated expertise is in faith and religion. One can already see the risk of bias in the interpretation of the data, and close analysis does find methodological flaws in the outlier studies. We know that children who experience family breakdown or a single parent don’t tend to do as well as those with stable, married parents. The outlier studies looked at children from families with same-sex attracted parents in the presence of parental separation and compared these to children who have heterosexual, married parents. That is, unlike more robust studies, they incorrectly conflated the married/unmarried issue with same-sex parenting. In fact, as we know that stable, married parents are associated with good child welfare outcomes, it would be beneficial for children from same-sex families to have parents who are married. And we have already seen a positive outcome on children in results from countries where same-sex marriage exists. In a concerning, frequently quoted outlier study, an author looked at a series of questions asked of children. The analysis was seriously skewed by the misclassification of questions. Questions which clearly do not describe child abuse were labelled as being associated with child abuse. This led to the false assertion that there are any difference in indicators of abuse between children with same-sex or heterosexual parents. With regard to effects on the gender fluidity of children, there is no truth to the suggestion that same-sex parenting, or the knowledge that homosexuality exists, is associated with childhood gender variance. Children of same-sex parents consistently strongly identify with their biological sex. Although there exists a separate group of gender questioning children, who may share experiences of discrimination, their condition is not related to same-sex parenting. It is harmful to suggest that legal validation of a same-sex family will cause damage to separate, heterosexually parented children. It is also harmful to tell gay children they are going to be poor parents when they grow up to have a family of their own. And it is frankly harmful to tell children of same-sex parents that they are being abused. The United Nations convention on the rights of the child is based on four general principles: the right to non-discrimination, the right to the best interest of the child, the right to survival and development, and the right to be heard. The data shows that same-sex parents can provide for these rights at least as well as heterosexual parents. As a paediatrician, I have experience working with children from all kinds of family structures. Young people from same-sex parented families have without fail been among the most wanted, loved, and well raised and cared for children I have seen. It’s perfectly valid to have a mature discussion on differing opinions regarding the legalisation of same-sex marriage. However, it is imperative that the adults in the debate ensure children are not harmed by misleading or false assertions, and it’s not acceptable to suggest there is any harm caused by same-sex parenting. Many Australian children have same-sex parents. We cannot harm these children for no valid reason.

Unai Emery, Paris Saint-Germain’s manager, has admitted on the eve of the Champions League getting under way that he feels a “responsibility” to deliver success after a summer transfer splurge. Neymar and Kylian Mbappé have joined Dani Alves in Paris, with finance as delivered from Qatar placing the club among Europe’s elite. All three are expected to play at Celtic on Tuesday evening. “It’s true that it’s the most important competition,” Emery said. “So I have a lot of responsibility, with so many good players at my disposal. “We go into the game with a lot of confidence. We have worked hard and we will have to work hard here. I feel that we look forward to good start. I know, obviously, that the Champions League is a big objective for the club. But I know it’s going to be difficult against Celtic.” Thiago Silva, PSG’s captain and an international team-mate of Neymar, emphasised the confidence that exists within Emery’s squad. Silva insisted events of last season – PSG lost 6-1 to Barcelona in the reversal of a 4-0 first leg win at the last 16 stage – are “already forgotten”. “I don’t know if we are the [Champions League] favourites,” the defender said. “We should get close this year. There are a lot of players with a lot of quality across the Champions League. But we have a lot of talent in our team. We’ve prepared hard for the Champions League and we are very motivated. “We know that Celtic are a very good team. We know how hard they are to beat at home. We expect a match with a lot of intensity. They will be very strong in closing us down, trying to stop us from playing. We analysed them this morning. “But with the players we’ve got, we are aiming to go far. The atmosphere in the team is magnificent. We will try to handle the pressure as well as we can. If we stick together, we can handle the pressure of trying to go far in the Champions League.” Silva smiled when asked whether training had become significantly more difficult for defenders given the arrival of Mbappé and Neymar. “The recruitment was very good,” he said. “They are both experienced and they are both very motivated to improve this team. We have confidence in them as team-mates. Neymar has so much experience in the Champions League. He can maybe make the difference. The three players we have signed are incredible. “It’s just normal that training is hard. When you’ve got these guys in there with this technique and ability on the ball, it’s an impossible task to stop them every time. They have their own individual quality. Neymar’s speed is almost unstoppable. Marking him in training is improving me. “Both Neymar and Kylian Mbappé are very intelligent footballers, as is Dani Alves. It’s very easy for them. I spoke with Neymar a lot before he signed, about the positives and negatives of the club. He has settled very quickly. As I expected him to.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"australia-news/live/2017/sep/12/agl-wants-to-have-its-cake-and-eat-it-too-says-josh-frydenberg-politics-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-12T08:32:06Z","webTitle":"Shorten asks Turnbull when he will act on clean energy target – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2017/sep/12/agl-wants-to-have-its-cake-and-eat-it-too-says-josh-frydenberg-politics-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/live/2017/sep/12/agl-wants-to-have-its-cake-and-eat-it-too-says-josh-frydenberg-politics-live","fields":{"headline":"Shorten asks Turnbull when he will act on clean energy target – as it happened","bodyText":"We largely remained in a holding pattern today, as the government worked to convince people it had made headway in its campaign to convince AGL to either keep the almost 50-year old Liddell coal-fired power station open, or sell it on to an investor who will. But AGL boss Andy Vesey only promised to take a proposal to the board and return in 90 days with a plan to fill the baseload power shortfall for when the plant is slated to close in 2022. This made it hard for the government to move the debate too far forward, but that didn’t stop them from trying. Which is why, for the second day in a row, energy completely dominated the corridors of power, with just a few brief forays onto other issues. Here is what we learnt today: Energy minister Josh Frydenberg believes there is “no other option” other than keeping Liddell going. Frydenberg and Labor’s Joel Fitzgibbon engaged in a verbal scuffle over energy policy in the hallways of parliament. Most voters want the government to step in and regulate power prices. Labor remains ahead of the Coalition in the polls, but Malcolm Turnbull has staged a slight comeback in terms of voter approval. Energy completely dominated question time, where Labor changed tact and prosecuted the government over how it plans to solve rising power prices, given it is now in its “fifth year of governing”. The ABS began sending out the marriage equality postal survey forms. 14-year-old Eddie Blewett returned to parliament to lobby for the yes vote. He came to question time a year ago with his mums, asking why marriage equality still had not happened. Labor and the Coalition have come close on agreeing on safeguard legislation for the campaign. The government appears to be a hair’s breadth away from striking a deal with the crossbench on its media reform legislation. Malcolm Turnbull and Julie Bishop called on China to use its influence to pull North Korea into line, while welcoming further sanctions on the secretive state. Justice minister Michael Keenan announced plans to introduce the ‘toughest laws in a generation’ for child sex offenders, which will include punitive measures for internet providers who do not report abusive materials. Construction has begun in earnest on the security fence parliament had to have - but won’t say why. Tomorrow the Senate will be kept busy with media laws and the higher education funding changes the government is hoping to work through. But don’t expect energy to go anywhere soon. It’s one issue where both sides think they are on a winner. That’s it for us today – thank you for coming along on my first solo keyboard ride. I couldn’t have made it without the Guardian Australia political brains trust, Katharine Murphy, Gareth Hutchens and Paul Karp and of course, a massive thank you to Mike Bowers and his ability to catch our honourable members, particularly Bob Katter, just perfectly. We’ll be back bright and bushy-tailed tomorrow morning –questions, queries or complaints to @amyremeikis and appreciation to @mpbowers. And speaking of Mr Bowers, he’s off to photograph Olivia Newton-John who is making a special guest appearance in parliament tonight to discuss the Olivia Newton-John Cancer Research Institute and ‘her personal experience with breast cancer’. We’ll have that – and a lot more – for you tomorrow. Tony Abbott has written on why he believes marriage equality will ‘fundamentally’ change society for Fairfax Media. Here’s a taste: Love might be love but it’s striking how little love the supporters of same sex marriage are showing for anyone who disagrees with them. It’s paradoxical how respect has flown out the window in the fight for yet more respect. It’s hard to see, at least from the tenor of the campaign to bring it in, how we would be a more decent society with same sex marriage than without it.” If you want to read more, you’ll find it here. Malcolm Turnbull is hitting the airwaves again, with a nice little swipe at earlier comments he is a Johnny-come-lately to the FM band. Barnaby Joyce is a lot more comfortable talking about energy than he is about marriage equality. Asked why the anti-vilification legislation was needed, Joyce couldn’t get out of there fast enough. Look I think people have heard my comments, I support the current definition of marriage – that’s it. I’ve made up [my mind], I’ve bet you have made up yours, I bet your listeners have made up theirs. I am sort of sick of people screaming at you. Everyone has made up their mind. I think the sooner this survey gets [done] the better. After getting a break in question time, with Labor abandoning its citizenship prosecutions, the deputy prime minister, Barnaby Joyce, is out and about on Sky News, talking energy with David Speers. More specifically, Liddell. And who might like to buy it. Joyce says he “knows people out there and they are not fools and they want to buy it.” I know of two entities – I am not going to disclose them – I’d have to ask them do they want me to give their information on Sky to you, but I absolutely know two. If AGL put it on the market – see they are going to pull it to pieces, it is going to hit the deck, so they must think it is not worth anything. So let’s get a bidding process going and see who wants to buy it. AGL don’t want to sell it, they want to basically pull it down. That would suggest if they want to pull it down, what do you think they value it at. If I have a car that I am going to chuck off a cliff and put in the ocean, what do you think my value is on that car? But as for price, Joyce believes there are people within the market “who know exactly what they are walking into” – which includes the rehabilitation costs. Speers puts that figure at “half to one billion dollars”. I am not going to – I would say you are in a good range there,” Joyce said. ... If it is such a dog of an asset, and we all suspect what the answer to this question is, if it is such a dog of an asset, if it is so terrible, then why not put it out there. Seeing as you are going to pull it to pieces, hit the deck, blow it up, whatever you are going to do? Then why not find someone out there who wants to buy it? Malcolm Turnbull and Julie Bishop have released a joint media statement once again calling on China to pressure North Korea into falling into line. Australia encourages all members of the international community to fully implement the UN Security Council resolutions. We urge China in particular to use its unique economic leverage over Pyongyang to place further pressure on the North Korean regime. Australia will move quickly to implement the measures under the new resolution and will continue to work with our partners to uphold global peace and stability. Tanya Plibersek had a little more to say about those safeguards while talking to David Speers on Sky News this afternoon. We are keen to see protections for people from vilification, we are keen to see things like proper authorisations, but, given the party room bill was still being negotiated this morning, we do reserve the right to move amendments and so on as well. Just a little more on some things the parliament can agree on. Paul Karp reports on the penalties of breaching the anti-vilification safeguards surrounding the marriage equality campaign. Penalties of up to $12,600 and court-ordered injunctions will be available as remedies for people who are vilified, intimidated or threatened for participation in the same-sex marriage postal survey under a new proposed law. Although the vilification provision would extend to both sides of the debate, Labor has warned a new bill will only provide limited protections and hurtful material will not be stopped. Paul Karp has more on that here. Seems like the prime minister has recovered from the “outrage”* from the last time he was caught “multitasking”. *Sarcasm. A few social media posts from people annoyed that the prime minister held his baby granddaughter at the same time as a beer at the football does not outrage make. All good things must come to an end. Barnaby Joyce at his mercurial best. At least some people still find the joy in question time. We saw a change in tactics from Labor today. Instead of prosecuting the government over citizenship, it moved on to energy – focusing on how long the Coalition has been in power. The line “given this government is in its fifth year of office” will stick. For its part, the government has moved on from direct name-calling to the more passive-aggressive approach of “their constituents aren’t laughing when they can’t pay for the blackout bill (lowercase intended)”. Another question on energy policy to the prime minister, with Bill Shorten asking whatever happened to the clean energy target, and we are done with another question time. Malcolm Turnbull keeps the holding pattern on that in place: The clean energy target proposed by Alan Finkel in his report – 49 recommendations of which have already been accepted and are being worked through by the relevant energy minister’s council. That 50th recommendation, we have under consideration. I’ll be very plain with the honourable members – all honourable members – we need to make sure that we get the energy market right this time. Because there has been a consistent failure in policy. Really surprised. Barnaby Joyce seems just as surprised as the rest of us he got through an entire answer without interruption. Tanya Plibersek to Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull: Yesterday, the attorney general blamed Labor for not supporting gas reservation earlier. So why did the minister for energy attack Labor’s gas reservation policy last year when he said, ‘It will kill investment, destroy jobs and, ultimately, lead to less gas supply’? Given this government is now in its fifth year of office, when will this government stop blaming everyone else and take responsibility for the mess that this Liberal government has made of energy policy in this country?” Turnbull flicks the question to Josh Frydenberg, who is quite excited at the chance to answer it. The Labor party never had a gas reservation policy! The only ideas you put forward is that future developments may be reserved for some domestic use! That would do nothing for the immediate issue we have today, which is the supply shortfalls – as indicated by Aemo and others. Only Prime Minister Turnbull’s response – which is to put in place these export restrictions – can have that effect to meet the supply shortfalls. We’re already seeing the positive impact of the discussions and the actions that we are taking.” Plibersek attempts to table Frydenberg’s comments from when Labor announced its gas policy, but is denied. But no matter – she has made her point. But being in accord in that chamber is quite rare Foreign Minister Julie Bishop takes advantage of a dixer to update the House on the North Korea situation: The new additional sanctions target very important parts of the North Korean economy. There will be a complete ban on the export of all North Korean textiles – that’s worth about $950 million a year to the regime. The amount of oil that North Korea can import will be reduced by a third. There will also be a prohibition on the importation of natural gas. All joint ventures with North Korean individuals and entities are banned. No North Korean worker will be permitted to work overseas once their current contracts are completed. And no new work visas will be issued. Again, this will deny the regime of hundreds of millions of dollars that it has been channelling from remittances to fund its illegal programs, also the power to stop and search vessels that are carrying cargo to and from North Korea will be greatly expanded. Australia continues to fully implement all sanctions, including those that were imposed on 5 August, and we will implement fully the latest sanctions. On this, the Coalition and Labor are in perfect accord. Bill Shorten: Later this month, I will travel with Senator Penny Wong to South Korea and Japan to discuss the security situation on the Korean Peninsula. All of us in this parliament should do do what we can in a united fashion to be able to contribute to greater world peace and dealing with the threat of North Korea. It’s only Tuesday, but it’s been a long week. Barnaby Joyce gets through a whole dixer answer without any bells ringing for a division. It’s a question time miracle (thanks to Speaker Smith who told Labor yesterday they had already tested their gag motion and failed, so he was putting a stop to it). It all falls to a common theme within the Labor Party – that is, they’ve given up on blue-collar workers and they’re now residing with the basket weavers. They’re the party of the basket weavers. They have given up. They managed to change their allegiances,just like the member for Maribyrnong – once upon a time he used to support South Melbourne. He believed in South Melbourne. He barracked for South Melbourne. He followed the Swans. Then all of a sudden, he decided it doesn’t work with South Melbourne anymore - he’s now with Collingwood! He can change his allegiances. He is a crazy leopard that can change his spots. He can change his spots! And now we find... manufacturing workers, they’ve given up on the manufacturing workers! We’ve got the member for Hunter – the member for Hunter, he’s a knight in Newcastle, but he’s a coward in Canberra! Jason Clare combines two of the government’s headaches – citizenship and energy – into one question to Malcolm Turnbull: On 24 January, Senator Canavan made a legal instrument which notified the government’s intention to pull the trigger on gas exports controls, even though he was already aware he might be an Italian citizen. The next day, Senator Canavan resigned from cabinet. Why did the government put the reservation of Australian gas for Australian households and businesses at risk of legal challenge when it was already fully aware there were problems with Senator Canavan? This is a simple one for the PM: The answer is the government did not do so. Nigel Scullion, representing the energy minister (Barnaby Joyce) in Senate question time, is being grilled about the gas export restriction mechanism. Labor is asking: why is the government claiming to have imposed export restrictions, when it hasn’t pulled the trigger yet? It’s part of the opposition’s ongoing attack on Joyce’s possible ineligibility to sit in parliament because of dual citizenship, since section 64 of the constitution could leave his ministerial decisions vulnerable to attack if the high court rules him out. Scullion responds that the government has “instituted a trigger” and now it’s just a matter of timing of when to pull it. He said the government has until 1 November to impose the restriction and there’s no disadvantage to waiting since the gas export controls won’t come into effect until 1 January. Scullion: “You’re just going to have to wait to open your presents. Take a chill pill about this.” It’s all in the delivery Shorten to Turnbull: “My question is to the prime minister: The government is now in its fifth year in office. In that time, seven coal-fired power stations have closed, removing over 4,000 megawatts of capacity. This is equivalent to nearly 6m households’ power, or more than enough energy to power every home inSydney, Melbourne and Brisbane. Why has the government done nothing to replace the energy which has been progressively switched off since 2013?” That just gives Malcolm Turnbull a chance to talk about his new favourite topic. It is my government that is set out to build the largest battery in the southern hemisphere, Snowy Hydro 2.0 – which will make renewables reliable. Now, I hear all the laughing and carry-on the other side. The leader of the opposition described Snowy Hydro 2.0 – the largest renewable project in the country’s history since Snowy 1, The largest single project since Snowy 1 – he described it as just a stunt for helicopter trips. There he is – the member for Isaacs calls out – ‘That’s right.’ That’s the vision you’ve got on the Labor party. Bob Katter sure knows how to engage the House Moving on, we are back to the dixers and Queensland’s Luke Howarth wants to know what Josh Frydenberg is doing on base-load power, and my personal favourite dixer disclaimer – does the minister know of any alternative approaches? Frydenberg is very aware of an alternative approach and once again prosecutes the government’s now well-worn argument for keeping Liddell open, before moving on to Labor’s desire to “close coal-fired powerstations”. His interaction with Joel Fitzgibbon in the parliamentary hallway this morning must still be smarting, as he takes the opportunity to dig up what Fitzgibbon said earlier this year in an op-ed to his local paper, the Newcastle Herald Listen carefully. This is what the member for Hunter says: ‘The coal industry remains strong. And it can continue to count on my energetic support’. Frydenberg looks like he wishes he had a microphone he could drop after that one, but here is a little context around what Fitzgibbon said. He does say the coal industry can count on his support, but caches the statement around the arguments for energy transition. Bob Katter has the independent question, and well, it takes us places. “Minister for the environment: Mission Beach, the jewel in the crown, jungle, waterfalls, 14km beach – Harold Holt’s refuge from Coal Victoria, home to actress Diane Cilento, wife of 007, acclaimed artist Tom Wilkshire – Australia lost its innocence when Helen Mirren lost her clothes...” He runs out of time before he can finish the question, which ends up being about a breakwater in north Queensland, but Josh Frydenberg after a little prodding from Speaker Smith, who asks that preambles not be “a series of unconnected sentences”, answers that it remains in the hands of the state government. Chris Bowen has a question for Scott Morrison recalling a treasured moment from earlier this year: The Australian Financial Review reports that at a private function at Wombat Hollow, the Treasurer said that the era of cheap, coal-fired power is coming to an end, and anyone claiming that it’s the sole solution to the nation’s energy was propagating a myth. Does the Treasurer stand by his Wombat Hollow declaration, or do his views change depending on whether or not he’s carrying his pet rock? The answer from Morrison is more of what we have heard from the government, attacking Labor’s record on energy. But he does give us a new name in the ideology wars. We’ve got Richo, [Graham Richardson] who’s described the Labor policies on energy as ‘an absolute farce.’ And they say, ‘Oh, Richo’ - well, you made him a life member the other day. He knows a lot more about the Labor party than this mob of neosocialists ever will! Labor tries again with its $1,000 figure, with Mark Butler picking up the mantle and taking it back to the prime minister: “Before coming to office, the Liberal party promised families they would be $550 a year better off because of lower power prices. But isn’t it actually the case that the average Sydney household is paying almost $1,000 more for their power bills every year since this Liberal government came to office?” Turnbull seems excited to continue his earlier attack against Joel Fitzgibbon and quickly deals with Butler’s question by saying the $550 figure was confirmed by the ACCC in a report to the minister dated July 2015. (Side note on that – that is not exactly right – here is the ABC Factcheck on where that figure came from.) Following on from yesterday’s strategy, the first dixer is also on energy, this time on how the government is working to maintain base-load power. It gives Turnbull a chance to prosecute his government’s “keep Liddell open” argument a little longer. He then takes a slight turn off the beaten track to tackle the “bullying” allegation Labor has levelled against the government in regards to AGL, by quoting from Joel Fitzgibbon’s interview on ABC radio this morning. Andy (Vesey) was bullied in taking this proposal to the board, he said, ‘of course when the prime minister stares you down’ – most people would regard that as a compliment, by the way – when the prime minister stares you down …” Turnbull runs out of time before we can work out where exactly the compliment was. Question time has begun – and Labor has been banned from suspending standing orders, at least in regards to Barnaby Joyce gag attempts. Let’s see if the opposition has another trick up its sleeve. First question is Shorten to Turnbull on – yup, energy: “This government is now in its fifth year in office. The state Liberal government in New South Wales has been in office that entire same time. Can the prime minister confirm that the average Sydney household is paying almost $1,000 more in power bills since this federal Liberal government was elected to office?” Turnbull recycles the government’s attack against Mark Butler and his “confession” that Labor should have quarantined some of the gas exports for the domestic market. It is nothing we haven’t heard before. In the Coalition party room on Tuesday, energy prices and the same-sex marriage postal survey were the main topics. The party room approved the postal survey additional safeguards bill and was given these extra details: The bill bans vilification, intimidation and threats to cause harm based on sex, sexuality, gender identity, intersex status, religious convictions or views people hold on the survey Penalties include fines of up to $12,600 and the power to seek an injunction in the federal court to prevent publications or acts that breach that law The attorney general will have a gatekeeper role, meaning he will have to give approval for suits claiming a penalty, and will have a right to be notified and appear in any case seeking an injunction The acting special minister of state, Mathias Cormann, suggested the attorney general, George Brandis, would approach that gatekeeper role “with a bias towards freedom of speech” The provisions only last during the period of the postal survey On energy prices, Malcolm Turnbull said AGL has a “vested interest” in a tight energy market, because a seller’s market means prices would increase. “Mr [Andy] Vesey has obligations to his shareholders to make AGL as profitable as he can, but our obligation is to our shareholders, who are the Australian people,” Turnbull said. The deputy prime minister, Barnaby Joyce, said AGL’s refusal to sell Liddell “shows that they are shorting the market” and the electricity provider would probably make more money from operating one power station rather than two. While we are on media reform, the Australian Conservatives senator Cory Bernardi is planning his own bit of mischief in the Senate this afternoon. He intends to amend the broadcasting bill to try and add the changes to the ABC being sought by One Nation during their protracted media reform negotiations with the government, and some similar changes sought by the Nationals senator Bridget McKenzie in a separate private member’s bill. The government came to terms with One Nation weeks ago, but the deal is basically meaningless, because there is not broad parliamentary support to amend the ABC’s charter or cut its funding (which is the One Nation ask). That would need to be done in separate legislation, and the numbers aren’t there. Bernardi’s actions, I suspect, are designed to flush out the hollowness of the deal One Nation has struck with the government. It will be interesting to see whether One Nation votes with Bernardi to try and implement its own deal, or whether it sticks with the deal being a deal in name only. As they say in the classics, only time will tell. Just before we buckle in for question time, let’s recap the morning. The Coalition is powering on with its energy agenda, but still doesn’t have all the answers. Labor has accused the government of attempting to ‘bully’ AGL into doing what it wants and keeping the aging Liddell power station open, while Greens MP Adam Bandt has accused Malcolm Turnbull of acting like a “petulant child” on the issue. Josh Frydenberg and Joel Fitzgibbon had a clash in the corridors over the energy issue, pumped up by the fact they were surrounded by cameras. Tony Abbott remains against a clean energy target. Labor and the Coalition have come to a consensus on the safeguard legislation for the marriage equality campaign. The government looks very close to striking a deal on its media reforms package Justice Minister Michael Keenan flagged new, tougher penalties for child abusers and internet providers who do not report abuse. Construction has begun in earnest on the fence around Parliament House. There are early reports the Turnbull government has secured its media reform package – but I think the truth is the Coalition is now close, but not quite there. If the government gets there today, and I reckon that’s more likely than not, it will have the numbers to scrap longstanding controls on media ownership, and trigger a range of consolidations in the Australian news landscape which are likely to lead to further market concentration. After weeks of negotiation, the Nick Xenophon Team has been offered quite limited concessions designed to enhance media diversity, particularly a new $30m innovation fund which will be made available to some independent publishers. After signalling publicly they would consider a broad range of diversity enhancing measures, like introducing a new tax break for smaller publishers to encourage them to employ more journalists – the government has recently backtracked, and taken tax breaks off the table. The NXT is yet to sign off on the government’s offer. That technical inconvenience notwithstanding, debate has kicked off in the Senate chamber. NXT senator Stirling Griff has just told the chamber the party is reserving its position “for now”. The core of the government’s reforms, which have been pursued since the first Coalition took office in 2013, will see the scrapping of the two out of three rule, which means media moguls will be able to own television, newspapers and radio stations in the same market. As well as scrapping the two out of three rule, the government’s package also includes scrapping the 75% reach rule, which prevents Nine Entertainment, Seven West Media and the Ten Network from owning their regional affiliates, due to restrictions on a TV network broadcasting to more than 75% of the population. More from the ‘things you never thought you would be discussing in Auspol’ files, Treasurer Scott Morrison compared himself to a power station when talking to Sunrise’s David Koch this morning. Kochie pointed out the Liddell power station, which is almost 50 years old, had broken down twice this summer, which was part of AGL’s argument it had reached the end of its lifespan. Morrison was having none of that, mostly because he is still working. They would say that. I’m older than it and is we are still doing alright. You are too.” The justice minister, Michael Keenan, has announced what he called the “strongest crackdown on pedophiles in a generation”. The new measures, include tougher fines for internet companies that don’t report abusive material, mandatory minimum sentences and stronger bail conditons. Current sentencing practices for commonwealth sex offenders often result in manifestly inadequate sentencing, which does not sufficiently recognise the harm that has been caused to the victims – in this case, children. Since 2012, only 58% of convicted commonwealth child sex offenders have spent time in prison. For those who did, the most common period of actual imprisonment was just six months. This represents a staggering and unacceptable number of offenders who are released into the community without them being monitored, posing an unacceptable risk to our children. The community expects that appropriate sentences will be handed down to the worst criminals and it’s up to all governments around the country to ensure that that is the case. Keenan plans on introducing the new legislation on Wednesday. While the fence goes up around Parliament House, soccer is still being played out the front. While the politicians spoke, the children of the families who have arrived in Canberra to lobby for the yes vote had a short game on the lawns. Still on energy policy and Labor’s Linda Burney took aim at Malcolm Turnbull’s renewed love of the Snowy hydro scheme, while speaking to Sky News. I mean it’s almost like an episode out of Utopia with the prime minister down you know clambering around Jindabyne and Tumut saying we’re going to have the Snowy Mountain come back. It is a feasibility study. I mean, please. This government is all over the place on energy. The Greens are feeling bolshie. They say they are tired of Peter Dutton telling voters how crucial his controversial citizenship bill is, while simultaneously withholding it from the Senate so it can’t be debated. They’re going to be moving a motion in the Senate tomorrow to strike the bill from the notice paper. If they’re successful, and the bill is struck from the notice paper, it will be a major embarrassment for the government. The government would have to move a motion to restore it to the notice paper if it wanted to put it back in the Senate, but if it found itself in that situation it may not have the numbers to do so anyway. The Greens will need Labor and the Nick Xenophon Team to support its plan, and it’s too early to say how they would vote. Both parties have told Guardian Australia they will need time to think about it and discuss it with their colleagues. But the Greens will be speaking to both parties over the next 24 hours. The government is still in negotiations with the crossbench about the bill, because Labor and the Greens have declared they won’t support it. The NXT last week also said they couldn’t support the package in its current form, which derailed Dutton’s attempt to enact tough new citizenship laws quickly. It means the government has been forced to consider either dumping its package or making substantial changes. NXT senator Stirling Griff has suggested the government could split its bill into two or more pieces of legislation. The fence is not exactly winning hearts and minds. Here is another look at the much maligned security fence currently under construction at Parliament House. Plans for the 2.6m fence were rushed through parliament just before the Christmas break last year. The reasons for the fence remain under lock and key, with the powers that be citing national security concerns. ‘Low visual impact’ Katharine Murphy has an update on the renewable energy target discussion – or lack of discussion, as the case may be. Despite energy dominating the political discussion, government folks tell me it didn’t get much of an airing in today’s Coalition party room meeting. But Tony Abbott had a view. As the government has been preparing its response to the Finkel review of the national electricity market, Abbott has been here there and everywhere saying a new clean energy target is not the way to go. The former prime minister intends to be a fly in the ointment as the government continues its deliberations. Today he told colleagues the government should not graft a new clean energy target on top of the existing renewable energy target. Abbott’s party room commentary was prompted by an observation from the foreign minister Julie Bishop that Australia needed “affordable” energy – that was the imperative, not renewable energy. Abbott agreed with that proposition, and said if affordable energy was the imperative, the government should not be putting a new clean energy target on top of a RET. Let’s call that a bit of front running. Christopher Knaus has an update on the welfare system reform the Turnbull government is attempting to get through the Senate. The bill contains the controversial measure to drug test 5,000 welfare recipients at three trial sites in NSW, Western Australia and Queensland. The votes of the Nick Xenophon bloc could prove crucial in the senate, but the party’s sole lower house MP, Rebekha Sharkie, on Monday voted against the legislation, which she earlier described as “devoid of logic”. Despite Sharkie’s strong criticism, NXT have confirmed they are still in negotiations with the government. “There are certain aspects of the bill the NXT senators - like Rebekha Sharkie - are yet to be convinced about - including the drug testing trials,” a NXT spokesman said. “However, they are still negotiating in good faith with the government on it.” Greens Senator Rachel Siewert praised Sharkie’s stand and called on her Senate colleagues to follow suit. Drug testing of income support recipients is poor policy grounded in ideology and has been overwhelmingly condemned by drug and alcohol experts, doctors and social service providers. We have come full circle on the energy debate, with Labor calling on the government to solve the issue by naming a clean energy target. It’s the Finkel review recommendation the government is yet to take up and Labor is now looking to wedge Malcolm Turnbull on the issue. Labor is also pushing the government on quarantining gas exports for domestic use. Jason Clare spoke a little earlier at a media conference with Mark Butler, which might give us a little hint of what fun and games await us during question time. We’ve got to make sure that businesses get access to the gas they needed. And that’s why we’re saying pull the trigger. Stop mucking around. Pull the trigger today, making sure that we’ve got access to more gas for generation purposes. It’s not good enough for Malcolm Turnbull just to criticise and harass Labor states. Labor Senator Penny Wong had a bit to say about those safeguards – and the need for them – during this morning’s caucus meeting This is a difficult time for our community. Already there are hateful things that are being said. There are hurtful things being said. They might be said politely but they are hurtful and inaccurate. About our families, about our children. This is a direct result of this flawed survey the government is imposing against the will of the parliament and the Australian people. This bill won’t protect against all of the hate speech we already see. It will provide some limited protection. But the real leadership has to come from the parliament and this government. They have to stand up and speak out against those who engage in hate speech. In the last few minutes, Paul Karp has been hitting the phones and has an update for you on those urgent safeguards for the marriage equality campaign: I’ve confirmed that the Coalition party room has approved a bill for ground rules for the postal survey, including anti-vilification provisions that will apply to both sides of the debate. Labor also discussed the negotiations with the government in its party room this morning but did not have a final version of the bill. A separate group including Bill Shorten, Tanya Plibersek, Penny Wong, Mark Dreyfus, Tony Burke and Terri Butler will have final sign-off on the Labor side. Earlier Labor accused the government of ‘bullying’ AGL – now the Greens have added their two cents, with Adam Bandt comparing Malcolm Turnbull to a child playing make-believe. AGL has treated Malcolm Turnbull like a toddler. When you’ve got a toddler who’s screaming on the floor insisting that they’re Batman you say, ‘yeah yeah, you’re Batman now come on let’s get out of the house and get on with what we’ve got to do anyway’. That’s how AGL has treated Malcolm Turnbull, like a petulant, petulant child. While we are on legislation, the government has listed five bills it would like dealt with today - keep in mind this is an evolving beast and can be switched around, amended or turned completely upside down, depending on how those backroom negotiations are going. Paul Karp has an update on where Labor stands in regards to legislation and policies currently before the parliament. Labor caucus met on Tuesday and discussed negotiations with the government for anti-vilification provisions. There are also reports the Coalition party room has given the bill the thumbs up, more on that soon. On Tuesday Guardian Australia reported the laws will be modelled on New South Wales laws that ban material that incites hatred, serious contempt or severe ridicule of protected groups. In Labor caucus the shadow attorney general, Mark Dreyfus, and equality spokeswoman, Terri Butler, confirmed vilification provisions will apply to both sides, and the law contains a mix of civil and criminal penalty provisions. Labor’s leader in the Senate, Penny Wong, said: This is a difficult time for our community. Already there are hateful ... and hurtful things being said. They might be said politely but they are hurtful and inaccurate [statements] about our families and children. This is a direct result of this flawed survey the government is imposing, against the will of the parliament and the Australian people. This bill won’t protect against all of the hate speech we already see. It will provide some limited protection but the real leadership has to come from the parliament and the government. They have to stand up and speak out against those who engage in hate speech. As I reported this morning, University of Queensland free speech expert Katharine Gelber said it was “very likely” crude epithets such as “stop the fags” would be found to be vilification, as would material “stereotyping almost an entire group as child abusers”. Coalition for Marriage ads linking same-sex marriage to gender education of children were “part and parcel of normal debate”, Gelber said. Even factually incorrect claims that marriage equality encouraged gender fluidity would not amount to vilification. Bill Shorten, Mark Dreyfus and Tanya Plibersek are holding a media conference with a special guest – Eddie Blewett, who stole question time back in September last year, when Plibersek told his story to Malcolm Turnbull. You can read more about Eddie and what happened last year, here. Eddie has travelled to Canberra with his two mums, Claire and Neroli, from Tathra in coastal NSW, to help promote the yes vote with Labor and other LGBTI families, who Shorten said “just want the same deal everyone else has”. Now 14, Eddie is frustrated that he’s back and having the same conversations. People who know my family, know that there is nothing wrong with us. We play soccer in the winter and we volunteer with the surf club in the summer. I have two parents. They love me and they love each other. All couples and all families deserve the same respect and value. Twelve months ago I came here. Nothing has changed, the marriage equality is still unresolved. I feel like people aren’t going to vote. I feel like they are going to throw their ballot papers in the bin. I also wanted to thank all those people who tried to keep this matter in parliament. People are saying stuff about my family. They are saying they are not normal. They are saying they are second rate. Don’t listen. Be yourself. Vote yes. It may not seem like it, but the parliament is dealing with more than just the government’s hunt for an energy policy this week. The media reform legislation, which was shunted off the agenda yesterday, should make a reappearance. Communications minister Mitch Fifield has been working behind the scenes trying to shore up a deal with the crossbench. Late yesterday, the Greens’ Sarah Hanson-Young said she didn’t believe they were quite there yet – there being support for the dumping of the 2/3 and 75% reach media ownership rules in exchange for better support for smaller media companies – but there was movement. Still on the Greens and leader Richard Di Natale plans to introduce a private senator’s bill which aims to “secure terminally ill patient access to medicinal cannabis”. Melissa Davey explained the context in this morning’s story. Di Natale says: Our disallowance motion that was supported by the Senate on the 13 June was very, very clear. If somebody has a terminal illness, they should be able to get access to imported medicinal cannabis under Category A of the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) Special Access Scheme (SAS). This made it illegal to prevent medicinal cannabis importation via category A of the SAS. Yet, just three days later the government wrote to importers, telling them that despite the law, they would be blocked from importing medicinal cannabis under category A. It is simple cruelty from this government. These patients are dying and their doctors believe medicinal cannabis may alleviate their suffering. The Greens will keep fighting to ensure the government can’t continue to draw out the suffering of terminally ill patients. For it to have any hope of surviving, it will need the support of either Labor or the government. The back and forth between the Coalition and Labor has heated up in recent months but it is having an impact. The latest Guardian Essential poll shows that while Labor is still well ahead with voters, Malcolm Turnbull has staged a small comeback over the last month. How long that lasts is anyone’s guess – a day is an absolute eternity in politics these days. But the polls shows Labor ahead 54% to 47% on the two-party preferred measure. Last week, it was 53% to 47%. Echoing the Fairfax Ipos poll, Turnbull is still seen as the better performer, despite Labor’s stronger showing. Katharine Murphy reports: Voters in the Guardian Essential sample have a higher regard for Malcolm Turnbull than they did a month ago, with 41% of the sample saying they approved of the prime minister’s performance (up from 38% in August). Disapproval remained steady on 46%. The September result gives the prime minister a change in his net approval rating from -8 to -5, which is Turnbull’s best net rating since October last year. Approval of the Labor leader, Bill Shorten, was up one point from August, on 36%, but the Labor leader’s disapproval rating was up five points to 47% (42% in August). That result represents a change in Shorten’s net approval rating from -7 to -11. Turnbull also retains a clear lead over Shorten as preferred prime minister, with 43% preferring him compared with 29% for Shorten. In August, the measure was Turnbull 41% to Shorten 27%. The results were split by party, with 79% of Coalition voters saying Turnbull would be a better prime minister and 62% of Labor voters saying Shorten would. Greens voters preferred Shorten (42%) to Turnbull (25%). Men prefer Turnbull to Shorten (47% to 30%), as do women (39% to 28%). The prime minister’s recent “FM assault” has not gone unnoticed by the hosts of that band’s breakfast shows. While chatting to Bill Shorten, Melbourne Nova 100 hosts made a point of mentioning Malcolm Turnbull’s recent availability to the FM band: “We have noticed, all of a sudden Malcolm Turnbull is doing FM, which is your stomping ground ... He is on your turf. You were first, he was clearly not interested in anything on the FM dial.” Turnbull has done more FM radio appearances in the past six weeks than almost the last five months combined, while maintaining his “more serious” regular media commitments with talkback radio and the ABC. Looking ahead to some of what this day will bring, debate wise, Paul Karp has this update. With the government’s higher education bill coming up for debate in the lower house, Universities Australia is lobbying the crossbench to oppose the $2.8bn in cuts. The bill would impose a two-year 2.5% efficiency dividend on universities, lower the Help debt repayment threshold to $42,000 and increase fees by a cumulative total of 7.5% by 2021. The Nick Xenophon Team’s education spokeswoman, Rebekha Sharkie, told Guardian Australia she “can’t support the bill at this stage”, although talks with the government are continuing. I don’t see the bill, as it is, as a reform of higher education. Really, it’s just a budget savings measure. I’m worried this will deeply hurt regional universities. The bill looks at universities as if they are homogenous entities but regional universities have a different experience. Sharkie said South Australia’s three universities could lose up to 750 jobs as a result of cuts. Sharkie said the government should consider a wider review, including looking at the demand-driven system. She suggested students may be opting for university as a fallback because they’re told their job of the future “hasn’t been invented yet” despite Australia having a shortage of apprentices. Before the political battle royale begins in earnest for the day, let’s take a look of some of what the prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, said at the R U OK event this morning. I am firmly of the view that our reluctance to talk about mental health issues, whether you call it a stigma or call it a taboo, has been a very real barrier to addressing this issue. You can’t deal with a problem that you can’t acknowledge. The PM’s comments come just a day after his benched resources minister, Matt Canavan, said anyone worried about the campaign around the marriage equality survey should “grow a spine” and “stop being delicate little flowers”. In the latest edition of “things you never thought you’d be discussing in Auspol”, the Liberal MP Tim Wilson has spent the morning defending a colouring-in book of his local community. Wilson funded it through his parliamentary communications budget, Joe Kelly from the Australian reports, and it is due to be dropped off around schools. But along with the cartoons, one of which is Wilson walking his pugs with his partner, Ryan, the book includes Liberal party branding, which may be against the Victorian education department’s policy. But its the cartoon of Wilson and his partner which has captured attention. The Goldstein MP has taken to social media to showcase the other images in the book. Party room meetings have begun, so we’ll have a little bit of a lull to catch up on the morning’s events. The government is really hoping “Blackout Bill”, it’s newest nickname for Bill Shorten, will catch on. Brownout Butler is another moniker the government is pushing, with both being salted across question time and press conferences. But they managed to put at least some of that aside for a short time this morning at the R U OK event, where Malcolm Turnbull gave a speech about the importance of mental health and reaching out to your mates. We’ll get some of that to you in a little bit but it had an impact on Shorten. It’s a galling thing when you are leader of the opposition and the prime minister yells slogans at you one day and you think ‘Oh, why did he do that?’ But then occasionally he gives a speech like that and I think, ‘You’re not too bad, are you?’ Mind you, by question time that thought will be erased. The opposition leader, Bill Shorten, has also been out and about. He was at the same R U OK event as Malcolm Turnbull and has been spoken to no less than six FM radio breakfast shows this morning, where it was all about energy prices, marriage equality and, as is par for the course these days, Game of Thrones. For the record, he told Mix102.3, Shorten believes he would be Jon Snow and Turnbull would be the King of the White Walkers. Why Snow? “He’s true to himself,” Shorten said with a laugh. That awkward feeling when the person you have been speaking about is right behind you ... The prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, has started his day at a R U OK Day event at parliament but at the press conference that followed it was all about – you guessed it – Liddell. I think the approach we are taking is common sense, it is practical, it is business-like. This is not a question of ideology, the way that Labor is going on. It just reminds you of the idiocy that they continue to bring to energy policy. There is no clearly set out plan to replace Liddell. Now you can either, if you are Labor, if you are with Bill Shorten, with old Blackout Bill himself, he says that is an issue for down the track. Well I am sorry, that is how we ended up with the problem with Hazelwood, with the very late notice of closure. We know they say they want to close it in 2022. It is five years away, that is not a very long time in fact in terms of putting in place new infrastructure. So we need to get the options on the table right now and the most obvious option is to keep it running. Labor has accused Malcolm Turnbull of bullying the boss of electricity company AGL into agreeing to consider extending the life of its ageing Liddell coal-fired power station for another five years. The Labor MP Joel Fitzgibbon says AGL’s chief executive, Andy Vesey, has had a well-publicised plan to close the ageing Liddell power station by 2022 and transition to cleaner forms of energy. He says Turnbull’s request – made during a meeting in Canberra on Monday – that Vesey take a proposal to his board to either sell the Liddell plant, or keep it open for another five years, would not be taken seriously by AGL. “I think Andy Vesey was bullied into taking the proposal to his board and I believe his board will say, ‘No, why are we doing this?’,” Fitzgibbon said on Tuesday. “Of course when the prime minister stares you down and says, ‘Won’t you at least take this back to your board?’, of course you say yes. “But I think we all know what the result will be.” Heading back to Canberra – and the corridors of power are getting a little heated over the energy debate. Josh Frydenberg and Labor’s Joel Fitzgibbon crossed paths – and words – in the press gallery hallway and had a little chat about the Liddell power station. Fingers were pointed and smiles were forced. You can see the encounter below. The ABC has broadcast some of the comments from that UN Security Council meeting – here is what Nikki Haley, the US ambassador to the UN, had to say: Today we are attempting to take the future of the North Korean nuclear program out of the hands of its outlaw regime. We are done trying to prod the regime to do the right thing. We are now acting to stop it from having the ability to continue doing the wrong thing. We are doing that by stopping its ability to fuel and fund its weapons program. Oil is the lifeblood of North Korea’s effort to build a nuclear weapon. Today’s resolution reduces almost 30% of oil provided to North Korea by cutting off over 55% of its gas, diesel and heavy fuel oil. Further, today’s resolution completely bans natural gas and other oil by products that could be used as substitutes for the reduced petroleum. This will cut deep. North Korea hasn’t been shy in responding to these sanctions. We await its reply. Stepping out of domestic politics for a moment, the prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, has spoken to his South Korean counterpart, Moon Jae-in, to reiterate Australia’s support of its ally, as the threat of North Korea’s nuclear program continues to grow. Guardian Australia’s political editor, Katharine Murphy, reports the two leaders spoke by phone overnight, ahead of the United Nations Security Council meeting, where new sanctions on North Korea were being negotiated. Australia has already supported what the foreign affairs minister, Julie Bishop, has called the “toughest ever” sanctions on the rogue regime, with Turnbull also previously calling on China to do more. The Security Council did not go as far as cutting off North Korea’s fuel supply but it did vote to limit refined petroleum products to 2 million barrels a year, and ban textile exports, on top of the previous sanctions, which banned North Korea’s resources exports. The United States managed to convince China and Russia, who hold veto power on the council, to agree to the latest sanctions, which were agreed to unanimously. Speaking before that meeting, Turnbull and Moon agreed that China and Russia were critical to ensuring the sanctions were agreed and enforced – read more on that, and a little on how we got to this point, here. The marriage equality postal survey forms will begin popping up in letter boxes soon, with the mail out due to begin today. The ABS has kept the form simple – it’s a mark the box system, which should stop any arguments over whether a tick is a cross or just a squiggle. Michael Koziol has reported on a Fairfax Ipos poll, which found of the 65% of respondents who were certain to take part in the survey, 70% planned on voting “yes”. It’s the first time Australians are being asked to vote this way, as well as being told it’s voluntary. In a country with compulsory voting, there will be a lot of eyes watching how many people get out and have their say when there is no fine forcing them to. Good morning and welcome to Tuesday. We start the morning much as we have for the past few weeks – with the government consumed by energy policy but hampered by outside factors. The energy minister, Josh Frydenberg, and the treasurer, Scott Morrison, have been out and about making the hard sell this morning, with both attempting to claim Malcolm Turnbull’s meeting with AGL boss Andy Vesey over the future of the ageing Liddell power station was a major step forward. In reality, Vesey committed only to taking a proposal to keep Liddell open for another five years beyond its slated 2022 closing date, or to consider selling it to an investor who will. Following the meeting late on Monday afternoon, Vesey released a statement tempering the government’s enthusiasm, which, as Katharine Murphy reported, made it clear the company was inclined to stick with a previously telegraphed plan to develop gas peaking plant, pumped hydro and batteries, as well as a demand response, to deal with the shortfall in NSW once the plant closes. But that hasn’t stopped Morrison and Frydenberg blanketing the morning radio and TV breakfast shows with their plan – which includes Liddell staying open. Frydenberg told ABC there was “no other option on the table”. The key point here is that we have a report from the Australian Energy Market Operator, which indicates that were Liddell to close in 2022, as scheduled, there would be a supply shortfall of 1,000 megawatts in the market. So our first responsibility is to help stabilise the system and ensure affordable power. There’s no other option on the table, although AGL does want to work out and work up other options, but the current option on the table is to keep Liddell open or to sell it to another party as Andy Vesey has indicated previously. Voters want the government to step in and regulate power prices, as well as invest in more renewable power sources, according to the latest Guardian Essential poll. So don’t expect this issue to go away any time soon. But before we kick off – a little bit of housekeeping. It is my first day flying solo, so be gentle – but please comment away. The thread is open for business but you can also talk to the man behind the lens, Mike Bowers, at @mpbowers or myself @amyremeikis on the twitters. I’ll do my best to talk back but I’m still wrapping my head around the blog, so I may be a little slow. I’ll do my best to put as many of Magic Mike’s pics on here as possible but if you want more – and let’s be honest, you always do – check out his Instagram here ."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2017/sep/07/afl-boss-says-game-leader-in-the-country-on-racism-after-heritier-lumumba-criticism","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-07T03:25:06Z","webTitle":"AFL boss says game is 'leader' on combatting racism after Heritier Lumumba criticism","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/sep/07/afl-boss-says-game-leader-in-the-country-on-racism-after-heritier-lumumba-criticism","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/sep/07/afl-boss-says-game-leader-in-the-country-on-racism-after-heritier-lumumba-criticism","fields":{"headline":"AFL boss says game is 'leader' on combatting racism after Heritier Lumumba criticism","bodyText":"The AFL has defended its record after former player Heritier Lumumba said the league was “incompetent” at dealing with racism in the game, with the chief executive, Gillon McLachlan, claiming it is “a leader in the country” on the issue. McLachlan spoke out after Guardian Australia published an interview with the former Collingwood and Melbourne player in which he said the AFL had failed to effectively address what he perceived was institutional racism. McLachlan – who is yet to speak with Lumumba following Sunday’s airing of a documentary in which the former player opened up about his experiences during his playing career – said the AFL has been “pretty strong” on the issue in the past. “Our industry has been a leader in the country on racism,” McLachlan said in Sydney on Wednesday. “It doesn’t mean we get everything right. We’re a work in progress. We listen and learn. “I’ve got [Torres Strait Islander and social activist] Tanya Hosch on my management team, who I take a lot of advice from. We’re all on a journey to do the best we can, but I think our history is pretty strong.” Hosch, the AFL’s general manager of inclusion and social policy, briefly met Lumumba last week on the set of the Marngrook Footy Show, but Lumumba maintains he was “ambushed” at SBS’s studios in Melbourne and that the meeting lasted just two or three minutes. There has been no further contact between Lumumba and AFL officials since. Lumumba told New Matilda on Thursday there was a follow-up email asking for a further meeting, but he declined to respond because he believed the AFL was trying to deflect attention from the issue of racism to his mental health. McLachlan had said on Fox Footy on Monday: “With respect to Collingwood – I know Tania has met with Heritier – this issue is really about where he’s at, and his state of mind and his welfare. We’ll do what we can and what’s appropriate. We’re so much better but we’re not where we need to be.” When McLachlan was asked on Wednesday if he himself would contact Lumumba, he replied: “Tanya has already met with Heritier.” In the documentary Fair Game, aired by SBS on Sunday, Lumumba revealed he was nicknamed “Chimp” during his time with the Magpies, which he described as “a boys’ club for racist and sexist jokes”. The coach, Nathan Buckley, also came in for criticism, with Lumumba accusing him of lacking “emotional intelligence”. Lumumba told the Guardian the AFL – not just the clubs – had historically failed to competently deal with systemic racism. “This issue should have been eradicated from the game, but even when we had the situation with [Sydney Swans player] Adam Goodes [who ended his career in 2015 after enduring serial racist booing] the AFL didn’t know how to address it effectively,” Lumumba said. “Their response to my concerns further speaks to a culture of incompetence.” Several former Collingwood team-mates, including Leon Davis and Andrew Krakouer, have lent their support to Lumumba, while Buckley’s predecessor, Mick Malthouse, said he was “very proud of the way he’s conducted himself”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/live/2017/sep/07/bangladesh-v-australia-second-test-day-four-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-07T11:07:53Z","webTitle":"Australia beat Bangladesh on day four of second Test – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2017/sep/07/bangladesh-v-australia-second-test-day-four-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/live/2017/sep/07/bangladesh-v-australia-second-test-day-four-live","fields":{"headline":"Australia beat Bangladesh on day four of second Test – as it happened","bodyText":"Australia rescued their tour of Bangladesh with an inspired performance on day four of the second Test, turning a match in the balance into an emphatic victory. Nathan Lyon was once again the hero, ripping the heart out of the home side’s second innings to enable his own top order to knock off the paltry target in quick time. The Test-best performance of Australia’s premier off-spinner dominates every aspect of how this match will be assessed. His wickets in the first innings kept Australia in the game, those in the second positioned his country for victory. A Wisden’s worth of milestones were passed along the way. The drawn series feels a fair result with Bangladesh proving that at home at least they belong at the top table of international cricket. Hopefully this year’s successes against England and now Australia will convince the ICC they deserve more recognition for their performances. This series, for example, would be beautifully poised heading into a deciding third Test. Thank you for your company. On behalf of all the OBO crew it’s been a joy getting to cover this series. Adam Collins will be filing more from Chittagong I expect, so keep your eyes peeled for that, otherwise, it’s over and out. 16th over: Australia 87-3 (Handscomb 16, Maxwell 25) Target: 86 Nasir Hossain has a twirl but it’s meat and drink for Maxwell who cuts hard to the point fence. Sensing one hit can win it, Maxwell tees off and smashes the ball over long on to win the Test for Australia! 15th over: Australia 77-3 (Handscomb 16, Maxwell 15) Target: 86 More gorgeous footwork from Handscomb, again staying leg-side of the ball and hitting crisply through the covers. Maxwell unfurls another reverse sweep, which now has its own dedicated boundary sweeper protecting it. Only now an over or two away from a drawn series. 14th over: Australia 69-3 (Handscomb 11, Maxwell 12) Target: 86 A case of when, rather than if, now for Australia with the Victorian pair at the crease looking to score from every delivery. A wristy sweep from Maxwell is the pick of the shots, earning four well in front of square. He has massive forearms, Maxwell, reminiscent of Ricky Ponting, making shots like those seem out of perspective, almost cartoonish. 13th over: Australia 63-3 (Handscomb 10, Maxwell 7) Target: 86 Lovely footwork from Handscomb on display this Shakib over, firstly engineering space to hit to the on-side, then getting leg-side of the ball to hit to the cover boundary. The bowler thinks he’s extracted his revenge with the final delivery of the over, sending an LBW appeal upstairs but it’s all bat, no pad. 12th over: Australia 55-3 (Handscomb 3, Maxwell 6) Target: 86 MAXY! The Victorian strides to the crease in a baggy green, sniffs a couple of deliveries then launches Taijul for a massive straight six. He backs that up with a reverse sweep, but straight to the gully fielder. We’re not coming back tomorrow. 11th over: Australia 48-3 (Handscomb 2, Maxwell 0) Target: 86 Moments before that dismissal Renshaw was engaged in debate with short leg, did that make him lose concentration? Anyway, Maxwell the new man at the crease, and still a little bit of work to do for Australia. Oooh, is it game on again? Renshaw absent-mindedly plays at one outside off from Shakib he needn’t and tickles it into the gloves of the faultless Mushfiqur. Sloppy dismissal, and one that could just send a few pulses racing in the Australian dressing room. 10th over: Australia 48-2 (Renshaw 22, Handscomb 2) Target: 86 Smith will be disappointed with his dismissal, and his return from a below-par series with the bat for him. In his absence Handscomb settles into his groove, rotating the strike nicely with Renshaw. Smith, caught behind, bowled drinks. The break does for the skipper, bottom edging Taijul’s first delivery into the safe gloves of the keeper. A nothing delivery, kept a little low, but Smith couldn’t cash in. Bangladesh still fighting. 9th over: Australia 44-1 (Renshaw 20, Smith 16) Target: 86 Renshaw and Smith continue to keep the scoreboard ticking over despite Mustafizur’s exertions. A result tonight now seems more likely than not, especially with the option of the extra half-hour. 8th over: Australia 39-1 (Renshaw 17, Smith 14) Target: 86 Taijul replaces Shakib and Smith wastes no time sashaying down the track and whacking the ball over the bowler’s head for four. He backs that up with four more through the covers, leaning forward, reaching and wristing it with incredible timing. As Mrs Merton put it, let’s have a heated debate! Ian Gould is getting ticked off with Bangladesh for their attempts to scuff the ball up by throwing it into the turf at every opportunity. Coming after the vision of Shakib Al Hasan doing something a little dubious yesterday, how do we all feel about this kind of behaviour? Personally - I don’t see anything wrong with it. It’s their ball, why should it matter what they do with it? 7th over: Australia 30-1 (Renshaw 17, Smith 5) Target: 86 Mustafizur still charging in, emboldened by Warner’s wicket, but Renshaw is resolute, offering a straight defensive bat whenever required and leaving often. Meanwhile, at Lord’s, West Indies are batting and England are dropping, again. 6th over: Australia 29-1 (Renshaw 17, Smith 4) Target: 86 Smith can obviously score rapidly but Warner’s dismissal increases the likelihood of play extending into a fifth day. Or maybe not. Renshaw channeling the spirit of his departed opening partner and lofting Shakib over long-on for four and then a six. Both times using nimble footwork (for a big lad) and hitting safely with the spin with a minimum of fuss. Lovely clean hitting; head staying down with the strokes, not over-hitting. A late cut two completes a very good over for Australia. 5th over: Australia 17-1 (Renshaw 5, Smith 4) Target: 86 Warner was going after everything Mustafizur threw at him and looked set for a rapid 50 until a short delivery got big on him and forced him to pull a delivery much closer to his grille than he would have liked. Smith off the mark with a trademark glide to the third-man boundary. 5th over: Australia 13-1 (Renshaw 5, Smith 0) Target: 86 That spices things up a bit. Cramped by a short delivery Warner’s attempted pull flies straight into the hands of deep square leg. 4th over: Australia 11-0 (Renshaw 4, Warner 7) Target: 86 Warner’s not given up hope of a day off. The first delivery of Shakib’s over is slapped to cow corner with one of those effortless free swings of the bat, like the reaper bringing down his scythe. Such fast hands. Renshaw’s playing a very different game and is beaten on the crease from the last ball of the over, a shot met with whelps of anguish in the field. 3rd over: Australia 6-0 (Renshaw 4, Warner 2) Target: 86 Renshaw off the mark with a four glanced to fine-leg. Mustafizur not making much happen out there. His stock ball is a tad short and his bouncer has been unthreatening. The odd full delivery has kept low, like the one Renshaw scored from, which was out if he’d failed to get any willow on it. Richard McKeary asks: Is there a decent crowd at the ground? It’s hard to tell from the pictures on the OBO, but it seems like there are more souls than normal for a Bangladesh home test. Could this be their Ashes 2005 moment? Adam reports from the ground that it isn’t packed but it is a work day and those that are in are very enthusiastic. ODIs are where it’s at for big crowds here, apparently. 2nd over: Australia 2-0 (Renshaw 0, Warner 2) Target: 86 So, what will David Warner do, will he want to end this tonight if he can? Of course. Second ball of Shakib Al Hasan’s over he’s down the pitch and lofting the ball over the bowler’s head. Looks like he under-clubbed though, the pitching wedge holding in the outfield and not reaching the fence. 1st over: Australia 0-0 (Renshaw 0, Warner 0) Target: 86 Mustafizur with the new ball for Bangladesh and he beats Renshaw’s outside edge first up. Five further dot balls follow that one and Australia’s chase begins with a maiden. Bangladesh not setting the most adventurous fields, despite needing to make early breakthroughs with the new ball. 20 overs in total are scheduled for tonight - plus that extra half hour if a result is nearby. John Jones has emailed in a question: Big thanks to you Sam and Adam for the live blog. Almost as good as being there, but a lot cooler. Is Cummins as menacing as it seems? If so, what type of threat will he pose on the faster Aussie tracks come Ashes time? John, he’s not a menacing presence, a la Patrick Patterson or Andre Nel, but he is quick, and smoothly quick, in a way that seems to catch batsmen off guard. What should make England nervous is Cummins will be one of three or maybe even four quicks in Australia’s Ashes attack. Over the course of the Ashes it would be nice to see all of Hazlewood, Starc, Cummins and Pattinson unleashed at different times. That pace quartet have suffered so long with injuries but have the potential to usher in a new era in aggressive fast bowling. Brisbane and Perth will be lively, the other three tracks not so much, if recent history is anything to go by, but even those will be more hostile than we’ve seen in Chittagong and Cummins has still managed to put batsmen under pressure. In case any Australian fans were nervous: So, 86 for Australia to chase and probably just about enough time to do it tonight, if they put their minds to it. Lyon finishes with 6-60. You heard it here first folks, Adam Collins was all over Mustafizur’s capabilities with the willow and it takes only two O’Keefe deliveries to disrupt the pegs. A routine left-arm orthodox delivery is played down the wrong line and Bangladesh are all out 157. 71st over: Bangladesh 157-9 (Mehedi 14, Mustafizur 0) Lyon keeps Mehedi honest for a maiden, which puts the, ahem, not especially prolific Mustafizur on strike for the start of the 72nd over. 70th over: Bangladesh 156-9 (Mehedi 13, Mustafizur 0) Mehedi continues to remain watchful against O’Keefe but milks the strike with a lap sweep from the final delivery. Bangladesh lead by 85. A selection of some more records for Nathan Lyon: 9th player in history to take six-wickets in three consecutive innings 2nd Aussie after Clarrie Grimmett 1st Aussie to take 13 wickets in Asia I’m sure there’s more, but that’ll do for now. 69th over: Bangladesh 156-9 (Mehedi 13, Mustafizur 0) Ok, so I was probably selling the GOAT a little short with my wicket description, that was a genuine quicker ball that deceived Taijul. 99kph as compared to an average in the high 80s early 90s. A bit happening this Lyon over for a change. An inside edge onto pad first up is followed by the first delivery that’s misbehaved in a long time with a regulation offie exploding off a length. That clearly gets into Taijul’s head as a routine Lyon delivery beats his defensive prod and splays the stumps. More joy for Lyon and one step closer to victory for Australia. 68th over: Bangladesh 156-8 (Mehedi 13, Taijul 4) Back to the rapid maiden action but this O’Keefe over contains a false shot from Mehedi, driving on the up just past short cover with the ball squirting off a leading edge. 67th over: Bangladesh 156-8 (Mehedi 13, Taijul 4) Steve Smith’s had enough of this moribund session and decides to bring every fielder within the batsman’s earshot, including a few right under his nose. Plenty of ‘chat’ going on too; ‘banter’ I think it’s called nowadays, especially when it’s inappropriate and nobody wants to take responsibility. All the extra catchers leaves a skerrick of space for Taijul to score the session’s first runs, behind square on the leg side. 66th over: Bangladesh 154-8 (Mehedi 13, Taijul 2) Hmmm, apologies for the brevity, but more of the same from O’Keefe and Mehedi, only at a faster rate. 65th over: Bangladesh 154-8 (Mehedi 13, Taijul 2) Lyon to continue his incredible series with the second over after tea. He’s bowling around the wicket to the left-handed Taijul. As with the previous over, very little to describe in a routine maiden. 64th over: Bangladesh 154-8 (Mehedi 13, Taijul 2) Steve O’Keefe to open the bowling after Tea, around the wicket to Mehedi Hasan. Both batsman and bowler seem pretty happy to share a nondescript maiden on what remains a decent surface, especially for the fourth day of a Test match. Evening all. As Adam mentioned, 31 overs or two hours of play remaining in the day. You’d think if Bangladesh bat for another half hour or so we’ll be guaranteed to return tomorrow but a couple of quick wickets and this could be all over tonight. Australia will certainly prefer that scenario and not have to run the gauntlet of the monsoonal thunderstorms that have skirted around Chittagong all week. The day so far - as most of the days have this series - has belong to Nathan Lyon. It’s been another incredible effort that’s seen further records tumble in a tour that has elevated his standing in the game. 63rd over: Bangladesh 154-8 (Mehedi 13, Taijul 2) Taijul off the mark, getting out the way of Cummins but getting enough bat on it to bunt a couple through point. He’s forced to negoitiate the usual bouncer/yorker combination to get through to tea, but does it well. ... So, the home side go to the break having scrapped their way to a lead of 82. Better than they may have hoped for after the early collapse, but short of where it’ll need to be if they can seriously threaten to make a play for this series in the fourth innings later today and tomorrow. Three wickets in the session; Lyon two of those. That makes five for the innings, 12 for the match and overtakes Bedi on the all-time list, It also tops Ashwin/Jadeja for 2017 wicket-takers, with 45 now to his name. Cop that. As for Cummins, his return brought an immediate reward, the wicket of captain Mushfiqur just when he was getting dangerous. The Australian quick just too threatening. It felt that way too when he hit Mehedi’s helmet soon after arriving at the crease, but he’s still there punching on. That’s the state of play. I’m handing over to JP Howcroft, who will see you through to stumps. Or maybe even a result. It’ll be a session of 31 overs, so there remains ample time. Thanks for your company. Let’s do it again soon. Bye! 62nd over: Bangladesh 152-8 (Mehedi 13, Taijul 0) Lyon into what will probably be his last over before the interval. Mehedi edges the first. But with soft hands, it evades danger. Couple taken. He does well getting forward to the off-spinner, who has 12-for-152 in the match to date. You can hear Steve O’Keefe in the mic, who is really giving it the big ones encouraging his spin in twin. Good stuff. He’ll now get a breather before going at it again following the tea break, Cummins to take the final over. 61st over: Bangladesh 150-8 (Mehedi 11, Taijul 0) “Uh ohhhhh!” Matt Wade says in earshot of the stump mic when Taijul gets up the business end. I suspect that’s an effort to remind the new man that Cummins is going hurt him. He doesn’t. Under the bouncer. A bit skittish, but sufficient. Keeps the full one out when it arrives. Not the prettiest, but it’ll also do. 60th over: Bangladesh 149-8 (Mehedi 11, Taijul 0) Taijul just does the best he can. Playing inside the line, no issue there. Another left-hander, so Lyon will fancy his chances here. But he gets through it. They lead by 77. Ten minutes until the tea break is due. If they get another before then, the session will almost certainly extend by half an hour. They have the breakthrough! And it is the last recognised batsman Mominul, a big top edge from a sweep. Pat Cummins, racing around in the deep, makes an athletic diving catch. What a player that man is. Lyon has five! His third bag of that or more on the trot. He has more wickets than anyone in the planet in 2017. It is the second time has has 12 in a match, but this will end up his best career figures by some margin. Still two wickets on the shelf for him. It’s all coming up Nathan. 59th over: Bangladesh 149-7 (Mominul 29, Mehedi 10) Cummins gets his bouncer to Mehedi in first up. He’s ready for it, getting underneath. Good batting. Then a single with soft hands, taking him to double figures. Runs he has really earned. The crowd are involved again, doubling in numbers - if not tripling - through the course of this session. Two men out for the hook when Mominul fronts up, but he takes on the hook anyway, albeit the more controlled version of that stroke, straight to ground for one to keep the strike. “If, and it’s a fairly big if, Bangladesh manage to get a lead of 140-150 it will be interesting to see whether the Australian top order will be able to curtail there aggressive default setting and bat slowly,” Phil Withall muses. “The desire to win in style and send a retort to certain parts of the Australian media may be a little bit tempting. I think that, although the visitors have the edge, there is still uncertainty in this match and I love it.” Me too. With rain in the mix as well, all four results still possible with four sessions to go. Can’t complain about that. But Australia winning by stumps tonight probably still the most likely. Yeah? My colleague from The Australian, Andrew Faulkner, has gone up to the roof. He doesn’t think there is much cloud about despite the sun being well hidden. Maybe the rain will miss us after all? Quarter hour to tea. 58th over: Bangladesh 147-7 (Mominul 28, Mehedi 9) Right. Nathan Lyon again, 25 minutes to tea. Rain surely not far. Just has that feel about it. He still has them coming out nicely more often than not, but his 27th over here and it shows when he drags one short, pulled by Mominul for a couple. Brendon Julian on TV suggesting that Smith gives the no. 1 tweaker a rest to get him back fresh after the break, and I tend to agree. Lead now 75. These two have put on a nagging 18 of those. 57th over: Bangladesh 145-7 (Mominul 26, Mehedi 9) Good from Mominul early in the over, getting inside the line and pulling Cummins to midwicket. Mehedi’s turn. Bounced straight away! He’s a nice man, young Pat, but he was always going to spit some short stuff at him. Ooh, another too. Past the edge. Not quite unplayable, but in that family. When the full one inevitbly comes, the young man is up to it, smashing Cummins down the ground. That’s the way. Made of tough stuff. Has a massive future. 56th over: Bangladesh 140-7 (Mominul 25, Mehedi 5) Four singles. A sign that they know if the board is going to keep ticking, it has to be against the spin while Cummins is in the attack trying to hurt them ball after ball. A couple of competent sweep shots. Mehedi happy to get forward and defend - thus, not have to face next up - at the end of the over. Lead is 68. 55th over: Bangladesh 136-7 (Mominul 23, Mehedi 3) It’s short on the resumption, but Mehedi plays it nicely down behind square and off strike. Good cricket from the teenager. Gutsy stuff. Mominul does the rest. Ooooh. We have a long delay. Fast and nasty. Cummins has smashed Mehedi in the grill. It’s whacked so hard that the back of his helmet, the protective flap at the back, has flown off. Watching the replay, it has smashed into his thumb on the way through as well. In turn, the physio is out there with the doctor giving him a good examination. “Thank goodness for helmets” the take of Brian Murgatroyd on the telly. Not wrong. It’s the thumb on his bowling hand. Doesn’t look like he is going to retire hurt, but going to take his time before fronting up again. While we have this pause, I’m fairly sure having spent a fortnight in this country now that it is going to rain soon. This is the cloud we get just before it chucks down. Sorry about that. 54th over: Bangladesh 132-7 (Mominul 22, Mehedi 0) Another change of ends for Lyon. And straight past Mominul’s edge! He’s had more turn from here, and turned this square. And pretty much does it again. Lyon overtook another champion of the game, Bishan Bedi, with his fourth wicket (his 267th). Can still draw level with Herath on 23 if he cleans up the whole tail. Mominul ensures that won’t happen this over, crunching a cut to the boundary. An edge follows! Maxwell deflects off his back at gully from a push off the back foot spitting off the blade, but it doesn’t go to hand. He is bowling that well, Lyon. This could all happen very quickly. 53rd over: Bangladesh 129-7 (Mominul 19, Mehedi 0) Cummins comes down at such a pace that it makes otherwise astute batsmen do things they would never consider otherwise. He needn’t have played at that, Mushfiqur. It was nothing more than a prod. Mehedi the new man has to face the music here. And he’s jumping around too, fat inside edge second up. “Agarn (close enough) a character in F-troop played by Larry Storch,” reveals Nicholas Jewlachow on our earlier topic.. I think, on reflection, I had seen that. But as if Matt Wade is an F-troop fan? David O’Hanlon also dropped me a line to confirm this. Most appreciated. I’m still going to probe Wade on this. There he is! Pat Cummins back, and into the book again within three ball! Too quick for Mushfiqur, who is prodding and tickling behind, Wade completing the straightforward catch. What a performer this young fast bowler is. Just when they needed it, they have got the Bangladesh captain. Pat Cummins, you star. 52nd over: Bangladesh 129-6 (Mushfiqur 31, Mominul 19) Larry Agar. Last one before drinks. He’s operating with a straight line from over the wicket. That’s enough to entice Mominul into an intense reverse sweep last ball. He doesn’t make contract, but it doesn’t matter as the ball has cleared Wade’s gloves, running away for four byes. Hmmmm. Drinks it is. Hour to Bangladesh? I think so. But for the session to be going their way these two need to be there when they next break. 51st over: Bangladesh 124-6 (Mushfiqur 30, Mominul 19) Lyon into his 24th now. He’ll has to tire soon. He’s only been taken off to change ends, doing that a few times now. Make your mind up, Gaz. This is uneventful, until the Australians go up for a legside caught behind. Fairly ambitious sort of appeal, more like they had to go through the motions. No consideration of review. Graham Crouch is probably bang on in his take on the eventual Australian chase: “Anything more than Smith and Warner can make is nasty.” As it stands, they need 54. 50th over: Bangladesh 123-6 (Mushfiqur 29, Mominul 19) Garry bowling with Larry. That’s what Agar is being called by Matt Wade for reasons we are yet to ask him about. Unless you clever lot have the answer? All ears. It is Larry, then. Cut my Monimul then driven by Mushfiqur. Singles to both. They’re into a groove here. Looking to score. Even if it means exposing themselves to come risk, as Mominul does when reaching wide to cut but playing and missing. “Is it possible that there will be a repeat of the infamous Mumbai Test?” asks Amod Paranjape. “What does the pitch tell you mate?” Well, it isn’t as bad as Mumbai in 2004, over in about two and a third days with Michael Clarke bagging a six-fa. Sure, there is spin. But nothing outrageous. 49th over: Bangladesh 121-6 (Mushfiqur 28, Mominul 18) First ball of the new Lyon set pulled for one by Mushfiqur. Shorter again later in the over, cut by Mominul for one more. Men around the bat excited when he floats the last one up, but no bat pad chance forthcoming. The lead is now 50. “This is peak GOAT right here, isn’t it?” says Pete Salmon on the email, about the Aussie no. 1. “Has any cricketer ever been more suited to having the dreams of Guardian readers lived vicariously? He essentially get batsmen out by offering convincing arguments as to why they should go. Basically, unless he makes an announcement urging a yes vote in the marriage referendum, this may be as good as life gets for all of us. Let us all take a moment to live in the moment, as I’m sure Tony Robbins must have said.” I can’t add to that. Perfectly put. 48th over: Bangladesh 119-6 (Mushfiqur 27, Mominul 17) So it’s Agar for another crack at it - this time the northern end. All over the place, this. Maybe on purpose, in the name of throwing the ball around? He’s pitching up to Mushfiqur then Mominul, who both take singles. Then pulling back to get a bit more bounce. The skipper keeps the strike with one behind point. 47th over: Bangladesh 116-6 (Mushfiqur 25, Mominul 16) Oh right, it was a change of ends for Lyon. So Agar, for the second time, replaced after playing that role. Not sure he’ll fancy that. Anyway, it’s Nathan-Nathan to now go from the southern end. And he’s keeping Mominul honest. A timely maiden. Might have to invest in building that pressure up again for a bit. 46th over: Bangladesh 116-6 (Mushfiqur 25, Mominul 16) SOK has been swung around to the end that Lyon has preferred, replacing the man with four wickets. Lyon needs to take a breather at some stage, so this stands to reason. But first up, the left-armer misses with a half-volley, put away with easy by Mominul. Per my tweet a couple of overs ago, this bloke is no conventional number eight. Three further singles. Monimul has 16 of the 19 these two have added. What constitutes the Nasty Little Chase here, do you think? Email. Tweet. Find me on MSN Messenger. AOL. ICQ. Want my number? 45th over: Bangladesh 109-6 (Mushfiqur 24, Mominul 10) Ashton Agar! How you been? Just standing out there in the field watching the other two ragging it around? Have a little jam roll. Not a bad one either, a maiden lodged to Mushfiqur who has to rush to get his bat down to quicker, straighter deliveries on a couple of occasions. Promising early signs for him. 44th over: Bangladesh 109-6 (Mushfiqur 24, Mominul 10) Dropped? Little edge from the bottom of the bat to another that doesn’t get up, cutting at the time. Misses the glove. Not fair to call it a half-chance, really. Hard to see how he could have taken it. Mominul into it though, a man who normally bats in the top three. He finishes the over with a classy late cut. Looked in complete control dinking wide of Wade and slip. Lead 37. (I won’t mention it every over, don’t worry). 43rd over: Bangladesh 103-6 (Mushfiqur 24, Mominul 4) “Ooh yes, Sok!” Matt Wade likes what he is seeing. He’s never been louder than in this Test. Singles through the legside to both early in the over, keeping Mushfiqur in defence for the rest. Keeps giving it a chance to spin. 42nd over: Bangladesh 101-6 (Mushfiqur 23, Mominul 3) Lyon slips outside leg stump to left-handed Mominul from around the wicket, not a lot of turn from there so he grabs a couple to get off the mark. First Aussie keeper in 62 years to effect three stumpings in a Test, according to uber-statto Mazher Arshad on TV. Not sure if that was followed by a caveat? Still, pretty good going in response to the most intense scrutiny. Another couple of singles taken, Mushfiqur retaining the strike with a push down the ground. 100 up along the way. It’s what I do. Just ask Mitch Marsh. 41st over: Bangladesh 97-6 (Mushfiqur 22, Mominul 0) Oohing and aahing away is O’Keefe from the southern end again. A much improved performance from the left-armer in this innings, barely missing his mark. Noticably mixing up his pace too, in this over pushing Mushfiqur back with a couple skidding on, before looping up to draw the skipper forward. His response is a solid one. The lead is 25. 40th over: Bangladesh 97-6 (Mushfiqur 22, Mominul 0) I said below it nearly didn’t carry to Wade on the full. On watching a replay, it definitely did bounce twice before arriving in his gloves. Making it all the better take. Not often you are collecting from a spinner off the second bounce. His third stumping for the match. Nicely done. Lyon immediately turning square to Mominul, the last of the recognised batsmen at no. 8. This is why they went with the extra batsmen. He’s desperately needed for a meaningful contribution. Right now. Looking solid here. 20 wickets in the series for Lyon! Sabbir comes down the track and misses, sneaks low and turns, more or less under the bat. The 54-run stand between the two is over. Wade had to keep his cool in order to complete the take, it only just getting to him on the full. He did exactly that before just about smashing all the stumps out of the ground. He likes it a lot! As does Lyon, 11 for the match. Three away from equalling Herath for the most in a two-Test series, four on the shelf. 39th over: Bangladesh 97-5 (Mushfiqur 22, Sabbir 24) O’Keefe to bowl his 15th. The third spinner getting the bulk of the work, Agar only seeing given the one set so far. Mushfiquir gets one behind point with a steer, but not completely in control. Sabbir down the track gets one as well. Again, good accumulation 38th over: Bangladesh 95-5 (Mushfiqur 21, Sabbir 23) Huge bounce and spin, into Mushfiqur’s thigh pad I think, but the Australians are keen on the catch. Taken by Warner around at leg slip. But they’re not keen enough to send it upstairs. The captain drives Lyon straight for a single, keeping the strike. They’re building into something here. 37th over: Bangladesh 94-5 (Mushfiqur 20, Sabbir 23) That’s right, I forgot when OBOing to factor in that Steve O’Keefe bowls his overs in about 75 seconds. Mushfiqur into the 20s with a flicked single. Going nice, in the circumstances. Sabbit less adventurous this time around, defending the rest. 36th over: Bangladesh 93-5 (Mushfiqur 19, Sabbir 23) Crowd involved in the eastern stand. Fair to say we were scrambling around in the press box after the fifth wicket fell, worried it could be over by lunch. But not the case at all. Mushfiqur had words with Umpire Gould before lunch. Unsure what it was about, but gives a sense that he’s still very much in this scrap. Until the very end. Singles to both again, Sabbir pushing, the captain tucking. Then the former goes at the reverse! Misses. He’s tried it on time and again since arriving. Four byes! A lot going on here. Wade can’t get a glove to a ball that shoots very low. Best he could have done is maybe kick it away. But four added. Bangladesh’s lead is into the 20s. Come on, sing it with me: from little things, big things grow. 35th over: Bangladesh 86-5 (Mushfiqur 17, Sabbir 22) SOK from the southern end. Mushfiqur adds one to begin. Sabbir has the right idea, trying to smack O’Keefe off a length. Doesn’t get any of it. So, they are going to try and keep the pressure on with runs. Looks their best bet, to be fair. Thank you, Sammy. Is this the final session of the match? It could be. Or are we about to enter a period of nasty-little-chase specualtion? Not a bad effort from Sabbir and Mustafiqur to put an end to a nearly-lethal 4-for-11 collapse while still well in the red. Now, they’re 11 to the good from a local perspective. This should be good. Players are a few minutes away from joining us here at the Zahur Ahmed Chowdhury Stadium. I found a mural of the great man on the wall of the posh entry this morning. Learned that he was a senior union acvitist and later health minister in one of the early Bangladesh administrations. History lesson over. Let’s have a tune and get into it. A fantastic session of cricket where the game moved very quickly, and in the main towards Australia. The wicket is well and truly awake now as Bangladesh find themselves 11 runs ahead, but five wickets down after destroyer-in-chief Nathan Lyon picked up three wickets to go with his first innings 7-fa. He bowled in tandem with Steve O’Keefe for the majority of the session and cut a swathe through the Tigers’ top order, at one stage leaving them reeling at five wickets down and thirty-odd in arrears. O’Keefe picked up one of his own as we pondered whether Bangladesh might make it to the fourth innings, such was the sense of drama around every delivery. But Test cricket is great, and so it turned to Rahim and Sabbir Rahman to launch a mini-fightback with a partnership of 40 that has taken the hosts into the lead. They batted purposefully with an array of sweeps both traditional and reverse that had the effect of deepening the field and allowing a few singles to accrue. Without doubt they rode their luck, but you need to in these sorts of conditions. Even so, they are effectively 11-5 heading into the fourth innings and it will take a little more luck and purpose for them to dig themselves out and give Australia something nervy to chase. If and when that lead hits 80-90 and beyond, antipodeans from everywhere will become very, very nervous. The whole thing augers very well for the next session, so I urge you to stick around as our man Adam Collins brings you the descriptions from this pulsating day’s cricket. Thanks for joining me. Catch you next time. 34th over: Bangladesh 83-5 (Rahim 16, Sabbir Rahman 20) Last one before lunch, but it doesn’t stop Sabbir Rahman trying to reverse sweep the GOAT unsuccessfully from the first delivery. It’s just the way he plays, presumably. It’s worked, too. He follows it with another reverse sweep which elicits a half-shout for LBW. Not out, says Gould. The tension mounts. Lyon decides to come around the wicket. Sabbir Rahman defends. And on the last ball Rahman chips one just short of Maxwell! Screams of anguish everywhere as it bounces ahead of the Victorian. The batsman survives. Both survive - they’ve kept Bangladesh in the match. That’s lunch! A few thoughts to follow. 33rd over: Bangladesh 83-5 (Rahim 16, Sabbir Rahman 20) O’Keefe is up for an LBW early on here after Rahim shuffled back in his crease and looked very square-on, but the ball found his inside edge and instead he collects a run for it. Llong gets this one right and Australia don’t review. There’s one more from the last ball through square leg. Sabbir Rahman and Rahim are nearly there. To lunch, that is. 32nd over: Bangladesh 81-5 (Rahim 15, Sabbir Rahman 19) Three off Lyon’s over. They’re riding their luck these two, but fortune favours their bravery. A reverse sweep from Sabbir Rahman bounces over Smith and he gets two for it. The next almost carries to short leg after he lunges forward. It finds the turf before Handscomb can grab it. Feels like the match is swinging slightly again here as we head to lunch. Pulsating stuff. 31st over: Bangladesh 78-5 (Rahim 14, Sabbir Rahman 17) Just the one from this over as O’Keefe flattens his trajectory and keeps Sabbir Rahman contained, largely on the front foot. It’s a quick one and we look towards lunch, which is 8 or so minutes away. In effect Bangladesh are 6-5, but to my mind they’re only a significant partnership away from making Australia very nervous. These two are...dare I say...looking...good. 30th over: Bangladesh 77-5 (Rahim 13, Sabbir Rahman 17) Looking more and more comfortable, these two. Three from the over, and it’s becoming a sweep-a-thon. A reverse sweep falls short of Cummins, and the next one balloons over Warner at leg slip for two. Attack probably the best defence for Bangladesh here as they keep the score ticking over. 29th over: Bangladesh 74-5 (Rahim 12, Sabbir Rahman 15) The sweep works again for Sabbir Rahman, again splitting the men on the square boundary as it hurtles into the fence. He’s watchful for the rest and all of sudden it doesn’t feel like every ball is doing something. Bangladesh are into the lead - looking back, Australia again would have ‘taken this’ situation, but every time they get a firm grip on the game, Bangladesh fight back. This partnership is now crucial. Test cricket is great. 28th over: Bangladesh 70-5 (Rahim 12, Sabbir Rahman 11) Far more positive from both batsmen again, though only one from this over. The deficit moves to two. How many more do Bangladesh need to make a game of this? Not too many, I’d venture. There will be some nervous Australian batsmen watching this. Whereas Lyon and O’Keefe had caught NBA Jam-level Fire some overs ago, the flame has been somewhat contained now, and we can expect the Tigers to take the lead soon. Ebbing and flowing, this. Agreed with Joel’s tweet - if this Test has shown us anything, it’s Smith’s faith in O’Keefe. Thought Agar was excellent in the first innings too. 27th over: Bangladesh 69-5 (Rahim 12, Sabbir Rahman 10) Another good one for the Tigers, this time from O’Keefe’s bowling. Two singles to the vacant midwicket followed by a swept boundary from the concluding ball of the over leaves them 3 behind Australia, with five wickets in hand. The boundary was hit uppishly and briefly had the attention of deep square, but was hit firmly and was never in danger. A counterpunch here from both batsmen. 26th over: Bangladesh 63-5 (Rahim 7, Sabbir Rahman 9) So an update on the scenario here, Bangladesh trail by 9 runs now after Sabbir Rahman successfully reverse sweeps Lyon for a boundary and four more singles are picked up. That’s 8 from the over. One of them was a lofted shot that fell just short of long on, but both batted with intent this over, and they’re nearly in the affirmative. 25th over: Bangladesh 55-5 (Rahim 5, Sabbir Rahman 3) Sorry Holland fans (looking at you Hasto), SOK’s back - Agar used as makeweight for the guy Smith trusts. It’s an eventful six balls with two reviews and was that a dropped catch? Rahim presses forward on the last ball and the ball pops out to Handscomb at silly point but he can’t hang on. Rahim rubs his shoulder, Wade dramatically says ‘oh no!’ Who do you believe? Rahim, personally. Not out... Sabbir Rahman was down the track but Australia liked it anyway. It went on with the arm but struck the batsman well outside off, and may not have been hitting the stumps anyway. Not the best review. Another review! It’s Australia challenging this time. It’s for LBW, given not out by Llong. A long chat between O’Keefe, Wade and Smith. We have a review! O’Keefe back into the attack. Llong gives Sabbir Rahman out. Massive inside edge. Carry on. 24th over: Bangladesh 54-5 (Rahim 5, Sabbir Rahman 2) Lyon (who else?) comes from the other end now, replacing O’Keefe. Not sure SOK did enough to satisfy the howling wolves at his NSW door there, but he was solid foil for Lyon during a productive period for Australia. Rahim tries to reverse sweep Lyon again. He does enough to survive the rest - he’s shuffling across the crease a fair bit. 23rd over: Bangladesh 54-5 (Rahim 5, Sabbir Rahman 2) There’s a little delay here as Rahim applies The Magic Spray to his index finger following one that reared on him from O’Keefe. Meanwhile Agar replaces the GOAT, and as with his spinning colleagues starts with a fairly benign over. He does concede a boundary though, as one that strays down leg is tickled fine. Turns out it’s byes. Wade couldn’t do much. A single later and that’s all she wrote. Can the Tigers salvage something? 100 lead too much to ask? 22nd over: Bangladesh 47-5 (Rahim 3, Sabbir 1) Two singles to Rahim, one to Sabbir in another quieter over - though it still feels like every ball is doing something. Still feels like Australia’s innings could be interesting, if they get there. A commanding sweep from Rahim later on is a little more like it. 21st over: Bangladesh 44-5 (Rahim 1, Sabbir 0) A quieter over here (there’s no wicket), but at one point Rahim tries to reverse sweep Lyon. It’s short, it hits the batsman’s shoulder, and kind of sums up Bangladesh’s efforts this innings. In fairness, they probably need some audacity to claw something out of this situation, though I’m not sure a reverse sweep/pull is quite the route to take, says the blogger who hasn’t played for five years. Bangladesh trail by 28 runs. 20th over: Bangladesh 43-5 (Rahim 0, Sabbir 0) Two balls remain to Sabbir, the first one from O’Keefe’s a little full and the next one scoots through from short of a length. It’s just kept out. Matt Wade says ‘come on Hasto’, to O’Keefe, no doubt a reference to his best mate plumping for rival Jon Holland overnight. Everything’s fun for Australia now, you see. O’Keefe gets his first after stringing some good sets together. It’s flighted, draws Nasir into a front foot prod and catches the outside edge, travelling easily to Smith at first slip. O’Keefe makes a ‘shh’ gesture with his forefinger to his mouth. Feels like a bit of a procession now. 19th over: Bangladesh 39-4 (Rahim 0, Nasir 1) It’s moving quickly now, this match. After the wicket there’s a shout for LBW that Lyon rejects himself - there was too much turn. Hmmm, this innings mightn’t last long. Ten for Lyon! He was drawn in on the front foot by one curving in and it spun away, grabbed the outside edge and was taken low by Warner in that short gully/third slip position. Kind of like a catch you’d see in dressing room cricket. Excellent bowling, Bangladesh well and truly on the ropes now. 18th over: Bangladesh 37-3 (Shakib 0, Nasir 1) Another maiden from O’Keefe who too has a duo of men in the cordon and a man in close on the off-side under the lid. I remember a time when the off-side, in-close man wouldn’t wear a helmet, and the man on the leg would. Mark Waugh under the floppy, Ricky Ponting under the baggy green. Times have changed. For the better. Australia squeezing here. 17th over: Bangladesh 37-3 (Shakib 0, Nasir 1) The ball’s spitting even more now, as Shakib defends the rest of Lyon’s over. It’s the one’s landing a little shorter of a traditionally good length causing the most trouble, as one fizzes past Shakib’s bat toward the end of the over. Bangladesh trail by 35, three down. Lyon strikes again! It’s a regulation delivery that may have stopped in the pitch slightly. Kayes is neither defending nor attacking as he punches the ball, checks his shot, and essentially offers Maxwell catching practice at cover. Huge wicket, and that’ll be drinks 16th over: Bangladesh 37-2 (Kayes 15, Nasir 1) Much better over from O’Keefe. A maiden. Gets a couple to rip past the edge with spin and bounce. Growing into it, hopefully. Good foil for Lyon who continues next over. 15th over: Bangladesh 36-2 (Kayes 15, Nasir 1) Lyon’s first ball to Nasir (and Nasir’s first ball) finds his bat, then pad, and it’s squeezed about two metres to the left of Handscomb to strained anguish from Australians all. Close. He’s off the mark next ball. A short gully is moved in to increase the pressure on Kayes, who has one spun past his bat on the concluding ball of the over. 14th over: Bangladesh 36-2 (Kayes 15, Nasir 0) O’Keefe continues to Kayes. Interestingly, Nasir has been promoted up the order - probably in a bid to throw a right hander into the otherwise left-handed mix. O’Keefe’s over is good until another half-tracker is dispatched brutally for four behind square from Kayes. He’s letting himself down with those. Five good, one terrible. Bangladesh trail by 36. 13th over: Bangladesh 32-2 (Kayes 11, Nasir 0) Lyon marches on, as do Australia. Thought Bangladesh were just creeping into the game through accumulated boundaries but an ill-advised departure from his crease saw Tamim on his way. Not good from a Bangladesh point of view, he was trying to give himself room to spank him over cover, presumably, which never looked a good plan. Tamim employs his flamboyant dance again but pays a much bigger cover charge this time! Sorry. He charges at Lyon, is nowhere near the pitch, tries to rescue it with a prod to cover but the ball is long gone. Good stumping from Wade. The ball fairly exploded off the pitch which gave Wade some work to do. He took it cleanly and had the bails off in good time. 12th over: Bangladesh 31-1 (Kayes 10, Tamim 12) After only a handful of runs in the last three overs, O’Keefe lets the Tigers off the hook with a half-tracker from his first ball that’s smashed off the back foot for four. The rest of his over is good; he beats Tamim in flight twice to have him chipping uppishly, same goes Kayes in the one delivery he faced. The ooh’s and ahh’s are building, just as Bangladesh’s deficit is decreasing. They’re only 41 in arrears now. 11th over: Bangladesh 25-1 (Kayes 9, Tamim 7) Cummins off, Lyon on. Lyon’s been spun around. Kayes withdraws into defence mode here - he’s keeping Lyon out. You feel like a moment’s never too far away in this situation. Beyond going aerial, it’s hard to see where Bangladesh will find their runs. Kayes plays out a maiden. 10th over: Bangladesh 25-1 (Kayes 9, Tamim 7) Lyon off, O’Keefe on. Can he do what he did in Pune? Unfair question. It looks a little slow, there’s little turn for him, and a straight one has Wade responding ‘OH that’s close to a nick SOK!’ The ball in question was hit to cover. The next one, though, rushes Tamim and finds his inside edge. His follow up is good too, as Tamim hides his bat behind pad to one the spins sharply into him. There’s an appeal from behind the wicket with no support from the bowler. 9th over: Bangladesh 23-1 (Kayes 8, Tamim 6) A few boundaries accruing for Bangladesh now. Cummins is around the wicket to the left handed Kayes and angles in to his hip. Kayes gets one of those open-faced-thick-edges through gully that rolls away for four. Fielders might have hands on heads, batsmen might say they were in control. A few balls later sees Kayes fending one - again at the ribs - that stayed airborne for a little while off the bat. Alas, no short leg. He finishes with a bouncer that lands short of Wade. Yikes. 8th over: Bangladesh 19-1 (Kayes 4, Tamim 6) Ooh! Tamim dances flamboyantly down the deck to Lyon on ball two and goes inside out over cover-point! He didn’t get all of it, he was beaten in flight, but he finds the boundary. Interesting. He was bogged down in the first innings - and here too - so perhaps a new tactic. He reduces Australia’s lead to 53 and defends the remainder of the over. 7th over: Bangladesh 15-1 (Kayes 4, Tamim 6) Whereas Cummins sought some swing with full deliveries early on, here he’s almost exclusively short. It’s rib target practice for the Penrith man, though it’s not to intimidate so much as exploit cracks and find one to zoot through. It has the effect of locking the batsmen in to the crease and having them waft with their hands. The plan nearly comes off as Kayes edges one that finds its way between Wade and Renshaw at first slip for four. It didn’t carry, not by a long way, but it was a genuine nick. Neither moved for it, strangely. 6th over: Bangladesh 11-1 (Kayes 0, Tamim 2) Lyon has a short leg and a slip in close, with five on the off side and four on-the-on. It encourages Tamim to hit through the relatively free leg side, but he opts against that trap, instead choosing to defend with an almightily straight bat. Bangladesh still trail by 61, and are one wicket down. 5th over: Bangladesh 11-1 (Kayes 0, Sarkar 9) There ends a successful over for Cummins, who got the wicket and exposed the impending misbehaviour of the wicket. Australia’s kingdom for another paceman, maybe? Reward for Cummins after he’d pushed Sarkar back on the crease for the entire over before pitching up, catching the batsman frozen on the crease, and eliciting the edge which flew through to Renshaw who snaffled it comfortably enough. The previous ball to the wicket saw a shorter one skid through very low, which likely contributed to Sarkar’s indecision. The game’s about to start moving, I sense. 4th over: Bangladesh 11-0 (Tamim 2, Sarkar 9) Lyon plays with a few angles to both batsmen this over, sometimes delivering the ball close to the crease, sometimes wide. No real sign of pitch demons as yet, and both Tamim and Sarkar are able to collect singles to move the Tigers past the first 10 runs for the innings. They do everything in tens in high level cricket, don’t they? The deficit is 61. 3rd over: Bangladesh 9-0 (Tamim 1, Sarkar 8) Cummins unleashes a bouncer early on that whizzes well over Tamim’s head and sends Wade climbing to reel it in. He tries again and finds a better height this time. Tamim tries to jump-cut but misses. The latter finds a single through cover but Sarkar, facing his first delivery from Cummins, helps himself to a boundary via an authoritative cut following width from the Australian. He responds by bumping him, of course. Sarkar survives. It’s hard not to lionise Cummins as he toils as the sole paceman in this humidity. Would he look even better in a headband? 2nd over: Bangladesh 4-0 (Tamim 0, Sarkar 4) Lyon will take it up from the other end, and all of a sudden the spinner-opener novelty has evaporated. Novelty will do that to you. He’s driven for four from his very first delivery from one tossed up wide outside off, but otherwise contains Sarkar. The lead is now 68. 1st over: Bangladesh 0-0 (Tamim 0, Sarkar 0) Cummins will lead the third innings charge, and he starts at a thunderous 140km/hr. It’s Tamim who’s dealing with a spate of full, scrambled-seam deliveries successfully enough, though a few beat the left-hander’s outside edge. It’s a maiden. Del Portro serving for the match v Federer in the US Open Check the blog here while we wait for the 3rd innings to commence. Credit to Mustafizur He threatened throughout and was rewarded with a very creditable return of 4-84. Success with pace in Asia: who knew? Australia all out 377 So that’s all she wrote for Australia, with yesterday’s slow(er) collapse rendering today’s efforts redundant. It means they carry a 72 run lead into the second innings, which I suppose they would have taken if offered it ahead of time. As ever, they’ll rue the inability of anyone to significantly contribute beyond the top 4, but they do have an opportunity to wrest the game toward them with a strong bowling performance. A question to everyone - how many can Australia chase in the fourth innings? Or, more neutrally put, how many do Bangladesh need to win? I’m not sure Australia can do anything beyond 200. Didn’t take long! Lyon’s out to the paceman Mustafizur in the last ball of the day’s 2nd over. He’d been angling the ball across the GOAT all over and finally found the edge - a thickish one taken by Kayes in the cordon after Lyon drove hard at one. 119th over: Australia 377-9 (O’Keefe 8, Lyon 0) Shakib takes the first ball of the day and fires in a maiden. A couple have ripped already. Bittersweet for the tweakers with blades out there, I’m guessing. O’Keefe, who was a very good batsman in his youth, blocks, blocks and blocks again. Before we ponder the fourth innings innings theatre, there’s the small matter of the third Barring some exceptionally poor bowling or outstanding batting - and both are possible, I suppose - one imagines this game will start to move quite quickly. Bangladesh can notionally bat Australia out of the match, and series, though the pitch should have something to say about that. Lyon will be Australia’s main man again, but he’ll need support. Agar and Cummins were excellent in the first innings, though O’Keefe was poor. A little has been made of his less-than-ideal preparation leading in to this Test - he’ll need to fix that quickly if Australia are to stand a chance. Play will commence imminently. This match clearly garnerning some interesting in Australia, if Rick’s tweet is on the money Hello... and welcome to our OBO coverage of day four from Chittagong, where this Test is poised beautifully as it heads down the straight. Australia, ever the bridesmaids in these parts, have themselves a lead that was yesterday whittled from commanding to handy. They’re 72 ahead with one wicket in hand after another largely self-imposed mess allowed the home side a path back into the match. Such is Australia’s history-bred fear, that were the teams’ positions reversed we’d no doubt be beginning to herald a Bangladeshi victory. Instead, the sense of a 150-220 nerve-flaying fourth innings chase beckons. It’s aided by the weather, where Chittagong admittedly has no sun at the moment, but importantly no rain either. It means play will begin very shorty, where the players will find some further dust, larger cracks, and the commencement of the full gamut of the late-Test pitch demons to content with. It should be intriguing; it should be fun. I’m on @sjjperry on Twitter, or sam.perry.freelance@guardian.co.uk for anything and everything, just about. Sam will be here shortly.

Are they this year’s fairytale? They certainly looked the part tonight - and Geelong looked well off the pace. Winning tonight means the Tigers will now face the winner of GWS v Port Adelaide/West Coast - and you’d back them in against any of those sides right now. On the contrary, the Cats will lick their wounds and come back next week against the winner of Sydney v Essendon - and would dread a possible clash with the Swans. Huge game from Dion Prestia who had 31 disposals, 18 contested possessions, six marks, five clearances, six tackles, six inside 50s and a goal. And even more influential game from Dustin Martin, whose numbers don’t account for just what a game-breaker he was. He had 28 disposals in the end, six clearances, seven tackles and nine inside 50s. For the Cats, Dangerfield (31) won the most possessions, but was poor in disposal efficiency at 45%. Full credit to the Tigers who hunted him in packs and gave him no space or time when he did win the ball. He still managed 15 contested possessions, three clearances, five tackles and a goal, but was overshadowed by Mitch Duncan, with 29 disposals, four marks, seven clearances and a huge 11 tackles. The lid is off at Punt Rd - if the Dogs are anything to go by, they ought to embrace it. As impressive as the Crows were last night, I’d say the Tigers were just as dominant, if not more impressive given the size of the crowd, and the weight of history and the pressure of having under-performed for so long against them. That’s all from me on this historic night, and it’s all about the Yellow and Black. Thanks to all those who joined me. Enjoy, Tigers fans! Q4 01:00 remaining Geelong 5.9 (39) v Richmond 13.13 (91) Prestia sets up Lambert who can’t make the distance. That takes Prestia up to a game-high 31. Richmond fans, is this you? Q4 04:23 remaining Geelong 5.9 (39) v Richmond 13.13 (91) Brilliant goal to Trent Cotchin, one of the goals of the year - I don’t know that I can even do it justice. He bullocked at the ball, picked up a contested possession, spun 180 degrees out of a possible tackle and kicked truly from 45m out. Jack Riewoldt joins the party, with the Tigers’ 13th. Q4 06:20 remaining Geelong 5.9 (39) v Richmond 11.13 (79) Harry Taylor gets a consolation goal for the Cats - not that they’ll be taking much consolation from this game. Poor showing by the Cats who have been completely blown off the park in this final quarter. I’m sure plenty will be said about the ‘home’ ground advantage this week. Q4 10:43 remaining Geelong 4.9 (33) v Richmond 11.13 (79) As impressive as Martin has been, he’s been selfless, a true team player. With plenty of space and the crowd behind him, he hits up Butler, who finds Caddy alone inside 50. What a performance. That’s two for him, and yet another to the Tigers. Cats players turning on each other; it’s a capitulation. Q4 11:57 remaining Geelong 4.9 (33) v Richmond 10.13 (73) Four-straight to the Tigers (this time through Castagna) and the lead is suddenly forty points. They’ve been as impressive as the Cats have been disappointing in this last quarter. Q4 13:15 remaining Geelong 4.9 (33) v Richmond 9.13 (67) Geelong have no answer whatsoever for Dustin Martin right now - who wins another clearance (with a trademark fend-off). The ball lands in the arms of Townsend - who kicks another with just his second kick of the day. Three goals to the Tigers for the final quarter. Q4 14:30 remaining Geelong 4.9 (33) v Richmond 8.13 (61) Dustin Martin absolutely tearing the game apart right now - but Butler, who he sets up for a simple set shot, shanks it. Martin comes to the bench. He’s been the game-winner. Lambert kicks the sealer. Q4 16:45 remaining Geelong 4.9 (33) v Richmond 7.11 (53) Some light rain falls to begin the final quarter. What can the Cats produce? Without jinxing it (sorry Tigers fans) it looks like Richmond for their first finals win since 2001 at this stage. Dangerfield coughs the ball up - he chooses to play on when it isn’t really an option, and is showing signs of panic. Another fend-off by Dusty who passes off to Riewoldt, who cooks the kick. It’s the fend-off again, and Dusty sets up a Tigers goal - finding Grigg alone in the goal-square. Just a point off the biggest lead of the game now. Three-quarer-time Geelong 4.9 (33) v Richmond 6.10 (46) Dangerfield throws himself behind the ball and takes a critical contested grab. Is lifting his team. But anything Danger can do, Martin can do (?better) - and some Dusty fend-off magic links up with Jack Riewoldt to open up the field for his team. Dion Prestia is all alone in the square, and converts the Martin-assisted goal. Tigers fans are up on their feet as the siren sounds. Q3 02:04 remaining Geelong 4.9 (33) v Richmond 5.10 (40) David Astbury gives away a(n admittedly soft) free kick to Tom Hawkins, who has been pushing up the ground and doing everything he can to haul his side back into the contest. He makes no mistake, and the Cats are back within a dangerously slim margin again. Q3 03:57 remaining Geelong 3.9 (27) v Richmond 5.10 (40) Dangerwood combine to spur the Cats on, but Danger uncharacteristically boots it out on the full. Momentum has well and truly swung back to the Tigers. Tuohy has a running shot on goal against the flow of play - but can’t bend it back far enough. Q3 05:31 remaining Geelong 3.8 (26) v Richmond 5.10 (40) Big holding the ball on Dangerfield by Riewoldt, and the ball spills to Martin who gets the crowd going again with a hit-up pass to Edwards from 35m out. Two in a row to the Tigers in quick succession. Q3 06:50 remaining Geelong 3.8 (26) v Richmond 4.10 (34) Nick Vlaustin strikes a beautiful goal from 50m to get the Tiger army back up and roaring. Great effort by the Tigers to get back into the game; they’ve had the last six inside 50s after the Cats looked to blitz them at the beginning of the third. Q3 08:15 remaining Geelong 3.8 (26) v Richmond 3.10 (28) Tigers creep back in front after Riewoldt soccers one off the ground - it almost bounces through for a spectacular goal, but misses narrowly to the left. Mitch Duncan up to 20 disposals for the Cats, ten contested possessions, five clearances and seven tackles. Daniel Rioli gets a rare possession - just his second for the night, and gives it off to Edwards for a shot at goal from a tight angle, 40m out. It’s a fair effort, but another point only to the Tigers. Q3 11:46 remaining Geelong 3.8 (26) v Richmond 3.8 (26) Stats have evened up a little - 24-23 clearances for the Cats, 29 inside 50s to 25 for the Tigers, 97-86 contested possessions for the Tigers. Zach Guthrie takes a courageous, contested grab with his back to the ball. He misses poorly. Surely he’d be nervous about Menzel taking back his spot. Q3 13:11 remaining Geelong 3.7 (25) v Richmond 3.8 (26) Almost a spectacular goal to Danger, who snaps one out of the pack, but Rance gets the rushed behind. Richmond almost look like they’re ‘protecting’ the lead - they need to get their manic pressure and attack back. Guthrie’s calf is a predicted three to four week injury. Another behind to the Cats - after a Blicavs mid-air soccer goes through for a behind. Danger signs (no pun intended) for the Tigers. Ball trapped inside the Cats’ forward half. Q3 14:46 remaining Geelong 3.5 (23) v Richmond 3.8 (26) Parsons centres dangerously, and Houli punches through a diving, rushed behind. Tight, tense start to the third quarter. Looks like the Cats are back in it - certainly the Tigers aren’t dominating like they were. I’d be worried if I was a Tigers fan. On cue, a goal to Parsons after a Hawkins assist, and it’s three goals in a row to the Cats. Q3 16:04 remaining Geelong 2.4 (16) v Richmond 3.8 (26) In some quirky news, the NRL final is almost out-scoring this AFL game. It’s 18-10 to the Roosters over the Broncos in the 63rd minute. One try each to Guerra, Cordner and Keary for the Roosters, for those interested (and one to Roberts and Oates for the Broncos). Big ice pack on Cam Guthrie’s right calf - he won’t be back. Q3 17:55 remaining Geelong 2.4 (16) v Richmond 3.8 (26) Cam Guthrie headed down to the rooms - not a good sign for the Cats. No Richmond player nominates for the ruck but Dustin Martin still manages to smother through a behind. Half-time Geelong 2.4 (16) v Richmond 3.7 (25) DANGER! He hasn’t had his usual influence, but manages a big goal on the siren. That’s huge in the context of the game. 21 clearances to 17 for the Tigers, 28 inside 50s to 18 and 87 contested possessions to 68. After that final goal, however, Richmond will be left to rue not making the most of their opportunities - with the Cats only nine points behind. For the Tigers, Prestia is dominating with 14 disposals, nine contested possession, three clearances, three tackles and four inside 50s. Martin also has 14 disposals, with nine contested possessions, four clearances, four tackles and four inside 50s. Caddy and Cotchin have also been influential. Duncan is leading the way for the Cats, with 14 disposals, six contested possessions, three clearances and six tackles. Scott Selwood also has 14 disposals, with six contested possessions, five clearances and six inside 50s. Joel, however, is well down on usual output with seven disposals. Q2 01:50 remaining Geelong 1.4 (10) v Richmond 3.7 (25) Could the Cats finish the term goalless? It looks more and more likely, as Rance wins a holding the ball against Hawkins. He’s had an excellent game, completely blanketing Hawkins. Best chance for the first half comes with under two minutes to go, and Motlop finally converts for the Cats after a series of fumbles. Good resilience shown by the Cats. Reckon Richmond will be nervous that they’re so close, after a half of total domination. Q2 03:34 remaining Geelong 0.4 (4) v Richmond 3.7 (25) Free to Parfitt - boos following him everywhere he goes. Caddy conveniently pretends not to have heard the whistle and takes the opportunity to dump a former teammate. Caddy and Prestia very impressive to date with nine and 15 respectively. Speaking of, Caddy picks out Riewoldt, 45m out on a tight angle. He can’t make the distance. Q2 05:37 remaining Geelong 0.4 (4) v Richmond 3.7 (25) Crowd figures officially past 95,000. Feels like 95,000 Tiger fans to me. Dion Prestia up to 14 disposals, all the while tagging Joel Selwood, who only has five. Selwood and Danger on the bench. Q2 08:15 remaining Geelong 0.4 (4) v Richmond 3.7 (25) Finally the third goal to the Tigers - this time to Dan Butler, after the small forwards combine. The crowd erupts. Great game by the Tigers so far - their tackling pressure is a real highlight; picking off the receiver with ease. Q2 09:19 remaining Geelong 0.4 (4) v Richmond 2.7 (19) Absolutely manic pressure being applied by the Tigers. Loving Prestia’s game, who wins a holding the ball free. Prestia has 12 disposals, seven contested possessions, two clearances and three tackles. The best game I’ve seen him play in yellow and black. Such a low-scoring contest, but the Tigers deserve to be much further in front (probably more like 7.2 than 2.7). Still not a single goal to the Cats. Q2 12:36 remaining Geelong 0.4 (4) v Richmond 2.7 (19) Uh oh, Parsons limping off the ground with what looks like an ankle - he came into the game underdone. Even Geelong’s veterans look rattled - like Harry Taylor who turns the ball over with a bomb long. Houli gets one high from Parfitt - and gets 50 for his efforts. Cameron Ling sees no issue with that one (surprised?) Q2 14:53 remaining Geelong 0.4 (4) v Richmond 2.6 (18) Very odd by the Cats - Tuohy runs past Hawkins and demands the ball - only to boot it out on the full. Not sure why he’d ask for the ball off Hawkins, who would easily have covered the distance. ON the replay it looks like Hawkins actually gives the ball to Tuohy without him asking for it. Even more odd. They look rattled, Geelong. Q2 16:44 remaining Geelong 0.4 (4) v Richmond 2.6 (18) 18 inside 50s to the Tigers, to 10 for the Cats. Joel Selwood is uncharacteristically caught holding the ball inside the Richmond 50 - and the free goes to Dion Prestia. This is his tenth disposal. He misses. Plenty of misses opportunities for the Tigers given how much they’ve dominated. Q2 18:00 remaining Geelong 0.4 (4) v Richmond 2.5 (17) Guess who - Josh Caddy. Tom Stewart drops an absolute sitter, and the Tigers pounce. Riewoldt squares the ball to the man of the moment, who hits the post - again! Trent Cotchin Loved the game of Trent Cotchin so far - he’s up to seven disposals, with six contested possessions, five clearances and a massive five tackles. Quarter-time Geelong 0.4 (4) v Richmond 2.4 (16) Harry Taylor has a chance to get the Cats back to within far closer than they deserve to be - the Tigers have dominated this quarter with 46-37 contested possessions and 13-10 inside 50s. Another poster to the Cats - bizarrely, that’s four posters for the first quarter. Q1 00:30 remaining Geelong 0.3 (3) v Richmond 2.4 (16) Houli gets the Tigers’ third! Or is it a free? Yes - free goes against Riewoldt - plus 50m for creeping over the mark. Not sure about the free - looked like a fair bump. Cries of ‘bullshit’ sweep over the ‘G. Could be a two-goal turnaround, with Duncan lining up from 50m out at the other end - but he too hits the post. Q1 03:26 remaining Geelong 0.2 (2) v Richmond 2.3 (15) So much for Riewoldt looking nervous - he finds Dustin Martin with an excellent, centering kick. Martin is only 10m out, but on a tight angle, and unselfishly passes off to Caddy. Can he convert this time? Yes. Just two goals for the game so far, both to the Tigers. Q1 04:15 remaining Geelong 0.2 (2) v Richmond 1.3 (9) Contentious deliberate call goes against Joel Selwood - who is yet to really get into the game. He doesn’t agree with the umpire, funnily enough, and manages to smother the kick back into play. Good work from the skipper. Hasn’t been as impressive as Cotchin, however, who lands a big, aggressive tackle (his fifth, in just the first quarter). Q1 05:24 remaining Geelong 0.2 (2) v Richmond 1.3 (9) Caddy finds Riewoldt outside 50, but he kicks into the man on the mark (Henderson). Reckon he looks nervous. Caddy takes a big contested grab on three Geelong defenders. Mackie finds himself out-positioned. The former Cat, however, hits the post, and looks disappointed with himself. Q1 10:18 remaining Geelong 0.1 (1) v Richmond 1.2 (8) Leading possession-winners are Duncan (5), Dangerfield, Tuohy and Lonergan (4 each) for the Cats, while Martin (5), Prestia, Lambert and Rance have 4 for the Tigers. Motlop looking all at sea - kicks it out on the full after his last turnover. Tuohy taking plenty of intercept marks for the Cats in their defensive 50. Q1 12:50 remaining Geelong 0.1 (1) v Richmond 1.2 (8) Both Cotchin and Martin stuck on the bench (and have been for several minutes). Rance gets one high from Taylor (after ducking into it) and is off with the blood rule (this will let their stars come back on, at least). Rance seems to lose it at his own trainer (hmm?) and gets booed. Very odd. Meanwhile Brian Taylor takes a moment to remind us all how good-looking Rance is. Like I said, odd. Q1 14:30 remaining Geelong 0.1 (1) v Richmond 1.2 (8) Good contest between Taylor and Rance - no signs of Rance being overawed by Taylor’s four goals on him last match. Danger has a wayward shot at goal and gets a nasty knock to the knee. He’s limping, but looks OK - could easily have been a medial ligament injury. Q1 15:40 Geelong 0.0 (0) v Richmond 1.2 (8) Several bad turnovers already - some key ones by Dangerfield and Motlop - who tries to switch through the middle and picks out three Tigers. Almost results in a Dusty goal - wouldn’t that have brought the house down? Murdoch has the first chance to score for the Cats - but is wrong-footed and it’s out on the full. Learn to kick both sides, kids! Q1 17:32 Geelong 0.0 (0) v Richmond 1.1 (7) Jack Riewoldt in all sorts of space, but fumbles and misses to the right. The moment may have got the better of him. Tiger pressure is manic - Cats have been caught holding the ball several times already. Q1 18:04 Geelong 0.0 (0) v Richmond 1.0 (6) First free goes to Selwood - have a guess how that was received. Cats look composed, and have been slow in their ball movement (as opposed to the frantic pace of the Tigers’ attack). First goal is a soccer by Townsend in the goalsquare - what would the odds of that have been a month ago? Here we go Selwood wins the toss - with Heads (FYI). This success is greeted with further boos. National anthem time For those less nationalistic amongst us, it’s always a little awkward, isn’t it. Still, nothing says September like just under 100,000 standing in unison at the MCG - and the roar of the crowd as the final notes ring out. And now for Geelong Honestly, all I can hear is the booing of Tigers fans. Reminds me of travelling to Sydney to support the Bulldogs in the preliminary final against GWS last year (and GWS entering the ground to deafening boos). Reportedly, Leon Cameron was so perturbed he complained to the umpires. No complaints from Chris Scott, who tells Cameron Ling that he is certain Cats fans will make some noise should his side fire. Here come the Tigers The Tigers arrive to beating drums (on the turf), as well as an almighty roar. You can barely hear the theme song over those fans singing along. Goosebumps - even from a non-Richmond fan. Tigers yet to play finals One of the big unknowns for tonight is how the inexperienced Tigers will perform. Amongst those yet to play in a finals game are: David Astbury, Nathan Broad, Dan Butler, Jason Castagna, Jack Graham, Dion Prestia, Daniel Rioli and Jacob Townsend. The crowd It’ll be a record-breaking crowd for a qualifying final tonight. Estimates are in the high 90,000s. Luckily for those still stuck outside, the MCG is looking mighty fine. Spine-tingling stuff. Are you stuck in line? Also seeing plenty of complaints from punters at the ground about queuing times. Geelong’s ‘home’ game? Seeing a lot of these floating around before the game. Keen to hear your thoughts. Welcome Hello and welcome to this special AFL finals blog of the sold-out Geelong v Richmond qualifying final at the MCG. I’m Kate O’Halloran and I’m here to take you through all tonight’s action. Feel free to contribute in comments below, to tweet me @kate_ohalloran or email me: kate.ohalloran.freelance@guardian.co.uk. This is surely one of the most anticipated finals games in recent years, particularly for a chronically-underperforming Tigers outfit who lost three straight elimination finals between 2013-15 (under current coach Damien Hardwick, who holds a winless finals record). This is the first time Richmond have played in a qualifying final since 2001, and concerningly for the Tiger army, they haven’t won one since way back in 1980. Let’s not mention that though, shall we Richmond fans? If you want all the bad news upfront, though, the Cats have won their last 13 matches against the Yellow and Black. Alarmingly, the last time the Tigers won against the Cats was in round nine, 2006. And if you think that having this final played at the MCG might disadvantage the Cats, don’t look now: the Tigers haven’t won against the Cats at the MCG since last century (1999). We all know, however, that this season hasn’t been any ordinary one for the Tigers, led by man-of-the-moment and newly re-signed star, Dustin Martin, underrated captain Trent Cotchin, and All Australian captain Alex Rance. Rance leads the third-best defence in the league, with the Tigers conceding just 76 points a game on average. Despite the brilliant leadership of household names in Cotchin, Rance and Martin, the key to the Tigers’ success this year has been team cohesion, hunger and improvement across the board, even in the most unlikely of places (Jacob Townsend anyone?) Can’t wait to see how their lesser lights perform on the big stage tonight. Geelong won’t be overawed - or at least shouldn’t be. Their team has a combined 185 games of finals experience, while the Tigers have just 65. They will also welcome back their captain in Joel Selwood, after his incredible recovery from a syndesmosis injury (and ankle surgery) for another round of ‘Dangerwood’. Match-ups will be crucial: look for Harry Taylor to repeat his defensive forward effort on Alex Rance in round 21 (in which he also managed four goals), while Scott Selwood will surely get a tagging role, probably on Cotchin. Cam Guthrie may be the match-up for Martin - but look for Scott to spring some surprises. Geelong have disappointed in finals campaigns in more recent times, failing to make the big dance from three qualifying finals in the past four years. Look for them to come out ready to avenge those failures. There are some milestones in tonight’s game; not that it needs any more hype. Patrick Dangerfield plays his 200th game (and ninth final) - and I envision a best-on-ground from him. Good luck stopping him, Tiges. Meanwhile, Kane Lambert plays his 50th. I’m tipping the Cats in a close one - but can’t help but think the MCG is unequivocally the home of the Yellow and Black. I reckon the entire army and more will be there tonight* - and despite what the exec will say, that could well be a deciding factor. *I can attest to this, having caught the South Morang home past Jolimont on the way home (in peak hour). Yes, that’s right, I actually trained past the MCG to cover this for you, from my couch in Northcote. Kate will be here shortly. In the meantime, here’s what happened in last night’s opening finals match:"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/2017/sep/07/mighty-juan-martin-del-potro-scuppers-hopes-of-federer-nadal-clash-at-us-open","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-07T04:45:00Z","webTitle":"Mighty Juan Martín del Potro scuppers hopes of Federer-Nadal clash at US Open","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/sep/07/mighty-juan-martin-del-potro-scuppers-hopes-of-federer-nadal-clash-at-us-open","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/sep/07/mighty-juan-martin-del-potro-scuppers-hopes-of-federer-nadal-clash-at-us-open","fields":{"headline":"Mighty Juan Martín del Potro scuppers hopes of Federer-Nadal clash at US Open","bodyText":"Riding an implausible wave of retro romance, Roger Federer, 36 and in sight of his third slam title of the year, foundered on the sharp rocks of hubris on day 10 of the US Open when Juan Martín del Potro ripped up his invitation to a semi-final against Rafael Nadal. Instead, the big man from Tandil will be Nadal’s opponent on Friday. The world No1 leads him 8-5 over their careers, but only a brave bookmaker would make either of them a clear favourite. Earlier, Nadal, a two-time New York champion, was at his commanding best in dismissing the limp but fevered challenge of the Russian teenager, Andrey Rublev, 6-1, 6-2, 6-2. That, though, was not a reliable guide to what awaits the Spanish clay-court supremo on Friday. Del Potro, his mighty forehand clicking like a rifle, deserves to be there after winning 7-5, 3-6, 7-6 (8), 6-4 in two hours and 50 minutes under the roof on Arthur Ashe, and Federer might one day regret his pre-match dismissal of the Argentinian’s victory over him in the 2009 final here. If it played any part in his downfall, only the winner will know but, from the outside, it did not look to help Federer’s cause. Del Potro was 20 back then and has done heroically well to beat wrist injuries and the usual fluctuations of form over the past few years to even be in the mix here. Eight years ago, the world was his. As Federer conceded this week, he might well have gone on to be No1. But he surprised many in his critique this week on their final that year. “I left that match with a lot of regrets,” Federer said, after both of them had reached the fourth round this time in vastly contrasting styles. “I should have been up maybe two sets to love or ... two sets to one. The only time when he was really better, in my opinion, was the fifth set. Obviously that was good enough to beat me that day. I had a great run... but it ended my five-year reign here in New York. But Juan Martín did play extremely well. I felt like he deserved it at the end.” Rarely has someone been damned so completely with faint praise. And Del Potro, fresh – or at least reheated – from his efforts to come from two sets down in seeing off Dominic Thiem, was fired up from the start. If he needed an incentive, Federer had supplied it to him in words. He dug in to take the first set, and a tremor of concern rippled around the stadium among the Federer faithful – as well as those American TV pundits who were torn between craving a Federer-Nadal semi-final (in their first ever meeting here) or the extension of the Del Potro fairytale. From love-3 down in the third set, Federer found enough magic to get to a tie break. And this is where the match pivoted in Del Potro’s favour. A set apiece, Federer changed ends 4-2 up with the ball in hand. Del Potro challenged an ace and won the point. Del Potro’s right arm was grooving, but the net got in his way. Federer had the set on his racket at 5-4. Del Potro hit long; set point. Del Potro saved when Federer unwisely served to his forehand then levelled with a huge serve wide. Mirka smirked in the box, and smiled when Del Potro double-faulted. Husband stepped up – but he put a backhand wide for 7-all. He grabbed another set point. Del Potro crushed a forehand for 8-all, and was at the net to grab set point, his first, with a volley. Federer volleyed long on the backhand. Job done. As they slugged it out in the fourth set, it took del Potro five games to make the breakthrough. Federer’s racket oozed a weird mixture of familiar certainty and anxiety. He knows no other way but to go for his shots, and not enough of them stayed legal as Del Potro moved to within two holds from victory. As Federer served to stay in the tournament, Del Potro, 5-3 up, thrashed an outrageous forehand past Federer’s whiskers at the net before the Swiss held with a whizz-bang backhand that kissed the line. This was high-grade theatre. Now it was Del Potro’s match to lose. They had been playing two hours and 45 minutes. The crowd, remarkably, seemed to be equally divided. They wanted more drama, certainly, but the hunger for a denouement was greater. Del Potro clipped the baseline with an ambitious forehand for 15-love. He aced for 30-love. He dumped a backhand volley: 30-15. At the end of an attritional rally, he hit long for 30-all. The crowd went crazy. Federer put an ambitious forehand volley madly wide: match point. A huge Del Petro serve forced Federer to block a set-up return and the Argentinian belted the gimme down the line, lifted his arms to the sky in exultation. As Federer slipped away, thwarted but valiant, the stage belonged to Del Potro. “It’s hearwarming, he’s an amazing young man,” John McEnroe told his ESPN audience, while simultaneously expressing regret that Federer and Nadal are unlikely to ever meet here. Del Potro said courtside: “I think I played my best match of the tournament. I did everything well. I served well and I deserved to win.” “I think it’s my court too,” he said, when asked about Federer’s dominance here in the distant past. Addressing the crowd, he said, “You make me feel happy every time I play here. I love to see you shouting for me. And I guess the crowd will be tough for me against Rafa. I think I got lucky in the tie-break, double fault at 6-all. But I made a good return. In the first set I played even better.” He then addressed the large and vocal Argentinian gathering in Spanish, which roughly translated as, “Thank you from the bottom of my heart.” That is a heart with almost bottomless reserves."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2017/sep/07/china-mars-replica-space-tibet-plateau","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-07T06:46:37Z","webTitle":"China brings Mars a little closer with replica on Tibet plateau","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/sep/07/china-mars-replica-space-tibet-plateau","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/sep/07/china-mars-replica-space-tibet-plateau","fields":{"headline":"China brings Mars a little closer with replica on Tibet plateau","bodyText":"The 55m-kilometre jaunt from planet Earth to the red planet takes up to a year. From Beijing’s international airport you’ll soon be able to fly there in just over seven hours. In the latest leg of its multi-billion dollar race for space, China has unveiled plans to build a 400m yuan (£47m) replica of Mars on a spectacular, sandswept corner of the Tibetan plateau. The “simulated Mars station” – a 95,000 square-kilometre tribute to the solar system’s second-smallest planet – will be built in Qinghai province’s Haixi Mongolian and Tibetan autonomous prefecture, not far from the westernmost tip of the Great Wall. Xinhua, China’s official news agency, described the breathtaking red rock location as “the most Martian place on Earth”. Liu Xiaoqun, a space exploration expert from the Chinese Academy of Sciences who is leading the attempt to recreate Mars on Earth, declined to speak to the Guardian about the project. “Liu Xiaoqun isn’t in Beijing and he doesn’t want to take any interviews,” said Huang Jingyi, a press officer from the state-run academy. But local reports suggest the remote desert base will be used for a mix of serious space research and money-spinning glamping of the sort that is becoming increasingly popular among well-off Chinese. One section of the “hyper-arid” high-altitude camp will be used to train Chinese astronauts, state broadcaster CCTV reported earlier this summer. Another part will receive tourists hungering for a taste of life on Mars. “People dream about migrating to Mars, so what we want to do is give people a high-end experience of what it would actually be like to live in outer space,” Liu said, according to the South China Morning Post. Xinhua said adventure-seeking glampers would be housed on a “Mars campside” featuring “module-like accommodations” designed to simulate extraterrestrial living. A Mars-themed amusement park will also be created. CCTV said guests would “find out what life on Mars is really like” by experiencing weightlessness and hiking in the area’s arid desert terrain. Despite its isolated location, the campsite is likely to be rather more hospitable than Mars, which has an unbreathable atmosphere that contains only 0.2% oxygen. Zhang Biao, the deputy mayor of Delingha, the nearest city to China’s Mars, said the project would boost the local economy as well as awareness of Beijing’s space program. “The building of the Mars village has both scientific and ecological significance,” he told Xinhua. China is fighting to transform itself into a space superpower, as part of a wider bid for international prestige that has accelerated since Xi Jinping took power in 2012. Beijing hopes to have a permanent manned space station operating by 2022 and to send a probe to the real Mars in 2019. In 2013 China became the first country to soft land on the moon in almost four decades as part of efforts to send the first Chinese astronaut there. Not everyone is convinced that Qinghai’s Mars simulation base will help China’s space ambitions. Jiao Weixin, a Peking University scholar, suggested it was more gimmick than game-changer. “It will be difficult for the Mars simulation to imitate the original,” he was quoted as saying by the Global Times newspaper.

The plan, revealed in a statement to the Guardian, distinguishes the company from others in Silicon Valley, where the chief executives of corporations like Facebook and Microsoft have denounced Trump’s decision to rescind a program protecting undocumented immigrants from deportation, but declined to offer specifics of how they will resist. The Guardian asked 19 major tech corporations if they would lay off their employees who are Dreamers – immigrants brought to the US as children without documentation – if they lose their work permits because of Trump’s elimination of their legal status. Airbnb spokesman Nick Papas replied in an email: “No. We are 100% committed to protecting Dreamers.” Despite other CEOs’ public promises to support employees targeted by the president, all the other tech companies refused to say if they would allow Dreamers to continue working for them, or did not respond to inquiries. It’s unclear how American companies could employ immigrants if their work authorization documents became invalid. Papas did not respond to follow-up questions and declined to comment on how many Dreamers Airbnb currently employs. Immigrants’ rights advocates in Silicon Valley argued that the tech executives – who have earned widespread media coverage and praise from liberals for opposing the White House – should take a more meaningful stand and pledge to continue employing Dreamers regardless of Trump’s repeal of their rights. The president faced international backlash across the political spectrum when he announced his decision to phase out the Obama-era program known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (Daca) by March 2018. Daca, which protected immigrants known as Dreamers, granted temporary status to roughly 800,000 people, allowing them the right to live, study and work legally in the US. If the Republican-controlled Congress does not, in the next six months, pass legislation to protect Dreamers, they could face deportation to the countries where they were born, even though for many, America is the only home they’ve ever known. Dreamers will also lose their right to work in the US under Trump’s rules. In response, leaders in the tech industry – which often supports conservative policies despite its liberal reputation – issued perhaps their most vehement rebuke of Trump since his inauguration. Apple’s chief executive, Tim Cook, tweeted the company would “fight for [Dreamers] to be treated as equals” and revealed that more than 250 employees are protected by Daca. Microsoft’s president said if the government tries to deport an employee, “it’s going to have to go through us to get that person.” Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg doubled down on criticisms of Trump’s decision with a live broadcast interview featuring Dreamers. But all of the major tech firms refused to say if they would defy Trump and continue to employ Dreamers in the long-term. David Leopold, an immigration attorney and former president of the American Immigration Lawyers Association, noted that employers are obligated by law to check the immigration status of workers and cannot knowingly employ people who lack authorization, putting the companies in a difficult position. A Facebook spokesperson said the company was not “speculating about the future”. A Microsoft representative pointed to its blogpost saying it would pay for lawyers if the US seeks to deport their employees, but said, “We are unable to provide any further information.” Despite signing a letter urging Trump to preserve Daca, Google also declined to respond to questions about the fate of its own Dreamers. Companies that either ignored queries or declined to answer questions about its Dreamer workforce include Apple, Twitter, Uber, Lyft, Salesforce, Netflix, eBay, Box, Intel, Oracle, Cisco, LinkedIn, HP and IBM. Amazon also did not respond to specific questions, but a spokesperson pointed to a declaration the company submitted in support of a new lawsuit challenging Trump, which said at least nine employees are Daca recipients and that the company “will suffer injury” if they lose their status and are deported. Madhuri Nemali, a Silicon Valley lawyer who represents immigrants in tech, said the big firms should promise to continue employing Dreamers. “That would be a powerful pledge,” she said. “It’s wonderful all the companies have been coming out with statements … but it’s a lot easier to say you’re going to stand by them when there are no consequences.” The impact would be more significant if the firms said they would allow Dreamers to stay after Daca expires, she said, sending the message that “it’s not just your lives on the line. We’re standing by you and also willing to go against the law to take a moral stance.” If the firms were to employ Dreamers without permits, Leopold said, “it would be an incredible statement. It would be unprecedented. The government would have to make a huge decision – are they going to go after major companies or are they going to do the right thing and reinstate Daca?” Leopold said it was difficult for him to advocate that companies break the law, noting that they could theoretically face sanctions or even criminal charges. Sarahi Espinoza Salamanca, a 27-year-old Dreamer based in Silicon Valley, who created an app that helps undocumented students with college applications, said she wanted to see tech firms make more specific promises to workers and hoped they would hire Dreamers as independent contractors if they lose authorization. Although companies aren’t required to check the work status of contractors, they could still be liable for hiring people they know lack permits. “I hope the tech industry steps up to the plate,” said Salamanca, adding, “A lot of the tech companies were founded by immigrants. They should definitely understand the situation we’re going through.” Contact the author: sam.levin@theguardian.com"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/sep/08/stir-like-an-assassin-five-tips-for-making-top-class-cocktails-at-home","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-08T06:00:31Z","webTitle":"Stir like an assassin: five tips for making top-class cocktails at home","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/sep/08/stir-like-an-assassin-five-tips-for-making-top-class-cocktails-at-home","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/sep/08/stir-like-an-assassin-five-tips-for-making-top-class-cocktails-at-home","fields":{"headline":"Stir like an assassin: five tips for making top-class cocktails at home","bodyText":"Watching a skilled bartender at work – gracefully moving from backbar to ice well, throwing splashes of liquids into mixing glasses and shaker tins, silently stirring drinks or shaking them with vigour – is part of the pleasure of going to a cocktail bar. But this theatre serves to obscure a fundamental truth about bartending: making a good cocktail isn’t necessarily hard work. Home bartenders have a few advantages over their professional counterparts when it comes to making high-quality cocktails. Firstly, home bartenders are beholden to nobody’s budget but their own. If you want to make, say, a Chartreuse swizzle at home, nobody’s going to stop you – whereas the reality of what customers are willing to pay keeps such drinks off most bars’ lists. Home bartenders are also able to deep-dive into the things that interest them. If you discover that you love aquavit, for example, you can collect as many different examples of the spirit as you please – a luxury most commercial bars can’t afford. With practice and finesse, the drinks that you make in your home bar can equal the drinks you’ll find at your local watering hole. Here are a few tips to help take your home bar game to the next level. 1. Buy high-quality ingredients – but don’t go super-luxe There’s a truism in the cocktail world that a mixed drink is only as good as its worst ingredient. While it mostly holds true – as anyone who’s had a Manhattan made with cheap bourbon and spoiled vermouth can attest – that doesn’t mean you have to spend a packet on ingredients to make good drinks. There isn’t always a strong correlation between price and quality of liquor. Of course, the very cheapest bottles are more likely to be dreck, but that doesn’t mean that the very expensive stuff is amazing. When you buy a bottle of liquor, you’re not just buying the juice inside – you’re paying for the packaging, the marketing, the product’s rarity, and the social prestige it endows. It’s also worth thinking about whether the product is a “team player” when put in mixed drinks. For example, I adore the Catalonian producer Casa Mariol’s sweet vermouth on its own as an aperitif, but have found that it doesn’t work very well in most cocktails that call for sweet vermouth. This kind of knowledge comes down to trial and error, but one simple way to tell if a product might not be a team player is if the product advertising emphasises its novelty or unusualness. The trendy new gin laden with obscure botanicals may taste wonderful in a G&amp;T, but could also ruin your Negroni. If you’re looking to fill a gap in your home liquor cabinet and don’t know what brand to buy, pop into a local bar and ask them what brand they use. The “first-pour” spirits used at good cocktail bars are usually great value for money and will work in a wide variety of mixed drinks. Make it at home: Manhattan The Manhattan is one cocktail that benefits from some thought put into its ingredients. Made with average ingredients according to the now-standard “212” recipe ( two ounces whiskey, one ounce sweet vermouth, two dashes aromatic bitters) hardly wows. Upgrade to a high-proof or cask-strength whiskey, match it with an equally impressive vermouth, and tweak the ratios so the vermouth plays an equal role to the whiskey – and suddenly you have a seriously delicious cocktail. 45ml high-proof whiskey (rye or bourbon) 45ml sweet vermouth 1 dash orange bitters 1 dash aromatic bitters Build ingredients in a mixing glass. Add ice and stir until chilled. Strain into a chilled cocktail coupe. Garnish with a skewered maraschino cherry or a twist of orange peel. 2. Ingredients are more important than equipment If you’re making drinks at home, you’ll need some basic equipment – emphasis here on the basic. While high-quality barware makes mixing drinks a pleasure, it’s not required at home. So skip the expensive equipment and splash out on ingredients instead. I’d much rather drink a martini made with high-quality gin and ultra-fresh vermouth stirred in a jam jar than one made of cheap gin and vermouth left over from a house party four years ago stirred in a Japanese cut-crystal Yarai mixing glass. There are a few areas where it doesn’t pay to skimp on equipment. Firstly, spend money on a decent set of jiggers to measure the booze you pour into cocktails. Accuracy is important: it helps you control how much liquor you and your guests drink, and it means your cocktails are consistent. Look for jiggers that can pour the most common cocktail measurements: 7.5ml (¼ fl oz), 15ml (½ fl oz), 22.5 ml (¾ fl oz) and 30ml (1 fl oz). If you make a lot of cocktails, go for a jigger with a larger capacity – one that measures 45 ml (1½ fl oz) and 60ml (2 fl oz). A bar spoon that measures the industry-standard 5ml in its bowl is also useful, but you can use a metric teaspoon measure in a pinch. If you like cocktails that call for dashes of ingredients that don’t come in bottles with built-in dashers – such as maraschino or absinthe – then a Japanese-style bitters bottle with a dasher top is a useful investment. For the rest: improvise. If you have a clean jam jar with a matching lid and a chopstick, you have all of the equipment you’ll need to make a stirred drink. And a protein shake bottle and a tea strainer can be used in place of a cocktail shaker and strainer. 3. You can’t have a party without ice If you’re invited to a friend’s cocktail party and are unsure what to bring, bring a few bags of ice. A well-made cocktail usually requires a surprisingly large, almost environmentally irresponsible quantity of ice – not just in the glass (for drinks served on the rocks or in collins glasses) but also in the making. Rookie bartenders often underestimate how much ice a cocktail needs, with tepid results. Quality matters too. Make sure the ice you use is fresh (old ice can absorb food odours from its neighbours in the freezer) and made from the purest water available. As bartender Simon Ford puts it, “if a gin or vodka travels to Iceland for its pure water source and you throw a seven-month-old burnt cloudy ice cube that was stuck to a packet of frozen peas in your drink, you just negated the trouble they went through.” The cloudier the ice is, the more impure it is. You don’t have to make your ice cubes from bottled water from an unspoiled exotic locale to get clearer cubes – simply run tap water through a basic water filtration system before freezing for better results. Large, crystal-clear ice cubes have become something of a shibboleth for high-end cocktail bars. If you have the time and patience, you can replicate this kind of ice at home using a technique known as directional freezing – essentially forcing the ice to freeze from the top down, which pushes the water impurities towards the bottom. Several new products, such as Wintersmiths’ ice chest and Tovolo’s clear ice system, do the work for you – but all you really need is a small insulated cooler filled with water, a freezer large enough to contain it, and the patience to break the slab down into smaller chunks. Make it at home: elder fashioned If you have the means to make large blocks of crystal-clear ice, the old-fashioned remains one of the best drinks to deploy them in. This light take on the old-fashioned is not only a doddle to make, but is light in colour, allowing the clear ice to shine through. 60ml dry gin, preferably Plymouth 15ml St-Germain elderflower liqueur 2 dashes orange bitters Build ingredients in a mixing glass. Add ice and stir until chilled. Strain into a tumbler over a large piece of clear ice. Garnish with a twist of grapefruit peel. 4. Shake it like you mean it (and stir like an assassin) There are three fundamental ways to make a cocktail. The easiest is to measure out the ingredients into the glass and add ice – known within the bar industry as “building” a drink. The other ways are to shake the ingredients together with ice or stir the ingredients over ice, then strain the drink off. These latter two techniques sound simple, but require practice and finesse. The rule of thumb for whether to shake or stir a drink has to do with its ingredients. Generally drinks that contain only clear ingredients (spirits, simple syrup, bitters etc) should be stirred, while drinks that contain opaque ingredients or those that need to be fully incorporated into the drink (citrus juices, milk, cream, and eggs) should be shaken. This allows drinks with clear ingredients to remain beautifully limpid, while creating texture and mouthfeel in the shaken drinks. In both cases, use loads of ice – enough to rise above the surface of the drink in the shaker tin or mixing glass. Many rookie bartenders underestimate just how hard a shake needs to be to properly chill and dilute a cocktail. Harry Craddock’s advice to young bartenders from his 1930 Savoy Cocktail Book remains timeless: “Shake the shaker as hard as you can … you are trying to wake [the cocktail] up, not send it to sleep!” Hard here doesn’t necessarily mean fast, but something more like firmly – pushing the ice vigorously back and forth from one end of the shaker to the other. This is easier to accomplish when you’re not fighting gravity – try shaking your cocktail horizontally rather than vertically. Once you’ve shaken for about 10 to 15 seconds, your cocktail is ready to be strained off through a hawthorne strainer and a second fine-mesh strainer (to catch errant chips of ice and citrus pulp). Professional stirring technique is deadly silent. Stirring a cocktail is not like stirring coffee – you’re not aiming to agitate the contents of your mixing glass while stirring. In fact you’re not really “stirring” the drink, but rather pushing the ice through the drink. Start by building your cocktail in the mixing glass and top it off with ice, then place a bar spoon (or chopstick if you’re improvising) between the ice and the inside of the glass. Then, with the spoon handle between the fingers of one hand, move the ice by alternating between pushing and pulling motions. Stirring a drink down to the proper level of chill and dilution takes longer than shaking – about 30 to 45 seconds should do the job. Make it at home: Ramos gin fizz If you want to test your shaking mettle, whip up a Ramos gin fizz. This cocktail is so labour-intensive that its inventor Henry Ramos famously hired a posse of “shaker boys” whose only job was to shake these drinks. It’s a lot of work, but worth the effort. 45ml old tom gin 15ml simple syrup 15ml lime juice 15ml lemon juice 30ml cream 1 egg white 3 drops orange blossom water 30ml soda water Build all ingredients except soda water in a cocktail shaker. Shake without ice to fluff up the egg white and incorporate the cream. Add ice and shake again, vigorously, until well chilled and frothy. Add soda water to a collins glass and gently strain the cocktail over the soda water. Gently top with ice if necessary. No garnish is required, but you can add a slice of orange if you like. 5. Garnish liberally or sparingly – just do it thoughtfully The old bartender’s saying is the customer takes the first sip of their drink with their eyes. This underlines the importance of a cocktail’s presentation – like food, drink is more appealing when it looks good. How much garnish to apply to a drink is a matter of aesthetic taste – some bartenders skew towards over-the-top garnishes, while others eschew all but the most functional of garnishes altogether. It’s worth distinguishing between garnishes that are functional – those that serve a purpose and those that are purely visual. Simpler garnishes tend to have a functional purpose: the twist of lemon peel that floats in a martini or the sprig of mint tucked under the straw in a julep, both of which enhance the taste and smell of the drink. More adventurous garnishes, such as the banana dolphin or artful arrangements of pineapple fronds and edible flowers, tend to be less functional. Of course, there are exceptions to this rule: the beautifully simple sprigs of baby’s breath that Naren Young places in his white Negronis at New York’s Dante add no flavour or aroma to the drink, while the inverted bottle of Underberg that crowns New Yorker Jane Danger’s imperial bulldog cocktail adds a complex aromatic element. For home bartenders, less is often more – you’ll achieve more wow factor with a simple garnish prepared with care than an extravagant one made poorly. You don’t need to do much to make your cocktails insta-worthy: a twist of citrus peel can be jazzed up by trimming its edges with pinking shears rather than a knife; a fresh sprig of an unexpected herb (thyme, basil, sage) can transform the way a drink looks and smells; and a long slice of cucumber can wind its way around the inside of a collins glass. As with the ingredients that go into the drink, opt for high-quality, fresh garnish ingredients wherever possible, especially if the garnish is edible."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/sep/08/australias-politicians-are-late-to-the-marriage-equality-party-but-they-are-finally-arriving","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-07T18:00:16Z","webTitle":"Australia’s politicians are late to the marriage equality party – but they are finally arriving | Gay Alcorn","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/sep/08/australias-politicians-are-late-to-the-marriage-equality-party-but-they-are-finally-arriving","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/sep/08/australias-politicians-are-late-to-the-marriage-equality-party-but-they-are-finally-arriving","fields":{"headline":"Australia’s politicians are late to the marriage equality party – but they are finally arriving","bodyText":"Labor frontbencher and western Sydney MP Tony Burke voted no to legalising same-sex marriage in a parliamentary vote in 2012. He now supports it. Labor’s Jason Clare has admitted he has changed his mind on the issue, and now calls on the Coalition government to “grow a pair” and deal with it in parliament. Liberal minister Josh Frydenberg voted against same-sex marriage five years ago – the party did not give its MPs a conscience vote at the time – but has switched, and now supports allowing same-sex couples to wed. According to research soon to be published in the Australian Journal of Political Science, not a single politician has flipped the other way – nobody who wanted to legalise same-sex marriage in the failed attempt in 2012 now has doubts. By 2016, almost 60% of Labor MPs who voted no (and were still in in parliament) had shifted to supporting same-sex marriage. Of Coalition MPs, 21% had changed their minds. The change has been rapid, but in some ways, so slow. The researchers, Andrea Carson, Shaun Ratcliff and Yannick Dufresne, point out that the issue of same-sex marriage throws up questions about what democracy is: public support for change has been strong in opinion polls for about a decade. In a representative democracy, politicians don’t automatically vote according to the majority view, but on this issue, the research paper concludes, “federal politicians have largely ignored majority opinion” for complex reasons. Their analysis of the more than 600,000 responses to the ABC’s Vote Compass survey during the 2013 election campaign, as well data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics, commercial opinion polls and other sources, found that just one electorate – Maranoa, a vast conservative seat in south-western Queensland including towns such as Roma and Kingaroy – opposed same-sex marriage. Just over half its citizens believed marriage should only be between a man and a woman. And its MP, Liberal National David Littleproud, agrees with them. All other 149 lower house electorates had majority support for change, although some regional seats in Queensland and New South Wales are very tight and only tip over into supportive if undecided voters are included. The electorates of prominent opponents such as Tony Abbott (Warringah in Sydney), Kevin Andrews (Menzies in Melbourne) and Andrew Hastie (Canning in Western Australia) support marriage equality. Warringah, for instance, is one of the most supportive electorates in the country, ranking 14th out of all seats, with about 70% backing marriage equality. Canning is more divided. Yet here we are. Twenty-three other countries, including New Zealand, Canada, Britain, the United States, Germany and France, have legalised same-sex marriage. And Australia has not. Here we are, with a government insisting we have a postal survey on this issue, largely because those politicians who want to deny same-sex couples the right to wed have compelled it. In 2012 the House of Representatives rejected marriage equality by a margin of 98 to 42 – the vote would have been tighter if the Coalition had allowed a conscience vote. The Australian Marriage Equality group says if a vote were held now, it would comfortably pass in both the House and the Senate. The huge data produced by Vote Compass, with statistical weighting to compensate for a survey that was “opt in”, means that for the first time, we have a glimpse about what people in every electorate thinks and to compare that with their representative’s view. The results give insight into why this issue has been so politically polarising – especially for the conservative parties – and why the national parliament has lagged so far behind public opinion. It all started in 2004, says Alex Greenwich, an independent NSW state parliamentarian, co-chairman of Australian Marriage Equality and a gay man who married his partner Victor in Argentina five years ago, a marriage that is not recognised in Australia. It was then prime minister John Howard’s insistence that the Marriage Act be amended to specify that marriage was “the union of a man and a woman to the exclusion of all others”, that spurred Greenwich, now 36, to become actively involved in changing the law. Australian Marriage Equality, a nonpartisan group that campaigns for same-sex marriage, was established that year. “My initial support was based around the fact that I don’t like being told I can’t do something because I’m gay, especially to marry the person you love,” Greenwich says. Labor backed Howard’s amendment, reluctantly. “Labor has made clear we don’t support gay marriage,” said frontbencher Nicola Roxon at the time. It wasn’t until 2011 that Labor’s policy platform was amended to support marriage equality. The Greens have always backed it. Dennis Altman, academic and pioneering gay activist, agrees with Greenwich that Howard’s attempt to delegitimise the marriage of gays who had travelled overseas to wed was the catalyst for a determined campaign to change the law. “It really only became an issue after John Howard made it an issue,” says Altman. “More radical people never saw the importance of marriage, but over the last couple of years because the right has made it so central to the culture wars and have linked it to so many other issues, it has become a totemic issue.” The first public poll on same-sex marriage in Australia is believed to be a Newspoll in June 2004. That found that 38% of respondents were in favour of same-sex marriage and 44% against. Just three years later, opinion polls started to find majority support – Greenwich puts that down to active campaigning by LGBTI groups and the influence of more overseas countries changing their laws. The latest Newspoll in August found 62% in favour, with 32% against and 6% uncommitted. Essential Media has just released a report summarising all its polling on marriage equality since 2010. It showed that support has steadily increased from the low 50s in 2010 to tdeche low 60s now, with most Australians expecting the laws to change in the next few years. Research director Andrew Bunn says the only comparable issue where public opinion has been so out of step with political opinion is assisted dying, where an even higher percentage of people support allowing a terminally ill person assistance to die if they choose. Carson says the research paper, Same-sex marriage debate in Australia: Public opinion and policy congruence, is the first empirical research in this country into legislators’ policy responsiveness to public opinion. Although national opinion is strongly in favour of change, it becomes more complex – particularly for the conservative parties – the more you drill down. “Opposition to same-sex marriage was highest in 2013 in divisions with fewer same-sex couples; a higher average Coalition two-party vote across the 2010 and 2013 elections; lower median ages (suggesting a higher number of families with children); lower household incomes; lower population densities, and a greater proportion of overseas-born residents,” the research paper says. In other words: “Electorates with high levels of opposition to same-sex marriage tend to provide the Coalition with the majority of their two-party vote. Those with lower levels of opposition were more likely to vote Labor.” It isn’t hard to see why the Coalition has been so divided on this – much of its support, particularly in country areas and among older voters and people with strong religious affiliations, have reservations, although they have declined over time. Labor has also been torn in the past, because of its (declining) links to the Catholic church and because immigrants who support the ALP are more likely to be conservative on this issue. Jason Clare’s electorate of Blaxland in western Sydney is among the 10 seats with the highest resistance to same-sex marriage. More than 60% of its people speak a language other than English at home and more than 20% identify as Muslim, making them less likely to be pro marriage equality. Many Coalition members – but not all – have responded to their electorates’ comparative unease. Of the 10 seats where objection to marriage equality is strongest, only one is represented by an MP who is a definite supporter – Jason Clare. Of the 10 electorates with the highest backing for marriage equality (in some seats support is around 90%) every MP approves of same-sex marriage and will vote to change the law, whether the politician is Liberal or Labor. Carson says there is a “status quo bias” in Australia – a temptation to leave things as they are – and that majority approval of same-sex marriage has not been enough for MPs to be convinced. Our major political parties are “interest aggregators” – interest groups such as religious organisations influence political parties on specific issues because they can be relied upon at elections, whatever the general voter might think. “Some of those groups, even though they are a minority, are quite vocal within political parties, which can’t afford to ignore them,” says Carson, a lecturer in political science at the University of Melbourne. “With Labor, most of the MPs have moved to support same-sex marriage. We find there needs to be a certain tipping point before they will shift over and that’s well above the 50% mark. It needs to be up to the 60% range before you start seeing MPs shift. It needs to be much higher (on average) for Coalition MPs. There needs to be overwhelming support before their MPs are prepared to move away from the status quo bias.” The research found that MPs representing electorates where opposition to same-sex marriage was 40% – so well below half – would still tend to resist change. There was still a 95% chance that they would be against same-sex marriage. “It was only once same-sex marriage opposition declined below an estimated 30% … did the probability of a Coalition MP opposing changes to marriage laws drop below 50%, and then only by a small margin.” That explains why many Coalition MPs in big cities representing more educated, more affluent electorates such as prime minister Malcolm Turnbull in the Sydney seat of Wentworth and Kelly O’Dwyer in the Melbourne seat of Higgins, have no resistance to supporting same-sex marriage. Both of those electorates are in the 10 that most strongly support marriage equality, so there is no political risk for their MPs. The other issue is “salience” – people might support marriage equality, but are unlikely to change their vote on it. It was not among the most critical issues for the Vote Compass responders. The Essential report notes that in a 2010 opinion poll, 60% of people did not think it was an important issue compared with others such as the economy and healthcare. (A majority of Green voters did think it was important.) Given the heat over same-sex marriage now, the importance of the issue to voters may have changed. Essential found that those who opposed marriage equality felt more strongly about the issue than those who supported it. This was particularly true for Liberal and National voters, where 48% of those opposed feel very strongly compared with only 16% of those in favour. Carson says her study indicates that same-sex marriage will happen in Australia. “It’s going to be inevitable given that public opinion is slowly overwhelming this status quo bias, but we don’t know when,” she says. “Even within the Coalition, their levels of opposition have fallen over the last four years, which suggest that their MPs are reading the signs.” It has taken a long time to read the signs, but all the signs are all there.

That’s just a fact, plain and simple. People who purchase priority boarding upgrades on low-cost airlines are genuinely worse than the devil. They’re snooty and snobby, and the only way they can distinguish themselves from the unwashed plebs they’re forced to share a plane with is by spending a fiver for the privilege of sitting in it first. They’re people who go on the internet specifically to pretend not to know who Kim Kardashian is. They’re people who sneer in Harvesters. They are the absolute living worst. They’re so bad that they’ve even done the unthinkable and made Ryanair look halfway good. Ryanair, for crying out loud: a company that’s inherently impossible to like. A company that made its name with unremitting unpleasantness as standard, run by a silent-movie baddie on a gap year from tying women to railway lines, has somehow come out of a policy announcement looking decent. Ryanair has just announced its intention to force everyone who uses a wheelie bag as hand luggage to purchase a priority boarding pass. And, well, hooray. On the surface, this is simply to address issues of space. On a plane with 189 seats, they say, there is only enough space in the overhead lockers for 90 bags. But lately, people have been exploiting Ryanair’s two-bag hand luggage policy by dragging both a wheelie bag and an oversized rucksack on with them. If every passenger did this, there’d be 380 bags all competing for a microscopic amount of space. Ryanair’s answer is a simple one: if you really want to bring two big bags on board with you, you’re going to have to pay for them. But really it seems Ryanair is simply doing a sterling piece of detective work. Whether intentionally or not, it’s actually helping to weed out latent speedy boarders. The people who are speedy boarders at heart – the sort of people who ignore the homeless and watch illegally streamed films for free, the sort of people who look at you with a dumb I’d-help-if-I-could expression when you ask for them to move their bag from an empty seat on a crowded train – but can’t commit to paying extra to make their monstrousness explicit, are gradually being edged out into the daylight. And, make no mistake, people who try to cram two big bags into the overhead lockers on planes are the living embodiment of latent speedy boarders. They’re the people who stop the plane taking off on time, causing a bottleneck in the aisle because they’re tutting and wheezing and attempting the aviation equivalent of stuffing a wedding cake into a condom. They could have just placed one of their bags in hold for free like everyone else. But no: that would have taken a maximum of five minutes and the barest trace of consideration for other people, and their convenience isn’t worth that. But now these people have been forced out into the open. If they want to maintain their selfishness, they’re going to have to pay for it. They’re going to have to let everyone else on the plane know upfront what exactly a swaggering pranny they are. The bell will ring in the departure gate, and they’ll announce “Can everyone who labours under the woeful apprehension that they’re somehow better than you please come to the front of the line?”, and the rest of us will watch, silently committing their bovine faces to memory. Honestly, I think Ryanair could have probably gone a little further with this plan. Hopefully its next policy will involve leading the speedy boarders to the plane with a bell-ringing nun who keeps chanting the word “Shame” at them. Or, better yet, special badges for speedy boarders to wear, so that everyone else can single them out and understand the depths of their depravity. Or, you know, slightly bigger overhead lockers. Whichever’s easiest, really. • Stuart Heritage writes on film, TV and music for the Guardian"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"business/2017/sep/07/fca-select-committee-rbs-report-nicky-morgan","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-07T14:02:20Z","webTitle":"Publish leaked RBS report, MPs tell FCA","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/sep/07/fca-select-committee-rbs-report-nicky-morgan","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2017/sep/07/fca-select-committee-rbs-report-nicky-morgan","fields":{"headline":"Publish leaked RBS report, MPs tell FCA","bodyText":"The Financial Conduct Authority is facing pressure from the Treasury select committee of MPs to publish the report into Royal Bank of Scotland’s troubled business restructuring unit. Nicky Morgan, the Conservative MP who chairs the powerful committee, has called on the FCA to publish the report, which was completed last year, after it was leaked to the BBC last week. In a letter to Andrew Bailey, chief executive of the FCA, Morgan said the so-called skilled persons’ report into the activities of the now defunct global restructuring group should be published without delay. It was a topic that had been raised by her predecessor, Andrew Tyrie, who did not stand at the June election. Morgan said: “The FCA told the committee in November 2016 that a full account of the findings from the skilled persons’ report would be published. Nearly a year later, and nearly four years since the report was commissioned, we are still waiting for answers. “The report itself is now in the hands of an unknown number of third parties. The FCA now has no control over the timing or content of further public disclosures from it. The balance has tipped firmly in favour of full publication. I have written to Mr Bailey to urge him to secure the approval of RBS to do so, without delay.” Allegations about the treatment of small businesses in the GRG unit first surfaced in 2013 when Lawrence Tomlinson, a businessman who was an adviser to the then business secretary, Vince Cable, compiled a dossier alleging the bank deliberately wrecked small businesses to make profits. Last year, RBS said it would pay £400m in compensation to customers of the unit, which was closed in 2013. The FCA, which commissioned the skilled persons’ report – paid for by RBS – said it had already initiated a leak inquiry. It said: “We have asked the other parties who had access to the report, namely RBS and Promontory, to do the same. If the Treasury select committee or the BBC have evidence that the document was leaked by the FCA, we encourage them to share that with us.” The FCA said it would respond formally to Morgan’s letter."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"education/2017/sep/14/preparing-for-your-first-year-of-university-live-chat","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-14T13:00:01Z","webTitle":"Preparing for your first year of university – live chat","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2017/sep/14/preparing-for-your-first-year-of-university-live-chat","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/education/2017/sep/14/preparing-for-your-first-year-of-university-live-chat","fields":{"headline":"Preparing for your first year of university – live chat","bodyText":"Your A-levels are behind you, the summer is all but over, and it’s nearly time to start on your university adventure.

Around 2,000 nurses from all over the country congregated in Westminster on Wednesday at a Royal College of Nursing (RCN) protest against the policy that has led to a 14% real-terms cut in the wages of staff in England over the past seven years. Speakers took turns to share stories of how the squeeze had left them and their colleagues living hand to mouth. The RCN president, Cecilia Anim, told the rally in Parliament Square that she had a message “to the people next door”. She said: “For far too long our hard work, our skill, our dedication has been taken for granted by this government … for too long the lives of our friends and colleagues have been blighted. And why? Because our pay has been cut.” Nurses in the crowd, from those just starting out on their careers to others with more experience, told how they were struggling to cope at work because of staff shortages, and at home because of the pay restraint. Billy Nichols, a nurse of 25 years who works at Wrexham Maelor hospital, said: “My disposable income has dropped over the last seven years so it’s a struggle to pay bills, pay the mortgage. There’s been a steady decline in morale and it’s reaching rock bottom.” Cyr Powell, a nurse of 10 years’ experience, who works in Tunbridge Wells, Kent, said: “I still live at home because I can’t physically afford to pay rent and bills and everything else. It’s not all about money, but enough is enough.” Lana Cook, from Scotland, who has just completed her training in Northern Ireland where wages lag even further behind the rest of the UK, said nurses were being driven abroad not just by poor pay prospects but also safety concerns. “A lot of my colleagues are [planning on] getting one or two years under their belt and then going to Australia, New Zealand, Dubai to save for a mortgage. I will probably go abroad if things don’t get better. “I don’t want to come home every night and feel deeply sad because I have not been able to do the job I want to do to the standards I want because there are not enough staff.” The demonstration was timed to begin immediately after the first prime minister’s questions of the new parliamentary year. One speaker reminded the crowd that during the election campaign Theresa May had said there were “complex reasons” nurses were using food banks. A gospel choir sang before and after the speakers, changing the words of the gospel standard Soon Ah Will Be Done (With the Troubles of This World), made famous by Mahalia Jackson, to “soon ah will be done with the troubles of this cap”. Claire Holmes, a nurse in Romford, Essex, attending the demonstration with her husband and two children, enthusiastically joined in with a chant of “scrap the cap”. She told the Guardian her monthly wages lasted barely two weeks. “My daughter says she wants to become a nurse like mummy, but I worry,” she said. “I wouldn’t encourage other people to go into nursing, which is a shame because the job itself is brilliant, but I’ve come to the conclusion we’ll never own our own home, [or] be able to go on a family holiday.” In May, more than 50,000 members of the RCN voted in a poll on pay, with eight out of 10 saying they were prepared to go on strike if the pay cap was not lifted. Almost all the nurses the Guardian spoke to at the demonstration said they were prepared to walk out. Dressed in her scrubs, Emily Meins, a senior staff nurse at St Thomas’ who in March was involved in the response to the terrorist attack on Westminster Bridge, said: “Anything that puts patients at risk is obviously something that goes contrary to my core values, but it’s got to the stage where the government aren’t listening and we’ve got to do something different.” Celebrity support came from the actor Tony Robinson and the comedian Rob Delaney. Robinson told the crowd they had been “consistently slapped in the face” by the government and, channelling Baldrick, the character he played in Blackadder, he said: “We all have a cunning plan, scrap the cap now.” To laughs, Delaney said: “The NHS is a wonderful thing. I mean the doctors, they’re alright, but nurses are the glue that holds everything together.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2017/sep/06/grenfell-tower-inquest-hearings-biruk-haftom","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-06T15:54:51Z","webTitle":"Grenfell Tower inquest hearings continue as investigation slows","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/sep/06/grenfell-tower-inquest-hearings-biruk-haftom","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2017/sep/06/grenfell-tower-inquest-hearings-biruk-haftom","fields":{"headline":"Grenfell Tower inquest hearings continue as investigation slows","bodyText":"Relatives of three people who died in the Grenfell Tower fire hugged and wept as they exchanged condolences at inquest hearings. On Wednesday, the Westminster coroner, Fiona Wilcox, opened and suspended inquests into 12-year-old Biruk Haftom, described by his family as “wise beyond his years”, Raymond Bernard, 63, and Denis Murphy, 56. Wilcox said that 58 victims of the fire had been identified but that the investigation was now slow and identifications were becoming increasingly difficult. All those who had been identified had been on the missing list, she said. At least 80 people died, according to police. Bernard’s remains were recovered from his flat on the 23rd floor of Grenfell Tower and he was identified by dental records. The preliminary cause of death was given as “consistent with the effects of fire”. Bernard – known to his friends as Moses – was “dearly loved by us all and will be sadly missed by many”, his family said in a statement. Wilcox said Bernard’s remains were found along with those of several other people in his flat. One of those was Biruk, who was also identified by dental records. His mother, Berkti Haftom, 29, also died in the fire, and an inquest into her death was opened and suspended in July. The mother and son are believed to have lived on the 18th floor. In a statement released by the Metropolitan police, their family said: “Biruk was a loving, pure-hearted boy, wise beyond his years and known for his politeness, kind heart and his love for his family and friends. Berkti and Biruk left an everlasting legacy full of lovely memories, and their contagious laughter and charisma will live in our hearts forever. “We are deeply hurt and heartbroken our angels were taken from us so cruelly, so young. We will not rest until justice is served.” Murphy’s remains were recovered from the 14th floor, where he was believed to have been trapped by the fire. He was identified by dental records. Last week, his family, originally from Ireland, said: “The pain, loss and sorrow we feel is indescribable and we have been left devastated with a gaping hole in our hearts that can never be filled.” Murphy was “an inspiration and an amazing, selfless, caring person and we feel lucky and blessed that he was part of our family, and his warmth and love will stay with us forever. What really matters to us is what he stood for – family, friends, community, loyalty and love – and our lives will never be the same without him.” At the end of the hearing, relatives of all three victims embraced and shook hands. Wilcox suspended the inquests to allow the public inquiry and criminal investigation to proceed. A preliminary hearing of the public inquiry, chaired by Sir Martin Moore-Bick, a retired judge, is due to take place next week. The inquiry is expected to start hearing evidence in October."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2017/sep/10/building-trust-into-greener-housing-north-west-cambridge-development","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-10T07:00:30Z","webTitle":"North West Cambridge: a model for affordable urban housing?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/sep/10/building-trust-into-greener-housing-north-west-cambridge-development","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/sep/10/building-trust-into-greener-housing-north-west-cambridge-development","fields":{"headline":"North West Cambridge: a model for affordable urban housing?","bodyText":"At the centre of debates about green belts is the question of trust. In theory it should be possible to build on a very small proportion of the nation’s green belts in such a way that affordable housing and sustainable communities are created, and more people have more and better access to nature than before. In practice few people trust that this will happen, as the available evidence is that we will get instead a smearing of developers’ standard products across the countryside, for sale at inflated prices. The promise of what’s called the North West Cambridge Development is that it will indeed achieve these good things. Here the University of Cambridge is turning 150 hectares of what was flat, inaccessible and somewhat featureless farmland, located between the city and the M11, into a billion-pound urban district the area of which is not much smaller than the historic centre of Cambridge itself. Three thousand homes are planned, half of them affordable, plus 2,000 postgraduate student bed spaces, 100,000 sq m of research facilities, and the schools, shops, surgeries and the like needed to sustain them. Two new public parks are being created, one between the new development and the old city, the other a series of lakes and mounds that buffer the sights and sounds of the motorway. The development is motivated by the extreme effects of growth in Cambridge, resulting in house values that have priced out key workers, including researchers and young academics, without which neither university nor city can function. In this way Cambridge acutely experiences pressures felt in other parts of the country, which has put it at the forefront of finding ways to do something about them. Change doesn’t happen quickly: discussions of expansion have been going on since the 1980s, with the current plans in development for over a decade. There is a patent desire to be responsible and exemplary in everything. The North West Cambridge Development sets out to achieve high levels of sustainability, including many photovoltaic cells to gather solar energy, low levels of car use and the recycling of rainwater for irrigation and the flushing of toilets. It has been masterminded by the multinational AECOM, which is one of the largest engineering and design consultancies in the world, with landscapes by Townshend, who have worked on large commercial developments such as King’s Cross in London. An array of well-respected architects have been brought in to design individual buildings: the Stirling prize winners Alison Brooks, Witherford Watson Mann, Wilkinson Eyre and Stanton Williams; Marks Barfield of London Eye fame, the Dutch practice Mecanoo and Muma, best known for their makeover of the Whitworth Art Gallery in Manchester. I am told that they also wanted “young” architects, although these practices are almost entirely led by over-50s. The plan is now taking physical form and, so far, it is doing what it said it would. The first homes have been completed in Eddington, which is the name given to the first phase. Residents have started moving in. A “market square” is complete. A new Sainsbury’s opened last week. A primary school has been open for two years. Swirles Court, housing for the graduate students of Girton College, is also complete. Unusually, in comparison with most commercial developments, it is the affordable housing and the shared facilities, rather then the more profitable high-value homes, that are being built first. Cambridge has never been a throbbing metropolis and its suburbs less so. By the time you get to the environs of north-west Cambridge the city is petering out into detached and semi-detached houses. Yet Eddington is in the form of apartment blocks, three to five storeys high, in density more like an inner suburb of a large Victorian city, with the intention of building a lot of homes without using up too much space. It’s a surprising typology, but it makes sense. The architectural style is bricky, rectangular, austere with a few outbreaks of playfulness. Ludwig Wittgenstein, who spent his last months in nearby Storey’s Way, once praised the plain Georgian terraces of Dublin for having “the good taste to know that they had nothing very important to say”, and the same might be said of this style. Metropolitan types call it the “new London vernacular”, but it turns out it’s at home here too, on the edge of the fens. Its best qualities are its thoughtfulness – the unusually high ceilings in ground-floor flats, the proportions of windows, the use of galleries with expansive views to give access to upper-level flats. The more public buildings loosen up a bit, though not too much. The school, by Marks Barfield, is an elegant flat doughnut with a calm, protected space in the centre. Muma’s nearly complete nursery school and community centre, designed for things like “dance classes or zumba, Brownies or film clubs, fashion shows, weddings or fairs”, will offer a lively inner world of contrasting volumes, while still being quite quiet on the outside. So the overall effect is of a development that is thoughtful and considered but also, even after making due allowance for its unfinished state and the fact that plants need to grow, overdoing its sobriety. Here the landscaping, which should be crucial, is unfortunately the weakest part. It should soften and animate and make places distinctive and sociable. What’s there, all good quality to be sure, has its moments – there’s a nice grassy swale running through the development that’s part of the rainwater system – but it tends towards the generic. The market square (where, for now, no actual markets are planned) is a could-be-anywhere bit of tasteful corporate design, for which some funky benches are not a sufficient antidote. There’s a long straight pedestrian-friendly street that looks promising as a place to congregate, but its hard and rectangular planters are oddly discouraging. The beige Mondrians of paving too often beat the planting. You can’t yet see spaces in which it would be a positive delight for children to play. More fundamentally the distribution of design intelligence is out of whack. In a way that almost always happens in projects of this scale the big efficient companies like AECOM are asked to make the really big decisions, whereas the Stirling prize winners and “young” architects get to play with a fairly limited range of choices about proportion and disposition. If the imagination and skills of the latter had been applied to the orchestration of a potentially rich array of shared spaces, and to an overall idea of the kind of place that is being created, it would have turned North West Cambridge from a good to a world-beating piece of planning. But these weaknesses should not detract from what is likely to be a fundamental success of the development. To the basic question to be asked when building on green belt or any green land – is it better than it would have been had it stayed as fields? – the answer is yes. More people will enjoy richer forms of nature in the new parks than in the past, and many will find homes at high levels of design and sustainability. The clout, wealth and wisdom of the university has been vital in achieving this, but if the model can be followed in other green locations across the country we might find a way to create large numbers of decent homes and respect nature at the same time."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/shortcuts/2017/sep/06/should-you-wash-your-pyjamas-every-day","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-06T15:49:49Z","webTitle":"Should you wash your pyjamas every day?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/shortcuts/2017/sep/06/should-you-wash-your-pyjamas-every-day","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/shortcuts/2017/sep/06/should-you-wash-your-pyjamas-every-day","fields":{"headline":"Should you wash your pyjamas every day?","bodyText":"When did you last wash your pyjamas? A mob of Mumsnetters has worked itself into a lather about whether one’s PJs should be washed after every wear. “Oooh, a laundry thread,” as one forum user succinctly put it: “Get ready for neurotics versus mingers …” It turns out, there really are people who wash their nightwear every day. “People sweat in bed, and many will go to bed without washing, as they shower in the mornings, so that is enough reason for me to wash PJs after one night,” wrote one member of the cleanliness camp. But there are clearly plenty of “mingers” content to wait days or even weeks between washes. A 2015 survey, by the mattress company Ergoflex, of nearly 2,500 people aged between 18 and 30 revealed that men wait 13 nights on average between washes, while women go 17 nights. A key determinant of how long people will put off purging their PJs appears to be the pong factor: 41% of women and 50% of men said that if their nightwear didn’t smell, they didn’t see why it needed washing. So, which side is right? Over to Prof Sally Bloomfield, chair of the International Scientific Forum on Home Hygiene. “We all carry certain organisms that are potentially harmful to us if we get them in the wrong place and are potentially harmful to other people if they get transferred to them,” she says. “Why do we launder in the first place? Because we don’t want other people to get those organisms.” Such bugs include skin bacteria, one of which is Staphylococcus aureus, a common cause of skin infections; fungal organisms such as the one responsible for athlete’s foot; faecal bacteria, such as E coli, which occasionally cause stomach upsets; and yeast, which can trigger thrush. Bloomfield, who, for the record, says she wears nothing in bed, washes her sheets approximately once a week – although she shares a house with only one other person, her husband, which is a crucial determining factor. Some people are more vulnerable to infections, while others are a more potent source of dangerous bugs. If you live with young children, or someone in your family is obviously ill, the need for regular laundering of bedclothes is more pressing, she says. Garments should be washed at 60C or at 40C with a product containing active oxygen bleach, in order to remove and destroy bacteria. Overloading your washing machine – as you might if you were trying to wash a family of five’s pyjamas, plus everything else each morning – will not do the job and may simply spread the bugs further afield. Plus, some nasties – including the bug responsible for norovirus – can survive on dry fabrics for weeks. So, what of the stereotypical bachelor, happily stewing for weeks in a single pair of underpants? Here, the risk is lower, says Bloomfield, because our own organisms usually start to threaten our health only if they get into the wrong places. “The dirtier your pyjamas get, the more likely it is that things will be transferred from your bowel to your urinary tract, for example. You can’t say there’s no risk, but the risk is relatively low.” There is, however, the issue of personal hygiene to consider. “Your underwear or pyjamas will start to become nasty smelling, and nasty feeling if you don’t wash them regularly.” As for what constitutes regularity, Bloomfield suggests once a week is adequate, unless your pyjamas - or whatever else your body comes into contact with - is visibly soiled. You can, of course, wash them more often, but there is the environment to consider: washing and drying a load every two days generates around 440kg of CO2e each year – equivalent to flying from London to Glasgow and back. And, if you dry your clothes by sticking them on the radiators or indoor drying racks, you risk creating the moist conditions in which mould thrives – another health risk. In other words: at ease, mingers."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"film/2017/sep/10/it-review-enthusiastic-cine-literate-stephen-king-adaptation","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-10T08:00:31Z","webTitle":"It review – enthusiastic, cine-literate retelling of Stephen King’s horror novel","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/sep/10/it-review-enthusiastic-cine-literate-stephen-king-adaptation","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2017/sep/10/it-review-enthusiastic-cine-literate-stephen-king-adaptation","fields":{"headline":"It review – enthusiastic, cine-literate retelling of Stephen King’s horror novel","bodyText":"“It’s summer, we’re supposed to be having fun. This isn’t fun – it’s scary and disgusting!” It, Stephen King’s 1986 novel about a shape-shifting demon that terrorises the town of Derry, Maine, was memorably filmed for TV in 1990. Boasting a mesmerising star turn by Tim Curry as the malevolent dancing clown, Pennywise, Tommy Lee Wallace’s mini-series became every coulrophobe’s worst nightmare, rivalling Tobe Hooper’s Salem’s Lot for the title of best small-screen King adaptation. Now, the Argentinean director Andy Muschietti, who directed 2013’s creepy Mama, brings a touch of widescreen gloss to King’s enduring horror-adventure. Drawing heavily on such 80s screen favourites as Poltergeist and The Goonies (both of which were co-written/produced by Steven Spielberg), this latest incarnation will resonate with audiences hooked on the nostalgic weirdness of Netflix’s Stranger Things. The chills may be more funhouse than frightful, but Muschietti’s tangible affection for the misfit schoolkids at the centre of this story draws us into their world, lending engaging weight to their (pre)adolescent trials and tribulations. Tackling only the early years of King’s chunky source, this “Chapter One” (a sequel is due to follow) relocates the coming-of-age section of the novel from the 50s to the late 80s. Here, poor Georgie Denbrough is dragged into a storm drain by the evil Pennywise (Bill Skarsgård, ably filling Curry’s oversize clown shoes). Riddled with guilt and grief, Georgie’s older brother Bill (Jaeden Lieberher, who shone in Midnight Special), becomes obsessed with finding the lost boy. As the summer vacation of ’89 rolls around, and yet more youngsters disappear, a group of variously bullied “Losers” embark upon a Stand By Me-style quest through the woods and into the sewers, in search of a mythical monster. Significantly, each of our key characters is haunted by nightmarish apparitions that feed upon their individual fears. Mike (Chosen Jacobs) sees visions of fiery tragedy that chime with suppressed memories of childhood trauma; Stanley (Wyatt Oleff) is distracted from his bar mitzvah rehearsals by a chaotic face that leers at him from a painting; hypochondriac Eddie (Jack Dylan Grazer) is pursued by “a walking infection” that seems to embody his mother’s overprotective fantasies. As for Sophia Lillis’s abused but strongly self-sufficient Beverly (“Who invited Molly Ringwald into the group?”), her Carrie-like anxieties manifest in a bloody eruption that owes less to the lift sequence from The Shining than to Johnny Depp’s demise in A Nightmare on Elm Street. With his gangly arms and marionette gait, Skarsgård’s wall-eyed killer clown resembles a baby-faced relative of Freddy Krueger. No surprise, then, that A Nightmare on Elm Street 5 is seen playing at the local cinema. This is a self-reflexively cine-literate world, in which posters for Gremlins and Beetlejuice hang on children’s walls, and the gateway to the monster’s lair resembles Norman Bates’s home from Psycho. In one bravura sequence, the kids use a slide projector to mount their own movie show, which is promptly hijacked by Pennywise in the manner of the spectral Sadako from Ring. Cinematographer Chung Chung-hoon, who has worked regularly with Park Chan-wook, keeps his cameras gliding elegantly around the action, lending an epic cinematic sweep to the widening horizons of youth. While TV screens burble satirically about having fun with your friends in the sewer, the Losers get involved in outdoor rock fights and bike chases as exuberant as anything from ET. For all its horror trappings, this is still a story in which battles with the supernatural can be abruptly curtailed when your mom turns up unexpectedly. Even the bullies are children at heart. River Phoenix-lookalike Nicholas Hamilton’s Henry may be the knife-wielding scourge of our antiheroes, but a scene in which he is humiliated by his boorish father (“nothing like a little fear to make a paper man crumble”) reminds us that his anger has been passed down through generations, a recurrent King theme. Flitting between crooked nursery crime chimes and lush orchestral themes, composer Benjamin Wallfisch creates an emotionally resonant score to accompany Muschietti’s blend of scares and sentimentality. The result is an energetic romp with crowd-pleasing appeal that isn’t afraid to bare its gory teeth. While it may not be as frightening as some hardened horror fans desire, the archetypal terrors and fundamental friendships of King’s source are slickly transferred to the screen with a ghoulish enthusiasm that proves hard to resist."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"global-development/2017/sep/07/indian-girl-13-allowed-abortion-supreme-court-ruling-doctors-afraid-to-help-child-rape-victims","type":"article","sectionId":"global-development","sectionName":"Global development","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-07T12:43:18Z","webTitle":"Indian girl allowed abortion amid claims doctors ‘afraid to help’ child rape victims","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2017/sep/07/indian-girl-13-allowed-abortion-supreme-court-ruling-doctors-afraid-to-help-child-rape-victims","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2017/sep/07/indian-girl-13-allowed-abortion-supreme-court-ruling-doctors-afraid-to-help-child-rape-victims","fields":{"headline":"Indian girl allowed abortion amid claims doctors ‘afraid to help’ child rape victims","bodyText":"The Indian supreme court has ruled that a 13-year-old rape victim in Mumbai who was left pregnant after the attack can have a termination. It follows a landmark ruling last month that said doctors should make greater effort to support victims of sexual assault regardless of the country’s abortion laws. On 25 August, the court ruled that precious time was lost, and added distress caused, to girls and their families when they were forced to bring their individual cases to court. Doctors have been criticised as being far too fearful when dealing with the victims of child rape. The girl in Mumbai is eight months pregnant, but her condition was only discovered last month, when her parents took her to a doctor. The court ruling was accompanied by an order instructing hospitals to establish a medical board to investigate and determine such cases, avoiding the need for legal hearings. “The inference is clearly that the judges are saying that to decide these cases, they have to consult doctors for their opinion – so why can’t hospitals with doctors take the decision themselves?” said senior lawyer Indira Jaising, who welcomed the order but said its success would depend on effective implementation. “The law as it stands isn’t understood properly by doctors. They are afraid to help victims for fear of criminal prosecution. But it is a given that a minor girl’s pregnancy is life-threatening because her body simply isn’t ready to give birth, so doctors don’t need to worry about interpretations of the law and don’t need court orders to carry out a termination.” Police have arrested the girl’s father’s business partner on suspicion of rape. The parents tried to arrange an abortion but doctors told them it was illegal. India does not allow terminations after 20 weeks unless there is a threat to the mother’s life. “They were absolutely shattered when I told them,” said the family’s GP, Dr Nikhil Datar in Mumbai. “She had been complaining of nausea, sleepiness, inability to concentrate and pain but they assumed the symptoms, along with her weight gain, were the result of some thyroid issue. “They had no idea she could be pregnant. They didn’t want to tell her but it was my duty to inform the police and obviously, in the course of being questioned, she realised that she was pregnant,” Datar said. After she was denied an abortion,the family went to the supreme court where, after hearing the opinion of doctors, judges said on Wednesday that the pregnancy could be terminated. In July, the supreme court intervened in a similar case in Chandigarh, where the parents of a 10-year-old girl who had been raped by her uncle sought a termination. In this case, the court accepted medical opinion that the procedure would be too risky for such a young child so far into a pregnancy. The girl has since given birth by caesarean section. She was not told she was pregnant. Her parents said to her that a stone in her stomach had to be removed. The baby was taken away for adoption. But in May, the court allowed a 10-year-old rape victim in Haryana to abort her foetus at 21 weeks. Sangeeta Rege of the Society for Nutrition, Education and Health Action, a Mumbai-based NGO that works with rape survivors, is critical of what she calls the “defensive practices” of doctors. She said medics fear that if they perform abortions, they will be jailed under a law that says anyone who causes a woman to miscarry in bad faith, or for any other reason except to save her life, will be punished. Yet the clause on miscarriage only applies to women, not girls. Rege said: “The silence of doctors on this is total. It is well within their power, under the law, to help minor girls and spare them the trauma of running around the courts – and don’t forget there are many who cannot afford to go to the courts – but refuse to do so out of baseless fears of prosecution.” Datar echoed that view: “They are worried that someone may challenge their decision to terminate and they are not prepared to take that risk.” The 13-year-old Mumbai girl will have her pregnancy terminated on Friday. Government data shows 10,000 cases of rape or sexual assaults in India against minors in 2015 (pdf)."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2017/sep/07/tackling-health-anxiety-could-save-nhs-over-400m-a-year-study-finds","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-06T23:01:44Z","webTitle":"Tackling health anxiety could save NHS over £400m a year, study finds","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/sep/07/tackling-health-anxiety-could-save-nhs-over-400m-a-year-study-finds","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2017/sep/07/tackling-health-anxiety-could-save-nhs-over-400m-a-year-study-finds","fields":{"headline":"Tackling health anxiety could save NHS over £400m a year, study finds","bodyText":"The NHS could save more than £420m a year by offering treatment for health anxiety and “cyberchondria”, a psychological ailment caused by people obsessively looking up their symptoms online, a study has estimated. The study, funded and published by the National Institute for Health Research, said the savings could be made just on the costs of care in hospital outpatient departments, with research showing health anxiety fades and stays away after a course of therapy. A team including researchers from Imperial College London and King’s College London are now calling for health anxiety to be more widely recognised as a condition and for the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice) to produce guidelines on managing it. The team estimates that at least one in five people attending hospital outpatient appointments suffers from health anxiety, although only one in 10 are ever diagnosed. Many have recovered from a serious illness such as a heart attack or cancer and believe it is going to happen again. Symptoms such as chest pain and headaches persist even when doctors tell patients there is nothing wrong. They believe the worst possible scenarios they read online and repeatedly return for tests. Dr Helen Tyrer, one of the study’s authors, told of the manager of a big company who was driving home when he felt very unwell. He phoned his wife and asked her to call an ambulance, which arrived as he reached his house. “He walked into the kitchen and had a cardiac arrest,” said Tyrer. His action in calling the ambulance saved his life, she said. After treatment he was well, but so anxious that he could not return to his job. “Every time he got a headache he went to A&amp;E. He didn’t go to work for six months,” she said. In a trial of cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) he did “incredibly well” and he was now back at work and leading a normal life. Another man in the trial had been discharged from hospital after a heart attack and was terrified it would happen again. “He wouldn’t go out of the house to feed his chickens,” said Tyrer. “His wife gave up her job.” The researchers found him in a hospital waiting room, just discharged after six months as apparently fine. “He clearly wasn’t,” she said. In the trial, involving 444 patients, even those who were not given therapy but who had health anxiety explained to them got somewhat better, at least in the short term. “By explaining health anxiety, it makes a difference to the symptoms and has an impact on patients’ behaviour,” said Peter Tyrer, a professor of community psychiatry at Imperial, lead author and the husband of Helen Tyrer. These were not strictly the “worried well”, said the researchers. They had been ill and had genuine symptoms, even if they were sometimes psychosomatic. In the trial they saw a doctor, such as a cardiologist, who would assess the physical symptoms alongside a psychiatrist or psychologist who would assess their anxiety. They might be prescribed breathing or relaxation exercises for their pain, alongside CBT for the anxiety. Remarkably for a mental health study, the patients given CBT were still doing well five years later. The researchers are calling for Nice to assess the intervention and issue guidelines to the NHS, in the hope that it will be adopted in all hospital trusts. Yvonne Lisseman Stones, a general nurse at Sherwood Forest Hospitals NHS foundation trust, who worked on the study, said it was the project that had given her the most satisfaction in her 40 years of nursing, “simply because it changes lives”. She said: “One of my patients had stopped all physical activity because of severe health anxiety, but after therapy was able to climb Mount Snowdon, where he wrote to me and said ‘thank you for making me feel on top of the world’.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2017/sep/06/daca-what-has-been-the-reaction-from-conservative-thinkers","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-06T16:06:30Z","webTitle":"Daca: what has been the reaction from conservative thinkers?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/sep/06/daca-what-has-been-the-reaction-from-conservative-thinkers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/sep/06/daca-what-has-been-the-reaction-from-conservative-thinkers","fields":{"headline":"Daca: what has been the reaction from conservative thinkers?","bodyText":"It has been reported that the Donald Trump may not himself understand all the implications of yesterday’s repeal of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (Daca), President Obama’s executive order granting residency to the children of undocumented immigrants. If that’s true, it’s odd that conservative media appear to know exactly what he is trying to do. On the whole, Americans are well-disposed to the idea that children brought here by their parents should be allowed to stay. Not so the hardcore Republican base, many of whom still obstinately support a president that the electorate has abandoned. Trump’s move – which punishes immigrants, trashes Obama’s legacy, and outrages liberals – serves to buy the continued loyalty of that small segment of the American public which has not yet abandoned him, and that of their tribunes in conservative media. The latter, apart from a few exceptions among libertarians, have spent the last day gearing up to defend what so many of their compatriots see as indefensible. It’s up to Congress to save the Dreamers Donald Trump just threw under the bus Publication Reason Author Shikha Dalmia is a writer for Reason, and a senior analyst at the Associated Reason Institute. Immigration is just one of the topics she regularly takes on there, and in other outlets like the Week. Why you should read it The pro-immigration libertarians at Reason have not been well pleased by the Daca moves. Their set of concerns about hardline immigration policy are different from those of progressives – partly, they proceed from the impact that lessened labour market flexibility would have on their corporate sponsors. But they can also see that any move down the line to enforce the consequences of Daca repeal could easily become an authoritarian nightmare. Dalmia worries that Trump’s “morally reprehensible” move, and the politics surrounding it, are all heading in one direction: enhanced powers for the state and its agencies. Extract “Trump’s move today seems designed to give the immigration hardliners in Congress vital ammunition to hold the fate of Dreamers hostage in order to extract concessions on enforcement action – funding to build the Great Wall of Trump, more appropriations for border patrol agents, etc. Indeed, immigration advocates who’ve approaching congressional Republicans for legislative action are finding little willingness among them to move anything Dreamer-related unless it’s tied to enforcement. The question is whether they’ll settle for a modest or a large “pound” of flesh.” Fourteen things the MSM won’t tell you about Daca Publication Breitbart Author John Nolte quit as Breitbart’s media critic in the wake of Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski’s manhandling of Breitbart’s Michelle Fields, and the website’s weak response. He’s just returned in the last week – not long after Steve Bannon made his way back to the helm after leaving the White House. Why you should read it Nolte got this piece out suspiciously quickly after Jeff Sessions’s announcement. Under the guise of addressing “media lies”, he sets out the earliest iteration of what we can expect to be the nationalist right’s DACA talking points. The piece relies heavily on blaming Dreamer parents, and the idea that Dreamers are taking “American jobs”. Extract “Then there is illegal immigration, which, like abortion, the MSM treats as its own personal sacrament. Flooding America, primarily Red States, with illegal Democrats who also serve the interests of a Big Business Complex desperate to keep wages low and unions non-existent, there is nothing our corrupt media will not do to keep that illegal flood flooding.” The politics of the Daca fix Publication National Review Author Fred Bauer is a conservative blogger and opinion writer who is well practiced in affecting the clubby, National Review-style civility when discussing issues like the possible deportation of hundreds of thousands of people. With that said he’s no dill, and this survey of the politics of Daca on the conservative side is worth reading. Why you should read it Bauer thinks that immigration reform could well be a lose-lose for congressional Republicans. They can either destroy a popular program, or retain some of its measures at the cost of alienating their anti-immigrant base. (The more feral sectors of conservative media will most certainly go nuts about the “establishment” making concessions that look to them like “amnesty”). His advice is to pass a bill that makes some concessions on reform, but steps up enforcement. If that’s the best they can do, we’re still in for a wave of deportations from a newly empowered Ice. Extract “Thus, a stand-alone Dream Act hurts Republicans whether it succeeds or fails. In a politically polarized time, depressing the grassroots probably harms the GOP’s midterm chances more than disappointing some swing voters does, but both inflict a cost. Perhaps the surest way to mitigate these political dangers is to bundle the Dream Act with immigration reforms that measurably advance conservative goals on immigration. What would these conservative goals be? One would be improving immigration enforcement. But an enforcement-only approach to immigration misses the broader importance of reforming the structure of the legal-immigration system. As Reihan Salam has suggested, conservatives should try to reform the immigration system so that it helps immigrants become equal partners in American society and ameliorates rather than exacerbates social divisions.” Political theater or not, rescinding Daca is the right thing to do Publication The Federalist Author David Harsanyi’s long career as a conservative opinionator includes his current senior editorship at the Federalist, his editorship of Human Events, and an op-ed column in the Denver Post. Why you should read it Harsanyi mobilizes the argument that the right can be expected to continue to regard as a trump card: Daca, an executive action by President Obama, was itself unconstitutional, and an excessive use of presidential power. It hasn’t been struck down by any courts yet, but given the current configuration of the courts, it might. None of this addresses the problem that Daca was an attempt to solve, which is largely of the right’s making. There are a large number of people living in America and who may wind up being deported because the nativist core of the Republican base won’t allow its legislators to carry out any kind of immigration reform, and want Obama’s legacy expunged. We’re stuck in the same place we were for the entirety of the previous administration. Extract: “There are a vast number of solid economic and moral arguments for legalizing the children of illegal immigrants. In substance, I agree with Daca. Yet, the justification given by the president and his allies at the time was summed up best by the Washington Post’s Eugene Robinson, who then argued that the “only reason President Obama has to act on immigration reform is that House Speaker John Boehner won’t.” Hysterical attacks on Trump for rescinding Daca are just hype Publication Infowars Author Alex Jones Why you should watch it: This is the red-meat counterpart to more genteel pieces like Harsanyi’s. Whether the latter likes it or not, he’s on a unity ticket with Alex Jones and his audience, who simply don’t like immigrants and want to repudiate Obama. The only difference is that Jones cannot countenance the idea that Trump might do anything wrong.

But she saves plenty of fire for her Democratic challenger Bernie Sanders, former FBI director James Comey and even vice-president Joe Biden. She also, of course, excoriates the man who beat her, Donald Trump, and forcefully defends the man who cheated on her with an affair that disgraced his presidency, Bill Clinton. And she mildly scolds Barack Obama. What Happened reportedly gets as close as anything yet to the real Hillary Clinton beneath the candidate and what led to perhaps the most shocking result in a presidential election in modern times. Clinton’s take on her campaign, at 494 pages, will be published by Simon &amp; Schuster on 12 September, but CNN said it bought an advance copy from a store in Jacksonville, Florida, and reported on excerpts on Tuesday. Other extracts, previously broadcast by MSNBC, revealed that Clinton considered telling Donald Trump “Back up, you creep!” during one of the presidential debates. She said her “skin crawled” when he invaded her personal space. She writes in her new book: “I go back over my own shortcomings and the mistakes we made. I take responsibility for all of them. You can blame the data, blame the message, blame anything you want – but I was the candidate. It was my campaign. Those were my decisions.” She admits she badly misjudged the environment in which she was running and the candidate she was running against, according to CNN. She writes: “I think it’s fair to say that I didn’t realize how quickly the ground was shifting under all our feet. I was running a traditional presidential campaign with carefully thought-out policies and painstakingly built coalitions, while Trump was running a reality TV show that expertly and relentlessly stoked Americans’ anger and resentment.” Clinton recalls the euphoria of her last full day of campaigning. During their final event together, Barack Obama hugged her and whispered, “You’ve got this. I’m so proud of you.” Then in the early hours of 9 November, Obama urged Clinton to concede to Trump, not string things out. The phone call was “one of the strangest moments” of her life. “I congratulated Trump and offered to do anything I could to make sure the transition was smooth,” she writes. “It was all perfectly nice and weirdly ordinary, like calling a neighbor to say you can’t make it to his barbecue. It was mercifully brief. I was numb. It was all so shocking.” Clinton says sexism hampered her ability to connect with voters. “What makes me such a lightning rod for fury? I’m really asking. I’m at a loss. I think it’s partly because I’m a woman,” she writes. She also admits suffering from an inability to speak her mind on the campaign trail. She pinpointed her comment during a CNN town hall about putting coal miners out of business as the misstep “I regret the most.” Clinton also reiterated that it was “dumb” of her to use a private email server when she was secretary of state. But she criticises Sanders, her opponent in the Democratic primaries, who ran her to the wire with a huge wave of popular support behind his calls for a socialist-style revolution. “He didn’t get into the race to make sure a Democrat won the White House, he got in to disrupt the Democratic party,” she writes. “He isn’t a Democrat. That’s not a smear, that’s what he says. I’m proud to be a Democrat and I wish Bernie was, too. “Every time I wanted to hit back against Bernie’s attacks, I was told to restrain myself. My team kept reminding me that we didn’t want to alienate Bernie’s supporters. President Obama urged me to grit my teeth and lay off Bernie as much as I could. I felt like I was in a straitjacket. “Nonetheless, his attacks caused lasting damage, making it harder to unify progressives in the general election and paving the way for Trump’s ‘Crooked Hillary’ campaign.” She is generous with her praise for many party colleagues and those who campaigned for her. But she questions criticism she received from former vice-president Biden, who is still viewed by some as a contender for 2020. “Joe Biden said the Democratic party in 2016 “did not talk about what it always stood for – and that was how to maintain a burgeoning middle class,’” Clinton writes. “I find this fairly remarkable, considering that Joe himself campaigned for me all over the midwest and talked plenty about the middle class.” But it was then-FBI director James Comey’s October revival of her email troubles that holed her campaign below the waterline, she writes, after he wrote a letter telling Congress he was looking into freshly discovered emails relating to her use of a private server while at the state department. “Comey’s letter turned that picture upside down,” Clinton writes, turning her image from a steady leader to one compromised by scandal. Meanwhile, during passages about Russia’s meddling in the election, she wonders whether a more forceful public response from then-president Barack Obama could have changed matters. In her personal life, she describes her marriage to Bill as one with “many, many more happy days than sad or angry ones” and talks at length about their loving relationship, despite hearing time and again even on the 2016 campaign trail that it was “just a marriage on paper now.” Looking back to the scandals of the 1990s, when he had an affair with White House intern Monica Lewinsky, which led to his impeachment, and accusations by several women of sexual impropriety, she writes: “There were times that I was deeply unsure about whether our marriage could or should survive, but I asked myself the questions that mattered to me: do I still love him? And can I still be in this marriage without becoming unrecognizable to myself – twisted by anger, resentment, or remoteness? The answers were always yes.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/sep/06/hurricane-irma-storm-damage-caribbean-florida","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-07T06:05:19Z","webTitle":"Death toll rises as 'apocalyptic' Irma wreaks havoc across Caribbean","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/sep/06/hurricane-irma-storm-damage-caribbean-florida","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/sep/06/hurricane-irma-storm-damage-caribbean-florida","fields":{"headline":"Death toll rises as 'apocalyptic' Irma wreaks havoc across Caribbean","bodyText":"The death toll from Hurricane Irma, the most powerful storm ever recorded in the Atlantic Ocean, has risen to eight as the category 5 storm advanced across the northern Caribbean towards the US mainland on early Thursday morning. Irma’s 185mph winds and 20ft storm surge left the French part of the island of St Martin “95% destroyed”, according to a local official, with six people reported killed. The death of a two-year-old child was confirmed in Barbuda, where the monster storm first made landfall at 1.47am on Wednesday, as well as one fatality on British-controlled Anguilla. American authorities ordered mandatory evacuations from Miami Beach and other areas of Miami-Dade county, effective Thursday morning local time, as the US National Hurricane Center said it was increasingly likely Irma would strike Florida by Sunday afternoon. The record-breaking hurricane moved over Puerto Rico on Wednesday night, leaving 965,000 people without power and 50,000 without water. 14 of the island’s hospitals were left running on emergency power. The Antigua and Barbuda prime minister, Gaston Browne, said 60% of the island’s 1,400 people were now homeless after 90% of structures were destroyed. In French-controlled St Martin, the northern section of the island that is split with the Netherlands-administered St Maarten, officials said government buildings were destroyed and roofs ripped from homes in St Barts, areas of which remained under water. Michel Magras, senator for St Barts, said in a text to a media company in France that the island had suffered a catastrophe. “I am shocked by the monster that covers us,” he wrote. “The island is devastated. It is apocalyptic, a lot of damage, many roofs destroyed.” Gerard Collomb, the French interior minister, observed that the four wrecked government buildings in St Martin were the sturdiest on the island, “which means that more rustic structures have probably been completely or partially destroyed”. From the Dutch half of the island, known as St Maarten, video posted on social media showed yachts smashed together in a marina and cars submerged in several feet of water. Dutch interior minister Ronald Plasterk said he believed the destruction on the island was “enormous”. Elsewhere across the region, including in the British overseas territory of Anguilla, power cuts were widespread and tens of thousands of people remained in shelters. The first damage assessments from the northern Leeward Islands emerged as Irma continued its record-breaking westerly march, lashing the British and US Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico on Wednesday afternoon. In Puerto Rico, thousands were taking haven in shelters opened by city authorities in San Juan and across the island. Carmen Yulín Cruz, the mayor of the capital, said such voluntary action was a sign of how on-edge islanders were about the storm, the eye of which was expected to come within 50 or 60 miles. “This is the first time since I became mayor almost five years ago that people have come to the shelters without anyone have to ask,” she said. “People are concerned, they are scared. Puerto Ricans cannot fathom what a category 5 hurricane is about – it’s something we’ve never heard of.” The mayor was speaking to the Guardian from her home in San Juan without any electricity – large parts of the city and surrounding towns had been cut off from power in advance of Irma in order to try to protect the island’s grid. “Power infrastructure is very, very fragile and we are expecting to be without power for the next four to six months,” she said. The hurricane is the strongest Atlantic storm ever outside the Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico and the most powerful since Hurricane Wilma, which tore into south Florida in 2005. By Thursday morning, Irma had also recorded winds at its eyewall at 180mph or greater for more than 33 successive hours – another record. Next in its path on Thursday are the Dominican Republic, Haiti, Cuba and the southern Bahamas. In its 5pm advisory Wednesday, the US National Hurricane Centre (NHC) in Miami warned that Irma was then expected to take a hard turn to the north, lining up an increasingly likely strike on southern Florida, home to 7 million people, by Sunday afternoon. “Irma is a very powerful, very dangerous storm,” said Michael Brennan, a senior hurricane specialist at the NHC. “It’s a scary sight to see this kind of system affecting people. “It’s a very dangerous situation for the Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico and much of the Bahamas, and everyone on the Florida peninsula and in the Florida Keys will want to keep an eye on this.” Donald Trump approved a request from the Florida governor Rick Scott to declare a state of emergency, adding to declarations for Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands. In a tweet, Trump said he had spoken to Scott and the governors of the US territories. “We are w/ you all,” the president wrote, following earlier tweets in which he promised the support of the federal government in recovery efforts. By late afternoon on Wednesday, more than 25,000 people had responded to a mandatory evacuation of the Florida Keys, the 100-mile chain of low-lying islands that lies south of the mainland. On Wednesday evening, officials said that all hospitals in the Keys would close by 7 am Friday. Authorities also ordered the evacuation of coastal areas from Miami to north of Fort Lauderdale, fearing the effects of a considerable storm surge. Traffic quickly filled I-95 and I-75, the two major highways north. At an earlier briefing, Scott said he had ordered 7,000 members of the state national guard to report for duty and had lifted tolls on state highways to ease evacuations. “Get prepared, know your evacuation route,” he said. “This storm has the potential to devastate our state and we need to take it very seriously.” The NHC continued to warn of the dangers from the storm surge on coastlines along Irma’s expected path. In Puerto Rico, a team of scientists from the US Geological Survey installed nine storm-tide sensors to measure the height and intensity of the hurricane’s surge. “The researchers will assess beach erosion, overwash or inundation at local level and along the entire coastal zone in the hurricane’s path,” the agency said in a statement."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/sep/29/feel-good-ink-cocktail-recipe-tequila-campari-vermouth-company-below-soho-london-w1","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-29T15:00:06Z","webTitle":"Cocktail of the week: Company Below’s recipe for Feel Good Ink","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/sep/29/feel-good-ink-cocktail-recipe-tequila-campari-vermouth-company-below-soho-london-w1","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/sep/29/feel-good-ink-cocktail-recipe-tequila-campari-vermouth-company-below-soho-london-w1","fields":{"headline":"Cocktail of the week: Company Below’s recipe for Feel Good Ink","bodyText":"So named because a couple of these are guaranteed to make you, er, feel good, no matter what the working day has thrown at you.

Happy music boosts imaginative thinking, say researchers","bodyText":"Jack London hunted it down with a club. Graham Greene found it on benzedrine. For Mary Godwin it struck one wet summer night after making up ghost stories with Lord Byron and her husband-to-be, Percy Shelley. Artists have relied on muses, nature, drink and drugs to fuel their creativity, but according to new research there may be another way to boost imaginative thinking: a blast of happy music. According to psychologists, uplifting music can help people think more flexibly and avoid getting stuck in a creative rut. Simone Ritter from Radboud University in Nijmegen and Sam Ferguson at the University of Technology in Sydney decided to test the power of music by setting 155 people in their late teens and twenties a series of puzzles to tackle in silence or while listening to classical scores ranked as either calm, happy, anxious or sad. The psychologists scored the volunteers on two measures of creativity. The first, known as convergent thinking, calls for deep thought, accuracy and logic, and can help people reach the single best answer to a given problem. Ritter and Ferguson used a number of tests to measure convergent thinking, including what is known as the Duncker candle test, in which a person must work out how to fix a candle to a wall and light it without wax dripping onto a table below. The second measure of creativity, known as divergent thinking, is needed to come up with original ideas: ones that connect previously disparate ideas, for example, or which use information in radical new ways. To measure divergent thinking, the participants sat a test called the Alternative Uses Task, which scores people on the uses they can find for a common object, in this case a household brick. Music turned out to have no effect on convergent thinking. But when compared to sitting in silence, listening to happy music boosted people’s scores on divergent thinking from an average of 76 to 94. In the study, that meant more and better ideas came from people who listened to Vivaldi’s uplifting Four Seasons, than from those who heard Samuel Barber’s sad Adagio for Strings; Holst’s anxious Mars movement from The Planets; or the calm Carnival of the Animals by Camille Saint-Saëns. Writing in the journal Plos One, the psychologists speculate that happy music can boost creativity by helping people to think more flexibly. “When getting stuck in a rut, it can be helpful, instead of digging deeper, to dig elsewhere,” they note. It is not only artists who could benefit from happy music, the authors add. “Music listening can be easily integrated into daily life,” they write, and may boost imaginative thinking in “scientific, educational and organisational settings when creative thinking is needed.” And a boost is certainly needed, the authors claim. In their report, Ritter and Ferguson describe creativity as the “driving force behind scientific, technological and cultural innovation” and “one of the key competences” for the 21st century.”. “The problems we face in our complex and fast-changing world more than ever demand creative thinking. However, we are in a creativity crisis; people in general are thinking less creatively than before,” they write. There is more research to be done. In future work, the psychologists are keen to explore how working to favourite musical pieces versus unfamiliar tunes affect people’s thinking. Other questions are whether rock, pop, dance and trance affect people’s creative powers in the same way, and whether ambient sounds, such as the tinkle of wind chimes or the grinding of machinery affect creativity as well."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2017/sep/07/hit-factory-british-music-stars-break-overseas-sales-records","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-06T23:01:44Z","webTitle":"Hit factory: British music stars break overseas sales records","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/sep/07/hit-factory-british-music-stars-break-overseas-sales-records","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2017/sep/07/hit-factory-british-music-stars-break-overseas-sales-records","fields":{"headline":"Hit factory: British music stars break overseas sales records","bodyText":"The popularity of British music abroad has hit a record high as artists including Adele, David Bowie and Coldplay brought in more than £350m from fans around the world last year. Sales of British music outside the UK surged 11% to a record £365m last year – the highest level since records began – spurred by the phenomenal growth in popularity of streaming music on services such as Spotify, Apple Music and Deezer. UK music trade body the BPI does not break down who was the most popular British artist abroad in terms of sales of all of their music, including back catalogues, but Adele’s 25 was the best-selling album by a UK artist in 2016. David Bowie’s Blackstar, his last album released just before his death last year, ranked second with foreign fans. Bowie was the biggest-selling artist in the UK last year. The top five was rounded out by The Rolling Stones’s Blues &amp; Lonesome, Coldplay’s A Head Full of Dreams and Radiohead’s A Moon Shaped Pool. The BPI said the value of British music exports – sales of CDs, vinyl, streaming and downloads of singles and albums – has rocketed by more than 72% since the start of the decade as legal streaming has replaced widespread piracy. “Music by brilliant British artists such as Ed Sheeran, Adele, David Bowie, Coldplay and Sam Smith is streamed and purchased the world over,” said Geoff Taylor, chief executive of the BPI and the annual Brit Awards. “The global digital streaming market represents a huge new opportunity.” Global streaming revenues need to grow by less than 10% this year to pass physical sales, which fell 8% to $5.4bn in 2016. Last year saw a 60% surge to $4.6bn. The BPI, which is to officially release the figures at its annual meeting on Thursday, said that British recording artists and labels made the most from their music overseas since it began keeping records at the turn of the century. Since 2000, the British record industry has made a total of £4.4bn from the sale of music outside the UK. British music proved to be most popular in the USA, the world’s biggest music market, followed by Germany, France, Australia and Canada. The BPI said that fast-emerging markets such as Asia, Turkey, India and South America were becoming increasingly significant in sales terms. However Japan is the only Asian market in a top 10 comprised of six European nations, Canada and the US and Australia. “With Britain leaving the European Union, the UK needs businesses that are true global superstars,” said Taylor. “Government can help seize the opportunity by making sure our artists can tour freely post-Brexit.” Best-selling albums by British artists outside the UK in 2016 1.

Dates, difficulty ratings, the names of the brave souls who did a route first. Each generation of climbers measures itself against yesterday’s best, with dreams of going one better. Advances in the sport tend to be linear and incremental, like climbing up a rock. Occasionally, rarely, a big climbing achievement erupts into the general consciousness. A 2015 ascent of the Dawn Wall on California’s El Capitan was celebrated by no less than Barack Obama. But the public, which is busy, quickly moves on. When the Dawn Wall was climbed again last year, few noticed. Then there are the climbs of Alex Honnold. Yosemite Valley, where El Capitan is situated, is an epic setting for epic exploits. The valley is a magnet for the strong and bold, who spider up granite walls and leap in wingsuits from the rim. But even in this world headquarters for daredevils, certain feats have for decades remained sealed off as mere ideas, locked away in a realm of challenges too big and too scary to grapple with, almost to speak of. In the early morning hours of 3 June 2017, Honnold, 32, walked to the base of El Capitan, touched the wall, and made the biggest idea of all a reality. He climbed from the bottom to the top of the cliff at one of its tallest points – 900m – without a harness or rope, along a route called the Freerider, just to the left of the Dawn Wall. A mistake at any point, or a failure of strength or focus or courage, or a stroke of bad luck in the form of a wet spot or a loose rock, would have sent him to the ground. Instead, after about three and a half hours, Honnold, with some of the hardest sections behind him, found himself 150 meters from the top, still climbing with perfect confidence and very quickly, and without fatigue or fear – as if he had somehow transcended gravity. “The final 500ft of the route was pretty much: ‘I’m done, this is easy, I’m just cruising,’” says Honnold. “It’s enjoyable to be able to climb that way.” It was the first time that the full height of El Capitan had been climbed without a rope. * * * “As one of his closest friends and an El Capitan addict myself, you would think I’d have a handle on what it would mean to free-solo the Freerider,” Tommy Caldwell, who in 2015 made the first free ascent of the Dawn Wall, wrote after Honnold’s climb. “But I don’t. No one does. Except Alex.” At the top, Honnold melted dumbly into hugs from a film crew that had documented his ascent – friends all – and succumbed to a feeling of “overwhelming stoke”, he said. “I felt almost vulnerable, in a way.” What he did not feel was tired. “It was emotional just because it was emotional,” Honnold said. “It was not as if I was worn down. Because physically I felt great, I felt super strong. If you had teleported me back to the bottom, I would have just gone again, because I felt so good.” Honnold had good reason for feeling relieved. Just seven months earlier, he had started the climb, got into trouble, and had to invent an escape. For 10 years, Honnold has been picking a lonesome line where athletic exploit blends with lethal risk. The hazards of Honnold’s climbs on monolithic faces such as Yosemite’s Half Dome and Zion’s Moonlight Buttress have been both obvious to everyone, and known only to him. While El Capitan was an order-of-magnitude leap for Honnold, the climb could also be called the next logical step for him. He has often been asked what he thinks about death. Of his hardest free-solos, Honnold said: “There’s always a point where you can’t overpower it any more –you just have to commit to: ‘If my foot slips, I’m going to fall and die, and that’s all there is to it.’ To me, that’s the level where you’re really climbing. It’s a different level, where you’ve just committed to just climbing like normal, but without a rope.” “Climbing like normal, but without a rope”: the phrase seems to hold the essence of Honnold’s genius, or his psychological uniqueness – the thing that allows him to do what no other climber can. Like a piano star or a test pilot, he seems indifferent to, or heightened by, the pressures of performing. He rehearses extensively before his biggest climbs, unlocking the subtleties of each move and committing long phrases of choreography to memory. “It’s just like a gymnast thinking about the routine and visualizing every movement of their body,” he says. But the analogy falls apart unless the gymnast is performing with the knowledge that a single mistake would be fatal. Rehearsed, not reckless; planned, not spontaneous; life, not death. It’s all a fit with Honnold’s low-key persona. In the many films that feature him, Honnold establishes a funny, ironic distance between his staggering feats and a laid-back vibe. While he can be something of a motormouth, he does not have the reactor-hot ego of some of the old-school climbing stars. * * * Honnold’s mother, Dierdre Wolownick, a college French professor, told Outside magazine about taking him at the age of five on his first climbing gym outing in Sacramento, California, where he grew up. “I was talking to the supervisor, and I turned around,” she said. “There was Alex, 30ft up. I was scared to death he’d kill himself.” His father, who died of a heart attack when Honnold was 19, would drive his son for hours to explore new gyms as the boy’s obsession took hold. “Overall, if you ask people about Alex Honnold, most people just really like him,” says Katie Ives, editor of Alpinist magazine. “He comes across as humble and genuine. He seems down-to-earth. He seems to have a lot of self-awareness and a lot of self-control, and he appears not to have let all the publicity go to his head.” A few days after Honnold’s historic ascent, a friend, Tom Evans, claimed that unhappy film executives had threatened to sue him for posting 19 images of the climb on his popular El Capitan photography blog. The climb is to be the subject of a feature-length film to be released in 2018. The executives wanted the images deleted from the internet. “Unfortunately, higher-ups at the production team keep sending me harassing emails, threatening me with legal action,” the friend told his readers in a sharp note after deleting the images. “They tell me I’ve no right to my own photos and I must get permission from them to use any of my Honnold shots.” Evans did not reply to an email asking who had threatened him. In a statement, National Geographic Channels, which will release the film, denied that Evans had been threatened with a lawsuit and accused him of violating a non-disclosure agreement. Evans says the film producers “tricked me into signing a release”. The company says the terms were clear. Unusually for a climbing film, the project also has a big-time movie production company attached, Parkes+MacDonald (Men in Black, Gladiator, Barbie). The media frenzy surrounding Honnold is the subject of some griping in the climbing world. “This is the kind of thing that makes me glad I’m a climber from the golden age, before all this commercialization shit hit,” one commenter on Evans’s site wrote. Peter Croft, a childhood hero of Honnold’s whose own free-solos provided an early road map for the young climber, has compared being filmed while soloing to performing in a “sex video”. Honnold says: “I can appreciate what Peter’s talking about ... I mean, soloing is a very personal, intimate experience, and it can feel weird to have somebody there sort of exploiting that experience. But at the same time, you know, if the filmers are good friends, and you feel you’re sharing something that you care about, and that you want to share … I mean, sometimes filming can be kind of cool.” * * * Every move Honnold makes in the commercial realm, however, raises questions about the commodification of risk. Should corporations be making money from someone risking his neck? Is there a moral hazard for consumers who buy Honnold videos – or for film-makers who shoot them – or newspapers who cover his feats? At least one corporation has broken up with Honnold. In 2014, Clif Bar dropped him and four other climbers, explaining: “We no longer feel good about benefiting from the amount of risk certain athletes are taking.” But reports of a supposed controversy surrounding Honnold seem overblown: it’s hard to identify the opposition. Apart from his films, Honnold has gold-plated sponsors, including Black Diamond, La Sportiva and the North Face, which brought him to London recently for its “walls are meant for climbing” campaign. He is the cover boy of the global outdoor recreation industry, which clocks an estimated $887bn (£684bn) in sales each year and is growing fast. “These kind of controversies are not anything new,” says Ives. “Climbers have been debating issues relating to publicity, media and profit ever since the 19th century.” On his free-solo ascent of El Capitan, Honnold occasionally interacted with the film crew. At the site of the single hardest move of the climb, however – which requires an all-body weight transfer via splits between two non-footholds at 520 meters – the film-makers used remote cameras. “It’s not the presence of cameras that exerts the pressure, it’s the presence of people operating the cameras,” Honnold explains. “I didn’t want to go into the crux wondering what they’re thinking about what you’re thinking – it’s just too much weird reflection.” In March 2016, a neuroscientist at the Medical University of South Carolina stuck Honnold in an MRI and found his amygdala, the brain’s centre for threat response, did not glow when he looked at disturbing images the way a control subject’s did. Afterwards, according to the science magazine Nautilus, Honnold had a question: “Looking at all those images – does that count as being under stress?” The scientist in the study concluded that either Honnold’s amygdala was misfiring, or “his frontal cortex is just so powerful that it can calm him down”. “I think it was all legit,” Honnold says. “But I think what it showed was that I was probably slightly less sensitive than average to begin with, and then after spending 10 years soloing at a high level, I’ve further desensitized myself to stimulus.” But he doesn’t see this as a safety liability. “If anything, I think that would make things safer for me, as it would allow me to better discern real risk,” he says. * * * In addition to his prodigious talent, Honnold clearly has extraordinary judgment in the mountains, a big part of which is knowing when to fold. One morning last November, he set the same process in motion that he began on 3 June. He woke up in his van, put on his shoes and started climbing the wall. But an ankle injury had not fully healed, he found, and things didn’t feel right. He began grabbing steel rings bolted to the mountainside for climbers to clip ropes to. Then he borrowed a sling from the film crew, rappelled off the cliff and went off to climb something else. The people closest to him support what he does, while fearing for his life. His mother is a backer. “Climbing is Alex’s job,” she wrote in a Climbing magazine. “And I trust his judgment.” Honnold says he is taking fewer casual risks than he used to. “I’ve actually really reined in my moderate soloing,” he says. “If anything, I’m probably moving in the direction of being slightly more conservative in my risk-taking.” In his personal habits, Honnold seems geared for the long term. He is a vegetarian. He only drinks water. He has never had alcohol or been stoned, which among full-time climbers may be Honnold’s other unique feat. He jokes he is a Mormon without the religion. “I’m in a period of up-and-up,” he said. “I’ve had the same girlfriend for coming on two years, and it’s totally solid, everything’s good.” Looking to the future, Honnold says, a major focus will be to spend more time on philanthropic work. The Honnold Foundation, which he founded in 2012, supports environmental development programs, from equipping low-income housing in the US with solar panels to seeking to eradicate kerosene lanterns from Africa by 2020. Honnold has an El Capitan tie-in to describe his foundation work. His point is that a seemingly impossible task, such as rejigging the African energy grid, can start to seem doable if you work at it steadily enough. “You can take something that seems totally impossible, and say: ‘Oh well, I can at least chip away at it, I can at least work towards it. You think about soloing El Cap, and, you know, 10 years ago that seemed completely outrageous, and much too big of a project. But then, over the years, you just work away at it, and then one day you’re like: ‘Oh yeah, that’s not a problem.’”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/sep/18/helen-gurley-brown-orthorexia-fad-restrictive-diet-clean-eating-rachel-cooke","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-18T07:00:03Z","webTitle":"The origins of clean eating","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/sep/18/helen-gurley-brown-orthorexia-fad-restrictive-diet-clean-eating-rachel-cooke","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/sep/18/helen-gurley-brown-orthorexia-fad-restrictive-diet-clean-eating-rachel-cooke","fields":{"headline":"The origins of clean eating","bodyText":"People talk about orthorexia, an eating disorder that takes the form of an obsession with healthy food, as if it were a new thing – or, at least, an illness that has broken cover recently, encouraged by those who spend their days posting pictures of their fantastical beet- and cashew-based diets on Instagram. But as Laura Shapiro reveals in her new book, What She Ate: Six Remarkable Women and the Food that Tells Their Stories, the condition has been with us for decades – sometimes in plain sight. It was back in 1959 that Helen Gurley Brown, future editor of Cosmopolitan and bestselling author of Sex and the Single Girl, first walked into the Los Angeles health-food store on whose shelves she saw the (terrifying) future. Gurley Brown was then feeling rather glum: David Brown, her movie executive boyfriend, was refusing to marry her, and she had just finished an assignment at the Miss Universe Pageant at Long Beach, which had done her ego no good at all (all those younger, prettier girls). Needing a pick-me-up, she swung by a place she’d heard people raving about, Lindberg Nutrition, and by the time she left, she was a convert: to vitamin supplements, to soy-flour pancakes and to the Serenity Cocktail, which comprised, among other things, pineapple chunks, calcium lactate, vanilla, powdered milk and brewer’s yeast. At this point, she was not interested in dieting so much as in wanting to improve her physical and emotional health (Gurley Brown had always been rake thin). But this soon changed. Although David did finally propose, her new status couldn’t alter the fact that she was nearing 40, a number which filled her with horror – and so the starving began. Except that she didn’t quite let on that she was starving, not at first. She always cooked for David, a hot breakfast and dinner every night, and she liked to tell people how “scrumptious” she thought this or that dish was; once her writing career took off, she even published a (ghostwritten) cook book. Thus, she maintained the illusion that her appetite was perfectly healthy. In fact, her diet was extremely restricted. Sure, she was a great one for tins and packets: the times were different then. (She was devoted to Jell-O, though it had to be sugar-free, of course.) But much of what she ate will sound weirdly familiar to anyone acquainted with so-called clean eating (as will her conviction that anyone who dared to criticise it was simply “jealous” of her figure). She liked to feast, for instance, on such “satisfying” and “delicious” treats as prunes, dried apricots and unsalted almonds. Meanwhile, many normal foods began to seem actively dangerous, and they had to be avoided at all costs. Other people were welcome to eat brownies, but if someone at a party happened to hand her one, straight into her handbag it would go (or, in an emergency, behind the nearest cushion). All this sounds desperately miserable and unpleasant. Combine the aspirations of a 60s hostess with a mortal fear of food and you get some pretty weird stuff; the mind boggles at the thought of avocados stuffed with orange ice (even as I’m typing this, I’m wondering whether some pouting blogger isn’t about to try it: “so amazingly refreshing, and lactose-free, too!”). Ill and exhausted as she must have been, maintaining the fiction it was just wonderfully good luck that those foods which made a girl “sexy, exuberant [and] full of the [sic] joie de vivre” were also the ones that happened to keep her “slender” was too much even for her. Slowly and surely, the smokescreen fell away. If the “incredible salad bar” in which she “simply rolled around” every night of her holiday sounds exactly the kind of thing you’d read on Instagram, her frank admission of a weekday diet consisting only of tuna, cottage cheese and an apple has a veracity that, however pathetic and troubling, seems almost touching in the age of the online chickpea mountain (“I eat so much,” bloggers insist, waving a loaded plate you feel certain they will never empty). Of all the anecdotes Shapiro dishes up, my favourite is the one with which she ends. Once, she writes, Gloria Steinem – Gurley Brown’s favourite feminist – begged her to say something positive about herself, something that reflected the serious, complicated person she really was. “Helen tried her best,” writes Shapiro. “She really did.” But in the end, all she could up with was: ‘I’m skinny! I’m skinny!’”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"uk-news/2017/sep/07/news-group-settles-17-cases-allegations-criminality-the-sun-phone-hacking","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-07T17:19:44Z","webTitle":"News Group settles 17 cases related to allegations of criminality at the Sun","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/sep/07/news-group-settles-17-cases-allegations-criminality-the-sun-phone-hacking","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2017/sep/07/news-group-settles-17-cases-allegations-criminality-the-sun-phone-hacking","fields":{"headline":"News Group settles 17 cases related to allegations of criminality at the Sun","bodyText":"The publisher of the Sun and the defunct News of the World has settled 17 cases of phone hacking and illegally obtaining personal information, avoiding a high-profile court case. News Group, part of Rupert Murdoch’s News Corp, has settled with celebrities including Les Dennis, the footballer Jonathan Woodgate and the Coronation Street actors Samia Ghadie, Kym Marsh and Alan Halsall. The settlement means that a high court trial due to hear the 17 cases in October will no longer go ahead. The trial would have aired allegations of phone hacking at the Sun – which News Group has always denied – and could have led to James Murdoch being forced to take the stand as his family try to secure a controversial £11.7bn takeover of Sky. The settlement is likely to be worth millions of pounds. News Group has not admitted to any unlawful behaviour at the Sun as part of the settlement, which was revealed at a pre-trial review at the high court on Thursday. The 17 cases are the first tranche of 91 new claims of phone hacking and illegally obtaining personal information against the Sun and News of the World. High-profile individuals who have not settled their claims include Sir Elton John, Gordon Ramsay, David Tennant and Heather Mills. A court hearing for the next tranche of alleged victims is scheduled for January, when the Sky deal is still likely to be awaiting regulatory approval. News Group has already settled hacking cases with more than 1,000 people, but these were related to the News of the World, which was closed in 2011 at the height of the hacking scandal. Other individuals in the latest settlement include Ian Cotton, the former press officer for Liverpool football club; James Mullord, the former manager of singer Pete Doherty; and Brooke Kinsella, the former EastEnders actor and anti-knife crime campaigner. At a hearing in June, News Group was ordered to hand over thousands of invoices relating to the use of private investigators by the Sun and its former Sunday sister title. Mr Justice Mann said News Group must explain why it had redacted hundreds of documents relevant to the hacking case, and that laptops used by James Murdoch, the former chairman of News International, should be searched. News Group is part of News Corp, which is controlled by Rupert Murdoch and his sons James and Lachlan. The Murdochs are trying to buy Sky through 21st Century Fox, which was split from their newspaper business after the phone-hacking scandal led to the collapse of their previous bid for Sky in 2011. The Murdochs are awaiting an announcement from Karen Bradley, the culture secretary, on whether the government will refer Fox’s bid to the Competition and Markets Authority for a six-month investigation. This announcement is expected next week. Bradley has already said she is minded to refer the deal on the grounds of media plurality after Ofcom raised concerns about how dominant it could make the Murdochs in public life. However, the culture secretary also said she was minded not to refer the deal on the grounds of broadcasting standards, with Ofcom clearing the Murdochs as fit and proper owners of Sky. However, Bradley has been put under pressure by Avaaz, a campaign group, and a group of MPs led by Ed Miliband, who claim the deal should also be referred on broadcasting standards, pointing to the sexual harassment scandal at Fox News and allegations it colluded with Donald Trump’s White House on a discredited story about a murdered Democratic activist, which Fox denies. Fox has pledged to continue broadcasting news under the Sky News brand. James Murdoch said earlier this year he was “particularly proud” of its track record. Fox has also denied claims it could push through the “Foxification” of Sky News, meaning it would broadcast news with the same rightwing slant as Fox News in the US, and insisted Ofcom regulations prevent this from happening."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2017/sep/08/princess-nokia-destiny-frasqueri-rap-riot-grrrl","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-08T08:34:53Z","webTitle":"Princess Nokia: ‘At my shows, girls can take up space the way men do’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/sep/08/princess-nokia-destiny-frasqueri-rap-riot-grrrl","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2017/sep/08/princess-nokia-destiny-frasqueri-rap-riot-grrrl","fields":{"headline":"Princess Nokia: ‘At my shows, girls can take up space the way men do’","bodyText":"The first time Destiny Frasqueri came to London, she was 18 years old and called herself Wavy Spice. She had released only a handful of songs on Soundcloud, but one of them, Bitch I’m Posh, had taken on a life of its own. It was a lo-fi house track topped off with a funny, laconic, trash-talking vocal – the kind of thing hipster playlists and profiles in Vice are made of – and now, inevitably, record companies were circling. One of them was interested enough to fly her to Britain. You might have thought Frasqueri would be delighted. It was, after all, only two years since she had run away from an abusive foster home in East Harlem with “three dollars in my pocket and 75% on my cell phone battery” for a life on the streets, as she subsequently told the makers of the 2016 documentary Destiny. But something about it didn’t sit right. “I still think: what the fuck was I doing? I couldn’t understand why people were glorifying me when I wasn’t that talented; there was no substance or merit in what I was doing. I couldn’t let myself get away with that. And there was a lot of male dominance surrounding me, wanting to be a fly in my ear and dictate or surmise what I was going to be doing.” So she spurned the record company advances – “To me, the music industry doesn’t exist,” she laughs, “it’s like the devil, it doesn’t exist if you don’t believe in it” – returned to New York and “started all over again”. She changed her stage name to Princess Nokia, after the brand of cheap “Obamaphone” she was eligible for as a low-income earner, and shifted increasingly towards hip-hop. That was five years ago. Today, Frasqueri is sitting in the back of a people carrier, wrapped in a blanket, sunglasses on, clutching a travel pillow. She has been in Britain for a grand total of 14 hours, long enough to play a rapturously received live set for Boiler Room, and now she’s leaving again. Thanks to the success of her third mixtape 1992, a flatly brilliant collection of tracks gleefully glorifying her own outsider status (it has just been reissued in expanded form by Rough Trade, which, she is keen to point out, is just distributing and promoting her records and has no say in what she does artistically), her schedule is so tight that the only place she has time to do an interview is en route to the airport. At first, I get the feeling that her itinerary might be getting to her. Her reputation as an extremely tough customer has been sealed through umpteen sharp, funny lyrics and remarks about race and gender (“she identifies as a bruja [witch] and a tomboy, a classic New York Boricua shorty, a feminist, a queer woman who isn’t burdened but empowered by her complexity,” offered one profile) and an incident earlier this year, when she got offstage at a Cambridge University event and slapped a male audience member who she said had been mouthing “Show me your tits” at her, telling the crowd, to cheers: “That’s what you do when a white boy disrespects you.” Today, however, she seems subdued and softly spoken, the opposite of the motormouthed Bronx-accented figure depicted in the Destiny doc. She says she doesn’t want to say too much: “I talk a lot in interviews, and I don’t want to overtalk something, so I’m being a little bit more quiet with my responses, because I overshare”. She says it politely and with a smile, but it’s hard not to feel a bit deflated: this ranks fairly high up on the list of things no interviewer wants to hear from an interviewee. But I needn’t have worried. The car has barely pulled away from her hotel and her resolution to be a little more quiet seems to have gone out the window. She’s as smart as her lyrics, about everything from comics – “I like Marvel because characters look like me and women don’t have roles that make them look too sexual” – to the gentrification of New York. “It makes me really sad. It has glossed over these really formative areas that have inspired me in my life and raised me. A lot of people from the inner city, like I am, they observe it but they’re not going to be vocal about it, because they’re just going about their day. But I really see it; I understand the modern colonisation that they’re doing. So I feel offended. My neighbourhood isn’t even undergoing development, there’s no real estate there, but I’ve seen a couple of people walking down the street who I know aren’t from there and I’m like ‘get the fuck out!’ I think: ‘How dare you? To have the audacity to just walk into this neighbourhood, you really got some gall.’ You know they’re really trying to be the first of their kind in the neighbourhood, and cash fucking crop.” Her musical background is fascinating. Her parents were hip-hop fans, but she was exposed to heavy metal aged six, courtesy of a goth babysitter. “She was the coolest person to be near. I’d watch her chain-smoke and listen to Rob Zombie and make out in front of me and it was scandalous and I loved it. I grew up in a liberal home where we all loved all types of music and my uncles listened to the Red Hot Chili Peppers; rock wasn’t considered some white-boy shit. But her specifically, I saw and I was really drawn to. It was radical, it was fun, it was aggressive, and it had a tone that matched my heart.” She says she was always a misfit – “not a typical clean-cut young lady, always a bit rough around the edges, always a bit messy” – even before her life was turned upside down by the deaths of her grandmother and mother, the latter from Aids. She was farmed out to a foster mother she has described as “a succubus”, who beat her so severely that she had to wear makeup to cover a black eye in a school photo. The obsession with 90s culture that runs through the lyrics of 1992 is clearly bound up in her troubled childhood. “Growing up in the 90s was the coolest thing to me. Listening to metal with my gothic babysitter, dancing to Kriss Kross, hanging out and listening to the music at the block party downstairs from my house, the cartoons I’d watch, seeing black representation and Latina representation on Nickelodeon and the Disney Channel, going to summer camp; oh, God, it’s so vivid, so significant. And then my grandma died and I went to go live with a woman that wasn’t the nicest person in the world and my life shattered and changed. I didn’t like the music that was on the radio, I didn’t wear the cute things girls wore at the time, I was on some baggy clothes, Harriet The Spy tomboy shit, and puberty hit and … I had to subconsciously block a lot of stuff that was going on at the time, so all I got is memories of the 90s.” She escaped into New York’s underground punk scene. “The principles of punk-rock culture, of self-expression and DIY culture, that really spoke to me. I remember at school one day there was a vocabulary list on the chalkboard and the word ‘nonconformist’ was on there and it said: “Someone that doesn’t appeal to society, someone who doesn’t fit in.” We had this whole conversation about it and I realised it cohered to the punk-rock world that I was into. It was more than the clothes, although I loved the fashion. It was rooted in this beautiful socio-economic awareness and identity, and just saying: ‘Fuck you, we’re going to be loud and express ourselves.’ It gave me so much confidence and backbone.” She had a particular love for riot grrrl bands including Bikini Kill and Le Tigre, who she belatedly discovered via a music streaming service, and indeed, you can see the influence in everything from Smart Girl Club – a kind of online audio fanzine that Frasqueri started “so I could have my own space when I was co-existing within a lot of white cis male spaces … where I could talk about urban feminism, sexuality, relationships, spirituality, music, art, and interview people and laugh and make fun of myself” – to her insistence that female audience members stand at the front of her shows. “Men standing in the back – it’s what’s right. All the shows that you go to, men would just be in the front in droves, moshing and they have such a brotherhood – which is beautiful and very commendable and I respect it very much. But it’s like a thousand men with their sausages out and it’s a real testosterone fest. Girls are, like, quivering in the corners, holding on to their purses, and they deserve to hold so much more space than that. A Princess Nokia show is this place where girls can do that and take the space in the way that men and the brotherhood do.” She currently occupies a unique and enviable place in pop music: a fiercely independent female rapper with a radical intersectional feminist agenda and burgeoning following, who has garnered praise everywhere from the world of fashion – she has modelled for Calvin Klein – to the music press and the serious socio-political blogs. “The only way you can make something work is really by being your most unique self and having a lane, and there’s no one in my lane,” she says. “Not until a sweet 17-year-old girl comes out of high school and does the same thing I do and I’ve paved the way for her. That’s important and I want that.” The one place she hasn’t been lauded, she says, is in the world of hip-hop. “When I’m featured in serious hip-hop blogs, the commentary is really negative. It’s not over-sexualisation – it’s just: ‘Who the fuck is she? This bitch is whack and corny.’ Because I speak highly of myself, people think I’m pompous, or that I’m really narcissistic. But I’m only speaking on myself and what I’ve done and accomplished, and I only speak like that because no one else is doing it.” By now, we’ve pulled up outside the airport. Everyone else has got out of the car, including the driver. He taps on the window – “Please,” he says, plaintively, “I cannot park here” – but Frasqueri keeps on talking. “I don’t take it personal. I have come into this knowing very much who I am and knowing where I stand within this world. The fact that I get to coexist with it, and only focus on making art, is all that matters. It’s not a competition, for me. Excluding me out of circles and worlds, it’s happened all my life and that’s what my music is about. So,” she says, “I will happily be the GG Allin of the hip-hop world.” I find myself letting out a startled bark of laughter – I hadn’t expected our interview to conclude with talk turning to the late, self-styled “true king of rock’n’roll”, notorious for performing naked and bloodied, defecating on stage, then throwing his excrement around while singing Eat My Diarrhea. GG Allin? She nods. “GG Lopez, it’s a concept I’ve created for many years. And that’s what it is and that’s what it will always be and I love that and I take ownership of it and everybody can suck a dick.” Then she gives me a hug – “it was lovely talking to you” – picks up her travel pillow and finally gets out of the car, vanishing into the terminal building."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/sep/17/food-and-love-kathleen-alcott-relationships-sharing-meals","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-17T11:00:39Z","webTitle":"Do couples that cook together, stay together?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/sep/17/food-and-love-kathleen-alcott-relationships-sharing-meals","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/sep/17/food-and-love-kathleen-alcott-relationships-sharing-meals","fields":{"headline":"Do couples that cook together, stay together?","bodyText":"There is perhaps no clearer a sign that a man does not love you than that he will not eat with you. I’m sorry to say I know this from experience, and further sorry to admit the man in question, whom I never saw ingest more than some crisp or pastry, was obligated to someone else. During the last acts of the obscure films we saw at the repertory cinemas of New York, on the subway platforms where he would run one finger down my arm, I was almost always starving. Though he was forever short on time, occasionally we made the desperate stop at a bodega, where I’d purchase a pathetic abbreviation of a meal, a suspect banana and salted cashews, and I would eat them as we walked, further contributing to the impression I was a woman who had planned nothing well. Our perverse friendship went on for a year, during a time I was licking my wounds from an awful separation, and just as we never ate together, neither did we sleep together. It occurred to me, after the fact, how telling the first part of the equation was, how indicative of all that followed. In every relationship there’s a mutual diet that evolves (or doesn’t), modified by allergies and preferences and begrudging compromises, and a set of behaviours that accompany it, and inside of all this a very readable code about who we are to each other, and what kind of unit we become or fail to remain. The first man I ever loved, 24 to my 18, had the sort of perfect name that people always spoke in full, first and last, and he loved to cook for great groups of people, pork roasts that took the whole day, root vegetables julienned so flawlessly they looked like birthday ribbons. I would fly up from college in the south of the state to attend these dinners, in his railroad apartment off Haight Street or his father’s rambling house, an hour north in the hills of our hometown. This was long before I learned to cook anything by myself, and so I would sit a little hamstrung on a counter nearby, a kid in the way, and occasionally he would say something like, “Do you know how to make a roux?” But given his skill and my incompetence, this was like a ballerina demonstrating a fouetté for a toddler with a broken leg. I would nod and listen mute to what he said, never asking for or offered the flour or the spoon, apparently content to take admiration over intimacy. I noticed, after a while, that the elaborate dinners were only prepared for an audience, and that when it was just the two of us, we mostly ate burritos with our hands as we watched television programmes about the bottom of the ocean. We can sense real connection, I’ve come to think, by how much being alone together feels at first like an occasion, something requiring collaboration and argument, tools and time. What he liked about me was similar to what I revered about him – how he thrived in a full room, how he catered his stories to the people in it – but that didn’t help us on those evenings with Blue Planet, where we each might as well have been on our own, greasy fingered and half asleep. It’s easy to remember him hurtling around the corner of a grocery aisle, his cart ahead of him full of the things he’d chosen, and also how young I was, how I failed to place anything in it myself. My next great target of affection, in my early 20s in San Francisco, was an impoverished painter who wore the same beige workman uniform every day. He took pride in living on as little as possible, and often went days surviving only on the generosity of friends and the Ziploc bags of nuts and fruits he kept in his pockets. His pieces were enormous and intricate, maps of scientific processes traced first in pencil, and they were the principle around which his life was organised. I was making a little more money, so I would often leave the studio where he also slept and return with dinner. What qualified as a feast then was panang or massaman curry, chased by a bottle of pale ale, spread out on the concrete floor on a spare sheet. While I took things out of the bag he would move around the room putting on a record and changing the lighting, on his left hand a ring of mine I had slipped there late one night which he never took off. Try as we did to meet in the middle, between my standards that were rising and his that remained ascetic, there was an underlying rift about this, about how flexible life as an artist could be. It was understood that no matter how deeply he might thank me for the meal, no matter how much he had needed it, he would not, soon or ever, be in the business of returning that favour. During a camping trip to Big Sur, where the physical beauty is a kind of punchline, even the sand an over-the-top lilac, he teased me for ordering an overpriced pastry from a seaside cafe. Shortly after, with a kind of quiet haughtiness that made my very molars itch, he retrieved a clingfilmed croissant from the garbage and began to eat it. I’m the first to admit I laughed too loudly when his face changed and he spat it out, having tasted the mould that had kept it from the day-old basket. A few months after that I moved to a city across the country, where he couldn’t follow, given how precisely his life was arranged, the cheap rent he couldn’t give up and the California light he was content to believe was better than anywhere else. Maybe his way of seeing was blinkered, but he had cornered fulfillment in a way I never have. Those dinners in that warehouse, talking quietly and insistently about my work or his, were an event from which he took pure and human pleasure – but even as they unspooled for me in real time, my aspirational self already envisioned them as a memory, part of a scrappy, fallow period that occurred before I stepped into the rest of my life. I wish I could have been there with him more truly, allowed both feet in that water, and there are more moments than I’d like to admit, eaten by ambition as I can be, awake at 2am writing a convincing and rotten review of my next novel, that I’d like to return, go barefoot on that concrete for a jar of water in the middle of the night. Because it was harder to survive on less in New York, where there was not a famous taqueria on every corner and avocados could not be purchased three for a dollar and spread on sourdough equally cheap and perfect, it was where I finally began to cook in earnest. It embarrasses me to mention my culinary skills deepened largely in service of a relationship where I occupied a very traditional female role, the lesser earner, the inhabitant of the brownstone my boyfriend owned. It always felt part of a performance in which I had been grievously miscast, and so I overcompensated, preparing meals that took four hours and three burners, insisting on courgette flowers and napkins folded to look like jewels. Though I never enjoyed the basic dishes my boyfriend very occasionally prepared – a fillet sautéed just in butter or some omelette that tasted like a scavenger hunt of the fridge’s darkest corners – neither was I ever totally satisfied with the way he received what I gave him. No “thank you” seemed to account for the time I had taken. It may not be possible to be the feminist and the housewife, or if it is I never mastered it, given how I expected my rhubarb compotes and squid risottos to be seen as much more than meals. I wanted them to signal my right to that home and that life, which never was mine, this much in evidence by the house guests I was always learning of just before their arrival, the sheer density of things bought with his money versus those bought by mine. Packing up my cake pans and vintage pitchers in that magazine-ready kitchen a year ago, my manner remote and my appetite nonexistent, I could not imagine any meal that I wanted. I spent the summer hidden in a linen kaftan to disguise all the weight I had lost, which friends remarked on as freely as they might some menacing weather system. If I’m brave enough to identify the through line here, at the small compromises that add up to unhappiness, I know it is not the men in my life but I who chose them. Whether it comes from the socialisation that tells little girls we should be accommodating before we are anything else, or some aspect of my itinerant bohemian childhood that made me more comfortable visiting than hosting, I have always been too willing to trim down my life so that it will adhere to another’s. I have often mistaken brilliance for goodness, a life rigidly defined as a kind of merit. The idea of a table where my place was waiting appealed to me, and I failed to see what that would mean for how welcome I’d feel there, in the long run, once the dishes were cleared and the candles snuffed. There was something I lost, letting the men I loved pick up the bill or otherwise dictate the terms, some apology I felt I couldn’t ask for later. We consent to the wrong life in small ways, less by what we say than what we don’t, maybe less by how we behave than by the behaviour we accept. Lately, my life is work and then dinners with L. He interrupted my thoughts on the subway, where he sat down across from me with his hair in his face, looking like a schoolboy sulky after being punished for a brilliant prank. Somehow I had the courage to wave, low and brief, and somehow providence was kind enough to get our train stuck with the doors open, allowing our exit and search for a drink to seem like the only option. When I was halfway through my first cocktail, a nervous choice that tasted like a cotton candy cone had set a forest fire, L took the glass from me and set it on the next table. You’re not enjoying that, he said, and asked me what I wanted instead. The first time he asked me to a meal, it was pouring. Without telling me his plan, he picked me up in a taxi that went straight back to a place in his neighbourhood, a small kindness that moved me inordinately. At dinner, at a Mediterranean restaurant where plants tumbled from pots sliced in half and mounted high on the wall, he was shiny in his face and clumsy in his movements, once swiping a hooked hand for a glass of wine that was not there, having been cleared by the waiter, and gawking at the table like a cartoon character who has passed the end of the cliff and looked down at his sorry fate. Everything we ate was taken from the same plate, everything we drank was passed back and forth, everything each of us said was annotated by the other. This is how our time together has continued to look, gestures I begin but he finishes. Last night in bed, deep in conversation, both of our gazes somewhere around our feet, I unhooked an amethyst pendant I keep around my neck to find that his hand was already there to take it and place it on the nightstand. The question was in my mouth – could you? – but I hadn’t said it. These are the sorts of behaviours that move me now, apparently, small acts of anticipation that don’t require a please or expect a thank you. This is classic you, he started to say, frustrated and delighted, just a few weeks in, at some behaviour of mine he had already classified, my tendency to pause mid-sentence to look closer at a tree or a building, and it made me wildly happy, to be the thing seen and known. It’s been a few months now and I still haven’t cooked for L, though I’m imagining it slowly. What I want is to prepare it all in his absence, for the meal’s creation to be totally separate from its reception. I am thinking pulled pork with apricots and curry powder, I am thinking cucumber gazpacho. Rules about meat pairings be damned, the only wine I want in the summer is a falanghina as light as the evenings here. Stuffed high above the cabinets in my pea-sized kitchen is a picnic basket I oiled and refinished in my old life, and I think I’ll take it down. I like the idea of carrying what I’ve made, out of the apartment where I’ve been living alone, a few blocks down to the park nearby. It is small in size but rich in hills, lending to the feeling that there is, with a step in any direction, a different view to be had.

In excerpts of an interview with CBS 60 Minutes host Charlie Rose set for broadcast on Sunday, Bannon also said Trump’s chief economic adviser Gary Cohn “should resign” and said the Catholic church was “terrible” on immigration issues such as the future of Dreamers because “they need illegal aliens to fill the churches”. One counter-protester was killed and many injured in Charlottesville after a man drove a car into a crowd. Trump said blame for the unrest rested “on many sides” and was slow to condemn the white supremacists who organized the event, a protest against the planned removal of a statue of Confederate general Robert E Lee. Trump belatedly condemned the militant white supremacists, yet insisted there were “some good people” attending their rally. He also lamented the removal of statues to Confederate leaders. Trump’s remarks provoked widespread uproar, not least among Republicans. Bannon said he was the only one of Trump’s staff to defend the president unequivocally, and said he had told White House chief of staff John Kelly how important that was. “I was the only guy that said, ‘He’s talking about something, taking it up to a higher level’,” Bannon said. “What he was trying to say is that people that support the monument staying there peacefully and people that oppose that, that’s the normal course of – of first amendment … “All Donald Trump was saying is: ‘Where does it end? Does it end in taking down the Washington monument? Does it end in taking down Mount Rushmore? Does it end at taking Churchill’s bust out of the Oval Office?’ “My problem – my problem, and I told General Kelly this – when you side with a man, you side with him. I was proud to come out and try to defend President Trump in the media that day.” Bannon left the White House late in August and has returned to the far-right website Breitbart News, which he ran before joining Trump’s team. He said he would now be the president’s “wingman outside for the entire time, to protect.” “You will not be attacking Donald Trump?” Rose asked. “No, our purpose is to support Donald Trump,” Bannon said, “to make sure his enemies know that there’s no free shot on goal.” House Speaker Paul Ryan, a frequent critic of Trump if not an outright enemy, told the New York Times on Thursday he believes Trump was “disgusted” by the neo-Nazis and white supremacists who marched in Charlottesville. “I know he’s disgusted by these people,” Ryan said. “His kids, his grandkids are Jewish.” Ryan said he believed Trump “made the right statements” on Charlottesville when he condemned white supremacy by name but not when he retreated from that position and appeared to draw a moral equivalence between those neo-Nazis who marched and those who protested against them. “The point is every single one of us needs to be really clear about this,” he said. CBS said Rose’s interview took place in the Capitol Hill townhouse Bannon uses as his headquarters, which his team calls ‘the embassy”, and said its host sat in on a Breitbart editorial meeting and interviewed key staff. Rose asked Bannon if the media’s image of him from his time in the White House was correct. Bannon said it was. “I’m a street fighter.” “By the way,” he continued, “I think that’s why Donald Trump and I get along so well. Trump’s a fighter. Great counter-puncher.” Bannon also condemned leaks from the White House. He said: “If you are going to break with [Trump], you should resign. I’m talking, obviously, about Gary Cohn and some other people. That if you don’t like what he’s doing and you don’t agree with it, you have an obligation to resign.” Cohn was the most senior administration official to condemn the president’s response to Charlottesville and was reported to have considered resigning. Meanwhile, noting that New York’s Catholic cardinal Timothy Dolan opposed Trump’s decision this week to end the Daca program to protect young people brought to the country illegally as children from being deported, Bannon said the church was “terrible” on immigration issues. “You know why? Because [they have been] unable to come to grips with the problems in the church, they need illegal aliens. They need illegal aliens to fill the churches. It’s obvious on the face of it,” Bannon said. Dolan said in an interview on Thursday that it was “a preposterous and rather insulting statement.” He added that the Bible is “so clear that to treat the immigrant with dignity and respect, to make sure that society is just in its treatment of the immigrant is Biblical mandate.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/sep/17/frozen-in-time-richard-nixon-in-china-february-1972","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-17T12:00:40Z","webTitle":"Politics and food: President Nixon in China, February 1972","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/sep/17/frozen-in-time-richard-nixon-in-china-february-1972","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/sep/17/frozen-in-time-richard-nixon-in-china-february-1972","fields":{"headline":"Politics and food: President Nixon in China, February 1972","bodyText":"Nixon in China is John Adams’s famous opera, but it’s also a phrase, describing a clash of civilisations, loaded with political jeopardy – plus some bizarre superpower chow-downs. Food is central to the Chinese. The banquet pictured here took place in Shanghai in February 1972, and placed an awkward US Republican loner in the dragon’s mouth. Everything about this picture screams, “Expletive deleted!” Nixon had already struggled to find words for his historic Sino-American initiative. On his visit to the Great Wall, he had observed, in a moment of stunning bathos, “This is a great wall.” On a smaller scale, this scene is also rich in comedy and drama. Tricky Dick knows he’s on primetime TV before a hometown audience that’s already wobbly about this trip. Worse, he’s been told that it’s rude not to express his appreciation to his Chinese hosts. His expression says everything: “I can’t seem too enthusiastic. What’s on the menu here? Is it bird’s nest or shark fin? Jeez – is it me? Next to these dudes, I can’t even work these goddam chopsticks.” (He and Henry Kissinger had been given lessons on the flight over.) Trapped between China’s first premier Zhou Enlai and Shanghai Communist party leader Zhang Chunqiao, Nixon is struggling with “chopstick diplomacy”. Had he ever eaten Chinese food? Raised in church-going, conservative Whittier, California, he’s most at home with ketchup. He was at one with America there. In 1972, the riches of Chinese food were becoming ghetto-ised in the Chinatowns of San Francisco, Washington DC and New York. Chopstick diplomacy had the unintended consequence of tempting the nation’s tastebuds. Ever since Nixon’s meeting with Chairman Mao, dim sum and peking duck have been high on the American menu. Not even a Trump trip to Beijing could wipe out this culinary dividend."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"film/2017/sep/07/darren-aronofsky-on-mother-jennifer-lawrence-was-hyperventilating-because-of-the-emotion","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-07T16:32:20Z","webTitle":"Darren Aronofsky on Mother! - ‘Jennifer Lawrence was hyperventilating because of the emotion’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/sep/07/darren-aronofsky-on-mother-jennifer-lawrence-was-hyperventilating-because-of-the-emotion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2017/sep/07/darren-aronofsky-on-mother-jennifer-lawrence-was-hyperventilating-because-of-the-emotion","fields":{"headline":"Darren Aronofsky on Mother! - ‘Jennifer Lawrence was hyperventilating because of the emotion’","bodyText":"The hour grows late at the London press junket. The schedule is running horribly behind time. Inside suite 206, the reporters find themselves packed in like sardines. They are perched on tables and windowsills, spilling coffee and mopping up the mess with their notepads. Each time the door opens, a fresh arrival comes in, which means that the walls inch ever-closer and there is less air. Tension is mounting and tempers are fraying. The night before, we all sat down and watched Mother! together. Today, it feels as if we might be living it, too. Darren Aronofsky’s new film is an explosion, an assault, a haunted-house horror that whips up conflicting emotions. Some love it, some hate it and some pinwheel back and forth, like lost souls in limbo. On screen, Jennifer Lawrence plays an unnamed heroine whose domestic idyll is overrun by an endless procession of malignant houseguests. They are disturbing her in the bathroom; they are making out in her bed. “I’m confused,” she confides, just as the nightmare begins. And by God, she is not the only one. “Yeah, well, that’s the journey,” shrugs Aronofsky, sipping bottled water, after I am granted entry to the tranquil suite next door. “I think it’s OK to be confused. The movie has a dream-logic and that dream-logic makes sense. But if you try to unscrew it, it kind of falls apart. So it’s a psychological freak-out. You shouldn’t over-explain it.” Some directors dazzle and some seduce. Aronofsky simply tramples you in your seat. He is the ripsnorting bull of American cinema, flanks matted with sweat, hooves kicking up clods; meaning to shock and awe; and possibly impregnate us as well. This pedigree was apparent right from his 1998 debut Pi, which took a cerebral premise (a mathematician studying patterns in the Torah) and spun it into paranoid fantasy. It then proceeded to thunder through the junkie nihilism of Requiem for a Dream, the redemptive contortions of The Wrestler and Black Swan, before building to the bombast of 2014’s Noah (by far his least interesting picture). “I’m always going to be a divisive guy,” he tells me. “What can I tell you, I’m like Johnny Rotten.” And yet Mother! – which was enthusiastically booed at its Venice press screening – takes a particular delight in tormenting its viewer. How best to describe Aronofsky’s bloody beast? Mother! is like Lars von Trier’s Antichrist as rewritten by Edward Albee, or a garish horror-comic by way of primal-scream therapy. It is about a lauded poet (Javier Bardem) and his doting young wife (Lawrence), who live in a gothic gingerbread house in a clearing in the woods. The poet wants to fill the house with new ideas, either as means of inspiring his writing or distracting himself from it, and so he opens the door to a cadaverous fan and his busybody wife (Ed Harris and Michelle Pfeiffer, both deliciously creepy). Before long the place is teeming with demonic revellers who trash the furnishings and drive a seemingly unresolvable wedge between the husband and wife. Is it a redundancy to note that the film turns shrill and hysterical, on the outer edge of control? That, surely, was where Aronofsky was headed all along. I am trying to resist over-explaining the film – but there is a major elephant at large in this room. Mother! is a film about a monstrous 48-year-old artist and his 27-year-old muse. And during production, Aronofsky struck up a relationship with his star. Aronofsky is 48; Lawrence 27. So I am wondering the most delicate way of broaching this subject. Did Bardem at any stage ask whether he was playing the director? “Oh no,” says Aronofsky, who has the sensitive features of a rabbinical student and the foursquare physique of a New York docker. “No, no, not at all. Javier knows me. He knows I’m not a monster. Because a film director is a very different kind of artist. I only have to be a monster on set – for two or three months every few years. The rest of the time I’m a nine-to-five father [he has an 11-year-old son from a previous relationship with the British actor Rachel Weisz]. I take my kid to school, go to sleep, live a life. Then go see my parents at weekends.” OK, I tell him. But does he realise he has left himself wide open for this kind of speculation? It is hard to believe the film is not just a bit about him. “Oh sure,” he allows. “It’s a projection of my life and what I’m thinking about. But my ego is in every character in every film that I’ve made. I’m the ballerina in Black Swan. I’m the wrestler in The Wrestler. I can see how people will especially make the connection with this one. But it’s also all fiction; it’s all smoke and mirrors. And if anything, my empathy here is more with the mother. I’m probably more Jen’s character than I am Javier’s.” Aronofsky was raised in Manhattan Beach, South Brooklyn, the son of two schoolteachers. He says his first exposure to culture was seeing Broadway musicals with his mother. They saw The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas and he didn’t know what a whorehouse was and asked his mother too loudly as soon as the curtain came down. A few miles up the road from his house was an amusement park at Coney Island, stinking of brine and cotton candy. He used to ride the Cyclone rollercoaster, sometimes 10 or 20 times a day in the summer. He has carried the experience with him ever since. “It’s funny,” he says. “Sean Gullette – the guy who starred in Pi – is staying in Rome and so he just came to the Mother! premiere in Venice. He told me afterwards that he closed his eyes twice during the movie. And I thought: ‘Come on.’ If you keep your eyes open the whole time, well, it’s like riding the Cyclone with your belt unfastened and your hands not touching the rails. And the second you look away, you’ve ruined it. So that’s the dare – and then Sean went and blinked.” Aronofksy likes to push his audience to the brink. I’ve heard that he likes to do it to his performers as well. Mickey Rourke – Oscar-nominated for his brilliant performance in The Wrestler – described the director as “an old-style Jew gangster”. He has a reputation for being combative and controlling, for breaking actors down and shooting them in extremis. “No, no,” he says, briefly nettled. “It’s not about breaking them down. They break themselves down. They’re game.” He gulps some water and thinks it over. “Actors,” he says. “Sometimes they forget, but I think the original reason they started acting was to be able to cry in front of class. Sometimes they forget that, when they become big action movie stars, because that’s more about modelling than acting. But they love it, really. So I’m always looking for actors who want to roll up their sleeves and let loose and just cry. Javier’s not afraid of crying; he’ll do anything. Jennifer, completely the same. She’s still very young; not jaded in the least. And, yeah, she was scared on this movie, because she knew she was going to have to go for some big emotions.” In a recent interview with Vogue magazine, Lawrence discussed her own experience in making Mother! “I had to go to a darker place than I’ve ever been in my life,” she admitted. “I didn’t know if I’d be able to come out OK.” There were reports that during one gruelling scene, she dislocated a rib. “Yeah, she ended up tearing her diaphragm,” Aronofsky says. “She was hyperventilating. Because of the emotion.” Is it true that he then immediately ordered her to do the whole scene again? The director snorts. “Well, yeah. Pull it together. That’s very British, right? Come on, let’s go.” And how was Lawrence with such behaviour? Did she tolerate it? “No, no,” he says, apparently worried I’m getting the wrong end of the stick. “I mean, we gave her time to recover. The thing is that she’d been thinking about that scene way too long, and it got all up in her head. So then the emotions flooded her and I saw what was happening – because I’m experienced – and was able to get the camera in the right place. The shot was originally on her back and I flipped the whole thing, let her recover and then said, ‘Get the camera on her face, right now’, because that’s the kind of emotion that you never, ever see.” It takes me a moment to process this. It sounds as though he is saying that he used Lawrence’s recovery time to reposition the camera so as to better capture her pain. But then Mother! is a film that positively luxuriates in pain. It’s a great, twisted howl of a movie; overheated and heady; an engrossing ordeal. As the house fills up, Lawrence is sent scurrying from one room to the next, vainly attempting to clear up the breakages, ordering the interlopers to get the hell out. One might view the film as a disease metaphor, in which tumours metastasise and infest the whole body. Alternatively, you can view it as a dark parable on the creative process, with the artist deciding what is let in and used up. In Aronofsky’s world, perhaps, there is not a whole lot of difference. The director agrees, but only up to a point. Film-making is tough, he admits. Some might even go so far as to view it as a form of dysfunction. But he has never been the sort to start whining about his hardship. “I love it,” he says. “Shooting movies, I love it. Those are the times in your life that you really remember. I remember, crystal-clear, shooting certain scenes in Requiem for a Dream, right down to the shirt I was wearing on a particular day. And it’s still so sharp, you know, because you’re alive, because your brain’s firing. Because you’re living, right there, in that little moment.” He says that the first thing he did on arriving in London was pick up the phone to call his parents. He wanted to tell them about the premiere, over in Venice, and let them know that he had landed safely. His father was in a nostalgic mood. The old man remembered the family driving past the local cinema when it was screening Pi. Aronofsky was still in his 20s, his career barely warming up. And he pointed out of the car window and said: “Dad, all I want in my life is for people to either cheer or boo. I just don’t want anything in the middle.” Aronofsky slams down his water and chuckles at the memory. He says: “Twenty years on, I guess not a whole lot has changed.” • Mother! is released on 14 September in Australia and 15 September in the US and UK."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"money/2017/sep/09/prepaid-funeral-plans-experts-warn-national-scandal","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-09T06:00:00Z","webTitle":"Don't dig deep for a pre-paid funeral plan","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2017/sep/09/prepaid-funeral-plans-experts-warn-national-scandal","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2017/sep/09/prepaid-funeral-plans-experts-warn-national-scandal","fields":{"headline":"Don't dig deep for a pre-paid funeral plan","bodyText":"Tens of thousands of people are at risk of being left out of pocket because of a growing “national scandal” involving pre-paid funeral plans, it was claimed this week. One consumer body that has investigated the sector said it believes some companies offering these plans could be operating a “quasi-Ponzi scheme”, where they allegedly use money from new customers to pay current claimants. About 1.3 million people in the UK have one of these plans, and it’s a rapidly growing market, with more than 200,000 sold last year. They are typically bought by older people to cover the cost of their funeral so their family doesn’t have to pick up the bill. But this is a controversial sector. Worryingly, the organisation set up by the industry to regulate providers concedes that a “small number” of non-member firms “are behaving inappropriately”. And 10 days ago the Financial Services Compensation Scheme, the official safety net for customers of financial firms that go bust, issued a warning that “individuals could lose out if their provider fails”. Now some funeral directors and consumer groups are claiming that parts of the sector are at risk of collapsing, and that in some cases middlemen are taking hundreds of pounds out of customers’ plans. Of course, with a prepaid funeral plan the person who bought it isn’t around when it is claimed on – and in some cases grieving families are being hit with unexpected extra bills at what is already a very difficult time. Plans tend to cost £3,000-£4,000 and are typically paid for via monthly instalments or a lump sum. What is covered varies between providers, and plans are sold in different ways – including by telephone and “in-home” sales agents – and there have been claims that some companies are using aggressive tactics. However, many people may be unaware of the commission and administration fees charged by some providers acting as middlemen between the customer and the funeral director. Funeral director Johanna Loveridge was astonished when a client bought a £3,420 plan, but only £2,535 went towards the funeral. “I wrote back saying, ‘Is there a mistake? Because this doesn’t seem right’ … and that’s how I found out there was an admin cost of almost £1,000,” she says. The fees, together with rising costs, mean there is sometimes barely enough to pay for the plan holder’s burial. “Companies are cutting corners when it comes to people cashing their plans in, so the families aren’t getting the standard they would expect,” Loveridge says. Death is an expensive business: insurer SunLife last year said the average funeral, not including the send-off, cost £3,897, and in May the Guardian reported that typical cremation and burial fees had risen by at least 5% in a year. Consumer group Fairer Finance, in partnership with Dignity, one of the largest funeral plan providers, published a report in July that called for stronger industry regulation. “It looks like some providers could be operating a quasi-Ponzi scheme, and we may see a Farepak-style collapse in the market,” James Daley, managing director of Fairer Finance, told Money, referring to the Christmas hamper business that went bust in 2006 leaving 116,000 people out of pocket. “I think people could lose a very significant amount of money.” The report warned that some providers could go bust, which could leave customers without the funerals for which they had paid. It also found some companies were aggressively marketing plans to over-50s, and that most customers did not understand what they had signed up for. The report added that “most plans” leave families carrying some of the costs, and that in the worst cases they can be left paying for a significant shortfall. “We’re heading for a national scandal. I think within 24 months we are going to see something quite nasty emerging,” says funeral director Lucy Coulbert. She adds: “I believe one particular company is relying on the fact that more people will take out pre-payment plans, which will top up the pot for the people who are dying now ... So every time a generation dies, hopefully the one underneath is still going to take out a plan, which means there is still money.” Strong market growth over the past decade has propped up the system, but if uptake starts slowing this could have disastrous consequences, Coulbert adds. She claims some customers are being ripped off by the plans. “As a funeral professional I wouldn’t let my grandmother touch one with a bargepole – they’re that bad.” Loveridge adds: “You don’t need to buy a plan; you just need to talk to your family and say: ‘Look, when the time comes this is what I want to happen’. I tell people to go and get an Isa ... that will make enough money to pay for most of a funeral.” According to Daley, some companies “brush over the detail and use phrases like ‘you’ll have nothing more to pay, you’ll have nothing to worry about, everything’s covered’. That just isn’t true.” When there is not enough money in a customer’s plan, some providers approach funeral directors and ask them to do the funeral cheaper, sometimes at a loss. “With one particular company, both myself and at least two other directors I know out-and-out refuse to accept their plans,” says Coulbert. “We cannot afford to undertake work for nothing.” She warns that funeral directors across the country may soon start refusing plans in greater numbers, fuelling concerns about a possible collapse. Bereaved and billed When Sue Willis’s father died just six months after buying a funeral plan, she assumed everything was taken care of. But when a £95 bill arrived from the funeral director she was surprised and decided to investigate. She found that while her father had handed over £3,685 in a lump sum payment, the plan provider had only paid the funeral director £3,047 towards the cost of his funeral. Another £638 was “missing”, presumably swallowed up by costs, and yet the funeral wasn’t fully covered. “I was told the cost was irrelevant to the plan holder because what you’re getting is a guarantee to provide a service for a fixed price at a particular time when you needed it. We got the bit that we were promised but had to pay an extra £95 when, as far as we could see there was an extra £600 floating around somewhere that hadn’t been accounted for. They took nearly 20% of what he gave them and then, to add insult to injury, [we were] charged a little bit more on top of that,” says Willis, who lives in Exeter. The provider told her that the crematorium had hiked its fees since the start of the plan. But the crematorium told Guardian Money it had not. When Willis got on to the Funeral Planning Authority (FPA), she was told her father’s plan provider had not breached any of its rules, so it could not take any action. “The FPA want to keep going and, because they are funded by the companies they oversee, I guess they don’t want to rock the boat too much,” she says. “They didn’t instil confidence.” Where the problems lie Funeral plans are not regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority or any other statutory regulator. Even though a pre-paid plan resembles an insurance product, the law exempts providers from regulation by the FCA if they put customers’ money either into a trust or a “whole of life” insurance policy. The vast majority of – if not all – providers make use of these exemptions. This also means consumers are unable to complain to the Financial Ombudsman Service and have no protection if a provider goes out of business. On 30 August the Financial Services Compensation Scheme issued a warning that, contrary to what some might think, it does not provide protection for individuals who have a funeral plan with a provider that fails. This is because the plans are not categorised as a “designated investment” under FSCS compensation rules. It added: “It is unlikely that the FSCS would be able to pay compensation directly to individuals.” It is not clear why the FSCS chose now to issue this warning, but there is no suggestion it was worried about a particular company. The Funeral Planning Authority was set up in 2002 by the industry to regulate providers. However, this is an “opt-in” scheme which has no substantive legal powers over providers. Of 70 complaints against providers it received last year, only five moved to the dispute resolution stage. “We have not taken formal disciplinary action in relation to any registered providers but, rather, have enforced customer resolution in particular situations, required that to be extended to any other affected -customers and required evidence to prove any breach or potential breach will not be repeated because remedial steps have been taken,” the FPA says. “The problems are largely to do with a small number of providers behaving inappropriately. Those are not FPA registered.” Neil Gray, Scottish National party MP for Airdrie &amp; Shotts, has been campaigning in this area. “The FPA needs some extra power to enforce their rules, and there needs to be a legal compulsion for those selling plans to be members.” James Daley at Fairer Finance says the solution lies in removing the exemption clause and forcing providers to be regulated by the FCA. However, concern still remains over high commission and administration fees of some FPA-registered providers. The FPA has dismissed claims that customers may lose all their money as unhelpful “scaremongering”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/lostinshowbiz/2017/sep/07/meghan-markle-perfect-fit-touchy-feely-royal-family-prince-harry","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-07T14:51:06Z","webTitle":"Meghan Markle is the perfect fit for our new touchy-feely royal family","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/lostinshowbiz/2017/sep/07/meghan-markle-perfect-fit-touchy-feely-royal-family-prince-harry","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/lostinshowbiz/2017/sep/07/meghan-markle-perfect-fit-touchy-feely-royal-family-prince-harry","fields":{"headline":"Meghan Markle is the perfect fit for our new touchy-feely royal family","bodyText":"Like me, you probably can’t get enough of the Generation Y royals talking about their feelings. I particularly enjoy the way these emotional sharings are praised as slightly more significant than the Reformation, as Princes William and Harry spearhead a great breaking away from All That and a move into Something Else Of Which One Unfortunately Suspects No Good Is Going To Come. Probably the standout thus far was the video they posted back in April, which featured William, Harry and Kate sitting round a picnic table in their jeans talking about stuff such as how hard new parenting can be. Hey – it’s cheaper to watch this than to earwig on it at Center Parcs, and I expect none of them had to stand up and find they had a nappy stuck to the bottom of their brown suede loafer and were late for the Owl Encounter. Anyway, there is a limit to how many times they can open up in any given month without sounding like your least repressed friend on six glasses of lady petrol, so it’s great to see the emotional reformation trickling down to supporting players. This week it’s the turn of Prince Harry’s girlfriend Meghan Markle, who makes the cover of Vanity Fair on the basis of her work in … hang on, let me get my reading glasses on … US TV legal drama Suits. Literally next on my list, once I’ve got through the box set of Prime Ministers’ Questions 1989-2017. For now, I can only offer my ongoing congratulations to Meghan’s agent, who probably isn’t familiar with the local term “jammy bastard”, but may care to familiarise himself with it. The accompanying Vanity Fair interview is a classic of its form, where the reader is required to wade through some agonisingly stultifying details as if it’s some kind of vision quest. Meghan has freckles – the freckles get more than 100 words. She’s from California – that gets an even longer run-out. Even details of what the interviewer and Meghan ate are presented as holy relics (this stuff is definitely in need of a reformation). “Markle had prepared a lunch of organic greens, a crusty bread to be dipped in olive oil, and pasta tossed with chillies bought from ‘a little place called Terroni, which they have in LA and in Toronto. They’re really hot, but if you’re good with heat, then I think they’re going to be your new favourite thing … I’ll give you a little jar to take home.’” Don’t worry, Meghan. Pretty sure you’re going to get the cover anyway. Having waded through the entire article, Lost in Showbiz can tell you that Meghan seems a very nice lady, and somehow manages to get through it suspending her disbelief that the magazine isn’t going to go with its eventual coverline “MEGHAN MARKLE – SHE’S JUST WILD ABOUT HARRY!” But with the best will in the world, we’re not here for the quality of chat, which is a particular strain of trite. On the basis of this interview, Meghan seems to talk in pre-butchered Andie McDowell lines. As students of her oeuvre will know, Andie has bungled more deliveries than Yodel, from having to be dubbed over by Glenn Close in Greystoke, to the sadly deathless scene in Four Weddings where she inquires: “Is it still raining? I hadn’t noticed.” Yet talk of rain must bring us back to the matter in hand. “It was raining in Toronto the day we met,” explains Meghan’s Vanity Fair interviewer, “and while this sounds corny, it also happens to be true: as she resumed speaking about Prince Harry, the sun came out, ushering in a brilliant, warm day.” You hadn’t noticed, until Vanity Fair battered you round the head with it. “We’re a couple,” Meghan explains of her gentleman caller, in a paragraph the mag just manages not to formally box up with the words MONEY SHOT. “We’re in love. I’m sure there will be a time when we will have to come forward and present ourselves and have stories to tell, but I hope what people will understand is that this is our time. This is for us. It’s part of what makes it so special, that it’s just ours. But we’re happy. Personally, I love a great love story.” Other than that, Meghan projects such a jaw-slacking image of blandness that she would be the perfect candidate to make up a four at a picnic table at some point in the future. In that imagined video, she and Harry and William and Kate could discuss the reaction to this Vanity Fair interview, and how they felt about it. This would tee up a future video in which they returned to discuss how they felt about the reaction to the video of them saying how they felt about the interview. And so on, until the essential mystery of the royal family is safeguarded in perpetuity. As I say, I am all for this great opening up, but I would really like to see the policy expanded to the people who have to do stuff such as put the toothpaste on the royal toothbrushes for them and clean their helicopters and whatnot. How does that make those people feel? Do they feel valued? Part of something? Or somehow strangely still searching for meaning, like they fear they might be – to quote Prince Harry – “on the verge of punching someone”? Or have I misunderstood the parameters of the policy, and it isn’t going to reach down to the servants? At present, the rules seem dangerously unclear, and I must urge the royals return to the Picnic Table of Candour to clear them up at their very earliest convenience."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"news/2017/sep/08/lauri-love-british-hacker-anonymous-extradition-us","type":"article","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-08T05:00:30Z","webTitle":"Keyboard warrior: the British hacker fighting for his life","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2017/sep/08/lauri-love-british-hacker-anonymous-extradition-us","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/2017/sep/08/lauri-love-british-hacker-anonymous-extradition-us","fields":{"headline":"Keyboard warrior: the British hacker fighting for his life","bodyText":"In October 2013, Lauri Love was drinking coffee in his dressing gown in his bedroom at his parents’ house in the village of Stradishall, Suffolk, when his mother called upstairs to say there was a deliveryman at the front door. Love, whose first name is pronounced “Lowry”, like the English painter, clomped downstairs. In the front doorway was a man dressed in a UPS uniform. “Are you Lauri Love?” the man asked. “Yes,” Love said. In a single motion, the man grabbed Love’s arm while presenting, not a package, but a pair of rattling handcuffs. For the next five hours, while dusk turned to evening outside, Love, then 28, and his parents sat in the front room as a dozen or so men from the National Crime Agency, which investigates organised crime and other serious offences, checked the computers in the house. In Love’s bedroom, they found two laptops, and a PC tower humming on his desk. Among the bewildering Rolodex of open tabs in Love’s internet browsers, the officers found accounts logged into several hacker forums and arcane internet chatrooms. Downstairs, Love, who knew that anything said in these limbo moments of investigation could be later used against him, kept the conversation to small talk about the weather and football. A little before midnight, Love was told that he was being arrested on suspicion of offences under the 1990 Computer Misuse Act, which covers, among other things, criminal hacking. He was not informed of what crimes he had allegedly committed, and was pressed into the back of an unmarked car, and driven to the police investigation centre in Bury St Edmunds. Love’s computers, along with USB drives and old computing hardware, much of which belonged to his father, a computing enthusiast, left, too. Love, who was subsequently diagnosed with Asperger syndrome – a form of autism that causes him to fret and obsess – did press-ups in his cell until, in the early hours of the morning, he fell into a brief and fitful sleep. Later that day, still without any clear indication of what he was supposed to have done, Love was released with pre-charge bail conditions that he surrender his passports (one British, one Finnish) and agree to only access the internet while using his real name. When the family arrived home, they found reporters camped in their garden. What did the journalists know that the Loves did not? The answer came the following day: as Love was lying facedown on his bed, he heard a Radio 4 bulletin state that the son of a Suffolk vicar had been charged for hacking into computers belonging to the US government . In fact, Love had not yet been charged with anything and, in October 2014, 12 months after his initial arrest, the Crown Prosecution Service announced that it no longer intended to prosecute. Love’s bail was cancelled and, for a moment, it seemed as though he was free – the victim, perhaps, of an international misunderstanding or a bungle. Then, in July 2015, Love was rearrested by the Metropolitan police, and spent a night at HMP Thameside, a Serco-run prison in south-east London, before being returned to his parents’ house. This time, Love’s pursuer was not the British criminal justice system, but the US government, which accused him of helping to orchestrate and wage cyber-attacks on official websites including those belonging to the Federal Reserve, Nasa and the US army between 2012 and 2013. Love, they claim, along with three other unnamed co-conspirators in Australia and Sweden, stole sensitive military data and personal information belonging to more than 100,000 government employees. He is wanted for crimes including conspiracy, fraud and identity theft in no fewer than three judicial US districts – the Southern District of New York, New Jersey, and the Eastern District of Virginia – a record unmatched by any foreign or domestic terrorist (but by at least one other hacker). Love has not protested his innocence – he only points out that, without seeing the evidence, which the US Department of Justice refuses to reveal until he is on US soil, he cannot say one way or the other. But he had the means, motive and opportunity to carry out the crimes of which he stands accused. Even if Love is guilty, however, there are important legal and moral questions about whether he should be extradited to the US – a nation that has prosecuted hackers with unrivalled severity, and one where Love could be sentenced to spend the rest of his life in prison. Four years after his initial arrest, Love has nearly exhausted his legal options. His extradition to the US is now perilously close. In September 2016, a district judge refused to blockLove’s deportation. His remaining hope for mercy is a final appeal against extradition in the high court in November. Love’s hope is for a full and fair trial in Britain. Even if he is found guilty in a British court of the most serious crimes in the US government’s indictment, his legal team estimate that he faces just a few months in prison. Failure means Love will be flown to a holding facility in New York, placed on suicide watch and probably forced to take antidepressants, prior to a trial. If he refuses to accept a plea deal and is convicted, he will face $9m (£6.8m) in fines and, experts estimate, a prison term of up to 99 years, a punishment illustrative of the US’s aggressive sentencing against hackers under the controversial Computer Fraud and Abuse Act. To his supporters, Love’s case is crucial in establishing a precedent to prevent the US government from pursuing disproportionate and unjust claims against hackers, particularly on foreign soil. “Lauri’s case is critically important in determining the reach of America’s unusually harsh punitive sanctions for computer crimes,” says Naomi Colvin, who works for the Courage Foundation, the human rights group providing Love with legal support (its other seven beneficiaries include the whistleblowers Edward Snowden and Chelsea Manning). Furthermore, the case will illustrate the extent to which British judges now consider human rights when assessing deportation claims. Love’s defence team argues that the US prison system is unable to provide their client, who suffers from depression and bouts of untreatable eczema, with a basic level of care to meet his physical and mental health needs. “It’s difficult to see how anyone can be so obviously under the threat of suicide and yet we would still extradite,” says Karen Todner, Love’s UK lawyer. “To extradite would be horrendous; It would make a mockery of the Human Rights Act.” “I will kill myself before I’m put on a plane to America,” Love tells me. “They can use as much violence against me as they want, but my will is sovereign over my body and my life.” Yet the stakes are not only high for Love. Following the publication of an FBI report showing that Russian government-sponsored hacking groups interfered with the 2016 US presidential elections, the US appetite to make examples of foreign hackers has only intensified. Hacking, once viewed as a kind of prank carried out by wayward geeks, is now seen as a crucial weapon by foreign governments and organised crime. “The US must make every possible effort to pursue [Lauri Love],” says Michael Smith, a cyber-terrorism expert who provides consultancy to members of Congress and the National Security Council. “They must do everything in their powers to deter others from engaging in the same activities Love is accused of undertaking against the US government.” * * * On the evening of Friday 25 January 2013, hackers who had broken into the website of the US Sentencing Commission, which sets guidelines for sentencing in US federal courts, took down the site’s front page and replaced it with a 10-minute YouTube video. The video, narrated in the detuned Stephen Hawking-esque computer voice favoured by soapboxing hackers, declared a cyberwar against the US judicial system for departing from “the noble ideals in which it was born and enshrined”. The long list of complaints in the video centred on the “disproportionate persecution” of hackers by prosecutors operating “in the interests of oppression or personal gain”. Responsibility for the cyber-attack was claimed by a group connected to Anonymous, the disparate hacktivist collective best known for its ideologically motivated pranks and rictus-grinning Guy Fawkes face masks. The group also claimed to have infiltrated a host of other government websites and collected troves of sensitive data. That information, which Anonymous did not specify, other than to claim it contained “secrets”, was then packaged up in a series of password-encrypted files (each named after a different US Supreme Court justice) and quietly uploaded to the internet. It was a digital ransom note: meet our demands for judicial reform, or we will release the password to the sensitive documents “We have not taken this action lightly, or without consideration of the possible consequences,” the authors said. “It is our hope that this warhead need never be detonated.” News of the hack quickly spread. “Anonymous hackers target US agency site,” stated one BBC headline. By the end of the weekend, the video had been viewed more than 1m times, with the US Sentencing Commission website repeatedly collapsing due to the vast amount of traffic it was drawing. On the Sunday, the hackers added an Easter egg: visitors who entered a classic video game cheat code were treated to a version of the arcade game Asteroids. (Shooting at the webpage revealed the text: “We do not forgive. We do not forget,” along with an image of the Guy Fawkes mask.) It took the government a week to close whatever backdoors the hackers had used – the website now read, simply, “under construction” – but it had not been able to contain the embarrassment. “Feds stumbling after Anonymous launches Operation Last Resort”, a tech blog teased. The US government had been made to look amateurish during a high-profile game of cat-and-mouse, and news outlets had amplified the embarrassment. According to the FBI, Love, who has been a skilled computer programmer since childhood (“When I look at computer code it’s like all I can hear is static,” Love’s father, Alexander, a prison chaplain, told me. “Lauri looks at code, he can hear the music”) was one of the leaders of the hack. In the months before the attack, an agent monitoring an online message room frequented by Love allegedly saw him describing the vulnerabilities of various US government websites. This was not news. In 2012, several months before the Anonymous hack, Chris Gates, a computer security expert for Uber in Washington DC, highlighted vulnerabilities in the US government’s website infrastructure at a conference in Boston. Gates even uploaded slideshows identifying which specific sites were vulnerable. According to the FBI, Love was recorded chatting to other hackers about stealing credit card details, although US prosecutors have not specified who was being targeted, how the numbers would have been harvested, or whether this was connected to the website hacks. Love’s braggadocio was, however, clear. In one exchange, he allegedly said: “You have no idea how much we can fuck with the US government if we wanted to.” By the time their video went live, the Anonymous hackers had been illegally collecting data from US government websites for several weeks. The unauthorised access was allegedly gained by exploiting vulnerabilities in Adobe ColdFusion, software designed to build and administer websites and databases that is notoriously riddled with weak points. The trigger for the public attack, however, was much more recent: the highly publicised death of the US computer programmer and hacktivist Aaron Swartz 15 days earlier. Swartz killed himself in his New York flat on 11 January while awaiting trial for alleged computer crimes. Those crimes were, his supporters claim, negligible and perhaps even justifiable. In late 2010, Swartz entered a utility closet at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, hooked a laptop up to the university’s servers and set it to download more than 4m documents from JSTOR, a database of academic journals that had been criticised by information activists for its prohibitively high access fees. Love first heard about Swartz in 2001, when Swartz was working with the World Wide Web Consortium – the group, founded and led by Tim Berners-Lee, that sets the standards for the internet. Love was instantly beguiled. He saw Swartz as a pioneering visionary, building and fighting for a free and open internet. The following year, when Love was 17, he joined Swhack!, an internet chat channel founded by Swartz as a place to discuss everything from ideas to improve the internet to poetry, philosophy, linguistics and artificial intelligence. While Love was involved in neither politics nor activism at the time, he says that Swartz’s ideology began to shape his philosophy deeply. “I started to see the power of the internet to make good things happen in the world.” Following his arrest, federal prosecutors pursued Swartz with the same zeal with which they now pursue Love. Swartz was indicted on a raft of charges that carried a potential jail sentence of 35 years, even though neither JSTOR nor MIT pressed charges. The main prosecutor in the case, Stephen Heymann, went so far as to liken Swartz to a rapist. Swartz’s supporters pointed out he had not technically hacked anything – he had legally accessed the JSTOR database, in part to make a point about the public distribution of academic research, much of which is publicly funded. “The act was harmless,” Tim Wu, a law professor at Columbia University, wrote at the time. “JSTOR suffered no economic loss.” Many hackers, including Love, believe Swartz was targeted for retribution by the US government. Swartz was the co-author of DeadDrop, software that allows whistleblowers to send sensitive documents securely to journalists – now used by media outlets around the world under the name SecureDrop. “The secret service had a grudge against him,” Love said. Swartz’s software appeared at a moment when US authorities had suffered a series of embarrassments at the hands of whistleblowers. “He was ‘caught’ downloading these journal articles when the US government had just got Chelsea Manning,” Love told me. Love describes the day he heard the news of Swartz’s death as one of the darkest in his life. “I screamed,” he tells me. “I cried a lot. I shouted at the internet.” Once that initial shock dulled, Love’s disbelief began to darken into anger – directed at the prosecutors that he regards as Swartz’s murderers. “That the United States criminal justice system did not tie the noose around Aaron’s neck themselves is immaterial,” he says. Love will not confirm or deny his participation in Operation Last Resort, although he tells me that he sees those who pursued Swartz as “self-interested prosecutors”, men and women with political aspirations trying to “put notches on their belt”. The US Army Investigation Command, for its part, claims to have traced the attacks to Love through an IP address in Romania, allegedly paid for via a Paypal account registered to a gmail account registered in his name. On 27 February 2014, a little more than a year after the Anonymous hack and four months after Love’s initial arrest, Preet Bharara, then the attorney for the Southern District of New York, accused Love of having played an instrumental role in the attack. “Lauri Love is a sophisticated hacker who broke into Federal Reserve computers, stole sensitive personal information, and made it widely available, leaving people vulnerable to malicious use of that information,” he said. George Venizelos, FBI assistant director-in-charge of the New York office, said: “Fortunately, Love underestimated the level of sophistication and dedication maintained by the FBI Cyber Division” – his swagger matching his target’s alleged online comments about the US government. * * * The allegations against Love came at a sensitive time for the US government, following a string of high-profile cases involving information leaks by politically motivated hackers. Four months prior to Love’s initial arrest, Manning had been sentenced to 35 years in prison for leaking nearly 750,000 classified or sensitive military and diplomatic documents. (Her sentence was subsequently commuted by Barack Obama.) It was the same year that Matt DeHart, the former US Air National Guard intelligence analyst who claimed to have documents related to CIA misconduct, tried to flee the US and find asylum in Canada (he has subsequently agreed a plea deal). And it was a few months after Barrett Brown, a US journalist with ties to Anonymous, was arrested for a string of alleged offences related to the distribution of sensitive information – although most of the charges were dropped in 2014. In each case, the US government pursued its targets with threats of wildly punitive sentences, often in search of plea bargains that would drastically reduce the sentence in exchange for an admission of guilt. “The prosecutorial culture is to aggressively pursue – this has been true since the first hacker trials almost 30 years ago,” says James Lewis, a cybersecurity expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington DC. “It’s standard operating procedure for this kind of hack.” The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, which, put simply, prohibits unauthorised access to protected computers and networks, was first used in 1989, three years after its introduction, to indict Robert Morris Jr, son of the then-chief scientist at the NSA’s National Computer Security Center. Morris, who was then a Cornell graduate student, was sentenced to three years’ probation and 400 hours of community service for creating and distributing the Morris worm, a piece of software that would slow down a computer to the point where it became unusable. Morris, who is now a tenured professor at MIT, received a more lenient sentence than the hundreds of hackers who have subsequently been prosecuted under the act. The law’s loose definition, its critics argue, has been stretched far beyond that which lawmakers intended, allowing the full force of criminal law to be used against petty pranksters and digital vandals – usually those who challenge power, either through the causes they espouse, or because their actions cause embarrassment to those in authority. One civil liberties group campaigning for reform of the act describes it as “infamously problematic”. In 2012, for example, the act was used to prosecute the hacker and neo-Nazi troll Andrew Auernheimer, better known as Weev, for accessing unprotected data that was freely available on an AT&amp;T website. In 2013, the journalist Matthew Keys was indicted with providing a member of Anonymous with login credentials that granted access to edit the website of the Los Angeles Times. Only one headline was altered – a prank that was quickly rectified – yet Keys faced up to 25 years in prison under the act (he was sentenced to two). As a result, British hackers who are charged with breaking into US computer systems are understandably eager to be tried in the UK. At least 12 individuals have been successful in this aim, including Mustafa Al-Bassam and Jake Davis, who are both avid supporters of Love. Tor Ekeland, the attorney who represented Auernheimer and Keys, and now represents Love, has called the act “a poorly written statute that doesn’t effectively define the main thing it seeks to prohibit”, namely the precise definition of unauthorised access. “There are ambiguities surrounding that definition that allow prosecutors wide latitude to bring charges under theories that shock computer people in the infosec [IT security] community.” Love’s first dalliance with the hacking community came in his early teens, when he retreated online and fell in with a clandestine yet benevolent hacktivist organisation called the Cyber Army. They were simpler times, before hacking, be it for fun or resistance, was complicated by its associations with cruelty, snark and the racism that has flowered in online forums such as 4chan and Something Awful. The Cyber Army was intended to be a wholesome club for promising young computer programmers, although Love admits that its members would often deface websites to show off their talent. The group had a military-style hierarchy, and Love, who once laid telephone extension cables under the family’s carpets so that he could connect to the internet without his parents knowing, soon reached the rank of general. “It was all relatively boy scout-y stuff compared to what I got involved with later,” he says. During this time, Love says he became more involved with Anonymous, which was evolving from a loosely coordinated, dispersed group of internet pranksters to something more organised and political. One of the group’s earliest targets was the Church of Scientology, whose well-documented attempts to suppress information via high-stakes legal cases typify the kind of institutionalised abuses of power that now fuel Anonymous’s activism. Love became involved in low-level attacks, tying up the church’s fax machines with a cascade of black pages. The activism moved from the digital realm to the physical after Love joined Glasgow University in 2011 to study physics and computer science. There he became committed to a seven-month sit-in protest staged against funding cuts and rising tuition fees at the university. “My problem is I jump into things and get completely engrossed because of my Asperger’s,” he tells me. “It gave an immediate sense of having done something meaningful; I completely neglected my academic studies.” Early into the sit-in, 60 Strathclyde police officers in full riot gear and supported by a dog unit and a helicopter were called in to shunt the protesters out of the building. It was, one participant recalled, a traumatic event, and the police’s heavy-handedness may have hardened Love’s attitude to authority. Love became increasingly committed to political causes (at the time, his Twitter screen name was “Smedley Butler”, after a major-general in the US Marines famous for his 1935 book criticising US foreign policy, War Is a Racket) but the activism took a toll on his physical and mental health. In his second year of study, Love was evicted from his shared flat in Glasgow following a drug bust in which a small quantity of cannabis was found in a sofa. He called home to ask that his family come to collect him. “I broke down in tears thinking that I had thrown away my life again,” he says. Back in Suffolk, directionless and without a focus for his political energies, Love fell into a bout of depression. A few months later, he heard about Swartz’s death. * * * Love’s extradition hearing took place at Westminster magistrates court on a grey London day in September last year. Love was surprised, he tells me, at what he perceived to be the laissez-faire attitude of the prosecution team, which had seemingly prepared little material. “We were certain that we were going to win, as much because of how little effort the other side put in as anything else.” Love’s defence team, by contrast, called numerous expert witnesses to build a careful case, based on legal precedent. The defence team’s argument hinged on the idea that to extradite Love to the US would be a denial of his human rights. They argued that US federal prisons such as Metropolitan Detention Center, Brooklyn, to which Love would be transferred, are unable to meet the needs of someone with acute Asperger’s. (The prison did not respond to requests for comment.) Simon Baron-Cohen, the director of Cambridge University’s Autism Research Centre, who first diagnosed Love with Asperger syndrome in 2015, was called as an expert witness. When the pair first met at the Courage Foundation’s office, Baron-Cohen tells me, Love had “hundreds, possibly thousands” of bookmarks and tabs open on his laptop. During his assessment with Baron-Cohen, Love scored 32 out of 50 on the Autism Quotient. Only 2% of the general population score this highly. In the trial, Baron-Cohen explained that Love was likely to be unable to cope with the noise levels in a US prison, or away from the support of his family. After the Loves moved to Lowestoft, when Lauri was 16, the stress of the upheaval caused his hair to fall out. Later, he was twice hospitalised due to infections caused by his eczema. During his bouts of depression, Love says, he can consider suicide as often as four times a week. The prosecution, meanwhile, called into question Love’s autism and mental health diagnoses, claiming that his conditions were either faked or exaggerated. “He needs a better story,” Lewis tells me. “There’s a long tradition of mobsters in the US discovering ailments after arrest, going to court in their bathrobes and so on. The Feds have seen it all. If it was a state court, I’d advise him to announce that he has found God, carry a bible and shout ‘Hallelujah’ – but this is a federal case, so he won’t get much sympathy.” (“I find that suggestion offensive,” Baron-Cohen tells me.) “I am going to extradite Mr Love,” said the district judge Nina Tempia in her summary. Love sat impassively in the dock while his mother put her head in her hands. A gasp went up in the public gallery. “The judge did not reject his mental health issues,” Alexander Love told me, a few months later. “The working was right but she gave the wrong answer.” Following the judgment, more than 100 MPs signed a joint letter to Obama in his final month in office, asking that any criminal proceedings against Love take place in Britain. The US administration did not respond. Now, the only thing standing between Love and a US trial is the high court appeal. Even if Love is guilty of all the charges against him – retributively breaking into flimsy US government servers, copying sensitive information and discussing with others what might be done with the haul – how could a life sentence fit a crime that cost not one person one cent? “It’s an invitation to dance, and it’s a shame Love didn’t figure that out,” Lewis says. “Most governments generally disapprove of people breaking into military facilities but the grave sentence is also a negotiating tactic. The Department of Justice always starts with something draconian and the actual sentence ends up with community service or a few months wearing orange in a minimum-security prison.” But Love’s decision to fight the extradition – instead of pleading guilty in exchange for the promise of a lighter sentence in US prison – “may have taken these options off the table”, Lewis says. Love believes the explanation may be even simpler. “Being hacked is great for creative accountancy,” he told me. According to Love, at the US Department of Energy, one of the victims of the alleged hacks, employee details were stored in a database that was 20 years out of date. “They had plans to fix this, like, a decade ago, and they just hadn’t been actioned.” In effect, the US government is likely to assess damages – perhaps up to $60m, Love claims – according to what it would cost to shore up the pre-existing security holes that Love is accused of exploiting. “Nothing has to be substantiated,” Love says. Ironically, governments and companies often offer huge “bug bounties” to hackers who expose similar weaknesses in their technology. “They will happily pay people to get that same information that they found out from this alleged compromise,” he says. It wasn’t supposed to be like this. In 2012, after facing widespread criticism, Theresa May – then the home secretary – withdrew a 2006 order to extradite the autistic Scottish IT worker Gary McKinnon, who was accused of hacking into nearly 100 US military and Nasa computers in 2001 and 2002. McKinnon, who claimed he was searching for hidden evidence of UFO activity, allegedly deleted critical files from US government computers and posted a message reading “Your security is crap” on a US military website. May still appears to view her decision as a legal triumph; she referenced the case in her first speech as prime minister, saying: “I was told I couldn’t stop Gary McKinnon’s extradition, but I stood up to the American government and I stopped it.” But after blocking McKinnon’s deportation, she moved to amend UK extradition law to introduce a “forum bar”, in which judges may rule that the US is not the proper forum for a trial if the alleged criminality largely took place in Britain, or if the suspect is particularly vulnerable. Critics, however, argue that the forum bar was principally a ploy to absolve any home secretary from having to get their hands dirty in this kind of internationally sensitive situation. Indeed, following Love’s initial court case, the current home secretary, Amber Rudd, wrote him a letter claiming that her hands were tied. The forum bar is yet to be successfully argued in any legal case. Todner, the London lawyer who has represented both McKinnon and Love, tells me that “the general attitude of judges is that the extradition treaty overrules the forum bar”. If this is the case, then the legislation is not worth the vellum on which it is written. The November appeal of Love’s extradition will be the first – and likely final – substantive test of May’s forum bar. “If the forum bar doesn’t work for me, it’s hard to see how it could ever work to protect anyone,” Love says. Todner agrees: “If it succeeds then the UK police will have a green light to take more prosecutions here and not bow to the US pressure to extradite.” And if it fails? Many more British people will face extradition to the US, where they will find, as Colvin puts it, “long prison sentences, horrible prison conditions and plea bargaining”. Love, meanwhile, waits. The University of Suffolk has suspended his studies in electrical engineering, pending the outcome of the extradition hearings. (“Immoral,” Alexander Love tells me. “You don’t rob someone on the basis of something that might happen.”) The university’s decision is especially painful in the knowledge that, had Love been allowed to stand trial in the UK following his initial arrest, and had he pled guilty to every charge, he would have spent a maximum of 18 months in prison. “It’s a particularly vindictive way they have gone about all of this,” Alexander Love says. “No evidence has been disclosed. No harm has been done. But they obviously feel that they want to make Lauri a deterrent. If you mess with us, they’re saying, this is what we can do to you.” * * * At a picnic bench in a clearing in Nutley Forest in East Sussex, on an agreeably warm June afternoon, Love leans over a battered laptop pocked with stickers. (“Don’t feed the Google”; “Leak more docs”.) After a moment of frustration, he hisses at the computer: “I will fucking stab you.” In 15 minutes’ time, he is due to speak at the inaugural Byline festival, an event designed to champion journalism, freedom of speech and diversity – “Woodstock for the Facebook generation”, as the organisers put it. Love is not here to discuss his legal case, but the recent WannaCry hacking attack, in which organised criminals sought to hold to ransom hundreds of thousands of computers – including some belonging to the NHS – in more than 150 countries. His laptop, however, is not playing along. Love is typically gentle and affable, bright-spoken and witty. (“What’s in your bag outside,” I asked, the first time we met. “State secrets,” he replied, without missing a beat.) But in the oncoming glare of this public speaking engagement, frustration has curdled into rage. His long-term girlfriend, the fashion model Sylvia Mann, leans over, places a hand on Love’s shoulder and softly helps him. Love settles back into his seat, calmed. His speech, the first of the festival, is delivered to a smattering of an audience. Love speaks confidently. Afterwards, he and Mann share a minute-long embrace in the front row, while someone fetches him a congratulatory beer. It’s clear that Love’s appearance here is part of a campaign to show himself to be a useful asset to his country. Love was one of a group of British hackers and computer scientists who worked around the clock to disarm the WannaCry attack. He tells me that he is now considering setting up a social enterprise scheme to steer bright, young, web-savvy people away from digital vandalism towards more productive pursuits. “I wasted my youth on the internet,” he says. “I need to somehow harness that experience so others don’t. I want to be able to make a contribution to society.” There is a moral hazard to hacking young, he says. “The internet distances you from the effects of your actions.” The internet also distances us from ideas of national borders, laws and sovereignty. Should a criminal be prosecuted in the country in which a website is browsed, or the country in which the website is hosted? “The internet isn’t borderless,” says Lewis. “It’s an illusion created by the speed of connectivity. The internet lets you commit a crime in one country while living in another, but it’s still a crime. The practice under international law is that the accused should face trial in the country where they committed the crime.” Todner, who successfully fought McKinnon’s extradition, disagrees, stating simply: “He was in this country when any crime may have been committed.” Harnessing this generation rather than criminalising it is, Love believes, the key to defending ourselves from the gathering deluge of cybercrime. Since his name was made public, Love tells me that he has been approached “more times than I care to remember” by criminal groups asking if he would help them hack a bank, or skim a cashpoint. “We’re at the point now where lives are at risk because of insecurity,” he says, referring to the WannaCry attack. The argument for countries to find a way, where possible, to enlist hackers rather than prosecute them is a persuasive one, especially when governments lack funding to fight cybercrime as well as knowledge about where best to deploy their limited funds. It is a position shared by Davis, a friend of Love’s and a former hacker associated with Anonymous, who was arrested in 2011 for targeting Sony, the CIA, the UK’s Serious Organised Crime Agency and News International. (He replaced the Sun’s homepage with a fake story claiming Rupert Murdoch had died.) “Lauri is ridiculously talented,” says Davis, who served just 38 days in a young offender institute for his attacks on US computer networks. “The word that keeps coming to mind throughout this whole ordeal is ‘waste’. It’s such a waste of time, money and effort to attempt to extradite him, and an even bigger waste of talent.” But there is little reason to believe that the British or US governments are likely to heed Davis’s advice. Last month, the US arrested the 23-year-old British IT expert Marcus Hutchins while he was attending an annual hacker conference in Las Vegas, accusing him of helping to design a piece of malware two years ago. Hutchins, who became famous for finding the “kill switch” that defused the WannaCry attack, denies all the charges against him. But according to a report in the Times, GCHQ knew that Hutchins was under US investigation and, in taking a plane to North America, had flown into a trap. One source stated that the FBI waited until Hutchins was on US soil before attempting to make an arrest – precisely to avoid the kind of lengthy extradition battle in which Love is embroiled. As Love drinks a beer from a plastic cup outside the tent where he gave his speech, I ask him what the best outcome for all of this might be. “We avert an ecological crisis and humanity still has a civilisation in 100 years?” he says, with a smile. “Unlikely,” I say. “No, for you, I mean?” “I often think about how I would kill myself,” he says, after a moment. “Maybe I’ll jump in front of that bus? So I have to concentrate on understanding that there is a beneficial purpose to my going through this. People died for the legal rights and protections we enjoy in the UK. People died for the right to not be held up pending your trial. People died fighting for the right to see the evidence.” • Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, or sign up to the long read weekly email here. • This article was amended on 8 September 2017.

A local institution touting a menu of Tuscan-influenced daily specials such as ribollita, summer panzanella salads, arista (oven-roasted pork), herbed coniglio porchettato (rabbit), potato topini and simple pastas either dressed in tomato or a slow-cooked hunter’s meat ragù. Despite incredible popularity, its prices hover between €5 for pasta and soup primi and €15 for secondi. • Piazza di San Lorenzo, 8r, +39 055 281941, on Facebook Duomo, Baptistery and Giotto’s Campanile Coquinarius Offering a welcome break from heavy Tuscan classics, Coquinarius is a stone’s throw away from Piazza del Duomo. Here, you’ll find the best tagliere (charcuterie) boards in town, speciality pastas and bistro mains such as chianina beef tartares, heritage cinta senese pork spare ribs, courgette-flower savoury tarts, all averaging €10-€15 a plate. This place also has one of the most-intriguing wine lists in town, showcasing smaller, independent producers, helmed by a superior sommelier in Nicola Schirru. • Via delle Oche, 11r, +39 055 2302153, coquinarius.com Ponte Vecchio Mangiapizza Just off the Ponte Vecchio on a little-known shortcut alley to the Uffizi gallery, Mangiapizza is a small, street-food style pizzeria that specialises in ciabatte (meaning slippers in Italian) with a tempting array of toppings including truffles, aged balsamic, courgette flowers and burrata cheese. Additionally, the pizza bases are made from scratch using slow-risen doughs made from Italian-grown grain and topped by sauce made from organic heirloom tomatoes. Pizzas start at €6. A bonus is the selection of Italian craft beers and sparkling wines. • Via Lambertesca, 24/26r, mangiapizzafirenze.it Oltrano artisan quarter: Palazzo Pitti, Boboli Gardens, Santo Spirito Il Magazzino On one of Florence’s most beautiful squares, is the unique Osteria Il Magazzino run by Luca Cai, a former photolithographer who became a chef. With Il Magazzino, Luca has transformed Florence’s signature street food lampredotto (a dish made from the fourth stomach of the cow) serving it in several ways, from fried meatballs to stuffed in ravioli and topped with heritage sweet-onion sauce or in tempura, nodding to Luca’s time spent teaching Tuscan cuisine in Japan. For offal refuseniks, there are luscious pastas, notably pillowy-soft gnocchi with candied tomato and thick pici pasta with kale pesto. A generous plate of pasta and decent table wine from nearby Chianti will cost less than less than €20. • Piazza della Passera 2/3, on Facebook Trattoria Cammillo The only drawback is this institutional trattoria rests on Tuesdays and Wednesdays, however its pastas, fried artichokes and courgette flowers, nearly rare T-bone bistecca fiorentina, soups laced with its family-produced olive oil and organic table wine are always worth the visit for either lunch or dinner. This has been run by the same family for more than 50 years, at the doorstep of the Santo Spirito artisan district. Affable waiters wear dapper attire and some have worked here for more than 20 years. The menu is long but all is made freshly in house, and prices for primi start at €10, with mains on the richer side of €30. Ideal for groups who’d like to share several dishes, or couples looking for a slightly higher-quality experience at a historic restaurant. • Borgo San Jacopo 57R, on Facebook San Niccolò: Rose Garden, Piazzale Michelangelo, Forte Belvedere Zeb Gastronomia San Niccolò is a charming and compact quarter, and a good base for visiting the panoramic Piazzale Michelangelo, the Rose and Iris Gardens, Forte Belvedere and the San Niccolò tower. Zeb is a modern interpretation of the Italian delicatessen and tavola calda (hot buffet) where the menu consists of dishes (mostly bakes and roasts) made in advance, soups and gourmet pastas. The bar-eating set-up and minimalist décor make it a perfect choice for couples and solo travellers. There’s an intriguing wine list full of natural and organic biodynamic selections, along with Italian craft beer. Go for ethereal fresh pasta, like ricotta and truffle cappellacci, made by hand by the mother-and-son team, and a selection of hot dishes, such as aubergine parmigiana, roasted herb-rich rabbit or stuffed courgette and cabbage rolls, all lined up behind the glass-shielded counter. Pastas start at €12 (the pear and pecorino large cappellacci are most memorable) and mains cost between €10 and €15, with a couple of truffle wild cards in the €20 arena, such as burrata (creamy mozzarella) with fresh truffle shavings. • Via San Miniato 2, zebgastronomia.com Osteria Antica Mescita San Niccolò Also in San Niccolò, this kitsch trattoria is surprisingly cheap and sweet: soups, such as pappa al pomodoro (tomato), and pastas cost about €6, and mains, such as steak and potatoes, are under €20. The bruschetta, loaded with fresh tomato, deserves a special mention. The food isn’t of phenomenal quality but the restaurant is worth a mention for its convenient location, outdoor seating and fair pricing – plus it’s an ideal stop for families. • Via di San Niccolò 60r, osteriasanniccolo.it Basilica di Santa Croce, Bargello Museum Ristorante del Fagioli Booking is a must for this fixture in Florence’s dining history, run by the same family since 1966. It is named for a poet at the Medici court, but the menu is crammed with fagioli dishes, evident in choices ranging from ribollita soup, chickpea pancakes and a white-bean side dish to accompany steak. Everything is prepared from scratch in the morning and it’s open for lunch and dinner Monday to Friday. The wine list is exclusively Tuscan, the house wine very drinkable, and it serves arguably one of the best T-bone steaks in town – a certificate proves its local provenance. This is the place to try some of Florence’s disappearing signature dishes, such as taccole flatbeans in tomato and garlic, and penne strascicate, a poor man’s dish of pasta tossed – or dragged – in a pan of leftover meat sauce. • Corso dei Tintori, 47r, on Facebook Coral Sisk is a culinary tour guide in Florence and founder of Curious Appetite"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"music/2017/sep/07/george-michael-new-single-fantasy-nile-rodgers","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-07T08:10:39Z","webTitle":"George Michael's new single Fantasy – a rework full of sex, funk and fabulousness","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/sep/07/george-michael-new-single-fantasy-nile-rodgers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2017/sep/07/george-michael-new-single-fantasy-nile-rodgers","fields":{"headline":"George Michael's new single Fantasy – a rework full of sex, funk and fabulousness","bodyText":"The last time George Michael launched a big new single, it was at the closing ceremony of the 2012 Olympics in London, where he chose – to the chagrin of many – to perform the deeply middling White Light rather than any number of his solo or Wham!-era classics. There’s rather more poignancy today as another new single arrives – the first new music since he died aged 53 at home on Christmas Day last year, after suffering from a heart condition, dilated cardiomyopathy. There was a tremendous outpouring of public grief and fondness, as people remembered Michael’s kindness (he would frequently make philanthropic gestures large and small, planned and impulsive) and his rockstar foibles – such as the time he drove into a Hampstead branch of Snappy Snaps. Adele and Chris Martin led the musical tributes, at the Grammy and Brit awards respectively. While recent years hadn’t yielded classic material, it was a major wrench – the loss of an artist with a rare emotional clarity who took queerness into the mainstream. Hopes that it would be a brand new classic are slightly dashed – it’s a rework of Fantasy, a 1990 B-side included on Freedom! ’90 in the US and Waiting for That Day in the UK, later featured on a 2016 reissue of Listen Without Prejudice. But it’s now been given a substantial refresh. Where the original is driven by a 90s breakbeat and some even more 90s horns, this new version has been pioneered by Nile Rodgers, who George apparently commissioned before he died. “I hope we make the fans proud of the amount of love we put into it,” Rodgers has said, tweeting to those who expressed mixed feelings about the posthumous nature of the work, “You SHOULD have mixed feelings. No one’s heart was dragged through emotional ambiguity more than mine. Tears, uncertainty, happiness &amp; love”. A classic Rodgers choppy guitar line sits under a freshly minted pop-house rhythm, as Michael’s voice is pleasantly – and quite radically – mangled, before segueing into the original’s top line. Its status as a B-side rather undersells it – Michael’s secret weapon is a half-sung style of rapping that gets a good airing here, and the “if you ain’t got time for me, I’ll find another fantasy” pay-off is suitably fabulous. The sigh that closes the chorus remains a glorious bit of petulance. Perhaps there isn’t a Prince-style vault waiting to be raided, and there needn’t be, given the strength of his existing work. Fantasy meanwhile is a reminder that George Michael could invest a dancefloor with sex and wit like few other pop stars."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/sep/08/mismanagement-alleged-against-only-company-interested-in-liddell-power-station","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-07T18:00:16Z","webTitle":"Mismanagement alleged against only company interested in Liddell power station","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/sep/08/mismanagement-alleged-against-only-company-interested-in-liddell-power-station","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/sep/08/mismanagement-alleged-against-only-company-interested-in-liddell-power-station","fields":{"headline":"Mismanagement alleged against only company interested in Liddell power station","bodyText":"The only Australian company with a stated potential interest in buying and keeping AGL’s ageing Liddell coal-fired power station open beyond 2022 is facing a number of allegations of environmental mismanagement. AGL’s chief executive, Andy Vesey, has told government ministers AGL would consider selling Australia’s oldest coal-fired power station – near Muswellbrook in New South Wales – to a “responsible buyer”. While that claim was put in doubt by an ASX announcement from AGL – saying it “has made no commitment to sell the Liddell power station nor to extend its life beyond 2022” – Delta Electricity has said it was interested in buying the station and that it was prepared to undergo a due-diligence process. But how responsible Delta Electricity is has come under question in a recent report by environmental law group Environmental Justice Australia (EJA). In a report released last month, EJA detailed a litany of alleged environmental damages caused by Delta Electricity in its operating of the Vales Point coal-fired power station on Lake Macquarie, 130km south-east of Liddell. EJA claimed Delta Electricity appeared to be underreporting its emissions of particulate pollution, which is responsible for hundreds of premature deaths in Australia each year, to the National Pollutant Inventory. The smallest and most dangerous particulate pollution, called PM2.5, was reported by Delta to be just 12,000kg during the 2015-16 financial year. “This is unlikely to be accurate,” the EJA report stated. “Eraring, Bayswater and Liddell all reported emitting more than 170,000kg during the same year, 17 times as much as Vales Point.” Delta Electricity told the Guardian those figures reported to the National Pollutant Inventory were also used to calculate the fees it pays the NSW government for the pollution. EJA noted the issue was particularly important for the Vales Point power station since it was located so close to people’s homes. “The Vales Point power station is arguably Australia’s most urban power station,” the EJA report said. “It is located in a residential area with almost half a million people living in the cities of Newcastle and Lake Macquarie (to the north) and 300,000 on the central coast (to the south). This power station is not a good neighbour.” The Delta company secretary, Steve Gurney, told the Guardian in July the figures had been independently obtained and reported to the regulator in accordance with the company’s licence conditions. “From our perspective, that is what it is,” he said. In a statement, Delta Electricity said EJA’s claims were inaccurate, saying “the testing is conducted in accordance with the EPA’s [Environment Protection Authority’s] required methodology”. “Environmental Justice Australia are a Victorian-based environment group with an anti-coal platform who want to shut down coal-fired generators now. This would see the lights go out, cost industry jobs and decimate the NSW economy,” the statement said. The EJA report also found that in just four years to 2013, prior to Delta Electricity’s purchase of Vales Point in 2015, the power station’s then-owner – the NSW government – had reported nine breaches of licence conditions in its annual compliance statement to the NSW EPA. But since Delta Electricity took over, the company had not notified the NSW EPA of a single licence breach. “From our research, the likelihood that an ageing power station such as Vales Point has not breached a single licence condition in four years is low,” the EJA report said. “This is supported by the fact that an EPA audit of just the power station’s coal ash ponds, completed in October 2015, found eight instances of non-compliance (none of which was reported by Delta Electricity in its annual compliance statements). No compliance action was taken against Delta Electricity for any of the breaches found in its audit.” James Whelan, a researcher at EJA who authored its report, said he couldn’t comment on whether Delta Electricity was a responsible buyer of AGL’s Liddell power plant, but he said: “The question we asked was whether they were a good neighbour. We reached the conclusion that of the 10 powers stations we looked at, Vales Point was the least qualified as a good neighbour.” EJA also documented evidence that Vales Point had been transporting coal via open trucks rather than via an underground conveyor belt. “Dumping coal in extremely hot, windy conditions created clouds of coal dust, which spread to nearby residential areas, in breach of the power station’s licence,” the report said. Delta Electricity denied there was any breach of its licence, saying the claims were “a gross exaggeration by a group of anti-coal activists”. “On this occasion, no dust left the stockpile site and there was no licence non-compliance,” Gurney said in a statement. The co-owner of Delta Electricity, Trevor St Baker, also made waves earlier this year when the energy retailer he co-founded, ERM Power, chose to pay a shortfall fine, rather than surrender the required number of renewable energy certificates. St Baker used the move to attack the renewable energy target, saying it wouldn’t be met – a claim not supported by most analysts. In Canberra, there was continued pressure on AGL to keep the Liddell plant open beyond 2022 or sell it to someone who would. The deputy prime minister, Barnaby Joyce, indicated there was interest in buying Liddell. “I know more buyers, yes,” Joyce told Sky News. “There are people out there who will buy Liddell.” The prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, has so far refused to say what taxpayer support could be offered to prospective buyers to keep the ageing plant open. “We don’t need to consider that at this stage. The important thing is to ensure we have that 1000MW [shortfall] covered,” Turnbull told 3AW radio. “Keeping Liddell going for another five years is one obvious way of doing it. AGL says they want to sell it, that they want to get out of it. They’ve said they would be prepared to discuss selling it to a responsible party. Another private-sector energy company has said they’d be interested in looking at it. So I think it’s too early to say what the precise role of government would be.” AGL’s position has attracted the ire of the Coalition and the mining sector, as well as large energy consumers. Martin Ferguson, the former Labor minister turned energy lobbyist, said Turnbull deserved full marks for pressing to keep the plant open."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/sep/07/south-korea-deploys-missile-system-as-us-strengthens-north-korea-trade-threat","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-07T04:28:48Z","webTitle":"South Korea deploys missile system as US strengthens North Korea trade threat","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/sep/07/south-korea-deploys-missile-system-as-us-strengthens-north-korea-trade-threat","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/sep/07/south-korea-deploys-missile-system-as-us-strengthens-north-korea-trade-threat","fields":{"headline":"South Korea deploys missile system as US strengthens North Korea trade threat","bodyText":"Dozens of South Korean protesters have been injured in clashes with police over the full deployment on Thursday of a controversial US missile defence system intended to counter attacks from North Korea. According to South Korean media, 38 people, including six police officers, were injured in the village of Seongju, 300km south of Seoul, as preparations were made to install four further terminal high-altitude area defence (Thaad) system batteries at a golf course in the village. The morning protests came as the US threatened to impose sanctions on any country that trades with North Korea ahead of a crucial meeting of the UN security council to discuss fresh measures against the regime. Donald Trump, along with Moon and the Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe, are pushing for an oil embargo against the North – a measure opposed by China and Russia. The US treasury secretary, Steve Mnuchin, warned on Wednesday that if the UN security council failed to agree on additional sanctions when it meets on Monday, he had an executive order ready for Trump to sign that would impose sanctions any country that trades with North Korea. “I have an executive order prepared. It’s ready to go to the president. It will authorise me to stop doing trade, and put sanctions on anybody that does trade with North Korea. The president will consider that at the appropriate time once he gives the UN time to act,” Mnuchin said. The South Korean president, Moon Jae-in, approved the full deployment of the Thaad system this week after North Korea detonated a powerful nuclear device on Sunday, drawing widespread condemnation and calls for tougher UN sanctions. Thousands of police officers were sent to the village to protect the system, situated where similar clashes took place when the first two Thaad batteries were deployed in April. Reports quoted a local police official as saying most of the demonstrators had been dispersed and that the launchers and other equipment had been driven on to the site. The protests in Seongju took place as the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, told Trump that the escalating crisis on the Korean peninsula must be resolved through dialogue. In a phone call early on Thursday, Xi told Trump he was “deeply concerned over the ongoing situation on the Korean peninsula, and attaches importance to China’s essential role in resolving the issue”, according to a readout by the official Chinese news agency Xinhua. Trump later told reporters he and Xi had had “a very, very frank and very strong phone call”. He added: “President Xi would like to do something ... we’ll see whether or not he can do it. But we will not be putting up with what’s happening in North Korea. I believe that President Xi agrees with me 100%. He doesn’t want to see what’s happening there, either.” Asked if he was considering military action against North Korea, Trump said: “Certainly that’s not our first choice, but we will see what happens.” Earlier, China’s air force carried out exercises near the Korean peninsula, practising its defence against a “surprise attack” coming from across the sea, Chinese state media said. An anti-aircraft defence battalion held the exercises early on Tuesday, near the Bohai Sea, the innermost gulf of the Yellow Sea that separates China from the Korean peninsula, an official military website said. Despite their shared sense of alarm at the speed with which North Korea appears to be nearing its goal of developing missiles capable of delivering a nuclear weapon to the US mainland, permanent members of the UN security council are divided over their response. In a draft of a resolution due to be put to a vote on Monday, the US called on countries to impose an oil embargo on North Korea – a measure opposed by Russia and China. A leaked copy of the draft includes demands for a ban on gas supplies, as well as an end to textile exports and payments to North Koreans working overseas. The measures are also designed to strike at the heart of the North Korean regime, with a proposed freeze on the assets of the country’s leader, Kim Jong-un, and those of the ruling Worker’s party. In addition, the resolution calls for Kim to be added to a UN sanctions blacklist, subjecting him to a global travel ban, along with four other North Korean officials. The country’s state-owned airline, Air Koryo, would also be hit by an assets freeze along with the Korean People’s Army and eight other groups linked to the government, the military and the ruling party. But China – the biggest exporter of crude oil to North Korea – is expected to oppose an oil embargo or any other action that could destabilise North Korea, fearing regime collapse could spark a refugee crisis and allow tens of thousands US troops based in South Korea to move to China’s border with the North. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, has also indicated Moscow would oppose an oil embargo, urging other countries not to “give in to emotions and push Pyongyang into a corner”. In response to a plea from Moon to support cutting oil supplies, Putin said on Wednesday that depriving the regime of oil would be devastating for ordinary North Koreans, since it would leave hospitals and other public services without fuel. A report by the Nautilus Institute thinktank warned of the huge disruption an oil embargo would cause: “People will be forced to walk or not move at all, and to push buses instead of riding in them,” the report said. “There will be less light in households due to less kerosene.” The ban will lead to more deforestation, it added, as North Koreans will be forced to cut down trees to produce charcoal, leading to “more erosion, floods and more famine” in the already impoverished country. Kim’s regime would immediately restrict supplies to private citizens, it said, and a ban would have “little or no immediate impact” on the North’s army or its missile and nuclear programmes. Russia and China have instead called for a “freeze-for-freeze solution that would suspend North Korean nuclear and missile tests in exchange for the US and South Korea halting joint military exercises that Pyongyang regards as a rehearsal for an invasion. The Trump administration has rejected the proposal, insisting the drills are essential in response to North Korean provocations, including a threat to launch missiles near the US Pacific territory of Guam. On Thursday, the China Daily accused the US ambassador to the UN, Nikki Haley, of being “narrow-minded and undiplomatic” for rejecting the China-Russia proposal. Haley’s call for new sanctions “could lead to an enormous humanitarian disaster in North Korea, hurting millions of women and children and innocent people,” the newspaper said in an editorial.

Bulgaria has ordered an investigation after revelations by the Guardian and other media partners that Azerbaijan operated a secret $2.9bn fund to lobby influential Europeans and to funnel money offshore. Prosecutor Sotir Tsatsarov said he was launching an inquiry into Kalin Mitrev, Bulgaria’s representative to the European Bank of Reconstruction and Development (EBRD). Mitrev received at least €425,000 (£390,000) from the scheme, which has been nicknamed the Azerbaijan Laundromat. Mitrev denies wrongdoing. He says the payments to his Swiss and Bulgarian accounts were for legitimate consultancy work and happened before he joined the bank’s board in London. The reports were a “doomed political attack” on his wife, Irina Bokova, the director general of Unesco, Mitrev said. Officials will seek to establish whether there is evidence of tax evasion or money laundering, the prosecutor’s office in Sofia announced on Thursday. Mitrev denies being aware of the original source of the funds and says he declared the income in Bulgaria and paid tax in full. Mitrev’s future remains unclear after his case was discussed on Thursday by Bulgaria’s cabinet. Speaking afterwards, Vladislav Goranov, the finance minister, said his government had not taken a position on whether Mitrev should be removed from his EBRD job and that it had written to the bank asking for its view. On Thursday, the EBRD said only Bulgaria could take action against Mitrev, or exonerate him. His role was equivalent to that of an ambassador, it said, adding that he was not an employee. Board members from other European states are concerned by the Laundromat revelations and would like Mitrev to stand down, it is understood. Bulgaria’s investigation comes at a sensitive time for the bank, which is on the brink of making a significant loan to Azerbaijan. The EBRD’s president, Suma Chakrabati, is on a two-day visit to Azerbaijani capital, Baku. The bank, founded in 1991, was established to support eastern Europe and to develop its private sector. At stake is the future of the controversial southern gas corridor, the largest energy project the EU is pursuing together with Baku. Records loans in European public money are being considered for sections of the pipeline, which will transport gas from Azerbaijan to Italy. BP and Azerbaijan’s state-owned energy firm are key partners. In October the EBRD will decide at a board meeting whether to give Azerbaijan a $500m (£380m) loan. Sarah Shoraka, a spokesperson with the campaigning group Platform, said the payments to Mitrev could be “a huge stain on the bank’s reputation”. Until the case was properly investigated, the EBRD should suspend any decision on the gas corridor project, she said. Xavier Sol, director of the bank-monitoring organisation Counter Balance, said the Laundromat revelations came at a time when the EU was strengthening its ties with the Azerbaijani regime. It was negotiating the gas deal together with a comprehensive agreement with Baku to replace an existing partnership arrangement. Sol said: “European public banks are considering huge loans for the southern gas corridor. Such loans would send a worrying signal of political support to the Azerbaijani regime despite ongoing human rights violations in the country.” Mitrev is an EBRD veteran. He has served on the bank’s board on and off since 1996 and is known as a well-respected and influential voice. The revelation that Mitrev has consulted for an Azerbaijani company is awkward for Bokova because of her UN role. She bestowed one of Unesco’s highest honours, the Mozart medal, on Azerbaijan’s first lady and vice-president, Mehriban Aliyeva, who is a long-time Unesco goodwill ambassador. Bokova has denied that there is a conflict between her husband’s work and her UN role. Clarification: It has been suggested to us by Kalin Mitrev that this article may be understood as alleging that he was involved in corruption and/or money laundering in association with the Azerbaijani Laundromat. Whilst we do not agree with Mr Mitrev that the article conveys such a meaning, we are happy to make it clear that that we did not intend to suggest this."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2017/sep/07/uk-insurance-payouts-to-shrink-uturn-ogden-rate","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-07T17:13:47Z","webTitle":"UK insurance payouts to shrink after U-turn on lump sum formula","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/sep/07/uk-insurance-payouts-to-shrink-uturn-ogden-rate","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2017/sep/07/uk-insurance-payouts-to-shrink-uturn-ogden-rate","fields":{"headline":"UK insurance payouts to shrink after U-turn on lump sum formula","bodyText":"Increases in payouts to victims of car crashes and botched operations are to be scaled back after a furious backlash by the insurance industry against Ministry of Justice plans. In a significant U-turn by ministers, changes to the so-called “Ogden rate” used to calculate compensation payouts are to be revised, after insurers said they would inflate car insurance premiums by hundreds of pounds. When the government cut the rate from 2.5% to -0.75% in February in a surprise move, there was an outcry from insurers. After a consultation, the Ministry of Justice has proposed a rate of between 0% and 1% in draft legislation. The change appears small, but the mathematical implications for payouts can be very significant. When the new Ogden rate was imposed in February, insurers said the compensation figure for a brain injury on a 25-year-old could soar from £3m to £8m, and that the NHS and other parts of the public sector could face an extra £6bn bill. Shares in insurance companies rose on news of the Ogden reform, with Direct Line closing up more than 2%. The formula is used to calculate lump sum compensation payments to people with serious injuries, to ensure inflation does not erode the future value of a payout. The lower the rate, the higher the lump sum. Insurers had argued that the February change would overcompensate victims of car crashes, although personal injury lawyers said a new rate was vital to ensure that victims received proper care and compensation. Mohammad Khan, UK general insurance leader at auditing group PricewaterhouseCoopers, said car insurance premiums rose by £75 on average and by £250 for young drivers after the February change. Premiums were expected to rise by a further £100 on average, or £300 to £500 for young drivers, in November and December, as insurers planned to pass their increased costs on in full. Assuming the revised Odgen rate becomes law, premiums should stay stable in coming months, or could even fall. Tony Sault, UK general insurance leader for consultancy firm EY, said: “We would expect the recent rise in premiums to level off in anticipation of the new legislation, and ultimately premiums could fall between 2% and 4%, saving up to £21 on the average premium to the consumer.” For people with serious injuries it is bad news as payouts will be lower than expected. Brett Dixon, president of the Association of Personal Injury Lawyers, said: “The discount rate must be set to meet the needs of catastrophically injured people. Someone with a life-long, life-changing injury such as brain damage or a spinal injury cannot afford to take any risks with how his/her compensation is invested.” He added: “This rate was wrong for many years and it has been cut right recently ... We need to examine the detail. We need to focus on meeting the needs of the injured person with 100% certainty.” Lawyers are also pressing the government for more clarity. Sarah Stanton, partner at law firm Moore Blatch, said: “Until the timetable of this legislation is clarified, the value of the compensation that claimants can seek in the most serious cases will remain uncertain. “We welcomed the decision to reduce the Ogden rate from 2.5% to -0.75% this year – a long overdue change that corrected the balance in compensation, in favour of the victims of serious injuries.” The AA gave a “cautious welcome” to the Ogden re-set. Its director of insurance, Michael Lloyd, said: “The new rate must be adjusted to set a realistic and fair rate for both victims and insurers. “This draft legislation is being put before parliament, but there’s no guarantee that it will be enacted. “We predicted in July that as a consequence of these entirely avoidable government-prompted increases including a doubling of insurance premium tax over the past couple of years, more young drivers would risk illegal ways of getting behind the wheel and sadly, that has come to pass.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2017/sep/07/martellus-bennett-michael-bennett-las-vegas-police-nfl","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-07T13:36:21Z","webTitle":"Martellus Bennett in tears after brother Michael's ordeal in Las Vegas","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/sep/07/martellus-bennett-michael-bennett-las-vegas-police-nfl","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/sep/07/martellus-bennett-michael-bennett-las-vegas-police-nfl","fields":{"headline":"Martellus Bennett in tears after brother Michael's ordeal in Las Vegas","bodyText":"The NFL has shown its support to Michael Bennett after the Seattle Seahawks defensive end said Las Vegas police threatened to shoot him last month. Bennett says the incident took place as he was heading back to his hotel after attending the Conor McGregor v Floyd Mayweather fight, and heard what sounded like gunshots. “Las Vegas police officers singled me out and pointed their guns at me for doing nothing more than simply being a black man in the wrong place at the wrong time,” he said in a statement on Wednesday. He added that one officer had threatened to “blow my fucking head off”. TMZ later released video of the incident, which showed Bennett protesting his innocence as he lay on the ground. The gunshots later turned out to be a false alarm. His brother Martellus, who plays for the Green Bay Packers, said he was in tears after watching the footage. “I didn’t even know there was a video,” Martellus told reporters on Wednesday evening. “I had to walk out of meetings because I broke down crying, just thinking about what could have happened, what could have been. It was just so close. You never know these days.” Martellus was clearly emotional on Wednesday, and his session with reporters ended with the player in tears. “Sometimes, a hug is the best thing you can give,” Martellus said. “I mean, I don’t really know, really – you know what I’m saying? I don’t really have the answers. You just think, ‘What if?’ You know? Two seconds this way, two seconds that way, the whole thing is different. So for me, I’ll just be happy to see my brother, because there’s a chance I couldn’t see him.” There have been questions over why Bennett was picked out as a suspect among the many people fleeing the gunshots, the reports of which later turned out to be false. The Seahawks coach, Pete Carroll, said the incident was indicative of wider problems in the United States. “What happened with Michael is a classic illustration of the reality of inequalities demonstrated daily,” he said in a statement. “May this incident inspire all of us to respond with compassion when inequalities are brought to light, and allow us to have the courage to stand for change. We can do better than this.” The NFL commissioner, Roger Goodell, said the league stood behind Bennett as it prepares to kick off the season on Thursday night. “Our foremost concern is the welfare of Michael and his family,” Goodell said. “The issues Michael has been raising deserve serious attention from all of our leaders in every community. We will support Michael and all NFL players in promoting mutual respect between law enforcement and the communities they loyally serve and fair and equal treatment under the law.” Las Vegas police said they were responding to reports of a shooter at a casino at the time of Bennett’s arrest. Clark County undersheriff Kevin McMahill said Bennett didn’t stop when officers saw him running away from the casino. McMahill added internal affairs investigators are reviewing video footage to determine exactly what happened. Bennett is known for supporting social causes, and said he will not stand for the anthem this season as a protest at inequality in the United States. Martellus Bennett said he was proud of his brother for speaking about the incident in Las Vegas. “I’m very proud of Michael and the way that he handled it,” he said. “There’s a lot of guys who told him not to say anything. It may be a distraction. You don’t need to say anything. You’re alive, you lived through it, why tell anyone your story? For me, I think that’s the wrong way to go about it. I think his letter, it was eloquent. You had to empathize with the side of the story that he was telling, what happened to him.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2017/sep/07/aung-san-suu-kyi-defends-handling-myanmar-violence-rohingya","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-07T15:10:52Z","webTitle":"Aung San Suu Kyi defends her handling of Myanmar violence","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/sep/07/aung-san-suu-kyi-defends-handling-myanmar-violence-rohingya","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/sep/07/aung-san-suu-kyi-defends-handling-myanmar-violence-rohingya","fields":{"headline":"Aung San Suu Kyi defends her handling of Myanmar violence","bodyText":"Aung San Suu Kyi has defended her handling of renewed violence in western Myanmar, where a crackdown has displaced hundreds of thousands of Rohingya Muslims. In her first spoken remarks since the crisis started in Rakhine state last month, the de facto Myanmar leader said her government, the first to be civilian-led in decades, was facing its “biggest challenge”. “It is a little unreasonable to expect us to solve the issue in 18 months,” she told the Delhi-based network Asian News International. “The situation in Rakhine has been such since many decades. It goes back to pre-colonial times.” Aung San Suu Kyi said the government needed to “take care of everybody who is in our country, whether or not they are our citizens”. “Our resources are not as complete and adequate as we would like them to be but still, we try our best and we want to make sure that everyone is entitled to the protection of the law,” she said. The United Nations has warned that up to 300,000 Rohingya could stream into neighbouring Bangladesh as they flee “clearance operations” by the Tatmadaw, Myanmar’s armed forces. On Wednesday a post on Aung San Suu Kyi’s Facebook page blamed “terrorists” for “a huge iceberg of misinformation” about the violence, and made no mention of the Rohingya who had fled. The 1991 Nobel peace prize winner has been repeatedly urged to exercise influence over the military leaders who controlled the government for decades until 2015. The army says it is rooting out “terrorists” among the ethnic Muslim population, including fighters from the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (Arsa), an insurgent force that attacked dozens of security sites on 25 August. For decades the 1.1 million Rohingya in majority-Buddhist Myanmar have been deemed illegal immigrants and denied citizenship or access to most government services. In the past five years they have been targeted in military campaigns that the UN has said could “very likely” constitute crimes against humanity. Aung San Suu Kyi said the government still needed to “decide how to differentiate terrorists from innocents”. The Myanmar government claims about 400 have been killed so far, though UN officials in the country have estimated the death toll at more than 1,000. Hundreds of thousands more people have been displaced including the 164,400 Rohingya estimated to have crossed into neighbouring Bangladesh in the past fortnight. The surge of refugees – many sick or badly wounded – has strained the resources of aid agencies and communities already helping hundreds of thousands from previous spasms of violence in Myanmar. Many have no shelter, and aid agencies are racing to provide clean water, sanitation and food. On Thursday, the escaped residents of one village, Tula Toli, told the Guardian they were cornered by Burmese soldiers on sandy banks near their homes and fired upon, some of their relatives drowning as they tried to flee. Their accounts tallied with those of other Rohingya who have described large-scale violence perpetrated by Myanmar troops and Buddhist mobs who allegedly set fire to their homes, spraying bullets indiscriminately, stabbing civilians and ordering them to abandon their homes or be killed. Journalists taken to parts of Rakhine by the military on Thursday reported seeing new fires burning in villages that had been abandoned by Rohingya people, raising doubts about government claims that members of the minority group have been burning their own homes. About two dozen journalists saw the fires in Gawdu Zara village in northern Rakhine state on the government-controlled trip. A villager who emerged from the smoke said police and Rakhine Buddhists had set the fires. The villager ran off before he could be asked anything else. Myanmar says its forces are fighting a legitimate campaign against terrorists responsible for a string of attacks on the police and army since last October. Officials blame Rohingya militants for killing non-Muslims and burning their homes. “We need to wipe out the threat of the terrorism in those regions,” Ko Ko Hlaing, a presidential adviser of the previous government, said on Thursday at a forum arranged by military-owned media to discuss the crisis. He said rehabilitation and development were important and the citizenship issue needed to be settled, but the first priority was “the detoxification of the dangerous ideology of extremism”. Aung San Suu Kyi’s spokesman, Zaw Htay, on Thursday posted what he said were “photos of Bengalis setting fire to their houses”. The pictures of several sword-wielding women wearing headscarfs and men in Islamic prayer caps setting a house on fire, which were published in one of the country’s leading newspapers, were also shared widely by the military. But the photographs were criticised on social media with some pointing to signs they said showed the photos had been staged. The UN secretary general, António Guterres, warned on Wednesday that the violence in the country verged on ethnic cleansing and could destabilise the wider region. Myanmar has said it is negotiating with China and Russia to ensure they block any potential security council resolutions on the crisis.

Labour welcomed what it called “a major U-turn on a misguided policy from a government with no solution to the workforce crisis in the NHS”. Ministers decided last year to sell off a 75% stake in NHS Professionals, which is fully owned by the Department of Health. The move sparked widespread concern and criticism from MPs, doctors and health unions, who argued that the sale was foolish given the seriousness of the NHS’s worsening staffing crisis. NHS Professionals, which was set up by the last Labour government, plays a key role in the NHS. It supplies doctors, nurses and other staff to about a quarter of hospitals at much cheaper rates than those charged by profit-making NHS staffing firms and saves the cash-strapped NHS £70m a year that would otherwise go to private firms. Philip Dunne, the health minister, announced the U-turn in a written ministerial statement issued this morning at the unusually early time of 8am. He blamed the change of policy on bidders not offering enough money for the 75% stake and did not acknowledge the wave of opposition the planned sell-off had generated. Ninety-five opposition MPs – from Labour, Lib Dems, SNP and Plaid Cmyru – and one DUP MP had signed a Commons early-day motion backing an immediate halt to the sell-off. Dunne said: “NHS Professionals Ltd – a company which supplies flexible staffing to the NHS – will remain in wholly public ownership, after offers to buy a majority stake in the company undervalued its growing potential.” He outlined how the firm “currently holds a bank of over 90,000 workers filling more than 2m shifts, saving the NHS £70m every year”. Since the DH decided to sell NHS Professionals its performance had risen, with the result that its pre-tax profit – which goes back into the NHS – rose 44% last year compared to 2015-16, he said in the statement. “Ministers tried to push through a sale behind closed doors but have been forced to abandon their plans in the face of wide opposition from NHS staff and patients,” said Justin Madders, the shadow health minister, who had asked the National Audit Office to investigate the sale. “With huge workforce shortages across the health service, NHS Professionals plays a crucial role in organising last-minute or replacement staffing. This is an effective and successful public body which saves the taxpayer around £70m a year,” added Madders. Ministers should disclose how much money had been spent so far on the now ditched sale, he said. With its future in public hands now guaranteed, NHS Professionals needs to expand the number of NHS trusts it works with in order to reduce their reliance on “more expensive agencies”, Dunne said. Cat Hobbs, director of the campaign group We Own It, which helped organise opposition to the sale, said: “This is a huge victory for the NHS and everyone in this country. The public doesn’t want to see senseless privatisations and they have stood up and said no to this one.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"stage/2017/sep/22/politicians-people-coriolanus-rsc-shakespeare","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-22T11:30:49Z","webTitle":"Politicians v the people: what our leaders could learn from Coriolanus","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/sep/22/politicians-people-coriolanus-rsc-shakespeare","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2017/sep/22/politicians-people-coriolanus-rsc-shakespeare","fields":{"headline":"Politicians v the people: what our leaders could learn from Coriolanus","bodyText":"The Romans liked to commemorate their military victories with a showy gesture. Why just win a battle if you could also perform that victory with a triumphal procession, a few days of gladiatorial games, or a brand new name? The emperor Claudius – after he added Britain to the Roman Empire – was voted an additional title by his obedient Senate. He didn’t use it, according to the historian Cassius Dio. He preferred to pass it on to his son, who was thenceforth known as Britannicus. Nominative acquisition obviously ran in the family, because Claudius’s brother had been named Germanicus, after an earlier generation of family victories. The more obscure figure of Gaius (or Caius or Cnaeus) Marcius is usually known to us by his toponym: Coriolanus. He lived (perhaps – his life is not well-attested) at the start of the fifth century BCE and acquired his name after acts of incredible bravery in the Roman attack on the Volscian city of Corioli. His story – a man of military prowess and political principle whose refusal to compromise entails his eventual downfall – was interesting enough to capture the attention of the Roman historian Livy, the Greek historian Dionysius of Halicarnassus and the biographer Plutarch. But Coriolanus is best known to modern audiences as the flawed hero of the eponymous play, which forms the potent conclusion to Angus Jackson’s Rome season for the Royal Shakespeare Company. What made Shakespeare choose the story of this relatively obscure Roman general from Plutarch’s book of Parallel Lives? Plutarch wrote biography for moral, didactic purposes, and paired the biographies of Roman and Greek figures to further illuminate both. So Alexander the Great was matched with Julius Caesar, but only the latter caught Shakespeare’s eye. Plutarch had been translated from Greek into French by Jacques Amyot, and then from French into English by Thomas North, and it was this version that Shakespeare was using: a translation of a translation. And Plutarch wasn’t completely reliable. He lived almost 600 years after Coriolanus, and was using other histories that were themselves 100 years old. He was also writing about a foreign country. Scholars have speculated that the reason Shakespeare was more drawn to the stories of Romans than Greeks is because Plutarch was writing for a Greek audience. He included more detail in the biographies of the Romans because their society was less familiar to his readers. Certainly the detail gives the story a real sense of drama: Plutarch tells us that Gaius Marcius (not yet Coriolanus) was so brave in one early battle that he was given an oak wreath to wear. This, Plutarch says, is bestowed by law on a man who saves another citizen’s life in conflict. But why oak leaves? Plutarch goes on to explain that it was either in honour of the Arcadians (who had once been described by an oracle as “acorn-eaters”); or it was because there were always oak trees to be found nearby; or because the oak tree was sacred to Jupiter. In other words, Plutarch has an answer for the anthropologists, the rationalists and the god-fearing. In common with most ancient biographers and historians, Plutarch’s historical methodology may look a bit vague to us. But Shakespeare didn’t particularly need accuracy to create drama. He needed a setting and strong characters, and Coriolanus’s story resonates with them: the ambitious young soldier, the articulate widowed mother, the old senator with a nice line in homely allegory. It’s intriguing to see what Shakespeare took from Plutarch and what he chose to omit. The early years of Coriolanus are jettisoned: the play jumps straight into the action. There is famine, and the plebs blame Caius Marcius for keeping the price of corn too high. “You are all resolved rather to die than to famish?” is the third line of the play. The conflict that will animate the action – between the principled, inflexible Coriolanus and the increasingly angry citizens – is immediate. This famine does appear in Plutarch’s biography, but it doesn’t receive so much prominence. The citizens have other reasons for their discontent: a plague that has struck the nearby town of Velitrae, meaning that they may be sent there to repopulate it, and the issue of debt relief. But which is more compelling: someone who is starving and angry about it, or someone who is starving, and might have to move to Velitrae, and would also like their debts forgiven? One striking feature of the play is how closely the speeches are modelled on the versions we can read in our ancient sources. Menenius Agrippa pleads with his fellow citizens to learn to appreciate the role the patrician class plays in society. He tells them a hoary old fable about the limbs of the body going into revolt about the belly, because it takes all the nourishment but does nothing useful. Not fair, he explains: the belly receives all the nutrition and sends it to the right places. This speech appears in Livy, Dionysius and Plutarch. Obviously Shakespeare was more of a fan of it than Livy, who snarkily describes it as “prisco … horrido” – primitive and rough. Coriolanus lived in a time of remarkable political evolution: Rome had just become a republic. Instead of a king, the city now had two consuls – each man elected for the year – both of whom had the capacity to veto the other’s decisions. The power of no always trumped the power of yes. But these powerful roles were limited to those of patrician class, who were allowed to stand for election. Plebeian citizens had no such opportunity, and were only starting to make themselves heard through the tribunes, who stood up for plebeian interests but had less potestas – power – than the consuls. Coriolanus is a play that speaks to our contemporary politics better than most, particularly with its emphasis on a class divide that has ossified into social immobility. In 450BCE, 43 years after the events of the play, the Romans passed a law forbidding intermarriage between the patrician and plebeian classes. It is interesting to note two features of this law: first, intermarriage must have happened occasionally before 450 or there would have been little reason to ban it. And second, social division was solidifying over time, rather than the other way round. Not all movement is progress. As for Coriolanus himself, he is a compelling figure: a man whose courage is never in question and whose principles are the very foundation of his existence. It’s a stark contrast with modern politicians who are often criticised for altering their views depending on the current political climate. When asked, focus groups routinely say they want politicians who listen to their concerns. The sense that she is disconnected from ordinary people has dogged Theresa May not least in times of crisis. Her inability to talk to people was compared unfavourably with the Queen after the fire at Grenfell Tower. But we are also profoundly intolerant of politicians who change their minds (an occasional consequence of listening). May was punished for reversing her position on an early election, having repeatedly stated that she would not go to the polls. Is there something to be said, then, for a politician who sticks to principles regardless of the pain it might cause him? Conviction politicians have a huge impact today, partly because they can get their message out via social media, and partly because any shift in position is now seized upon as the worst kind of hypocrisy. But it is a risky strategy for the politician: Livy finds one early source who believed Coriolanus lived into ripe old age, but it’s not a view shared by any other historian. Coriolanus is at the Royal Shakespeare theatre, Stratford-upon-Avon, until 14 October and then transfers to the Barbican, London EC2, 6-18 November. rsc.org.uk."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2017/sep/07/delta-airlines-plane-flies-puerto-rico","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-07T14:30:16Z","webTitle":"Delta Airlines plane flies straight into Hurricane Irma – and out again","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/sep/07/delta-airlines-plane-flies-puerto-rico","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/sep/07/delta-airlines-plane-flies-puerto-rico","fields":{"headline":"Delta Airlines plane flies straight into Hurricane Irma – and out again","bodyText":"As Hurricane Irma threatened to make landfall in Puerto Rico, most pilots were avoiding the area. Understandably so, perhaps. One Delta Airlines plane, however, headed straight toward the storm. The pilot landed on the island as it was engulfed and got away again within an hour, taking more than 170 people out of the path of the most powerful Atlantic hurricane ever recorded. Despite the extreme weather closing in, the airline described conditions as “well below operating limits” for the aircraft when it arrived. Flight records examined by the Guardian show it arriving in San Juan on Puerto Rico’s north coast, and leaving again about 40 minutes later. “Our meteorology team is the best in the business,” said Delta’s Erik Snell. “They took a hard look at the weather data and the track of the storm and worked with the flight crew and dispatcher to agree it was safe to operate the flight. And our flight and ground crews were incredible in their effort to turn the aircraft quickly and safely so the flight could depart well before the hurricane threat.” The flight was the last to leave the island, which has been battered by the category 5 hurricane. It had arrived to “nine miles of visibility and light rain. Winds were around 24 knots with gusts up to 31 knots,” Delta said. Its flight was tracked by an enthusiast using the FlightRadar tracking software, which showed it taking off and working its way north between the outer band of Irma and the storm’s core. The flight arrived safely at New York’s JFK airport. In Puerto Rico, people have been seeking shelter. Carmen Yulín Cruz, the mayor of San Juan, said: “This is the first time since I became mayor almost five years ago that people have come to the shelters without anyone having to ask. People are concerned, they are scared. Puerto Ricans cannot fathom what a category 5 hurricane is about. It’s something we’ve never heard of. “Power infrastructure is very, very fragile and we are expecting to be without power for the next four to six months,” she told the Guardian.

Speaking as the EU published its latest Brexit position papers, Barnier said he was disappointed with the UK position he had heard at the latest round of negotiations. “It seems to be backtracking on the original commitment of the UK to honour its international commitments,” he said. “There is a problem of confidence here.” This problem was a moral one, he said. “You cannot have 27 countries paying for what was decided by 28.” The Brexit secretary, David Davis, acknowledged in July that the UK had obligations to the EU from its 44 years of membership, but his officials spent last week’s negotiating round dismantling the EU’s calculations without offering any clues on what the UK might pay. There were more harsh words for the UK on Thursday from the European parliament’s Brexit coordinator, Guy Verhofstadt, who warned that if the government adopted the immigration policies contained in a Home Office document leaked to the Guardian this week, it would make a transition deal impossible. “As a sovereign country, post-Brexit and after any transition period, the UK will be free to execute its own discriminatory immigration policy, no matter how economically damaging this might be,” the MEP said in a statement released to the Guardian. “However, a number of the leaked proposals would breach EU free movement law if implemented during any transition period, for example the proposal to discriminate between ‘high-skilled’ and ‘low-skilled’ workers.” EU diplomats say they have neither the time nor the inclination to negotiate a bespoke transition deal for the UK. This means the UK would have to follow European rules on free movement of people if it wanted to remain in the single market for a period after Brexit day in March 2019. Barnier did not comment on the leaked Home Office document, saying he wanted to work in “a serious fashion”. He said debate on transition arrangements in the UK was evolving and he called on London to make clear its vision. “The UK needs to tell us what it wants and we will see what is acceptable while respecting the rules,” he said. Barnier did, however, praise Davis for his professionalism after it emerged that the European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, had questioned the Brexit secretary’s commitment to the talks. Juncker had voiced concern about “the stability and accountability of the UK negotiator and his apparent lack of involvement” in Brexit talks at a meeting of top commission officials on 12 July, according to minutes released on Thursday. The discussion took place before the second round of Brexit talks, when concern was running high in Brussels that the UK would not acknowledge its debts to the EU. At that time officials were also in the dark about how often Davis would attend the talks in Brussels. Describing how he had known Davis for 20 years, Barnier said they had cordial relations and defended him against the charge that he was not spending enough time at the EU negotiating table. Turning to the substance, however, he made it clear he saw the UK position as unrealistic: “It will not be possible for a third country to combine the benefits of the Norway model with the weak constraints of the Canada model,” he said. Barnier also said he was worried about the UK’s proposals on the Irish border, because London was asking the EU to suspend its own laws on the customs union and the single market. “The UK wants to use Ireland as a kind of test case for future EU customs relations. This will not happen.” A UK government spokesman welcomed the commission’s paper on the border issue between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, “which continues to demonstrate that the UK and EU’s objectives on this issue are closely aligned”. The government again appealed to the EU to be flexible: “Unilateral UK flexibility will not be sufficient to meet our shared objectives, which is why we welcome the commission’s continued recognition of the need for flexible and imaginative solutions.” The EU negotiator’s evident exasperation with UK “backsliding” reduces already low expectations that Brexit talks will be able to move on to trade after October. Tensions over money were also evident in the newly released commission minutes. Barnier told the European commission in July that “the UK’s real aim seemed to be to use past debts as a means of buying future access to parts of the single market, something which the union could not accept”, according to the document. A former president of the European council, Herman Van Rompuy, said on Thursday that the chances of Brexit talks moving to trade after October were “in the neighbourhood of zero”. European leaders will be asked to decide if the UK has made sufficient progress on the Brexit divorce issues in October. If they deem that the UK has fallen short of their expectations on the Brexit financial settlement, EU citizens’ rights and the status of Ireland, talks will not progress to trade. Van Rompuy told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme he was not confident of a deal by the end of the year. “Let’s hope that we have a breakthrough. The latest declarations are not reassuring, but let’s hope,” he said. Barnier’s statement on Thursday was his first in public since the Guardian published the Home Office paper setting out a possible blueprint for post-Brexit immigration policy. The document has had a mixed reaction in Brussels, ranging from anger at the perceived attempt to restrict rights of EU nationals, to more detached feelings that the policy does not concern Brussels. But Verhofstadt said some proposals would cause “further uncertainty, distress and anxiety” to 3.5 million EU citizens in the UK. Restricting the rights of EU family members to enter the UK is deemed especially problematic. Others viewed the draft as emblematic of the UK’s unfriendliness to the rest of Europe. Philippe Lamberts, a Belgian Green MEP, who sits on the parliament’s Brexit steering group, told the Guardian the proposals would “poison the atmosphere even more” and make it harder to strike a post-Brexit agreement “if the same kind of attitudes persist”. “The United Kingdom sits 30km away from a continent that is unified politically by the European Union. And that is a reality imposed by geography. It is in both parties’ interest to have the most fluid possible functioning among us and to be as open as possible to each other.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2017/sep/08/mps-to-question-city-watchdog-over-saudi-aramco-float","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-08T07:37:42Z","webTitle":"MPs to question City watchdog over Saudi Aramco float","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/sep/08/mps-to-question-city-watchdog-over-saudi-aramco-float","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2017/sep/08/mps-to-question-city-watchdog-over-saudi-aramco-float","fields":{"headline":"MPs to question City watchdog over Saudi Aramco float","bodyText":"The Financial Conduct Authority is facing questions from MPs about whether political influence was behind proposed City rule changes that could lure the $2tn (£1.5tn) float of Saudi Aramco to London. Andrew Bailey, the chief executive of the FCA, is being asked by the chairs of two powerful Commons committees whether there were any discussions between the City watchdog and ministers ahead of the consultation on the planned changes. The FCA did not mention Aramco when it began consulting on its proposal to create a new category for firms controlled by a shareholder that is a sovereign country. But the plan was immediately seen as an attempt to lower any barriers to the $2tn Saudi oil company picking London for its stock market listing, which could boost the UK in the wake of Brexit. Major City investors warned the plans could damage London’s reputation and the matter is now being raised by Nicky Morgan, the Conservative MP who chairs the Treasury select committee, and Rachel Reeves, the Labour MP who chairs the business, energy and industry committee. In a joint letter, the two chairs tell Bailey: “We are interested to explore the rationale for this consultation, particularly given the concerns expressed by shareholders that these proposals would weaken protection for private investors against interference from foreign sovereign company owners.” They pose seven questions for Bailey, including “to what extent was the FCA aware of any interest shown by Saudi Aramco in obtaining a UK listing, and if known, how far that interest influenced the consultation?” They also ask: “What discussions did the FCA (whether at board or working level) have with ministers or officials from government departments in advance of and during the consultation, and in particular on the balance between attracting foreign investment and maintaining the integrity of the UK markets?” The committees are being reformed after the July general election and are likely to be formally constituted next week. Both Morgan and Reeves said they would discuss Bailey’s response with their members, signalling further scrutiny from the MPs. Saudi Arabia is planning to sell off a wide range of assets in the face of a weak oil price. The sale of a 5% stake in Aramco - probably next year – is key to the plan and could value the entire company at $2tn. The Financial Times reported on Thursday that some changes were made to parts of the economic transformation plan but that these would not affect Aramco’s sell-off. London and New Year are regarded as vying for the listing and in April Theresa May and Xavier Rolet, chief executive of the London Stock Exchange, visited Riyadh to meet Aramco’s chief executive, Khalid al-Falih, who is also the kingdom’s energy minister. The FCA proposals would enable state-owned companies to qualify for a premium listing – which has more onerous corporate governance rules and is valued by investors – but escape two key hurdles. One relates to how the company and the controlling shareholder conduct deals with each other; the second allows investors a vote on independent directors. Morgan said: “The UK has a world-class reputation for upholding strong corporate governance. The FCA must protect this reputation, especially as the City looks to remain competitive and thrive post-Brexit. Any changes mustn’t dilute the protection afforded by the ‘premium listing’ brand.” She said the FCA’s consultation would be examined by the Treasury select committee, which she was elected to chair after the general election in July. Reeves said that while it is important for the UK to thrive after Brexit it should not be at the expense of a weaker corporate governance regime. “Getting this balance right will be vital to the UK’s long-term future as a key financial centre and an attractive market-place place for investors. The FCA’s consultation relating to its premium listing regime raises questions about the UK’s reputation for sound corporate governance.” The FCA confirmed it had received the letter and that it would reply in due course. At the time of the consultation, Bailey said sovereign owners had different motivations from private sector individuals or companies. The consultation ends on 13 October."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2017/sep/08/vince-cable-urges-pm-to-lift-lid-on-eu-immigration-reports","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-08T06:00:31Z","webTitle":"Vince Cable urges PM to lift lid on EU immigration reports","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/sep/08/vince-cable-urges-pm-to-lift-lid-on-eu-immigration-reports","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/sep/08/vince-cable-urges-pm-to-lift-lid-on-eu-immigration-reports","fields":{"headline":"Vince Cable urges PM to lift lid on EU immigration reports","bodyText":"The Liberal Democrat leader, Vince Cable, has written to the prime minister calling on her to publish evidence on the impact of EU migration that he claims the Home Office has suppressed. After the Guardian published leaked proposals for post-Brexit immigration policy, May repeated her insistence that unfettered immigration was harmful to low-paid workers. “We continue to believe as a government that it’s important to have net migration at sustainable levels – we believe that to be the tens of thousands – because of the impact particularly it has on people at the lower end of the income scale in depressing their wages,” she said at prime minister’s questions on Wednesday. But Cable, who served as business secretary in the Conservative-Lib Dem coalition government of 2010-15, claims that when May was home secretary, she prevented the publication of a series of reports on the issue, which should now be released. In a letter sent to May on Thursday, Cable says: “As you will recall, there were reviews, studies and reports into whether the assumption that immigration suppressed UK wages was supported by the evidence. These were shared with the Home Office. They largely showed that this assumption was misplaced, and that EU migration was beneficial to the UK economy and labour market, but the information was never published. “Parliament will soon consider a fundamental reshaping of the immigration system. In that light, I hope you will agree that it is in the national interest now to release these reports in full.” He urged the prime minister to ensure that the independent Migration Advisory Committee (MAC) would be given the freedom to produce its own evidence of the impact of foreign workers on the UK economy. “Doubtless colleagues will want to know that the MAC is able to publish at its own discretion and to its own timetable.” The leaked paper has reignited tensions within the Tory party about the economic risks of cutting immigration, which flared up earlier this month after new data revealed May had drastically overestimated the proportion of foreign students who overstayed their visas. Proposals for an immediate post-Brexit crackdown on EU migration set out in the draft paper also sounded alarm bells, including among some Conservatives, about the likely response of the EU27 countries. A delegation of Conservative MEPs met the prime minister on Thursday afternoon to warn her that the European parliament would not accept an immigration system like that set out by the leaked Home Office paper. The MEPs, who are split between supporting and opposing Brexit, went to see the prime minister for the first time since the election and some were expected to express concern about the approach of the government towards the negotiations. Sajjad Karim, a Conservative MEP opposing hard Brexit, said he would raise the unworkability of the immigration proposals with the prime minister. He told the Guardian: “The European parliament will never accept these proposals and there can be no progress in negotiations. A European parliament resolution will come forward soon and it will make clear that these proposals aren’t getting off the ground. Of course exit in a no-deal situation means the government can go ahead regardless – and it may be good for short-term political consumption in the UK – but will be disastrous in terms of the retaliatory responses thereafter.” Charles Tannock, another Tory MEP, recently broke ranks to say he was so disgusted about Brexit that he was “ashamed to be British in many ways”. He said on Thursday that EU citizens “should be welcomed and given the respect they deserve for the huge contribution they make to the UK economy”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2017/sep/07/the-fiver-arsenal-premier-league-arsene-wenger","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-07T15:38:37Z","webTitle":"Watch out, 15 teams currently above Arsenal in the Premier League table!","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/sep/07/the-fiver-arsenal-premier-league-arsene-wenger","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/sep/07/the-fiver-arsenal-premier-league-arsene-wenger","fields":{"headline":"Watch out, 15 teams currently above Arsenal in the Premier League table!","bodyText":"ARSENE KNOWS WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER Last season Arsène Wenger tended to stage his weekly press conferences on Fridays. But he held the one to preview this weekend’s clash with Bournemouth today, Thursday. That catalyst for change that Ivan Gazidis bragged about is evidently in full effect. Watch out, 15 teams currently above Arsenal in the Premier League table! The conference may have been ostensibly to look forward to the meeting with Eddie Howe’s billionaire-backed fairytale club, the one that was fined £35,000 in March for breaching anti-doping regulations, but an audience with Wenger is traditionally also an opportunity to try to glean the Frenchman’s thoughts on the state of modern society and, if possible, on Per Mertesacker’s guinea pig, Weird Uncle Fiver’s film exploits and José Mourinho’s personal grooming. That chance appears to have been missed today but the hackery did manage to prod the Arsenal manager into holding forth on an assortment of football-related topics, including the recently closed transfer window. Naturally Wenger confirmed that Arsenal came tantalisingly close to signing some of the very best players in the world, but he also called for a change in the rules so the window is shut before the season starts because “in players’ minds, they have no clarity. Are they in? Are they out? Are they half in? Are they half out?” Premier League chairmen duly listened to Wenger’s plea, and it was announced this afternoon that they have voted to close next summer’s window before the 2018-19 campaign begins. The vote was not unanimous – it is understood 14 suits voted in favour of the amendment, with five against and one abstention – and the change will only concern incoming signings, so clubs will still be able to sell players until 31 August. Wenger was also invited to respond to the many former Arsenal players who are now paid good money to point at Aaron Ramsey updating his Facebook profile in the middle of a match and Mesut Özil’s pausing to feed ducks on his way to cutting out an opponent’s counterattack. “I always have problems understanding what a legend is and what a legend isn’t. I’ve had all the players here and we speak about today but they all had their weaknesses, as well, don’t worry about that,” tut-tutted Wenger of the professional ex-professionals. “They had their weak games and their weak behaviours. Nobody was perfect.” Careful. Arsène knows. QUOTE OF THE DAY “Everything that happens around Carlos creates something all over the world. It’s incredible. I didn’t watch one game of Chinese football last year. Now, you can watch it on Sky and you can watch in South America, and I think it’s because of Carlos Tevez. People maybe say to me: ‘No it’s because of whatever.’ But for me, it’s because of Tevez. Everybody depends so much on Carlos that whatever he does he creates something” – Gus Poyet’s reply when asked about the struggling striker’s effect on the Chinese game does little to suggest the Shanghai Shenhua manager has actually watched a Super League match this season either.

The task group includes the ageing ship HMS Ocean, carrying at least three helicopters, which will take 10 to 14 days to reach the area, and hundreds of marines and royal engineers who will be sent in RAF transport planes. HMS Ocean is currently deployed in the Mediterranean and is due to be decommissioned next March before being sold, possibly to the Brazilian navy. It will work alongside RFA Mounts Bay, a landing ship, which had already been deployed to the region as a precautionary measure and is being sent to Anguilla. The increased resources, and military hardware, came after an overnight assessment sent to the cabinet emergency committee Cobra concluded the devastation on the British overseas territories of Anguilla and the British Virgin Islands was worse than feared. Aid was increased from a planned £12m to £32m after Cobra met. At least one person has been confirmed dead in Anguilla and there are concerns that another British overseas territory – the low-lying Turks and Caicos Islands – is in the line of the storm and likely to be battered. Evacuations have begun and tropical-force rains were expected to begin on Thursday afternoon local time. Defending the initial government deployment of Mounts Bay, Sir Michael Fallon, the defence secretary, said: “These are our people and we are going to do everything possible to help them. It’s exactly the right type of ship for this, with its helicopters and its marines, and it’s already at work, helping the people of Anguilla, helping to clear roads, helping to restore power and get an accurate picture for the governor of exactly what’s happening on the island. So we’re there and we’re helping, but obviously this is a huge challenge.” On Thursday morning, Theresa May spoke to the French president, Emmanuel Macron, in a bid to coordinate efforts. She later said her “thoughts and prayers” were with all those affected. France, which directly administers its Caribbean territories, has already sent a minister and hundreds of soldiers to the region. The British prime minister said: “It’s the most powerful storm to hit the Atlantic. It’s brought devastation in its wake. It’s destroyed buildings and infrastructure, but it’s had such an impact on people’s lives because people have seen their livelihoods completely destroyed, and of course some people are missing, and some will have lost loved ones. “We have taken action, we have moved swiftly. We have people on the ground, £32m has been released. “We must not forget that there is a further storm on the way, and that the Turks and Caicos Islands still lie in the path of Hurricane Irma. But that won’t stop us from providing the assistance that is needed, and doing everything we can to help.” The move to deploy HMS Ocean and increase funding came after Josephine Gumbs-Conner, a barrister from Anguilla, claimed on Thursday morning that the UK’s preparations for, and response to, the storm had been “sorely lacking”. She told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme that the UK government should have “done what the French did in St Martin … made sure that they had military on the ground so that the response given is timely”. The island’s essential services, including hospitals and police stations, were in a “limping position”, she said, after the hurricane caused “nuclear bomb devastation”. On Wednesday evening, Dorothea Hodge, a former UK representative to Anguilla, criticised the government’s response: “It’s absolutely disgraceful that it has taken the whole day for [international development secretary] Priti Patel to respond to the worst hurricane we have seen in a British territory since the 1920s.” The French and the Dutch have permanent military bases in the Caribbean, but the British forces are kept at sea ready to respond to UK territories spread out across the region. The foreign office minister Sir Alan Duncan said the island of Montserrat, a British overseas territory, had only been swiped by the hurricane but that Anguilla received its full blast.“The initial assessment is that the damage has been severe and, in places, critical,” Duncan told MPs. “The British Virgin Islands were also not spared the hurricane’s full force when it passed through yesterday morning. “We must appreciate that this is a massive, perhaps unprecedented, natural disaster. We have not seen a hurricane on this scale in our lifetime, so we will have to assess the damage and respond as best we possibly can, knowing that this is a whopper.” He refused to be drawn about the extent to which climate change was making hurricanes more frequent, arguing the focus had to be on the emergency rescue. Hurricane Irma, one of the most powerful Atlantic hurricanes in recorded history, made landfall on the islands of the north-east Caribbean on Wednesday morning, causing major flooding and damage to buildings. At least nine people are confirmed to have died and thousands more remain in shelters, their homes damaged or destroyed. In Puerto Rico, almost a million people are without power and 50,000 without water, according to the US territory’s department of emergency relief. Travel association Abta said thousands of Britons are believed to be on holiday in the Caribbean."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2017/sep/08/limehouse-golem-it-best-uk-films","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-08T08:59:36Z","webTitle":"The Limehouse Golem and It: this week’s best films in the UK","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/sep/08/limehouse-golem-it-best-uk-films","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2017/sep/08/limehouse-golem-it-best-uk-films","fields":{"headline":"The Limehouse Golem and It: this week’s best films in the UK","bodyText":"1 It (15) (Andrés Muschietti, 2017, US) 135 mins Expectations have been set unrealistically high for the Stephen King-based scary-clown horror, but this polished rendition should satisfy fans, even if Stranger Things has stolen its thunder.

Don’t worry about that. They had their weak games and their weak behaviours. Nobody was perfect. “We have to take a distance with that, as well; focus on our performance and not be dragged into any animosity. We are all grateful for what they have done for the club but what matters is always the players on the pitch, who can defend the pride of the club.” Wenger reflected on the transfer window, in which Alexis Sánchez stayed, despite Manchester City making a £60m offer for him, and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain left for Liverpool in a £35m deal, days after he had started for Arsenal in their 4-0 loss at Anfield on 27 August. Wenger repeated his call for the summer window to shut before the start of the season, as he fears that players can be tapped up by rival clubs – even on the eve of matches. “Many things happen in the last second [of the window], which I regret,” Wenger said. “That’s why I believe it’s important that we change that and close all that stuff before the championship starts. Even in the games, you sit there before the games and, in players’ minds, they have no clarity. Are they in? Are they out? Are they half in? Are they half out? Are they tapped up in the afternoon of the game by people who want to get them out? “It’s not the way to work and it’s uncomfortable. Every single manager in the league would agree that it’s time to kick that out before the season starts and not continue to have players in the dressing room who are half out and half in.” Wenger had promised “100%” that Oxlade-Chamberlain would not be sold and he was bitterly disappointed when the midfielder told him that he wanted to leave. But, on the other hand, the manager admitted that the club had to “sell somebody”, with Sánchez, Oxlade-Chamberlain and Mesut Özil having entered the final 12 months on their contracts. “I wish Oxlade-Chamberlain all the best and I am thankful for what he has done here,” Wenger said. “You make decisions in which you choose one or the other one. We had to sell somebody and, overall, I believe that we are today in a strong financial situation, as always, and we have a good enough squad to compete. “It doesn’t take away any of the quality of Oxlade-Chamberlain. I think he’s a great player. But, sometimes, it opens the door for some younger players like [Reiss] Nelson or Joe Willock, or players who are in behind and get an opportunity that they wouldn’t get.” Wenger reported that Jack Wilshere still needs some fitness work and Santi Cazorla, who has not played since October last year because of an achilles problem, had started to run. Cazorla is out until the new year, at least; Wenger did not name him in his 25-man Premier League squad. “Santi’s injury is not career-threatening,” Wenger said. “He is having his first run today, so that is quite positive. The flexibility of his ankle looks good, his mobility is good and now it’s back to getting back to full fitness without having any setbacks. It’s very difficult to predict when he will be available again but, overall, I hope that after Christmas, he will be available.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"social-care-network/2017/sep/15/muslim-foster-care-row-press-responsibility","type":"article","sectionId":"social-care-network","sectionName":"Social Care Network","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-15T08:12:14Z","webTitle":"Muslim fostering row: Careless press must be held to account | Tay Jiva","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/social-care-network/2017/sep/15/muslim-foster-care-row-press-responsibility","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/social-care-network/2017/sep/15/muslim-foster-care-row-press-responsibility","fields":{"headline":"Muslim fostering row: Careless press must be held to account","bodyText":"Late last month, the Times made some rather astounding claims that Tower Hamlets council had placed a five-year-old white, British Christian girl into the care of a niqab-wearing Muslim family who didn’t speak English. As a qualified children’s social worker with more than 20 years’ experience, I suspected the story was exaggerated. My suspicions were confirmed within the next few days as the council claimed there were numerous errors in the reporting of the case and a court order was published. For the last two years, I’ve managed an adoption and fostering recruitment project for the Penny Appeal. We’ve had more than 250 applicants from all over the UK in the past six months. The project targets Muslim adopters and foster carers because our preliminary research found that of the 3,000 Muslim children entering foster care every year, approximately half spend time living in non-Muslim homes. In fact, our research found that of the 70 Muslim children placed into foster care by Tower Hamlets in 2015, 14 were placed into non-Muslim homes. Our concerns about the availability of Muslim carers was shared by the Department for Education, which provided £200,000 in December 2016 to expand our the project. Penny Appeal has worked with several care leavers who have said that their experience of living in homes of different faiths or cultures left them feeling insecure, with a confused sense of identity and a longing for a connection to their heritage and community. On the other hand, many have said that the ethnicity and religion of their foster carers or adopters did not matter to them. Either way, it is grossly unfair to imply that a home that is not faith- or culturally matched to that of the child is necessarily abusive. Hundreds of non-Muslim carers provide loving, stable and healing homes to Muslim children every year, just as Muslim carers provide the same for non-Muslim children. The real problem is not how well the placements are matched, but the significant shortfall of fostering families. We make it clear to our fostering applicants, Muslim and non-Muslim, that the vast majority of carers will be expected to care for children of different faiths, to take the child to their chosen place of worship (if they wish to go), or join them in celebrating religious festivals. If the carer refuses to do this, they would be asked to make appropriate changes (via support and training) or be at risk of being deregistered. Typically, if a carer has strong views against supporting children with different religious backgrounds, they will simply refuse the placement – as is their right. But most applicants, agree that all children deserve a loving home. So claims made in the Times that a foster carer would confiscate a religious symbol (a cross, in this case) from a child, make blatantly racist comments and not be able to speak the same language were highly unlikely. And implications that social work professionals were not only aware of these issues, but were complicit in this treatment of the child, were outlandish. There is a lack of clarity around who leaked the information to the Times but it is apparent that they did not follow established social services reporting procedures and still provided incorrect information. I was also shocked that Tower Hamlets council responded and that a court document was made public, disclosing more information about the child. Social care professionals are not accountable to the press or public with regards to the care plan for a particular child; they are accountable to service users, other professionals, independent staff and, on occasion, to senior management and regulatory bodies. Inputting into the care of vulnerable children requires training, experience, the support of other professionals and, essentially, access to the facts of the case – which were notably missing in the reporting of this case. But this story received such a high level of attention that social care professionals were effectively forced to respond, perhaps because of concerns around distress caused to the child, or the risk of psychological harm in the future. This is already a difficult time for the child. She has moved home three times over the past six months – to two foster homes and now to her grandparent’s home. And yet confidential details about her have been disclosed by the professionals trusted to keep her safe. If she has any understanding of what is going on, I expect it will be a confusing and scary time for her. It is also likely that anyone who knows her is aware that she is the child at the centre of this case, thereby breaching her right to privacy and confidentiality. Regardless of what she experienced living with her mother, it is not in her best interests that details of her mother’s struggles have been made public. And we should not forget the impact on the foster carers who have opened their homes to vulnerable children, and yet have been vilified by the press. As this child grows older, she will read these articles about her, the incorrect information, and many inappropriate responses to it. All children grapple with their sense of identity through their teenage years, but this is a particularly vulnerable time for those who have experienced time in care. All this has substantially increased her risk of struggling with her identity in years to come. Many people have said that this story highlighted the abuse of this girl within the foster care system, but there is no publicly disclosed evidence to suggest the foster placement was harmful. Instead, I would argue that it is highly likely that its publication – and subsequent critical comments – are much more harmful. Careless reporting needs to be held to account for the damage that can be done, particularly to vulnerable individuals. Tay Jiva is the adoption and fostering manager at Penny Appeal.

David Dingle, the chairman of Maritime UK, which represents marine and shipping industries, said he was “very nervous” about the future and concerned the government was putting £16bn worth of business in jeopardy with threats of no Brexit deal. His concerns stemmed, he said, from the reality of developing new customs declarations systems in time to prevent gridlock at ports and their approach roads. At a briefing on Thursday Dingle said it had taken HM Revenue and Customs “eight to 10 years” to put its latest customs declaration system in place. It is due to go live in October, suggesting a Brexit system will take many years to put in place. The chairman of Carnival UK, which operates cruises for P&amp;O, said: “Having looked at the time it takes, even in my own company, to build complex new systems, I would be sceptical we will be where we need to be in two years.” Dingle, who will lead a delegation of industry leaders to meet Theresa May and the trade secretary, Liam Fox, on Monday, also criticised the leaked Brexit immigration plans, saying they would be a “straitjacket” for the industry. “It raises concerns about the principles involved. Was a document like that based on really good analysis? Did it think about the fact that this country is a country with low levels of unemployment and what happens if you literally can’t fill jobs?” he told reporters. It is the first meeting the shipping industry has had with May since the referendum and Dingle said the government needed to take its concerns more seriously. He warned that there would be an “awful shutdown” in trade if May ended up with no deal, branding such a scenario as “daft”. Asked if he had confidence in HMRC delivering a new system that could do electronic matching of trucks and their cargo to enable continued speed in roll-on-roll-off ports such as Dover and Holyhead, Dingle said: “It has taken an extremely long time to build the new system planned before Brexit – eight to 10 years – and then suddenly it [HMRC] is supposed to have another step change in just two years? “That makes me nervous. It’s why we need to have … a lengthy transition period so that work is completed,” he said. “We need to land this. We need to land this in a really sensible and pragmatic way.” Earlier this year the Treasury select committee warned that confidence had collapsed in HMRC delivering a system in time for Brexit. HMRC warned that it faced a fivefold increase in customs checks after Brexit, with Andrew Tyrie, then committee chairman, noting that the delivery of a Brexit customs declaration system was “in doubt”, with HMRC’s internal project management rating placing it in a “major risk” category. Earlier this year, leading freight industry groups including Eurotunnel said the introduction of customs checks at Dover after Brexit could cause gridlock in south-east England, with lorries queueing in Kent for up to 30 miles (48km) to get across the Channel. Dingle will tell May and Fox that frictionless trade must be a priority in the immediate aftermath of exiting the bloc, coming above any future trade deals with other countries. Dingle told reporters at a press briefing on Thursday that he wanted the transition period to be extended until frictionless trade could be guaranteed. “I’m worried how long it’s going to take,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"culture/2017/sep/08/10-best-things-this-week-stewart-lee-mother-scythians","type":"article","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-08T08:00:32Z","webTitle":"The 10 best things to do this week: Stewart Lee, Mother! and Scythians","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2017/sep/08/10-best-things-this-week-stewart-lee-mother-scythians","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/2017/sep/08/10-best-things-this-week-stewart-lee-mother-scythians","fields":{"headline":"The 10 best things to do this week: Stewart Lee, Mother! and Scythians","bodyText":"Comedy Stewart Lee Lee’s ongoing Content Provider show comes with some advice via his website: “Leave voters planning to walk out in disgust will need to book early.” Expect musings on Trump, Brexit (obviously) and his own intellectual superiority.

The letter from Arron Banks, published below, accuses Rudd, the home secretary, and Hammond, the chancellor, of being part of a “cabal of Westminster MPs” who are working to “overturn the wishes of the 52%” and provides a step-by-step guide to kicking them out. Writing as chairman of the Leave.EU campaign, Banks says Rudd and Hammond are legitimate targets because they are pushing for a “lengthy and unnecessary ‘transition’ period of up to three years” after the UK leaves the European Union in spring 2019. In the letter sent to Rudd’s constituents in Hastings and Rye, Banks says: “Whether you voted remain or leave, Rudd’s actions in dividing the cabinet are damaging the prospect of a successful Brexit, encouraging the EU to play games with the whole process.” Rudd is particularly vulnerable in her Sussex seat, where she has a majority of just 346. Hammond’s majority in Runnymede and Weybridge is 18,050.Banks informs constituents who wish to kick out Rudd to first join the local Conservative party – “if you vote Conservative and want your voice to be heard by the national Conservative party” – and then demand a special general meeting (SGM). According to party rules, SGMs must be granted if more than 50 members of the local party or 10% of the previous year’s membership sign a petition. “Anyone can start the petition,” the letter notes. Activists should then table a motion of no confidence in the local MP. Banks also urges Rudd’s constituents to contact Leave.EU “so that we can smoothly transition the initiative over to party members”. Banks says similar tactics were “used successfully in 1997”.That year, the Beaconsfield MP Tim Smith resigned after coming under pressure following the cash-for-questions scandal. Other deselection attempts have succeeded in recent years. The Conservative MPs Tim Yeo and Anne McIntosh were deselected by their local parties before the 2015 election. Banks first came to prominence as the leading backer of Ukip under Farage’s leadership. He spent more than £7m funding the Leave.EU campaign during the referendum, again working closely with Farage. The Conservative partycan reject membership applications if it believes the individual does not support the Conservative values. As the party website notes: “The Conservative party reserves the right to not accept a donation or application for membership.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"careers/2017/sep/08/what-i-wish-i-could-tell-my-boss-every-day-you-made-my-heart-sink","type":"article","sectionId":"careers","sectionName":"Guardian Careers","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-08T06:00:31Z","webTitle":"What I wish I could tell my boss: 'Every day you made my heart sink'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/careers/2017/sep/08/what-i-wish-i-could-tell-my-boss-every-day-you-made-my-heart-sink","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/careers/2017/sep/08/what-i-wish-i-could-tell-my-boss-every-day-you-made-my-heart-sink","fields":{"headline":"What I wish I could tell my boss: 'Every day you made my heart sink'","bodyText":"Everything I’m about to say, I’ve been meaning to tell you for a while. You shattered my confidence. For you, nothing I did was ever good enough. Even taking a simple telephone call would result in you coming over and picking my conversation apart one line at a time. Every time I saw you approach my desk or received an email from you, my heart would sink. Once, you humiliated me in front of the whole office. I was on my way to a sample sale at lunch (you knew well I couldn’t afford to buy those clothes at full price on my meagre salary). But as I got up to leave you shouted at me to “sit down” and said “you can leave when I tell you to leave”. I felt like a teenager at school. My cheeks flushed bright red and you could have heard a pin drop in the room. Another time, you gave me a pile of work to do at 4:20pm on a Friday afternoon. I’d gone into the office early so that I could leave half an hour early at 4:30pm, and you were annoyed because I hadn’t formally requested the flexitime. But I’d never had to ask for formal permission before. You knew I couldn’t come in early on Monday morning to do the work as I had taken a day’s annual leave. I see now that this was a test. On Tuesday morning, you summoned me to a formal disciplinary meeting and it felt like a punch in the face. The fact that one of the other assistants had volunteered to complete the work and had done so within the time-frame was irrelevant. According to you, I had put the business at risk because I hadn’t done it myself. You made me question everything about myself. You made me feel useless and stupid. Nobody has ever made me feel like that before. It got to the point where I was running to the bathroom to sob several times a day without any acknowledgement from senior managers. I knew then that it was time to go. When I handed in my letter of resignation, I only had enough money to last me the next four weeks – which was pretty terrifying, but I felt like my life couldn’t get much worse. Looking back now, I can’t believe I held on as long as I did. We never did establish why I was paid substantially less than the other assistants. You were forever pointing out that, as the senior assistant, I should be coordinating tasks and setting an example – but I wasn’t paid the correct salary to do any of this. When I asked for a pay rise, you told me I had to earn it. So I started staying late. Yet when the director questioned you about why I was still in the office at 9pm on a Friday evening, you shouted at me that it was unnecessary, and said that when I couldn’t meet a deadline you wanted to know why. I couldn’t win. I finally realised there is a big difference between quitting and walking away from something for the sake of your sanity. You may have bullied me, but without you I’m a success. I write this letter as a woman in my 30s with my own thriving fashion business. I’m happy. And I know the same cannot be said of you.

Study the cruelty and indifference of governments, the disarray of opposition parties, the apparently inexorable slide towards climate breakdown, the renewed threat of nuclear war, and the answer appears to be no. Our problems look intractable, our leaders dangerous, while voters are cowed and baffled. Despair looks like the only rational response. But over the past two years, I have been struck by four observations. What they reveal is that political failure is, in essence, a failure of imagination. They suggest to me that it is despair, not hope, that is irrational. I believe they light a path towards a better world. The first observation is the least original. It is the realisation that it is not strong leaders or parties that dominate politics as much as powerful political narratives. The political history of the second half of the 20th century could be summarised as the conflict between its two great narratives: the stories told by Keynesian social democracy and by neoliberalism. First one and then the other captured the minds of people across the political spectrum. When the social democracy story dominated, even the Conservatives and Republicans adopted key elements of the programme. When neoliberalism took its place, political parties everywhere, regardless of their colour, fell under its spell. These stories overrode everything: personality, identity and party history. This should not surprise us. Stories are the means by which we navigate the world. They allow us to interpret its complex and contradictory signals. We all possess a narrative instinct: an innate disposition to listen for an account of who we are and where we stand. When we encounter a complex issue and try to understand it, what we look for is not consistent and reliable facts but a consistent and comprehensible story. When we ask ourselves whether something “makes sense”, the “sense” we seek is not rationality, as scientists and philosophers perceive it, but narrative fidelity. Does what we are hearing reflect the way we expect humans and the world to behave? Does it hang together? Does it progress as stories should progress? A string of facts, however well attested, will not correct or dislodge a powerful story. The only response it is likely to provoke is indignation: people often angrily deny facts that clash with the narrative “truth” established in their minds. The only thing that can displace a story is a story. Those who tell the stories run the world. I came to the second, more interesting, observation with the help of the writer and organiser George Marshall. It is this. Although the stories told by social democracy and neoliberalism are starkly opposed to each other, they have the same narrative structure. We could call it the Restoration Story. It goes like this: Disorder afflicts the land, caused by powerful and nefarious forces working against the interests of humanity. The hero – who might be one person or a group of people – revolts against this disorder, fights the nefarious forces, overcomes them despite great odds and restores order. Stories that follow this pattern can be so powerful that they sweep all before them: even our fundamental values. For example, two of the world’s best-loved and most abiding narratives – The Lord of the Rings and the Narnia series – invoke values that were familiar in the middle ages but are generally considered repulsive today. Disorder in these stories is characterised by the usurpation of rightful kings or their rightful heirs; justice and order rely on their restoration. We find ourselves cheering the resumption of autocracy, the destruction of industry and even, in the case of Narnia, the triumph of divine right over secular power. If these stories reflected the values most people profess – democracy, independence, industrial “progress” – the rebels would be the heroes and the hereditary rulers the villains. We overlook the conflict with our own priorities because the stories resonate so powerfully with the narrative structure for which our minds are prepared. Facts, evidence, values, beliefs: stories conquer all. The social democratic story explains that the world fell into disorder – characterised by the Great Depression – because of the self-seeking behaviour of an unrestrained elite. The elite’s capture of both the world’s wealth and the political system resulted in the impoverishment and insecurity of working people. By uniting to defend their common interests, the world’s people could throw down the power of this elite, strip it of its ill-gotten gains and pool the resulting wealth for the good of all. Order and security would be restored in the form of a protective, paternalistic state, investing in public projects for the public good, generating the wealth that would guarantee a prosperous future for everyone. The ordinary people of the land – the heroes of the story – would triumph over those who had oppressed them. The neoliberal story explains that the world fell into disorder as a result of the collectivising tendencies of the overmighty state, exemplified by the monstrosities of Stalinism and nazism, but evident in all forms of state planning and all attempts to engineer social outcomes. Collectivism crushes freedom, individualism and opportunity. Heroic entrepreneurs, mobilising the redeeming power of the market, would fight this enforced conformity, freeing society from the enslavement of the state. Order would be restored in the form of free markets, delivering wealth and opportunity, guaranteeing a prosperous future for everyone. The ordinary people of the land, released by the heroes of the story (the freedom-seeking entrepreneurs) would triumph over those who had oppressed them. Then – again with Marshall’s help – I stumbled into the third observation: the narrative structure of the Restoration Story is a common element in most successful political transformations, including many religious revolutions. This led inexorably to the fourth insight: the reason why, despite its multiple and manifest failures, we appear to be stuck with neoliberalism is that we have failed to produce a new narrative with which to replace it. You cannot take away someone’s story without giving them a new one. It is not enough to challenge an old narrative, however outdated and discredited it may be. Change happens only when you replace one story with another. When we develop the right story, and learn how to tell it, it will infect the minds of people across the political spectrum. ❦ But the best on offer from major political parties is a microwaved version of the remnants of Keynesian social democracy. There are several problems with this approach. The first is that this old story has lost most of its content and narrative force. What we now call Keynesianism has been reduced to two thin chapters: lowering interest rates when economies are sluggish and using countercyclical public spending (injecting public money into the economy when unemployment is high or recession threatens). Other measures, such as raising taxes when an economy grows quickly, to dampen the boom-bust cycle; the fixed exchange rate system; capital controls and a self-balancing global banking system (an international clearing union) – all of which John Maynard Keynes saw as essential complements to these policies – have been discarded and forgotten. This is partly because the troubles that beset the Keynesian model in the 1970s have not disappeared. While the oil embargo in 1973 was the immediate trigger for the lethal combination of high inflation and high unemployment (“stagflation”) that Keynesian policies were almost powerless to counteract, problems with the system had been mounting for years. Falling productivity and rising cost-push inflation (wages and prices pursuing each other upwards) were already beginning to erode support for Keynesian economics. Most importantly, perhaps, the programme had buckled in response to the political demands of capital. Strong financial regulations and controls on the movement of money began to weaken in the 1950s, as governments started to liberalise financial markets. Richard Nixon’s decision in 1971 to suspend the convertibility of dollars into gold destroyed the system of fixed exchange rates on which much of the success of Keynes’s policies depended. The capital controls used to prevent financiers and speculators from sucking money out of balanced Keynesian economies collapsed. We cannot hope that the strategies deployed by global finance in the 20th century will be unlearned. But perhaps the biggest problem residual Keynesianism confronts is that, when it does work, it collides headfirst with the environmental crisis. A programme that seeks to sustain employment through constant economic growth, driven by consumer demand, seems destined to exacerbate our greatest predicament. Without a new, guiding story of their own, allowing them to look to a better future rather than a better past, it was inevitable that parties who once sought to resist the power of the wealthy elite would lose their sense of direction. Political renewal depends on a new political story. Without a new story that is positive and propositional, rather than reactive and oppositional, nothing changes. With such a story, everything changes. The narrative we build has to be simple and intelligible. If it is to transform our politics, it should appeal to as many people as possible, crossing traditional political lines. It should resonate with deep needs and desires. It should explain the mess we are in and the means by which we might escape it. And, because there is nothing to be gained from spreading falsehoods, it must be firmly grounded in reality. This might sound like a tall order. But there is, I believe, a clear and compelling Restoration Story to be told that fits this description. ❦ Over the past few years, there has been a convergence of findings in different sciences: psychology, anthropology, neuroscience and evolutionary biology. Research in all these fields points to the same conclusion: that human beings are, in the words of an article in the journal Frontiers in Psychology, “spectacularly unusual when compared to other animals”. This refers to our astonishing degree of altruism. We possess an unparalleled sensitivity to the needs of others, a unique level of concern about their welfare, and a peerless ability to create moral norms that generalise and enforce these tendencies. We are also, among mammals, the supreme cooperators. We survived the rigours of the African savannahs, despite being weaker and slower than our predators and most of our prey, through developing a remarkable capacity for mutual aid. This urge to cooperate has been hard-wired into our brains through natural selection. Our tendencies towards altruism and cooperation are the central, crucial facts about humankind. But something has gone horribly wrong. Our good nature has been thwarted by several forces, but perhaps the most powerful is the dominant political narrative of our times. We have been induced by politicians, economists and journalists to accept a vicious ideology of extreme competition and individualism that pits us against each other, encourages us to fear and mistrust each other and weakens the social bonds that make our lives worth living. The story of our competitive, self-maximising nature has been told so often and with such persuasive power that we have accepted it as an account of who we really are. It has changed our perception of ourselves. Our perceptions, in turn, change the way we behave. With the help of this ideology, and the neoliberal narrative used to project it, we have lost our common purpose. This leads in turn to a loss of belief in ourselves as a force for change, frustrating our potential to do what humans do best: to find common ground in confronting our predicaments, and to unite to overcome them. Our atomisation has allowed intolerant and violent forces to fill the political vacuum. We are trapped in a vicious circle of alienation and reaction. The hypersocial mammal is falling apart. But by coming together to revive community life we, the heroes of this story, can break the vicious circle. Through invoking our capacity for togetherness and belonging, we can rediscover the central facts of our humanity: our altruism and mutual aid. By reviving community, built around the places in which we live, and by anchoring ourselves, our politics and parts of our economy in the life of this community, we can restore the best aspects of our nature. Where there is atomisation, we will create a thriving civic life. Where there is alienation, we will forge a new sense of belonging: to neighbours, neighbourhood and society. Community projects will proliferate into a vibrant participatory culture. New social enterprises will strengthen our sense of attachment and ownership. Where we find ourselves crushed between market and state, we will develop a new economics that treats both people and planet with respect. We will build it around a great, neglected economic sphere: the commons. Local resources will be owned and managed by communities, ensuring that wealth is widely shared. Using common riches to fund universal benefits will supplement state provision, granting everyone security and resilience. Where we are ignored and exploited, we will revive democracy and retrieve politics from those who have captured it. New methods and rules for elections will ensure that every vote counts and financial power can never vanquish political power. Representative democracy will be reinforced by participatory democracy that allows us to refine our political choices. Decision-making will be returned to the smallest political units that can discharge it. The strong, embedded cultures we develop will be robust enough to accommodate social diversity of all kinds: a diversity of people, of origins, of life experiences, of ideas and ways of living. We will no longer need to fear people who differ from ourselves; we will have the strength and confidence to reject attempts to channel hatred towards them. Through restoring community, renewing civic life and claiming our place in the world, we build a society in which our extraordinary nature – our altruism, empathy and deep connection – is released. A kinder world stimulates and normalises our kinder values. I propose a name for this story: the Politics of Belonging. ❦ Some of this can begin without waiting for a change of government: one of the virtues of a politics rooted in community is that you do not need a national movement in order to begin. But other aspects of this programme depend on wider political change. This too might sound like an improbable hope – until you begin to explore some of the remarkable things that have been happening in the United States. The Big Organising model developed by the campaign to elect Bernie Sanders as the Democratic nominee is potentially transformative. Rather than relying on big spending, big data and a big staff, it uses proliferating networks of volunteers, who train and supervise more volunteers, to carry out the tasks usually reserved for staff. While Hillary Clinton’s campaign was organising money, the Sanders campaign was organising people. By the end of the nomination process, more than 100,000 people had been recruited. Between them, they ran 100,000 events and spoke to 75 million voters. His bid for the nomination was a giant live experiment, most of whose methods were developed on the job. Those who ran it report that by the time they stumbled across the strategy that almost won, it was too late. Had it been activated a few months earlier, the volunteer network could have abandoned all forms of targeting and contacted almost every adult in the US. If the techniques they developed were used from the outset, they could radically alter the prospects of any campaign for a better world. When, after reading a book by two of Sanders’s organisers, I argued in a video for the Guardian that this method could be used to transform the prospects of Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour party, I was widely mocked. But it turned out to be true. By adopting elements of the Sanders strategy, Labour, supported by Momentum, almost won an election that was largely predicted to be a Conservative landslide. And the method that propelled this shift is still in its infancy. I believe it could become still more powerful when combined with some of the techniques identified by former Congressional staffers in the “Indivisible guide to influencing members of Congress”, an online “practical guide for resisting the Trump agenda”. These people studied the methods developed by the Tea Party movement and extracted the crucial lessons. They discovered that the key is to use local meetings with representatives to press home a single demand, film and share their responses on social media, then steadily escalate the pressure. The Tea Party honed this technique until its requests became almost impossible to resist. The same thing can be done, though without the harassment to which that movement sometimes resorted. Supported by the Big Organising model, using its proliferating phone-bank teams and doorstep canvassing, the Indivisible methods could, I believe, be used to flip political outcomes in any nation that claims to be a democracy. But none of this will generate meaningful and lasting change unless it is used to support a new, coherent political narrative. Those who want a kinder politics know we have, in theory at least, the numbers on our side. Most people are socially minded, empathetic and altruistic. Most people would prefer to live in a world in which everyone is treated with respect and decency, and in which we do not squander either our own lives or the natural gifts on which we and the rest of the living world depend. But a small handful, using lies and distractions and confusion, stifle this latent desire for change. We know that if we can mobilise such silent majorities, there is nothing this small minority can do to stop us. But because we have failed to understand what is possible, and above all failed to replace our tired political stories with a compelling narrative of transformation and restoration, we have failed to realise this potential. As we rekindle our imagination, we discover our power to act. And that is the point at which we become unstoppable. • Out of the Wreckage: A New Politics for an Age of Crisis is published by Verso.

An ice hockey hero, captain of the Halifax Highlanders and “a huge, Jewish freight train”, Glatt is good natured and more than a little slow.

Baruchel, too, has written himself a small but shouty role as Pat, an irritating, foul-mouthed nerd who wears a string vest and a baseball cap that says “Fuck white people” (he’s better behind the camera than he is in front of it, which isn’t saying much)."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"sport/2017/sep/07/the-breakdown-premiership-yellow-cards","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-07T10:27:22Z","webTitle":"Premiership’s brilliant start should not blind us to rugby’s yellow fever","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/sep/07/the-breakdown-premiership-yellow-cards","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/sep/07/the-breakdown-premiership-yellow-cards","fields":{"headline":"Premiership’s brilliant start should not blind us to rugby’s yellow fever","bodyText":"Rugby is brilliant these days. There are more than a few out there who feel it always has been, who have stuck with it since it was little more than a curious, esoteric ritual for those in thrall to mud, pain and lawlessness, but they have long since been joined by many others. Now rugby is glamorous, exciting, in multi-angle HD slo-mo and watched by an ever-growing audience of thousands, sometimes millions. And yet there remain a minority in the sport who are more ill-treated than they ever have been, who suffer intolerable injustice on a weekly basis despite their very best efforts to do the right thing. It is quite possible that of all performers in the sporting universe rugby players are held to the most rigorous, and at times unreasonable, standards of conduct in the face of the maddening physical abuse to which their sport subjects them. You might think they would be treated sympathetically by the lawmakers, enforcers, commentators and spectators they so richly entertain and provide for, but the incidence of yellow and red cards is higher than ever. The opening weekend in the Premiership just gone was not a controversial one; even so we can pick out a few examples of the sort of betrayals the modern rugby player must endure on a weekly basis. As first wins at Welford Road since 2003 go, Bath’s on Sunday was a superb demonstration of all the sport holds dear – nerve and defiance, and deadliness when precious opportunity demanded. It would have been a travesty if they had been denied. It was a travesty that they were shown three yellow cards in the last 10 minutes. They conceded two tries in that period and nearly lost the game. It is a grim irony that the modern first-class rugby player is by far the cleanest incarnation of the breed and yet by far the most punished. Compare and contrast with their vicious counterparts from the amateur era who practised deliberate violence against each other with impunity. This new model of honest player is as much as anything a result of all those HD camera angles broadcasting to ever greater audiences, but another corollary of the new technology is that rugby’s administrators, many of whom played in those unsavoury times before professionalism, have panicked at how ungentle their sport is revealed to be. Instead of accepting this, or instituting meaningful law changes, such as lowering the threshold for a high tackle, they have simply ramped up the punishments for players who are doing their best under circumstances far removed from the dark old days, the licence to inflict deliberate harm on an opponent and get away with it having long since lapsed. And so Kahn Fotuali’i saw yellow five minutes after he had come on for a tackle that was barely even a penalty. He went, said the ref, because his was the fourth non-yellow high tackle by Bath in the match. But no warning was issued and the other three high tackles were of the same family – absolutely harmless and, crucially, accidental. One might think Fotuali’i’s yellow would reset the counter, but, no, minutes later, Matt Garvey saw yellow for the same offence, this an example of the “seat-belt” (so much less vicious than the “clothes-line”) high tackle. In other words, absolutely harmless and accidental again. The third yellow, on the other hand, shown to Matt Banahan in the penultimate minute, punished just the sort of offence for which the sanction was brought in: a deliberate and obvious attempt to thwart an opposition attack by illegal means. Another yellow, on Friday night, was that shown to Gareth Steenson of Exeter, who ran across field to catch a high ball that was landing plumb where he positioned himself, with perfect innocence and legitimacy. Unfortunately for him, at the last split second, the player who was chasing his own kick, Jason Woodward, leapt from a good few yards away into Steenson’s space, where he was flipped over in the subsequent collision. Thus Steenson’s innocence was transformed at a stroke into guilt worthy of exclusion from the match. Rugby’s ludicrous sanctification of the airborne player – the notion that the game must somehow stop whenever someone leaves the ground – has long reached farcical levels, best exemplified by the penalty with which the Lions won the second Test in New Zealand, when an honest player set himself for a tackle, only for his opponent to leap at the last moment to catch a poor pass and frame the former for tackling him in the air. In effect, the Lions were awarded the match-winning penalty because their scrum-half threw a poor pass. Another meaningful and overdue law amendment would be that players go airborne in open play at their own risk, or, better still, not at all. As it is, jumping for the ball has become a slot machine yielding penalties and cards of both colours. The refrain in this twisted new era is consistent – honest players hung out to dry for the sake of the game’s image, as safeguarded by those who wouldn’t have thought twice in their day about deliberately clothes-lining an annoying opponent. They’re rewriting rugby’s law book as we speak, with a view to making it more accessible and, mercifully, shorter. They can have this first law for free: “There is no punishment worse for a player than exclusion from the game. None should be so sanctioned but for offences that are deliberate and calculated to harm an opponent or their chances of scoring. And the referee better be sure.” In other words, just give the players a break. They’re doing their best in a game faster and more physical than it has ever been. • This is an extract taken from the Breakdown, the Guardian’s weekly rugby union email.

Mind you, the perennial danger of Nazi evil has been known since 1945 and has never been just about the past. In the 1960s my university history lecturer, Peter Phillips, who had spent time in a Nazi concentration camp, warned of the danger. The big question for us was how this terrible evil could have occurred in what was supposed to be a civilised Germany. We had at best only a partial answer to that question. In tutorials we ran through some of the knowable causes of the Holocaust: the susceptibility of an acutely insecure population to strong leadership; their propensity to want a scapegoat for these social ills; and so on. But that, Phillips said, only took us some of the way. The rest of the answer lay in the unknowable evil that exists in the dark recesses of human nature. What we did know as students was that this evil could come back to haunt us. And now it has, as Freedland points out, in the form of the Charlottesville phenomenon sanctioned at the very highest levels of US society. Terry Hewton Adelaide, South Australia Failure of US diplomacy Julian Borger’s article, Diplomacy takes a back seat, is correct (18 August). However, we need urgently to recognise that this is exactly what the so-called alt-right cohort, which includes Steve Bannon, Mike Pence and the Koch brothers, to name but a few, are working towards. They aim to destroy all the post-second world war international institutions, and to decimate US government departments. Most likely they calculated Donald Trump to be most electable of their group, and hence allowed him to run as their candidate, knowing him to be a narcissistic buffoon with no experience of government. It seems likely that he could be impeached if he fails to govern or to achieve any of his campaign promises. In that case Pence, who is much more alt-right than Trump, and a much more effective organiser, would be president. That is a truly scary prospect. Working to develop positive alternatives is what people of both conservative and liberal views must espouse. Caroline Patterson Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada The fall of Macron I am surprised that French pundits cannot explain Emmanuel Macron’s slippage in the polls (1 September). In the lead-up to the presidential elections there was an unnatural alliance as a result of the common cause to keep Marine Le Pen of the far-right Front National out. Both the socialists and the communists said that they would vote for Macron, but once he was elected president they would oppose him. This is what is happening and is no doubt reflected by the polls. Macron’s “Jupiter” style is mostly in the eyes of the Paris media bubble, who, like the media bubbles in London, New York and Washington, failed to tap the national mood that produced Brexit and Donald Trump. Val Wake Lodeve, France Unnecessary surgery Dara Mohammadi draws attention to a troubling trend (When surgery is just a stitch-up, 1 September). After a lifetime as a general surgeon I am increasingly concerned that surgical techniques are taking priority over non-technical skills. Acquisition of surgical competence has never been easier, but the balance between what can be done (quite a lot) and what should be done (not as much as you think) is not prominent in surgical education. Candidates for surgical intervention arrive with substantial problems that demand close attention not only as to the timing of surgery but also as to its necessity. By and large the operations described in Mohammadi’s piece are relatively safe, but it is no longer acceptable for surgeons to say that just because a procedure is low-risk, it is worth doing. The medical profession can hardly complain about lack of resources while such unproven interventions continue to burden those who fund our healthcare. The colleges who train surgeons are mindful of this issue, but there remain surgeons who continue to deliver unnecessary procedures to a largely unsuspecting population. The inescapable conclusion is that the prime motivation for performing such procedures is financial. Patrick Alley Auckland, New Zealand Briefly • Gloria Keoji and others like her are the true heroes of the 21st century (Ties of bloodshed bind South Sudan’s refugee ‘families’ in Uganda, 25 August).

It is my job to interview people and help identify the barriers stopping them from working. We then agree how they can be overcome. Those barriers might be relatively simple. Someone might need to be taught how to produce a CV or they might need help with their computer skills. Some of the people I interview have not been in employment for many years and lack the motivation or skills to return to work. Work coaches will discuss the appropriate next steps, which may include a referral to a specialist partner organisation. This can involve a great deal of phone calls and form-filling. Marion, for example, wanted to improve her employability skills so we consulted and discussed a spreadsheet of available courses and completed the relevant application online. You would be quite correct to assume that this all takes time. These interviews used to range from 10 minutes to an hour, depending on whether the person needed intensive support or is seen to be self-sufficient. It is the work coaches who were – and still are – best placed to decide how long the interview should be. Alarmingly, that decision is now in the hands of our managers, who know nothing about the jobseekers’ needs. Interviews are now limited to either 10 or 20 minutes, and 10-minute interviews are arranged back to back. Jobseekers may have travelled a considerable distance to attend these interviews, and many are left waiting while appointments overrun and we desperately try to provide what little help we can. Very little can be achieved within a 10-minute timeframe. We have to recap the previous interview, discuss the jobseeker’s progress and the update several IT systems. Often, even 20 minutes is far from sufficient to adequately support people with what are often multiple and complex barriers to work. Paul, for example, is autistic and needs much more time and support to help him express himself. When I take the initiative and schedule a longer interview for a jobseeker in need, I am asked to reduce it to allow diary space for other 10-minute appointments. The management direction is to “tick and turn”. This means we’re encouraged just to go through the motions and not waste time. However, myself and my colleagues are assessed on how many jobseekers we move into employment. Our main target this year is quality. How can that be achieved in 10 minutes? The problem has been exacerbated by a shortage of work coaches, and the resulting lack of available diary space to see our clients. This hasn’t been helped by the roll out of universal credit. Work coaches have been taken out of the office for training and often they are not replaced. This means that hard-pressed coaches need to fit additional people into their diaries. It is a regular occurrence that I am often unable to find space in my diary to book a work-focused interview and have to look to my colleague’s already busy diaries instead. The severe lack of work coach capacity will only be made more acute by the decision to close jobcentres in towns and cities across the UK. Jobseekers will be required to attend interviews in a place that is not local to them. They will need to travel greater distances to attend interviews that last less than 10 minutes and do not offer them much in the way of support. It’s even more unsustainable pressure on a badly creaking system.

Podcasting is growing – although it still only gets a fraction of the audience enjoyed by ABC Radio – and ABC boss Michelle Guthrie is keen to push the ABC’s audio-on-demand services over broadcast radio. “This fund allows us to invest not only in the extension of our own podcast content but also content from the brightest, freshest creative talent in this field,” cheered radio director Michael Mason. These shiny new funds come at a cost however. One senior exec complained to Beast that the $1m fund could have paid to keep the jobs of more than a few experienced Radio National staff who were let go during mass redundancies earlier in the year. Guthrie is joining 21st Century Fox CEO James Murdoch in the UK as one of the speakers at the Royal Television Society’s Cambridge convention next week. Murdoch junior tops the bill. The biannual conference has the theme of A World of Opportunity this year. Perhaps Guthrie could use the opportunity to have a word with Murdoch about News Corp’s campaign against the ABC, which continued apace this week. At another industry conference News Corp boss Michael Miller called on the government to follow the British government’s recent “root-and-branch” reform of the BBC. And the chief executive of Sky News and new Walkleys chairman Angelos Frangopoulos repeated his view that the $1.04bn in public funding should be opened up to Sky as well as the ABC. “This is a really big area that we as commercial media need to focus on because not only do we have challenges from offshore but we have them here as well,” Frangopoulos said. “There needs to be contestability. There is no way that government funding has to be limited to just one organisation because they don’t have all the great ideas.” Justice for Lynette Daley There are some injustices that would never be righted if it weren’t for the media. The death and sexual assault of Lynette Daley seven years ago on a northern NSW beach is one such case. When Daley’s family emerged from the trial which finally gave them justice on Wednesday they thanked their legal team, the police, the DPP and ABC reporter Caro Meldrum-Hanna and Four Corners. Gordon Davis, Daley’s stepfather said: “If it wasn’t for her taking the story and running with it, this wouldn’t have happened.” Davis was talking about the Four Corners program Callous Disregard which led to prosecutor Lloyd Babb SC calling in independent counsel, Philip Strickland SC, two days after it was broadcast for an independent review. Strickland ended up bringing the matter to trial for the DPP. But on Thursday the Daily Telegraph claimed on its front page that its reporting of the story had led to authorities reopening the case. Sources said Janet Fife-Yeomans was upset she hadn’t been recognised for her February 2016 report which revealed two men had escaped prosecution despite their brutality towards a woman with the pseudonym “Norma”, who they left to die on a beach . The day after the Telegraph’s report the DPP said it would review the evidence again after a request from then-attorney general Gabrielle Upton. The Tele revealed the story first. But Meldrum-Hanna gained the trust of the family and worked closely with them to bring her story to television, causing a national outcry and pushing authorities to act. Sleuth women We’ve brought you a lot of Alan Jones’ random thoughts lately but thought it was worth sharing his views on why women have not succeeded in the blokey world of talkback radio. Channel Ten’s entertainment reporter Angela Bishop asked Jones who the next upcoming talkback stars were and why there weren’t more women in the game. Where is the female Ray Hadley or John Laws, Bishop asked in an extended interview for morning show Studio 10. Jones: “I don’t know why but the women primarily migrate to the newsroom, they are sleuths … Women are successful everywhere they want to be so I can only assume its because they don’t want that, they choose other roles in the media.” The 2GB breakfast star also continued his extraordinary attack on his Fairfax Media bosses, saying the Sydney Morning Herald treated him like a “marginalised player” rather than someone who had won 100 surveys in a row. Well done us While the prospect of public funds being made available for Murdoch hacks might be tantalising to folk at Holt Street, they were soon distracted by the annual industry newspaper awards. The self-congratulatory awards are fought out between Fairfax, News Corp and a handful of smaller newspapers with the result that the Australian is often the winner. And this year the good folk at the Oz won the trifecta: the newspaper of the year, the weekend newspaper of the year and the website of the year. Foreign interests With the demise of the foreign reporting category in the Walkleys, the Lowy Institute’s shortlist for their 2017 Media Award took on extra interest. The award recognises excellence in foreign affairs journalism and, unlike a Walkley, has a cash prize of $20,000. Nominees include the ABC’s Eric Tlozek, Matt Brown and Sophie McNeill; Four Corners/Fairfax for the joint investigation into the Chinese Communist party; Guardian Australia, for the Nauru Files; and Cameron Stewart of the Australian."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/live/2017/sep/07/county-cricket-live-lancashire-v-essex-hampshire-v-surrey-and-more","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-07T20:02:00Z","webTitle":"Haseeb Hameed outlines Ashes intent but mizzle halts Lancashire charge","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2017/sep/07/county-cricket-live-lancashire-v-essex-hampshire-v-surrey-and-more","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/live/2017/sep/07/county-cricket-live-lancashire-v-essex-hampshire-v-surrey-and-more","fields":{"headline":"Haseeb Hameed outlines Ashes intent but mizzle halts Lancashire charge","bodyText":"Will Macpherson’s report Essex were happy to watch the Manchester mizzle sweep gently in and wipe away the evening session against their closest challengers, Lancashire, taking with it realistic chances of a result and of major shifts in the title race. Still, Lancashire’s is a position of strength, largely thanks to Haseeb Hameed, who – in also providing England with a neatly timed nudge – had done that increasingly rare thing: dug in, and weathered testing times. “Tough runs” was Hameed’s description of conditions, where “the play and miss is as good a shot as you can play”. His was a simple mantra: “I decided that no matter how it looked I was determined to score runs in whatever way possible and bat for as long as I could.” Hameed added just three to his overnight 85, going leg before to a shooter from Jamie Porter, but by then his job was done and Lancashire’s last pair, Tom Bailey and Kyle Jarvis, rollicked their way to a stand of 57, and a total of 290. Hameed was Porter’s fifth wicket, for a fifth five‑wicket haul of a season that has now brought 57 wickets at 18. Porter is the Professional Cricketers’ Association’s player of the month and should win an England Lions place this winter, too. As he had after his unbeaten 77 against Hampshire last month (this was a better innings), Hameed’s words were positive but cautious, and those of a man who still has just 421 runs this season. Unsurprisingly, he would not be drawn on his winter plans. “It would be great to go on that Ashes tour,” he said, “but as I said at Hampshire, there’s a process to achieving things. It’s pretty simple – I have to perform. If I do that hopefully it’ll bring further honours. “Everyone has to experience that [a poor run] to work yourself out as a player and a person as well. It toughens you up. One of the things has been to trust what I do, and know that there are people around me who understand my game better than people from the outside. I’m glad that I’ve been able to experience that at a young age.” Soon enough Ryan McLaren had dismissed Nick Browne, bowled leaving one he should not have, and Dan Lawrence, caught at third slip. Varun Chopra and Ravi Bopara sipped on a shot of whatever Hameed was drinking, but not enough; Bailey trapped Chopra leg before, then Bopara was caught at slip off Stephen Parry on the stroke of tea, which proved to be the last action of the day. Essex have still not avoided the follow-on. Marcus Trescothick, 21 years Hameed’s senior, has put Somerset on the verge of victory against Warwickshire, who can start planning for life in Division Two. Trescothick’s 65th first-class century set up a nominal target of 402 for Warwickshire who, despite Jonathan Trott’s 74, reached stumps 172 for six. Only rain can save them. “That was a special century for me because it has been a tough season so it’s good to come through and get the runs I’ve been looking for for a long period of time,” said Trescothick, who shared 148 with James Hildreth and 100 with Tom Abell, who is having a fine game. Victory would see Somerset make ground on Yorkshire and Middlesex, who are cruising towards a rain-affected draw at Headingley (the visitors are 108 for three in response to 358), while Surrey could yet find themselves in trouble. With six second-innings wickets in hand, they lead Hampshire by just 45 runs with Ben Foakes – who has slipped ahead of Jos Buttler in the race to be England’s spare wicketkeeper on the Ashes tour – on 33. The top of Division Two is equally cagey. Worcestershire need 103 runs, with eight wickets in hand, to ruin Chris Read’s final game at Trent Bridge and keep up their hopes of preventing Nottinghamshire’s treble. Notts’ lower order, led by Read (who had been greeted at the crease by a guard of honour from Worcestershire and made 38 off 43 balls) scrambled hard to set up a target of 226. Daryl Mitchell reached stumps 63 not out, while the prodigious Joe Clarke will resume on a king pair. All of this was bad news for third‑placed Sussex, but they refused to lie down against Northamptonshire. Sussex were eight behind when they lost their eighth second-innings wicket, but Jofra Archer (who made his fourth fifty of the season) and David Wiese shared a record stand of 129, and they closed leading by 128, with Archer still at the crease. If the weather allows, a thrilling finale awaits. Right, that’s that. We have a huge day ahead tomorrow, which should be chockful of results, and only bad weather can scupper it. So pray for good weather! Here’s where we are: Division One: Essex 115-4 v Lancashire 290 Warwickshire 146 &amp; 172-6 v Somerset 282 &amp; 265-4d Surrey 200 &amp; 135-4 v Hampshire 290 Middlesex 108-3 v v Yorkshire 358 (back on there) Division Two: Worcs 243 &amp; 123-2 v Notts 193 &amp; 275 Durham 217 &amp; 145-2 v Kent 206 Sussex 172 &amp; 263-8 v Northants 426 Leics 222 &amp; 154-7 v Gloucestershire 368 Derbyshire 236-9 v Glamorgan I greatly look forward to hearing from you all tomorrow. No idea where I’ll be, but I’ll be somewhere. There are 2.5 overs left at the Oval. Stumps at Edgbaston, where Warwickshire are 172 for six. They need 230 more... Sussex 128 ahead, with Jofra still standing on 74 at the end of day three. Can they pull off something remarkable? They are nine down. Warwickshire are six down after Bess got Barker! Alasdair Maiden asks: Jofra Archer. When does he qualify? Getting him on a plane to Aus with those nice bouncy wickets. Alas I don’t think it’s until 2021. A wicket at the Ageas - Weatherley gets Burns for 63, and Surrey are four down, leading by just 32. Could be a decent final day in the offing there. Huge wicket at Edgbaston, as Trott goes lbw to Bess! Warks 163 for five... Stumps at Trent Bridge. Off at Northants, too. Trott has 50, and Warwickshire are 136 for four. Craig Overton is bowling off spin! Off for the day at Old Trafford. Essex 115 for four, still 175 behind. You’d think we’ve no hope of a result now. Bad light at Wantage Road, where Sussex are eight down, and 108 ahead. Well done Stuie! Enjoy it. Glosters going nicely. Leicestershire are six down and six behind. Five for Norwell! Jofra has his fourth 50 of the season, and Sussex’s lead is up to 78. Extraordinary. Play abandoned for the day at Headingley! Ah, bad light at Trent Bridge! Immediately after that wicket. Worcestershire two down ... Mullaney bowls Fell. 123 for two, needing 103 more. Think we are done for the day at OT. Pieing it down. Sussex’s lead is up to 62, and their ninth wicket stand worth 66... Durham have extended their lead to 118, and Tom Latham has a fifty. They are two down. Ooph. Surrey in some strife! Roy made 1, but has been bowled by Abbott! 39 behind, three down. Sussex’s lead is up to 37... Some Essex players appear to be ambling over to the hotel. It’s not that bad, and the rain’s not too heavy. But I’d be pleasantly surprised if we saw more cricket today. Billings is still battling a migraine. Rain at Edgbaston ... Warwickshire 85 for three, chasing 402. Hampshire two down, still 42 behind. Borthwick gone to Dawson for 1. He made a first innings duck. Full covers coming on here. We may be done for the day... Off for bad light again at Headingley with Middlesex 108 for three. Middlesex three down as Sidebottom gets Robson... 104 for three and requiring great care. Looks like there is play everywhere else that there should be. Covers coming on. Proper you-wouldn’t-start-in-it-but-you-would-stay-on-it rain. It is drizzling. Scheduled restart after tea is now, the hover cover is on, the rain doesn’t appear to be falling, and the light isn’t as bad as it was ay times before the break. But it’s an inspection, not play, that we are having. Oh well. 4.05 restart at Durham which is good. Here you go. Division One: Essex 115-4 v Lancashire 290 Warwickshire 146 &amp; 73-3 v Somerset 282 &amp; 265-4d Surrey 200 &amp; 44-1 v Hampshire 290 Middlesex 94-2 v v Yorkshire 358 (back on there) Division Two: Worcs 243 &amp; 75-1 v Notts 193 &amp; 275 Durham 217 &amp; 98-2 v Kent 206 Sussex 172 &amp; 263-8 v Northants 426 Leics 222 &amp;97-3 v Gloucestershire 368 Derbyshire 219-6 v Glamorgan Enjoy your tea. Covers going on at tea at OT but I don’t think it’s currently raining. Wicket and tea at OT! The light is much better and there’s rain due, so we are going off for tea. But not before there’s a wicket! Parry finds some turn and Ravi nicks off. Sharp catch by Livi at slip... 115 for four. Sussex lead, eight down... Surrey have lost their first, Ryan Patel to Dawson. Still 46 behind. 3.30 start at Headingley. Nash gone for 66 and Sussex are eight down, still eight behind. Needs something special from Jofra and Wiese Debit, you’d think. Light reading... and we are staying on, but with spin on. Livi on. News from Headingley. Tea is at half past here. It’s getting a bit darker. Wheater got going with a flash over the slips. 96 for three. Bell gone! Warwickshire 51 for three. He made 24 off 36 but was bowled by Jack Leach. Worcestershire have lost their first. Rhodes gone to Hutton. 57 for one. Tea At three At Headingley. Rhymes, doesn’t it. Wicket! Bailey’s done it! Chopra had battled hard but he’s lbw for 40. 81 for three. Lancs need wickets fast. Sussex 32 behind, on 222 for seven, as Robinson goes to Gleeson. Nash still there. Drop! Ravi’s nicked Bailey to Davies at second slip and he’s shelled it. On 18. 78 for two. Good start to Worcestershire’s chase; they are 43 without loss and need 183 more at Trent Bridge. Warwickshire two down! 21 for two. Groenewald again! Umeed this time and Trott and Bell have got the band back together... Sussex are six down and Northants are going to win in three days! 193 for six, still 61 behind. Nash still there on 53. Warwickshire have lost their first ... 18 for one as Groenewald gets Sibley. Brown gone for 0, Sussex five down! Sussex 186 for four, 68 behind still, as Wright goes to big Rory. 50 stand up for Chopra and Ravi. Playing nicely. Jack Leach opened the bowling at Edgbaston! Warks are 6 for none. Hampshire 290 all out, the same as Lancashire earlier, and also thanks to some late heave ho from the tail. They lead Surrey by 90. Bad light at Headingley: Middlesex 86 for two. Chopra and Ravi playing well here in tough conditions. 56 for two, and battling hard. I’d be bringing McLaren back soon... Sussex 177 for three, still 81 behind, as Gus Robson goes to Kerrigan. Off for bad light at Durham. Middlesex two down ... Eskinazi goes to Sidebottom. 83 for two. It sure has. Abell out, bowled by The Other Ryan Sidebottom. And he takes Tres with him. 119 not out the big man. Warwickshire need 402... Middlesex one down, Compo gone to Sidebottom. 73 for one. And now Hants are nine down! Berg gone to Dernbach and the new ball. Fidel joins Abbott, who will now tee off you’d think What a stand at the Ageas between No9&amp;10 for Hants. Now worth 93, and their lead is 63. Nottinghamshire 275 all out! Worcestershire need 226 to win. Number 65 in FC cricket. Somerset’s lead is 371... For the final time at Trent Bridge, the great man is gone. He made 38, one more than his career average. What a guy. Notts 271 for nine, and 221 in front. Trescothick has 99... Here come the umps at OT. If Lancashire could continue to get among Essex this afternoon before the rain comes, we could have a game. But if Essex reach 141, you’d think that’s the game cooked. They are 38 for two. Play to start again at 1.30 at Durham. Oooooh. Nice. It’s Neil Wagner! Engrossing session here. Lancashire in a very good spot. Division One: Essex 38-2 v Lancashire 290 Somerset 282 &amp; 218-3 v Warwickshire 146 Hampshire 247-8 v Surrey 200 Middlesex 53-0 v v Yorkshire 358 Division Two: Notts 193 &amp; 264-8 v Worcs 243 Durham 217 &amp; 72-2 v Kent 206 Sussex 172 &amp; 136-2 v Northants 426 Gloucestershire 349-8 v Leics 222 Derbyshire 109-4 v Glamorgan Enjoy your sarnies! Nearly lunch here. Essex 34 for two. Wicket! Lawrence drives at McLaren and he’s very well caught at third slip by Vilas! Essex 23 for two... Read is teeing off in his final innings, and the lead is 197... Andy Miles emails with an update on one of my favourite county cricketisms. He has a mate named Norwell so they have an annual contest – prize: food, beer – based on which Gloster bowler with the same surname takes more wickets. The latest update on the Miles/Norwell Gloucestershire county championship wicket taking battle (see previous county cricket coverage) sees Miles trailing significantly. Norwell has 48, Miles has 27 and Miles is also not playing in the current game. Not his/my best season, and with only three more games to go I think that Norwell has a significant upper hand. Can you provide any glimmer of hope for me, or will I soon be stumping up for some real ale and Turkish cuisine? I can’t, I’m afraid. Norwell will win. But I have suggested to Andy that seeing as Norwell is sponsored by a pasty company, he should sack off the turkish stuff and get him something cornish. Gareth Berg reached a 70-ball 50 with a six... Never change. Hants eight down, lead by 24. Can they? Here’s the one wicket Essex have lost here Lloyds Leach has five! And Notts are eight down, with a lead of 163. Nice way to get going for Lawrence: handy on-drive for four... 14 for one. Dan Lawrence, who made a pair last week, in at No3... Wicket! There are two types of leave! Nick Browne has been close to this a few times today. McLaren, from round the wicket, takes out his off-peg with one angled back in. Offering no shot was a poor choice and it’s 9 for 1. Hildreth goes, Somerset lead by 301... Time to crack on you’d think. Hampshire lead! Eight down. Oi oi Lancashire have it doing all sorts. Umming and ahhing after every ball. Somehow Essex surviving. 9 for 1. 20-year-old James Bracey going nicely for the Glosters ... He has 62 and they are 301 for four. Somerset lead by 300... That’s a great snap. Lovely man Chris Read. Magnificent stuff. Notts lead by 152. Could see two Tongues soon! Interesting here that McLaren and Bailey are opening the bowling, not Jarvis, who has six-fers in his last two matches... Notts’ lead is 150... Notts 186 for seven! Taylor gone. 136 ahead. Guard of honour from the Worcestershire players for Chris Read on his final appearance at Trent Bridge. Lovely stuff. Buttler’s keeping for Lancs because Al Davies isn’t quite 100%. Davies is at second slip, between Livi and Vilas. McLaren with the new seed. Has at work. Northants have their first: van Zyl gone to Gleeson. Sussex 89 for two. So, Lancashire. The rain is coming at about 4pm today, I believe. The forecast is looking a bit better for tomorrow... Yorkshire 358 all out! Harris gets Bressie for 44. Think that’s done Yorkshire a favour. Lancashire 290 all out! Never ball, Jarvis goes for a huge yahoo, misses, and Lancs are all out 10 shy of a third batting point. A great effort, that. Last wicket worth 57. They were 92 for six at one stage! Six! Jarvis smashes Harmer down the ground, and Lancs are 290 for nine... 50 stand for the 10th Lancashire wicket! Took 25 minutes and 49 balls. Lancs 284 for nine. A wicket at the Ageas! Holland gone to Meaker - Hampshire 170 for eight and in need of runs from my fantasy skipper Abbott. Somerset’s lead up to 266 ... Tres and Hildreth going very nicely indeed. If the forecast is awful here and the game in the balance there, I might head there tomorrow. Surely it’s time for a Yorkshire declaration? 353 for nine, not going to lose the game. Get stuck in! Yorkshire have four batting points! Comments seem to be back. Harmer on, Bailey reverse sweeps four first ball. Lancs 261 for nine. Could they get three batting points? Here’s the answer to the Hampshire 2s issue! (Thanks Bradley Adams) Two batting points for Lancs! Great effort. 251 for nine, with Bailey and Jarvis playing nicely. Can anyone help Alan Fisher? Hi Will, A googly (sorry!) but any chance you might know how Lancashire v Hampshire in Champo Second XI Final is going on? Nowhere can I find any reference to this match whatsoever. Send help my way and I’ll pass it on. So Notts lead is 106, but they are six down. Big job for Brendan Taylor and, when he eventually comes in at No9, Chris Read. Its his last innings at Trent Bridge. Off for rain at the Riverside! Durham 72 for two, lead by 83. Here’s the Hameed wicket... If you are not able to view comments please let me know. I can’t, but some people seem to be fine. Hameed gone! He made 88 and is Porter’s fifth - lbw to one that stayed low. Gets a big hand as he ambles off. Glosters have lost Hankins too - I think I know what Stuie means. Bit slow to update... Morning Stuie! The Glosters are going great guns - they have lost Roderick but have parity three down. As I say, Yorkshire won’t mind that cloud... Yep - Yorkshire definitely the only team that can win that game. Get as many as possible, get stuck into a rather fragile Middlesex side. This already happened at Headingley. Sounds like comments are only not working for me, which is good. Don’t be too nasty about me while I can’t read them! So Tom Bailey now sets up like a right-handed Chanderpaul. He used to bat normally. Hilarious. Just two days late, Derbyshire v Glamorgan is underway. Bradley also enjoys my favourite time of the day. Well the bell’s been rung here at Old Trafford, and out come the players. Overcast but not unpleasant, it’s still a bowler’s day, especially as Essex have an over old ball. Sam Cook to get us going, and Hameed’s partner is Tom Bailey. Lancs 22 for eight. Comments are currently down for me, so if they are for you, please be patient. Can always email or tweet me! Welcome to Old Trafford for day three of the fourth to last round of county cricket - live! for this fine summer! I’m Will Macpherson and I’m here to guide you through the action from here and the other eight games on offer. There’s some other cricket on offer, apparently, but we need not mention that. The weather is nice now but nasty later, I’m told. The chances of a result in this Lancashire-Essex game, given the loss of day one, were pretty slim as is, but losing the final session today would end all hope. Haseeb Hameed batted beautifully last night and resumes on 85 this morning. He’s dug his team out of a horrible hole, to be honest. Elsewhere in Division One, Hampshire’s slim title hopes are slipping at the Ageas, Somerset are dominating Warwickshire, and Yorkshire are on top against Middlesex. Yorkshire hold the cards – if they can bat themselves into a very strong position then take some early wickets … who knows. It’s a big day in Div Two. Can Notts hold off Worcestershire? Big wicket of Riki Wessels late last night. Can Kent get there act together and keep the pressure on? And can Northants finish off Sussex? At Derby, there has finally been a toss. Or, well, there hasn’t really. It was uncontested, and Glamorgan stuck the hosts in. Here’s where we are: Division One: Lancashire 222-8 v Essex Hampshire 129-7 v Surrey 200 Yorkshire 317-7 v Middlesex Somerset 282 &amp; 75-2 v Warwickshire 146 Division Two: Nottinghamshire 193 &amp; 138-5 v Worcestershire 243 Sussex 172 &amp; 34-1 (f/o) v Northants 426 Durham 217 &amp; 57-2 v Kent 2016 Gloucestershire 218-3 v Leicestershire 222 Glamorgan have stuck Derbyshire in without a toss Yesterday’s report and roundup is at the top of yesterday’s liveblog.

Dir. Darren Aronofsky It’s an event-movie detonation, a phantasmagorical horror, a black-comic nightmare. Jennifer Lawrence plays the loving young wife of a famous author (Javier Bardem); they live in a remote, picture-perfect country house. Suddenly a strange couple, played by Ed Harris and Michelle Pfeiffer, show up out of the blue and very strange stuff starts to happen, leading to an explosion of horror and hallucinatory violence. Seatbelts must be worn and airbags may deploy. Read the full review. Released on 15 September in the UK and the US; 14 September in Australia. On Body and Soul Dir. Ildiko Enyedi Hungarian director Ildiko Enyedi won the Golden Bear at this year’s Berlin film festival with her deeply strange, dreamlike movie: this director has in fact been absent from the movie scene since her estranged-twins drama My Twentieth Century won the Cannes Camera d’Or in 1999. On Body and Soul is about two people employed at a slaughterhouse, which is grimly depicted. They don’t get on in real life, but mysteriously share dreams. Is this the “soul” which rises above the “body” — and the blood-flecked reality of the workplace? 22 September UK. Home Again Dir. Hallie Meyers-Shyer This could be this autumn’s guilty pleasure with extra cheese. Reese Witherspoon stars in an upscale romantic comedy written and directed by Hallie Meyers-Shyer, who has impeccable family background for this kind of thing. Her mum is Nancy Meyers (writer/director of Something’s Gotta Give, It’s Complicated) and dad is Charles Shyer (director of Baby Boom and Father of the Bride). Witherspoon plays the divorced single mother of two kids who returns to the (extremely comfortable) family home in LA and immediately is plunged into uproarious dating situations. 29 September UK; out in US. Zoology Dir. Ivan I Tverdovsky Whoah. A Kafkaesque situation develops in this curious fable from Russian director Ivan I Tverdovsky. Natalya Pavlenkova plays Natasha, an unhappy and downtrodden middle-aged office worker who lives with her mother and likes going to the zoo. Then she experiences a personal renaissance when she, erm, grows a tail and then finds love with a younger man. Whatever can it all mean? Read the full review. 29 September UK. On the Road Dir. Michael Winterbottom The prolific British film-maker Michael Winterbottom gets his groove back with his best film in years: romantic, erotic and euphoric. It’s a docu-social-realist adventure, with fictional scenes in a real setting. Winterbottom went on the road with the rock band, Wolf Alice, documenting their performances but also inveigling ride-along actors on the tour bus, playing the part of a roadie and PR who fall in love. Read the full review. 29 September UK. Blade Runner 2049 Dir. Denis Villeneuve Harrison Ford hands on the baton of postfuturist heroism to his young co-star Ryan Gosling in this sequel to Ridley Scott’s 1982 sci-fi classic, and running at a buttock-challenging two hours and 43 minutes. The original was based directly on Philip K Dick; this is an original screenplay. Gosling plays LAPD officer K, who uncovers an awful secret about humanity, and his own existence. He sets out to discover the whereabouts of a blade runner who has been missing for 30 years — Rick Deckard, played by Ford. Jared Leto plays a sinister villain, who says things like: “You do not know what pain is yet. You will learn.” 5 October UK and Australia; 6 October US. The Reagan Show Dirs. Sierra Pettengill, Pacho Velez Reagan nostalgia? Too soon? The time will surely come for a fiction-feature about the Gipper — focusing, I predict, on the 1981 assassination attempt. (Alec Baldwin? Steve Carell?) Meanwhile, here is a documentary about Ronald Reagan made up entirely of his TV appearances, and various line-fluffing TV feeds. Who was this man? It’s an exercise in 80s immersion. He may seem hokey, but in those pre-social media, pre-Trump days he also seems like a stately monarch of homely restraint. 6 October UK; out in US. The Party Dir. Sally Potter We might have thought that Sally Potter couldn’t do funny. We were wrong. This is a short, sharp shock of a film, written and directed by Potter: a theatrical drawing-room comedy starring Kristin Scott Thomas on tiptop form, playing a government minister who is hosting a party at her elegant London townhouse, along with her husband, played by Timothy Spall. It’s like a stylish play by Simon Gray or Anthony Shaffer, with a neat punchline twist that leaves you laughing over the closing credits. 13 October UK. The Death of Stalin Dir. Armando Iannucci For my money, this is the film of the year: Armando Iannucci (Veep, The Thick of It) directs an icily brilliant, ruthlessly satirical and mordant comedy about backstairs intrigue at the Kremlin after Stalin dies in 1953. It’s superbly acted by an A-list cast including Michael Palin, Simon Russell Beale, Jason Isaacs, Steve Buscemi, Andrea Riseborough and Jeffrey Tambor. Iannucci has written the script, alongside David Schneider and Ian Martin. Read the full review. 20 October UK. I Am Not a Witch Dir. Rungano Nyoni The new film from the Zambian-born and Cardiff-raised film-maker Rungano Nyoni made a fierce impression at this year’s Cannes Film Festival. It’s a tale of dogma and corruption in the land of the director’s birth, a satirical and surreal account of absurdity and sexual politics. A young woman is accused of witchcraft and this preposterous injustice exposes a raft of absurdities. Read the full review. 20 October UK. Call Me By Your Name Dir. Luca Guadagnino Luca Guadagnino’s gay romance is a coming-of-age drama — widely acclaimed as a stunning and moving addition to this director’s already very impressive work. Timothée Chalamet is Elio, a young man whose academic father (Michael Stuhlbarg) welcomes research assistants to his handsome summer villa in Italy. One of these is Oliver, played by Armie Hammer, and his growing relationship with Elio is at the film’s centre. Read the full review. 27 October UK; 24 November US; 26 December Australia. Murder on the Orient Express Dir. Kenneth Branagh Time for some comfort cinema. Last filmed by Sidney Lumet in the 70s with an A*-list cast, Agatha Christie’s Murder on the Orient Express now returns to the screen, directed by Kenneth Branagh, who has cast himself as the great moustachioed detective Poirot. Someone has been offed in his compartment of a luxury train. One of the passengers happens to be Poirot himself. The cast includes Judi Dench, Michelle Pfeiffer, Johnny Depp, Willem Dafoe and Daisy Ridley. It’s one of Christie’s most famous and sensational endings. 3 November UK; 9 November Australia; 10 November US. The Florida Project Dir. Sean Baker Sean Baker was the film-maker who gave us Tangerine, a movie about trans experiences which he filmed mostly on his iPhone, inspiring a new generation of digital film-makers. This is a richly atmospheric and great-looking film about Moonee, a six-year-old kid who rattles around with her friends one summer, at the motel where her dad (Willem Dafoe) is manager, in the shadow of Walt Disney World. Meanwhile her mum has just lost her job as a stripper, though Moonee is happily unaware of it all. 10 November UK. Justice League Dir. Zack Snyder Inspired by Superman’s gesture of friendship, Bruce Wayne experiences a resurgence of faith in humanity and reaches out to Wonder Woman to help battle a new enemy. Director Zack Snyder stepped back from working on this movie after a personal tragedy: his daughter took her own life, and the film was entrusted to Joss Whedon. Inevitably, this puts things in perspective, as the director himself put it: “In the end, it’s just a movie. It’s a great movie. But it’s just a movie.” 17 November UK and US; 16 November Australia. Film Stars Don’t Die in Liverpool Dir. Paul McGuigan There’s a lovely warmth and likability to this heartwarming stranger-than-fiction love story, starring Jamie Bell as Peter Turner, an out-of-work actor in the 1970s who met and fell for the legendary Hollywood star Gloria Grahame, who was then in the endgame of her career and suffering from ill health – and who later came to stay with Turner’s mum and dad, played by Julie Walters and Kenneth Cranham, at their home in Liverpool. She is played with terrific verve by Annette Bening: by turns imperious, vulnerable and tender. Read the full review. 17 November UK. The Killing of a Sacred Deer Dir. Yorgos Lanthimos Yorgos Lanthimos is the Greek film-director who has acquired a cult following for his disquieting surreal strangeness; here is his second English-language movie. It’s a taboo horror about a wealthy and successful surgeon, played by Colin Farrell, who appears to have a happy if sexually weird marriage to Nicole Kidman. Then he forms a friendship with a 16-year-old boy which tests the boundaries of appropriate behaviour and ends in disaster. Read the full review. 17 November UK; 27 October US. Battle of the Sexes Dirs. Jonathan Dayton, Valerie Faris Which is better: men’s tennis? Or women’s tennis? It’s time to return to 1973 — the era of wooden racquets in presses, and the post-match jumping of the net to shake hands — for the exhibition match designed to settle this thorny issue. The contestants are the bullish, middle-aged former US champion Bobby Riggs who challenged the then twentysomething Billie Jean King to a match. Steve Carell plays the egregious Riggs and Emma Stone puts on the glasses to play King. 24 November UK; 22 September US; 28 September Australia. Suburbicon Dir. George Clooney Director and co-writer George Clooney has taken an old, unproduced script by the Coen brothers and brought it to the screen as an intriguing cousin to Fargo. It’s the 1950s and Matt Damon plays a sleazy guy with criminal interests, living unhappily with his unusual family, in the apparently picture-perfect smalltown of Suburbicon. Julianne Moore plays twins, and Oscar Isaac is an insurance claims investigator. 24 November UK; 27 October US. Happy End Dir. Michael Haneke There’s a strange note of Alan Ayckbourn to this new movie from director Michael Haneke, set in Calais: a satirical nightmare of haut-bourgeois European prosperity. It is a horribly inspired soap opera: a dynasty of lost souls. Isabelle Huppert plays a woman who has taken over a family construction and transport business from her ageing father, played by veteran Jean-Louis Trintignant. She must also preside over a grisly collection of dysfunctional family secrets. Read the full review. 1 December UK; 22 December US. Mountains May Depart Dir. Jia Zhangke This movie from China’s Jia Zhangke is a mysterious and ambitious piece of work utterly unlike anything else. It appears to evolve before our eyes, starting out as a classic drama of the kind that Old Hollywood could have produced, and then turning into a futurist essay on China’s global diaspora and a destiny of alienation. A young woman has a child with a pushy young capitalist in a country which, in the new century, is infatuated with business: that child is to grow up far away, in a future in which hopes and expectations are far from being fulfilled. A flawed, complex, challenging film. 15 December UK."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"sport/live/2017/sep/07/england-v-west-indies-third-test-day-one-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-07T17:46:34Z","webTitle":"England v West Indies: third Test, day one - as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2017/sep/07/england-v-west-indies-third-test-day-one-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/live/2017/sep/07/england-v-west-indies-third-test-day-one-live","fields":{"headline":"England v West Indies: third Test, day one - as it happened","bodyText":"That is officially that. It’s been action-packed, and has featured some brilliant swing bowling from Stokes and Anderson, and some hostile seam bowling under dark skies and bright lights from West Indies. At the end of it, well, it’s probably honours approximately even. I’ll be back for more tomorrow, though the forecast is miserable: between 11am and 6pm the chance of rain, according to current predictions, is never less than 50%, rising to 75% or more between 1pm and 4pm. It’s been raining wickets today, tomorrow it’ll just be raining, with occasional outbreaks of cricket. See you then! Bad light stops play England will be delighted about this development. It’s also raining a little. If it’s neither lighter nor drier in six minutes, the day will officially be declared over. 19th over: England 46-4 (Malan 13, Stokes 13) A shot of a flapping flag informs us that in addition to being dark, it’s also very windy. Stokes hits a very fine shot through midwicket for four, and at the end of the over the umpires get together for a chat, presumably about the fact it’s basically pitch black. 18th over: England 42-4 (Malan 13, Stokes 9) Malan clips the ball straight down into the ground, and has to spin and lunge to make sure it doesn’t bounce into the stumps. These are wild times, in which it seems absolutely anything can happen. The next ball is edged, but doesn’t carry anywhere near the slip cordon. 17th over: England 40-4 (Malan 11, Stokes 9) Malan gets a four and a three, the latter greatly assisted by the fielder chasing a gently rolling ball diving too early and missing it entirely. 16th over: England 33-4 (Malan 4, Stokes 9) Two fours for Stokes off successive deliveries from Roach, the latter a fine drive wide of midwicket, but then the last ball is gorgeous, straightening off the seam and missing the stumps by that much. 15th over: England 24-4 (Malan 4, Stokes 0) That was a poor shot from Root, the ball pitched short and heading just wide of his ribs, well over the stumps. There was no need to play it at all. Lord’s is silent, and tense. West Indies’ 123 isn’t looking quite as bad now. That’s a fine catch from Powell at first slip! He looked to his left, waited for Dowrich to move, realised Dowrich wasn’t moving, and at the very last moment flung out his hands – the ball sticks, and England’s captain has gone! Holder is on a hat-trick! 14th over: England 24-3 (Root 1, Malan 4) Three of Westley’s last four innings have ended with him on precisely eight. His average over his last five Test innings is 7.2. “Good England tactic here,” writes Mark Hooper. “Get their specialist batsmen in as soon as possible.” 13th over: England 19-3 (Root 0, Malan 0) That’s a lovely shot from Westley, clipping the ball off his pads through midwicket for four! It’s his last, though – he’s out to Holder’s final delivery. Westley’s caught on his pads! He doesn’t seem happy about it, and strolls down the pitch to chat to his captain, who tells him to start walking. This, it transpires, was a good decision. 12th over: England 15-2 (Westley 4, Root 0) These remain filthy conditions for the batsmen. The lights are on, the clouds are thick and grey, the ball is shiny, the bowlers are fast and there are four slips and a gully lined up behind the bat. England are batting as if survival is the only goal, but Cook’s innings ends after 43 balls and 10 awkward runs. England are notalot for two again. The last ball of Roach’s over nicks the shoulder of Cook’s bat and is easily caught! 11th over: England 15-1 (Cook 10, Westley 4) Another maiden, from Holder. Joe Hart is in attendance, so if Cook needs anyone to talk to about disappointingly failing to catch things, he’s in luck. 10th over: England 15-1 (Cook 10, Westley 4) Westley rolls the ball to midwicket and runs a reasonaly sharp single. The fielder hits the stumps with his throw, but Cook’s comfortably home. Then Cook hits through cover for a couple. Three off the over, which is exciting. West Indies were 18-0 after 10 overs. 9th over: England 12-1 (Cook 8, Westley 3) Cook is making some lovely shots now, though he isn’t actually timing any of them. There’s been a handsome pull that sent the ball bouncing gently to midwicket, and a back-foot swipe that sent it bobbling lazily through cover for a couple. 8th over: England 10-1 (Cook 6, Westley 3) “I’ve been doing some stats digging while waiting to meet my girlfriend’s mother at Euston station,” declares tom Bowtell, encouragingly. “Stokes now has three six-fors in Tests which represent 18 out of 95 wickets or 18.9%. This seems high – Jimmy, for example, has only taken 5% of his wickets in 6-fers and even Streaky Broad has only taken 16.5% of his wickets in 6-or-more-fors (although seven 6-fors, two 7-fors and one 8-for is quite good going).” 7th over: England 8-1 (Cook 6, Westley 1) In which Westley gets off the mark with a leg-side single. 6th over: England 7-1 (Cook 6, Westley 0) It’s a dark late afternoon in north London, with most of what light there is coming from the floodlights. Still difficult conditions for batting, and Gabriel is rapid. A maiden. England’s last four second-wicket partnerships, meanwhile: 23, 7, 25, 14. There have at least been four 50+ contributions this summer, two of them involving these batsmen. 5th over: England 7-1 (Cook 6, Westley 0) Cook sends the ball down to third man for four, in time-honoured fashion. This was only the third single-figure first-wicket partnership of England’s summer, but another four ended without reaching 20 and they have only once exceeded 35. 4th over: England 2-1 (Cook 1, Westley 0) Gabriel befuddles Westley with a 93mph stonker that squares him up, straightens and flicks the batsman’s trousers on its way through, the noise provoking a loud but unsuccessful appeal. Excellent bowling, though. 3rd over: England 1-1 (Cook 0, Westley 0) Westley is welcomed with a big inswinger that ends up thumping him in the thigh. Perhaps England should have let West Indies bat for another hour or so. Stoneman leaves Roach’s first three deliveries, but the good judgement doesn’t last and he nibbles at the next. Dowrich takes an easy catch. 2nd over: Cook 0, Stoneman 1 (England 1-0) Gabriel’s over starts with a single for Stoneman and ends with a fine delivery to Cook, sliding across him and just missing the edge. 1st over: Cook 0, Stoneman 0 (England 0-0) A largely stress-free maiden to start proceedings. That’s the sixth-lowest score by a Test team batting first after winning the toss at Lord’s, and West Indies are back out to defend it: Stokes’s bowling in full. A disappointing start, I’m sure you’ll agree: 4-2-0-0-1-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-W-0-0-1-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-1lb-0-0-0-0-0-1nb-0-1-W-1-W-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-1-0-0-0-1nb-4*-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-1-0-0-0-4-0-0-0-0-0-0-W-0-0-0-W-W * An edge A wild inswinger clatters middle stump, the innings is over and Anderson’s going to have to wait for his 500th wicket! That’s a five-fer for Stokes, and a lovely diving catch from Anderson, flying from fourth slip to collect the ball in front of third! 57th over: West Indies 123-8 (Bishoo 13, Roach 0) Ooooh! Bishoo edges the first for four, and then finally Anderson sends in an inswinger, and the batsman has not a clue about it, raising his bat helpfully as the ball streaks towards the stumps, missing them by barely an inch! The best ball of the over comes two deliveries later, heading towards the batsman, straightening and passing just over off stump. Even after two slow-motion replays of it missing it still looks certain to take off the bails. And then he repeats the dose a few times, the batsman a mere spectator. That’s beautiful bowling. Fabulous. 56th over: West Indies 119-8 (Bishoo 9, Roach 0) Stokes, refreshed by a brief break, keeps bowling, and the ball keeps swinging. It is moving a lot, making batting wildly hazardous. It’s a wicket maiden, and Stokes is one away from a five-fer. Holder is done by the inswinger! The ball starts off wide, Holder leaves it, and it’s a big mistake. The way he snaps his head back as the bails fly, as if he’s just heard a noise behind him and has absolutely no idea what it might have been, is classic. 55th over: West Indies 119-7 (Holder 9, Bishoo 9) Anderson gets the ball to swing away from Bishoo. And then he does it again. And again. And another time. Bishoo doesn’t get close to any of these deliveries, or need to, or try to. He’s waiting for the inswinger, but it never comes. It’s a maiden, which allows you to bring you this excellent fact while it remains accurate: The players are back out, and Jimmy Anderson is going to bowl the first, and 55th, over. Surely – surely – the 500th wicket will come before bedtime. 54th over: West Indies 119-7 (Holder 9, Bishoo 9) Dropped! The 13th over of Stokes’s spell, and Holder edges just to the left of Root, who gets two hands to it but can’t hold on. The next, inevitably, goes four four. And that is the last significant action of the session, which has been a fine one for England and in which Stokes has been outstanding. 53rd over: West Indies 115-7 (Holder 5, Bishoo 9) Broad is currently off the field, being treated for a “sore heel”. Anderson goes round the wicket for his final three deliveries, the first of which is lovely, angled into Bishoo and moving away, and the last is much the same. The one in between, as with a few before he switched angles, was too wide to be really threatening. One more over before tea. 52nd over: West Indies 115-7 (Holder 5, Bishoo 9) There’s a delicious late-swinging yorker here, which zips an inch wide of off stump. But Bishoo survives that, and even gets a real, proper run off the meat of his bat. 51st over: West Indies 114-7 (Holder 5, Bishoo 8) Jimmy’s back! And his second delivery goes just past the edge of Holder’s bat. And it’s that kind of over, in which Holder repeatedly feels compelled to push towards the ball and repeatedly gets away with it. A maiden, and that 500th wicket surely can’t be far off. 50th over: West Indies 114-7 (Holder 5, Bishoo 8) Stokes is called for another no ball, and the next ball’s a peach! It’s swinging into the batsman, who’s extraordinarily fortunate to get a thin inside edge on the ball and end up with a boundary to his credit instead of a trudge back to the pavilion. Bishoo’s eight runs have come courtesy of two streaky edges. 49th over: West Indies 109-7 (Holder 5, Bishoo 4) Moeen continues, though at least there’s a second slip there to deal with the next thick edge that flies wide of Stokes. Inevitably, there isn’t one. There is an inside edge, but it only sends the ball into the bottom of Baistow’s pad. 48th over: West Indies 106-7 (Holder 2, Bishoo 4) Given what Stokes is doing to the batsmen at the moment, it seems puzzling that Anderson isn’t having a go. There’s nearly another wicket here but it’s got little to do with the bowler, Holder pushing the ball to TRJ at cover and going for an optimistic single. Bishoo would have been just short had the fielder’s throw hit the stumps, and it didn’t miss by much. 47th over: West Indies 106-7 (Holder 2, Bishoo 4) Again the first ball of a Moeen over is edged high but wide of Stokes and away for four! Meanwhile, some reading for you: 46th over: West Indies 102-7 (Holder 2, Bishoo 0) A maiden from Stokes, which ends with a delivery that swings in a bit and keeps swinging, hitting Holder’s foot but on its way down the leg side. “Regarding what has gone right with Cook in the slips the debate must switch to the pressure he is now coping with following his brief failure to adapt to the new pressure of not having the old pressure of the captaincy,” writes Ian Copestake. “Under so much pressure is it a wonder that the pressure is no longer telling.” 45th over: West Indies 102-7 (Holder 2, Bishoo 0) Featuring a single for Holder and a loud, solo and entirely puzzling appeal from Bairstow as Bishoo defends the ball, which was nowhere near his pads at any point. 44th over: West Indies 101-7 (Holder 1, Bishoo 0) Well that was all-action. It started with Dowrich finally getting off the mark with a single from his 18th delivery. Just as well, because it means he doesn’t have to face the next ball, which heads towards leg stump, straightens and clips the top of off. An absolute stonker. Still, it’s not much of a let-off for Dowrich, and after a quick single from Holder his number’s up. Stokes is getting the ball to move all over the place at the moment, and the batsmen have no answers. The batsman walks, the umpire raises his finger, the fielding side celebrates! There’s some doubt about whether it carried, but it only takes one replay to answer it – that’s a fine low catch from the once-again reliable Cook. That’s a lovely delivery, and it clips the top of off stump with Chase befuddled! 43rd over: West Indies 99-5 (Chase 18, Dowrich 0) Some spin, for the first time today, and Moeen’s very first delivery takes a thick edge and flies over the right shoulder of Stokes, at first and only slip. That’s the highlight of the over, one that also includes a rank full toss, driven away for a couple. 42nd over: West Indies 93-5 (Chase 12, Dowrich 0) Stokes bowls full and wide, and Dowrich chases after it like a game puppy, though he gets nothing on it. Then a wild inswinger, which looks to be heading towards off stump before careering towards the batsman’s groin. The next goes even further, swinging way down the leg side. The last ball is a fine one, tempting the batsman again, taking an edge and bouncing into the hands of second slip. But it’s a no-ball, and the seventh delivery again slides across the batsman and well wide. 41st over: West Indies 92-5 (Chase 12, Dowrich 0) A boundary! The first four more than six overs, in which one wicket had fallen and one run had been scored off the bat. But then Chase pulls Roland-Jones, and the dark days are over. 40th over: West Indies 88-5 (Chase 8, Dowrich 0) Having troubled Chase in his previous over by bowling straight at him, this time Stokes is all over the place – he bowls across the batsman and wide, he bowls straight and wide, he bowls short and straight, and finally he bowls full, it swings into the pads and there’s a leg bye. 39th over: West Indies 87-5 (Chase 8, Dowrich 0) Another maiden, bowled by Rowland-Jones to Dowrich. Tim is busily forwarding me all the emails he never quite got round to, in which you fine people demonstrate your enormous range of disappointing jokes about philosophers. Here’s Nick Parkhouse: “Jean-Paul Sartre is sitting at a French cafe, revising his draft of Being and Nothingness. He says to the waitress, ‘I’d like a cup of coffee, please, with no cream.’ The waitress replies, ‘I’m sorry, monsieur, but we’re out of cream. How about with no milk?’” 38th over: West Indies 87-5 (Chase 8, Dowrich 0) Good afternoon Tim! Hello everybody! Stokes chases Chase all over the place here, the batsman trying to leave a shortish delivery, misjudging it and accidentally deflecting it into the turf and to third slip, and then appearing completely nonplussed by a ball that attacked his left ankle. Maiden. And here is Simon Burnton to take you through the rest of the day. Thanks for all the emails, tweets and philosophical jokes. 37th over: West Indies 87-5 (Chase 8, Dowrich 0) They took drinks at the fall of that wicket, with England suddenly rampant. Blackwood was out slogging, which shows a certain insouciance when your team are in this much trouble. And Roland-Jones again showed his ability to come up with a wicket, even when not at his best. A good question from Shariq Gilani. “Was there a hint of back-foot no-ball on the Kieran Powell wicket? Umpires have generally stopped enforcing it as it’s difficult to check in real time, but now that they go upstairs for marginal decisions, it seems like they could check this as well.” Blackwood’s aggression gets the better of him as he plays all around a regulation straight ball from TRJ. This is now a collapse. 36th over: West Indies 87-4 (Chase 8, Blackwood 1) Blackwood, not one to linger on 0, is away with a push into the covers. A good over, says Ian Botham, who think Stokes has rediscovered the ability to swing it both ways. “You don’t know what you’ve started,” says Rupert Smith, apropos philosophical jokes. “I should really save this for something to do during the rain that’s forecast for tomorrow, but: “Three logicians walk into a bar. The barman says ‘Would you all like the usual?’ ‘I don’t know,’ says the first logician. ‘I don’t know,’ says the second. Then the third logician says, ‘Yes, we would!’ “I have far worse.” 35th over: West Indies 86-4 (Chase 8, Blackwood 0) Roston Chase, who is less agricultural than his name suggests, is into the groove with an elegant clip off TRJ, after getting off the mark with something more streaky to fine leg. And Jonathan Gresty is back. “Answer to John Withington’s question [over 32]: a TRJ wicket. Keep them coming, John!” 34th over: West Indies 78-4 (Chase 0, Blackwood 0) So the boulder that Powell and Hope had pushed half-way up the hill has now slid back to the bottom. It’s a brutal game sometimes. And Geoff Wignall has picked his team for the next Test in Brisbane. “If the Ashes side is to be based purely on form, then let’s start the Collingwood/ Stevens bandwagon now. “Otherwise: Cook, Hameed, Hales, Root, Barstow, Stokes, Ali, Woakes, TRJ, Crane, Anderson. 12th man: Wood. Gold watch award: Broad.” Oof. One brings two! Stokes, finding some swing, persuades Powell to push it back, and takes a sharp catch. England are well on top now. 33rd over: West Indies 78-3 (Powell 39, Chase 0) Roland-Jones overpitches and Hope plays a handsome cover drive for four. “Lovely, lovely shot,” says David Gower, which is like being complimented on your writing style by Tom Stoppard. But next minute, all Hope is gone, as Alastair Cook beams with relief. Credit to Root for keeping him at first slip. Cook holds a catch! Textbook stuff from TRJ, seaming up the hill and taking the edge. 32nd over: West Indies 74-2 (Powell 39, S Hope 25) A maiden from Stokes to Powell. One ball in each of the past two overs has taken off, sending Bairstow into the stratosphere. A pitch that promised to be a pudding is now threatening to become a trampoline. “That’s a cracking Descartes joke,” says John Withington [29th over]. “But what do you get when you cross a joke with a rhetorical question …?” 31st over: West Indies 74-2 (Powell 39, S Hope 25) Powell shovels Roland-Jones for three to midwicket, not getting hold of it but bringing up a fine, fighting 50 partnership – further evidence that these West Indians are coming of age. Julian Farino has a question, which luckily is not too philosophical. “Been meaning to ask all summer, and now seems an appropriately quiet moment for you to put me out of my misery: what are the numbers that appear on the players’ shirts underneath the crest? They seem random - 678, 292, 302, 658… are we in Dan Brown territory? Does it relate to online betting? Cricket bingo?” It’s the player’s place in England Test history. 30th over: West Indies 71-2 (Powell 36, S Hope 25) Ben Stokes, under-used on that last day at Headingley, comes on for his first bowl here. He finds Powell’s edge instantly, but it’s a controlled edge that goes for four through the vacant gully, and Powell picks up a few more on the leg side. The last ball, touching 86mph, may be the fastest of the day. Matt Potter is back for more. “After having my error pointed out (idiot), I would like to think that one of the Stokes could be replaced by TRJ, slotting in after Woakes, with the remaining Stokes staying at 5. Although that would lead to having five seamers, and how many seamers is too many seamers? Can you have too many seamers? If so, maybe a second spinner? Or Hales AND Buttler? Is that too attacking? Does it matter? I’m losing the plot. You tell me your 11!” 29th over: West Indies 64-2 (Powell 29, S Hope 25) Roland-Jones bowls a yorker, which Powell blocks for three through mid-off. TRJ then curls a lovely outswinger past Hope’s drive, before Hope tucks him to square leg for four. Good contest. An email comes in from Ben Parker. “Good idea from Matt Potter [24th over] to have a back-up Stokes in case the regular Stokes gets banned for saying naughty words in Australia.” And here’s Peter Salmon, picking up on my non-memories of philosophy (25th over). “Astonished you don’t remember philosophy being about jokes. Have you forgotten the classic: Rene Descartes walks into a bar. The barman says ‘Do you want a drink?’ Descartes says, ‘I think not!’ and disappears.” Lol. 28th over: West Indies 57-2 (Powell 26, S Hope 21) Hope breaks the run of dots with a leg glance, picking up a cheap four because England, puzzlingly, have no fine leg. Broad beats his inside edge next ball and utters a throaty appeal, but it’s so high that not even Broad is demanding a review. 27th over: West Indies 53-2 (Powell 26, S Hope 17) Another maiden, from Roland-Jones. I’ve forgotten it already. But at least the emails are pouring in. “Afternoon Tim.” Afternoon, Ben Powell. “Prior’s 11 looks to be a 12, or is it a 10 with the inclusion of Stokes twice. Or to look at it another way: is Stokes a sub-set of Stokes and, if so, will the pressure of being both Stokes and a subset of Stokes materially affect his batting and bowling averages equally or in inverse proportion to his Stokes-y-ness?” And there we have it: the Platonic ideal of the unanswerable question. “Hi Tim (again, sorry!).” No need to apologise, Jonathan Gresty. “A quick check on Google reveals yours may be the first ever use of the compound verb ‘to square-squirt’ (I shall check some of the leading text corpora later to confirm this). What a glorious privilege you have as OBO commentator to create new words - I am delighted you are taking full advantage of it! As well as being the first Lord’s test in September, this will go down as the first in which this essential cricketing term was used.” Do I detect a trace of sarcasm? 26th over: West Indies 53-2 (Powell 26, S Hope 17) Broad continues, and gets the last ball past Hope’s edge, but his figures of 11-5-20-0 are decidedly flattering. Our next armchair selector is Rob Jacques. “Inspired by Matt Potter [24th over], I’d go with: Root, Root, Root, Root, Root, Bairstow, Moeen, Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy.” 25th over: West Indies 53-2 (Powell 26, S Hope 17) Root wasn’t insulting Roland-Jones after all – he was waiting to give him the Pavilion end, where he bowls for Middlesex. So Anderson stays on 499 for now. And Sod’s law sees to it that TRJ struggles with the slope after the switch, so Powell cuts a wide long-hop for four to bring up West Indies’ 50. They’ve applied themselves well. “Comedy Gold,” says Keiran Betteley. “Takes me back to my days studying philosophy. What’s yellow and equivalent to the axiom of choice?” Search me. I did a bit of philosophy, badly, and I don’t remember there being any jokes. “Zorn’s Lemon.” Ah. “Trust me, in a room full of analytic philosophers and mathematicians, that one has them rolling in the aisles.” 24th over: West Indies 48-2 (Powell 22, S Hope 16) Broad continues, and tries a yorker on off stump, but Powell digs it out. Broad has been so good at times to left-handers that it’s frustrating to see him being mediocre today. More excitingly, Matt Potter has picked his XI for the Ashes. “Cook, Hameed, Root, Buttler/Hales*, Stokes, Bairstow, Stokes, Moeen, Woakes, Broad, Anderson. “*Other fast-scoring players may be available – would Morgan play test stuff again?” Morgan has Rob Smyth in his corner, so he’s not to be sniffed at, but the selectors seem to see him as a white-ball specialist. 23rd over: West Indies 48-2 (Powell 22, S Hope 16) Shai Hope square-squirts Anderson for four, but immediately learns from his semi-mistake, playing a much more solid drive, also for four. Anderson’s riposte is a fabulous outswinger, darting up the hill, past Hope’s astonished outside edge. 22nd over: West Indies 40-2 (Powell 22, S Hope 8) Not content with keeping Anderson on, Root returns to Broad, which is quite the insult to Roland-Jones, given how wayward Broad was this morning. Powell creams him for four through mid-off. Where’s Woakes when you need him? I have Withingtons coming at me from all directions. “Afternoon Tim!” Afternoon John! “For the first time this summer I’m a little stumped over how to mark the occasion with an appropriate Guardian OBO cocktail. Obviously it has to be something to mark Jimmy’s hoped-for 500th today – although a 501 sounds better so hopefully he can get a four-fa before I get mixing tomorrow. But what should the ingredients be this time? Suffice to say that I can assure readers of an almost infinite selection of ingredients at the bar – though not quite so many as to require me to exercise the ‘Axiom of Choice’ (See Brother Brian’s set theory, 7th over)! Anyways …. A little help with recipe ideas would be appreciated.” 21st over: West Indies 36-2 (Powell 18, S Hope 8) Root sticks with Anderson, sniffing that 500th wicket. It’s his 11th over, but he had a nice little rest from the rain. Powell nudges a single; Hope is more watchful. Mike Atherton, who watched him in the nets yesterday, pronounces him a “proper player”. In my inbox, the spotlight is moving from Jos Buttler to Bertrand Russell. “Nice to see the great Welshman getting an airing,” says Ian Copestake. “A little ‘research’ has revealed a comment he actually made about cricket, namely that ‘Understanding language is ... like understanding cricket: it is a matter of habits acquired in oneself and rightly presumed in others.’” Of course it is. And here’s Brian Withington. “Splendid of Sir Ian (Copestake) to round the morning session off [13:12] with another fine paradox to rival that of Bertrand Russell. I wonder idly whether it can really be said to be a Test Match without an OBO contribution from the great man?” The email was entitled “Paradox regained”. You don’t get this from the Beeb. An email from Ian Copestake. “Regarding what has gone wrong with Cook in the slips, surely the debate must switch to the pressure he is now feeling at his failure to adapt to the new pressure of not having the old pressure of the captaincy. Under so much pressure is it any wonder that pressure tells in the end?” 20th over: West Indies 35-2 (Powell 17, S Hope 8) Roland-Jones is digging it in, which doesn’t seem right on a September surface with a bit of juice in it. And that’s lunch. The morning belongs to the great Jimmy Anderson, who took both the wickets to fall, and had a catch dropped to boot. Paul Harrison, on Twitter, has a question. “Does anyone understand what reason WI had for choosing to bat? With England’s top order so shaky, I don’t see the logic.” It’s a good point. They probably should have bowled, but as Rob Smyth spotted (2nd over), Lord’s tends to reward captains who bat first. If the Windies can get through today five down, they will have got away with it. And they are well placed to bowl last with their two spinners, if Holder remembers to use them. 19th over: West Indies 35-2 (Powell 17, S Hope 8) With Brathwaite gone, Powell has to be the anchor of this innings. He’s done the hard part, seeing off 53 balls and reaching his highest Test score at Lord’s. 18th over: West Indies 35-2 (Powell 17, S Hope 8) Roland-Jones locates the channel, and then finds some seam movement, but not, as yet, both at once. Hope almost nicks it with a late leave, like his brother. Raymond Reardon picks up the Bertrand Russell baton (7th and 12th overs, and 12:09). “Interesting that Russell received his Nobel prize in literature in 1950 after the Second World War for his philosophical writings and anti-nuclear war compositions, yet after the Korean War of 1950-1953, the Nobel prize for literature in 1953 was given to Winston Churchill for his works that were the complete opposite of pacifist writings.” 17th over: West Indies 34-2 (Powell 16, S Hope 8) One ball from Anderson darts away like a leg-break, another jags in like an off-break. Shai Hope, who went from boy to man at Headingley, is just about equal to it. And here comes TRJ. 16th over: West Indies 34-2 (Powell 16, S Hope 8) Straining to make Powell play, Broad strays on to his legs again, conceding four more. And then he goes back to being too wide, fifth stump rather than fourth. Get him off! 15th over: West Indies 30-2 (Powell 12, S Hope 8) One Hope replaces another, and instantly surpasses him, pushing his first ball to the cover boundary, and then guiding safely through the cordon. Anderson has 2 for 18. He’s been a one-man band this morning. Kyle Hope tries to leave one going away from him up the slope, but retracts his bat too slowly, and that’s well snaffled by Bairstow, diving to his right. Anderson moves to 499! 14th over: West Indies 22-1 (Powell 12, K Hope 0) Root keeps faith with Broad when Roland-Jones must be champing at the bit. Powell tucks one into the leg side for four, his first commanding stroke. 13th over: West Indies 18-1 (Powell 8, K Hope 0) Kyle Hope comes within a whisker of giving Anderson wicket no. 499, playing just inside another outswinger. The revised timings are out. Lunch remains at 1pm, tea goes back to 4.10, and play can, and probably will, continue to 7.10. If you’ve got Sky, put it on because Mike Atherton is digging up some gems from the British Film Institute archive of old cricket footage. Who knew that Alec Bedser made stylish home movies on Ashes tours? My colleague Ali Martin has spotted that Chris Read is having some fun in his final innings at Trent Bridge, racing to 35 at a run a ball. Such a fine player, and so poorly treated by England. The rain has stopped and play will resume at 12.30, as long as it stays dry. “On another subject,” says Peter Mackelworth, who is on a roll. “A small shout-out to Zagreb Falcons CC who are playing the Hurricanes touring team as the first game in the T20 Balkan Bash today… in the pouring rain… https://www.facebook.com/T20balkanbash/ “Ida Sokol (as they say in Croatian here). Anyone in the Zagreb vicinity… this is on all weekend… at the Budanec Oval (near Ikea).” Wish I was there. An interesting point from David Keech. “With hurricane Irma causing death and devastation in the Caribbean, I’m sure many of the WIndies side must have loved ones in danger. Why is there no talk of cancelling this match and allowing them to return in time to be with them during this extreme time? When I first moved to the USA I lived in Florida but traveled extensively all round the world. I told my family I would return to be with them if a hurricane threatened and my company respected this. I think the ICC should put lives above sport, sorry as I would be to miss the match.” The covers are still on, raindrops are falling on the lens, and Sky’s graphics are showing that Broad hasn’t made Powell play two-thirds of the time, which is poor from such an experienced bowler. Andrew Benton joins the philosophy seminar (7th and 12th overs). “Wasn’t Bertrand Russell a member of the Bloomsbury Group? The only other members I know of are Virginia Woolf and John Maynard Keynes. And...isn’t Guardian Towers in Bloomsbury? Are you the Bloomsbury paper?” In many ways, we are. But the office is in King’s Cross, on the Regent’s Canal. And before that it was Farringdon, a few blocks north of Fleet Street. Bloomsbury’s a bit pricey these days. Time for some emails. The Buttler debate continues with Peter Mackelworth. “There is some inherent ability in Buttler,” he begins, sounding like a school report from the 1970s. “I’m not sure what it is but he is a mercurial talent that should be invested in. For sure he is no worse than Westley, Malan or Stoneman based on current evidence.” Steve Hudson has a dilemma. “I have a ticket for Saturday, and would really, really like to be there when Jimmy gets his 500th. So should I feel happy or disappointed at that wicket? He only needs two more.” I’d nip along today if you can: with this breather from the rain, he could do it before lunch. And a tweet comes in from Nick TaleTeller (possibly not his real name). “Is Cook now dropping catches,” he wonders, “because he’s finally standing in the slips thinking about field placing?” Ouch. It’s raining moderately hard, and the umps take the players off. So much for that forecast. The first act belonged to Anderson. 12th over: West Indies 18-1 (Powell 8, K Hope 0) Powell keeps Broad out, peering through the encircling gloom. Powell owes his team some runs: he hasn’t reached 50 for about five years. John Starbuck is back for more, picking up on the philosophical thread (7th over). “It’s said that the OED has more information on the entry for ‘set’ than any other, so maybe Bertrand Russell was in good company that way too. By all accounts he was a one for good company, but that’s another story.” 11th over: West Indies 18-1 (Powell 8, K Hope 0) So Anderson makes the breakthrough and picks up his 498th wicket in Tests. He has been immaculate. Anderson gets one to hold its line up the slope, Brathwaite nibbles at it, and Cook is off the hook. 10th over: West Indies 18-0 (Brathwaite 10, Powell 8) Broad brings in a fifth slip, which is the right idea, or would be if he didn’t then bowl an in-ducker, which Brathwaite stabs for a single. A better ball shaves Powell’s off bail. Geoff Wignall is thinking about Cook’s fumble. “Is that now 3 dropped catches for Cook in 2 innings plus 3 overs? He used never to seem to drop that many in a season. Is it a sign that his eyes are starting to let him down when he’s deprived of a sightscreen’s benefit?” 9th over: West Indies 17-0 (Brathwaite 9, Powell 8) Anderson continues to ask all the right questions, and Powell is the candidate who hasn’t revised – inside-edging on to his pad, thick-edging short of fourth slip. On email, George Rogers isn’t happy with the talk of Jos Buttler. “I do find the belief in Buttler’s Test match credentials to be a little bizarre. What’s that old adage, the less he plays the better he gets? Actually watching Buttler bat in Tests was a thoroughly painful experience. Never before have I witnessed someone make less use of such obvious ability. As if his actions were completely at odds with the Million dollar talent straining away in his muscle memory. “The only way I’d pick Buttler is as an Opener/Keeper told to play in Pure T20 style. It might be a stupid idea. But it could be bloody entertaining. Whilst freeing up Bairstow to take a proper batting slot and sparing Hameed our wanton expectations for a tour or two.” 8th over: West Indies 15-0 (Brathwaite 8, Powell 7) Brathwaite punches Broad into the covers for a couple, but also plays an air shot. And a big black cloud has come over the ground. Meanwhile, John Starbuck is back for a second spell. “Playing both Moeen and Buttler as primarily batsmen means you can have an extra spinner, Crane, and a spare keeper who gets plenty of game time too. Haseeb is the best opener of those available to partner Cook and will come to be seen as his eventual replacement, so he should certainly go.” Amen to that. 7th over: West Indies 12-0 (Brathwaite 6, Powell 6) Anderson continues to find swing, but Brathwaite’s eye is in from Headingley, and he keeps it out before picking up two to square leg when Anderson tries the inswinger. “Morning Tim.” Morning, Brian Withington. “Excellent to see an early cricketing paradox from Jonathan Gresty [4th over]. A bit like the old chestnut of “the set of all sets that are not subsets of themselves” (think about it) that drove Bertrand Russell to such despair (well that and the threat of nuclear annihilation). Thank goodness we don’t need to worry about the latter any more ...” 6th over: West Indies 10-0 (Brathwaite 4, Powell 6) Broad jags one back into Powell which goes over middle stump – the first sign of lift. But the next one goes through slowly, allowing Powell to pick up the first boundary of the match with a back-foot poke to third man. 5th over: West Indies 6-0 (Brathwaite 4, Powell 2) Brathwaite pushes Anderson to point, having wisely decided that the best place to watch this masterclass is from the non-striker’s end. Powell’s turn to play and miss, before he too takes a single. There are plenty of gaps out the front of the pavilion, which is a crying shame. If you’re an MCC member, get your arse onto those benches. 4th over: West Indies 4-0 (Brathwaite 3, Powell 1) A maiden from Broad to Powell, tidy but unthreatening. “Hi Tim.” Hi Jonathan Gresty. “Every match now seems to bring some unlikely first or other: in Headingley it was the first batsman to score two centuries in the same match; now it’s the first ever Lord’s Test in September. Can some pundit please tell me the last English Test match when there wasn’t a first? And also whether it was also be the first English Test match without a first? Which would then automatically disqualify it.” 3rd over: West Indies 4-0 (Brathwaite 3, Powell 1) Powell gets off the mark with a thick edge. Brathwaite is dropped off a thin one. Brathwaite then edges again, just short of Stokes at fourth slip. And plays and misses. Vintage Anderson. But is the time coming when Cook should retreat to the outfield? Anderson finds the edge of Brathwaite’s bat, and Alastair Cook, at first slip, spills it. A straightforward chance. 2nd over: West Indies 3-0 (Brathwaite 3, Powell 0) Stuart Broad opens up from the Nursery End, first bowling at Brathwaite’s stumps, then suddenly remembering that he has four slips and going too wide. A stat comes in from the great Rob Smyth. “In the last 10 years there have been 21 Lord’s Tests,” he spots, “and the team batting first has won 14 and lost one.” Yes, but how many of those Tests have been in September? 1st over: West Indies 3-0 (Brathwaite 3, Powell 0) Kraigg Brathwaite, so staunch at Headingley, carries on where he left off by pushing the first ball into the covers for two. Jimmy Anderson has four slips, but not much swing as yet. Brathwaite nicks the strike with a dodgy quick single off the last ball. And all is right with the world, because John Starbuck has emailed. “As the pitch is reported to have fairy rings and suchlike,” he writes, “you wouldn’t suppose they’d have mushrooms for lunch today, but to be sure, maybe you can revive the OBO service of a look at the menu board when it comes out? We all try to be sustainable and growing one’s food on the cricket field is a novelty which could catch on, especially given the way they’re extracting value from the game nowadays.” By naming an unchanged team, West Indies have two spinners, while England have only Moeen, and the odd token over from Malan or Root. “Worth playing another/a different spinner?” says Magister Equitum on Twitter. “Wouldn’t necessarily fancy relying on Moeen for a tour of Australia.” It’s a good point, but who? Adil Rashid is mysteriously ostracised, Samit Patel seems to be seen as a Bangladesh specialist, and Mason Crane is untried except as a rather good sub fielder. Have England picked the wrong team again? Peter Mackelworth joins the fray. “If they had picked TRJ, Woakes, Hameed, Hales and Buttler… then that might be too many for 4 free places.” It would: I meant they should have played Woakes alongside TRJ today, and lined up the other three for the Ashes squad. “However, in principle I agree with you.” Phew. “Hameed and Buttler I believe are too good to miss out, Hales reminds me a little of Graeme Hick. So on reflection: Cook, Hameed, Root, Ali, Stokes, Bairstow, Buttler, Woakes, Roland-Jones, Broad &amp; Anderson. Hmmm….” That looks a stronger team than today’s, though personally I’d keep Moeen below Stokes and Bairstow. Stokes is turning into a batsman who bowls a bit, isn’t he? Alan Tuffery’s plea from 10:29 has been smartly answered by Stuart Cherry. “Here is the link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb56IgFXl64 “You might also want to tell your readers that the BBC always put a link to TMS overseas at the top of their own live blog. Or you might not.” Ha. We can stand the competition. England: Cook, Stoneman, Westley, Root, Malan, Stokes, Bairstow, Moeen, Roland-Jones, Broad, Anderson. West Indies: Brathwaite, Powell, K Hope, S Hope, Chase, Blackwood, Dowrich, Holder, Roch, Bishoo, Gabriel. Jason Holder wins the toss and opts to bat, which is brave at Lord’s in September. The Windies are unchanged. Joe Root, asked what he would have done, refuses to say, which is intriguing. Up in the media centre, it’s the end of an era. Henry Blofeld, the fruitiest of all the cakes on Test Match Special, will be putting in his final commentary stint. At the last Lord’s Test, against South Africa in July, I ran into him behind the Edrich Stand. As dialogue is his medium, it seems right to reproduce the conversation verbatim. Me: Henry Blofeld! Blowers: My dear old thing! Me: What a shame you’re quitting. Blowers: No, it’s not – I’m far too old. Talking of TMS, the first email of the day is headed “YouTube link” and comes from Alan Tuffery. “Please could you ask your wonderful and eclectici readers to provide the URL for ther Test,” he writes, “so that I can follow the commentary in my Tuscan fastness?” Tuscany and typos: is this a bid for peak Guardian? Morning everyone and welcome to the third Test. What could well have been a dead rubber has turned out to be a decider, thanks to David beating Goliath at Headingley. Sachin Tendulkar, in a text message to Brian Lara, described it as “a success the entire world needed”, which may have come as a surprise to anyone wondering if we are heading for nuclear war, but still, the cricket world did need it. The question now is: can West Indies do it again? Or will England bounce back, as they often do after a flop? The bookies, or the punters, don’t fancy the Windies at all, making them 10/1 to win the match, with England 3/1 on. So a fiver on England wins £1.67, while a fiver on West Indies wins £50. Those sums surely contain a dollop of English complacency. England have brought back Toby Roland-Jones in place of Chris Woakes, a tacit admission that they were wrong to drop TRJ in the first place. But that doesn’t mean they’re right to do a U-turn now. While Woakes was too rusty to make the ball talk at Headingley, he was himself again on T20 finals day, and he was immense in last year’s Lord’s Tests, taking 14 for 140. Plus, he is now so assured with the bat that he will get as many runs as any of England’s top-order pretenders. The selectors should have picked both him and TRJ, and given Tom Westley a rest. Anyway, they haven’t, so there’s a first Test appearance on his home ground for Roland-Jones, who, like his mentor Angus Fraser, is a character actor who can suddenly take over as the leading man. And England’s three bridesmaids, Westley, Stoneman and Malan, get one last chance to bag the plane tickets to Australia that might be better handed to Hameed, Hales and Buttler. West Indies come here on a high but they remain an unknown quantity, as only two of their likely XI have ever had a taste of a Lord’s Test. One is Kieran Powell, the left-handed opener whose slender Test average (26) gets even thinner in England (14) and almost translucent at Lord’s (6). The other is Shannon Gabriel, the hefty seamer who bowled well the other day and did all right here in 2012. Will their team-mates rise to the location, or struggle to cope with the slope and the unexpected chance to regain the Wisden Trophy? Jimmy Anderson needs three wickets to become the first Englishman, the third fast bowler and the sixth person to take 500 in Tests. It would be sweet if he did it here, under the wing of Ottis Gibson, who will be shepherding England’s seamers for the last time before becoming head coach for South Africa. Mind you, Gibson has left England for a bigger job before (with West Indies, in 2010). On past form, he’ll be back in 2022, just in time for Jimmy’s 700th. It’s all looking very appetising. We even have some tentative sunshine."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2017/sep/08/world-most-dangerous-generation-nato-chief-jens-stoltenberg","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-08T17:00:11Z","webTitle":"Nato chief: world is at its most dangerous point in a generation","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/sep/08/world-most-dangerous-generation-nato-chief-jens-stoltenberg","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/sep/08/world-most-dangerous-generation-nato-chief-jens-stoltenberg","fields":{"headline":"Nato chief: world is at its most dangerous point in a generation","bodyText":"The world is more dangerous today than it has been in a generation, the head of Nato has said, days before the mobilisation of an estimated 100,000 Russian troops on the EU’s eastern borders, and as a nuclear crisis grows on the Korean peninsula. Jens Stoltenberg, secretary general of the military alliance, said the sheer number of converging threats was making the world increasingly perilous. Asked in a Guardian interview whether he had known a more dangerous time in his 30-year career, Stoltenberg said: “It is more unpredictable, and it’s more difficult because we have so many challenges at the same time. “We have proliferation of weapons of mass destruction in North Korea, we have terrorists, instability, and we have a more assertive Russia,” Stoltenberg said during a break from visiting British troops stationed in Estonia. “It is a more dangerous world.” From next Thursday, over six days, Russian and Belarusian troops will take part in what is likely to be Moscow’s largest military exercise since the cold war. An estimated 100,000 soldiers, security personnel and civilian officials, will be active around the Baltic Sea, western Russia, Belarus and the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad, without the supervision required under international agreement. On the other side of the world, in the face of local protests, the South Korean government has deployed the controversial US Thaad missile defence system as it looked to counter potential future attacks from North Korea, which recently launched a ballistic missile over Japan, threatened the US Pacific territory of Guam and tested a possible thermonuclear device. Donald Trump has threatened to unleash “fire and fury” on the North Koreans should further threats be made against the US, and kept up the threat on Thursday, saying he is building up US military power. “It’s been tens of billions of dollars more in investment. And each day new equipment is delivered – new and beautiful equipment, the best in the world, the best anywhere in the world, by far,” Trump said. “Hopefully we’re not going to have to use it on North Korea. If we do use it on North Korea, it will be a very sad day for North Korea.” Trump has ruled out talks with Pyongyang for the time being and Washington’s diplomatic focus is now on efforts to secure agreement at the United Nations for much tighter economic measures, including an oil embargo and possibly a naval blockade. Speaking during his visit to the Estonian military base in Tapa, a former Soviet Union airstrip about 75 miles (120km) from the border with Russia, Stoltenberg was coy when asked if he backed the US president’s bellicose threats to Pyongyang, blamed by some for exacerbating the current situation in south-east Asia. “If I started to speculate about potential military options I would only add to the uncertainty and difficulty of the situation so I think my task is not to be contribute to that. I will support efforts to find a political, negotiated solution,” he said. Pushed on whether he could even envision a military solution to the crisis in Korea, Stoltenberg said: “I think the important thing now is to look into how we can create a situation where we can find a political solution to the crisis. “At the same time I fully understand and support the military message that has been implemented in the region by South Korea and to some extent Japan, as they have the right to defend themselves. They have a right to respond when they see these very aggressive actions. I also support the presence of US troops and capabilities in Korea.” Stoltenberg, a former Norwegian prime minister whose 10 years in power were marked for his success in improving Norway’s environmental footprint, took over the role of Nato secretary general in 2014, forming a close working relationship with Barack Obama. Soon after Trump’s election last year, however, in response to suggestions that the White House might back away from Nato, Stoltenberg made a pointed intervention highlighting the lives lost by the alliance’s members coming to the aid of the US after the 9/11 attacks. Trump had described Nato as obsolete during his election campaign. In May, Stoltenberg took on the role of placater-in-chief after the US president used the occasion of the opening of Nato’s new building in Brussels, and the unveiling of a memorial to 9/11, to castigate 23 of the 29 Nato members for not spending enough on defence. A number of leaders were visibly startled by the nature and timing of the speech. Asked this week whether Trump was the ideal person to unpick the current fraught security situation, Stoltenberg insisted the 29 Nato members were united within the alliance. “Donald Trump is the elected president of the United States,” he said. “And Nato is a collective alliance of 29 democracies. And that’s part of democracy, that different political leaders are elected.” He said he did not believe there was an imminent threat to Nato members, and that an increase in defence spending had strengthened the alliance in recent years. Stoltenberg has completed a tour of the four battle groups stationed in Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland, forming the Nato advanced forces defending the eastern borders. Stoltenberg said the troops’ “defensive” mobilisation was a message to Russia that an attack on one Nato ally was an attack on all, and that he remained confident of the security of eastern Europe. But he expressed concern at Moscow’s imminent failure to live up to its international obligations for exercises involving more than 13,000 troops to be open to observers, including overflights. Some Baltic states estimate that about 100,000 Russian troops will be involved in this year’s exercise and Poland claims the Kremlin has requisitioned more than 4,000 train carriages to move military personnel west. “Russia has said it is below 13,000. They briefed that on the Nato-Russia council a few weeks ago,” Stoltenberg said. “That was useful but at the same time we have seen when Russia says that an exercise has less than 13,000 troops that’s not always the case. We have seen that in Zapad 2009 and 2013 – the two previous Zapad exercises. There were many more troops participating.” Stoltenberg said Nato had always offered up its exercises to scrutiny, “while Russia has not opened any exercise to open observation since the end of the cold war”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/sep/07/malcolm-turnbulls-relief-palpable-as-he-dodges-same-sex-marriage-bullet","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-07T08:58:54Z","webTitle":"Malcolm Turnbull's relief palpable as he dodges same-sex marriage bullet | Katharine Murphy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/sep/07/malcolm-turnbulls-relief-palpable-as-he-dodges-same-sex-marriage-bullet","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/sep/07/malcolm-turnbulls-relief-palpable-as-he-dodges-same-sex-marriage-bullet","fields":{"headline":"Malcolm Turnbull's relief palpable as he dodges same-sex marriage bullet","bodyText":"Malcolm Turnbull looked for all the world like a prime minister who had dodged a bullet when the high court declined to throw out the postal survey. His relief in the moment expressed itself as arrogance. Here was a comprehensive victory over enemies, within and without. He leaned over Bill Shorten, like a heavyweight boxer who had just put his opponent on the mat. The reaction – pure adrenaline – tells you a lot about a prime minister living in a near permanent state of siege. If you watch politicians over a long period of time, at the top of their game, when things are going well, when the big moments come, when events intrude and impose themselves, they tend to dial themselves down. Their words and reactions mould to the moment and shape it into some sort of collective experience. Leaders at the top of their game speak for the nation and causes beyond themselves. They don’t burst out of moments, discordant – which was Turnbull on Thursday, triumphant, oversized, self-referential – taking grim possession of his high court victory, a trophy on a belt. In any case, while he lacked grace in the moment, the prime minister had a victory, and a significant one, on Thursday. The importance of this milestone can’t be overstated. Courtesy of the high court, Turnbull remains one step ahead of the enemies within, and without, and he will use the opportunity to try to build some political momentum. But the victory doesn’t begin and end today. Today is just the start of a critical period which will determine whether Turnbull is still prime minister by the time Australians are heading back to the polls. Turnbull now has to decide whether he takes up the opportunity of the equality campaign to reach and connect with the supporters he has disappointed since taking the top job. The alternative to leading and connecting is handing the opportunity of this campaign to the two people who desperately want his job – Bill Shorten and Tony Abbott. Abbott will want to use this campaign to show his colleagues, who are currently deeply frustrated with him, that he can beat Shorten in a head-to-head political contest. That’s Abbott’s strongest claim to any comeback – his demonstrated capacity to come from behind and beat Labor. Shorten also faces some very high stakes. He will want to convince voters who are frustrated with the deficiencies of the Turnbull government, but not at all sold on him, that he is prime ministerial material. Neither are going to waste the opportunity of this campaign. So, the question is, faced with these challenges, what is Turnbull going to do? There is another question beyond Turnbull’s own agency at a critical moment, and it’s this. What are Australian voters going to do to him? There is a good reason why governments don’t generally contract out decision making to the public, apart from elections, which are hard to avoid in democracies. The main reason decision making isn’t generally contracted out in representative democracies is because governments aren’t, then, in control of the agenda. Turnbull is now hostage to a process which will either deliver what he needs – a decisive yes vote and a smooth path to parliamentary resolution of a poisonous issue for the Liberal party – or more pain. Turnbull, by his own actions, has put his fate in the hands of Australian voters, rather like David Cameron did in the Brexit campaign when he asked Britons to work out an issue his riven political party lacked the stomach to deal with. It didn’t end so well for Cameron. How will this story end for Turnbull?"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2017/sep/10/david-lynch-the-art-life-la-soledad-colossal-snatched-review","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-10T07:00:30Z","webTitle":"David Lynch: The Art Life; La Soledad; Colossal; Snatched and more – review","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/sep/10/david-lynch-the-art-life-la-soledad-colossal-snatched-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2017/sep/10/david-lynch-the-art-life-la-soledad-colossal-snatched-review","fields":{"headline":"David Lynch: The Art Life; La Soledad; Colossal; Snatched and more – review","bodyText":"In case the recent completion – I hesitate to say “resolution” – of Twin Peaks has left a hole in your life the approximate shape and size of David Lynch’s soft-serve quiff, the DVD release of David Lynch: The Art Life (Thunderbird, 15) could not have been more cannily timed. Ostensibly a documentary about the aberrant auteur’s creative process, Jon Nguyen’s film is nothing so prosaic. Instead, it’s a wayward, stream-of-consciousness tour of a mind that knows no process, as related and embellished by the man himself, drolly revelling in formative anecdotes and dream fragments. Lynch’s ventures into fine art, as opposed to film, are the springboard for these musings, but it’s all of a piece, betraying the same fascinating, febrile imagination; it’s an internal portrait almost as eerily riveting as a Lynch original. Keep the subtle shiver going with Mubi.com’s latest hand-picked exclusive: La Soledad, a blurred-at-the-edges documentary from Venezuela. The title alludes to a pervasive sense of isolation in the country’s crumbling social fringes; it’s also the name of a ruined, rambling Caracas mansion owned by the family of director Jorge Thielen Armand, now inhabited by a pinched working-class family who won’t be able to stay much longer. In a peculiar way, this is a study of economic downturn as ghost story: there’s a strange, delicate twinge of the supernatural in its folds, but the colonial house is really haunted by memories of previous, more affluent residents, of generations and possibilities that no longer exist for their inheritors. Colossal (EIV, 15) is a high-concept curiosity worth seeking out simply for the brazen what-if extremes of its premise; teasing out the success or otherwise of its execution is part of the fun. Anne Hathaway is the errant, alcoholic writer who somehow – deep breath here – ascertains that her daily actions and errors are puppeteering the apocalyptic rampage of a Godzilla-type beast on the other side of the globe; what ensues is a woolly, genuinely anomalous fusion of brash monster movie and therapy drama, crying out for attention and analysis. Demanding merely the former, and hardly earning it, is Snatched (Fox, 15), a gunky, shrieky mom-com (right) that somehow already feels years old. Goldie Hawn’s long-missed, still sparky timing gives it a handful of redeeming points; shame she’s mostly cast as the straight woman to onscreen daughter Amy Schumer, whose usual straight-shooter act isn’t given any good punchlines to fire. The last days of summer feel like the right moment to face the sharp, parched comic truths of Greek director Argyris Papadimitropoulos’s debut Suntan (Eureka, 18). A deeply discomfiting portrait of schlubby male midlife crisis in the face of oppressive island-holiday beauty, it sees the masculine ego elevated, taunted and tattered with ruthless, recognisable specificity. The cycles of insecurity, denial and release for older women, meanwhile, are negotiated with classic French elan in The Midwife (Curzon Artificial Eye, 12), a slight framework for two strong Catherines – Deneuve and Frot – to act their guts out. Finally, either a warning, or a clarion call for connoisseurs of catastrophe: Sean Penn’s The Last Face (Lionsgate, 15), practically placed in cinematic quarantine after last year’s derided Cannes premiere, has slipped straight to DVD. It is, and I don’t wish to put too fine a point on this, one of the worst films ever made: a gaseously pompous white-saviour romance set in darkest war-torn Africa, where children are dying to the musical accompaniment of the Red Hot Chili Peppers while Charlize Theron and Javier Bardem fight out the bigger problem of their tempestuous attraction. “She’s leaking urine, but she’s still dancing!” one side player immortally observes of an abused African martyr; the same might be said of this perversely unforgettable film."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2017/sep/13/deforestation-ivory-coast-trees-chimpanzees-make-way-cocoa","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-13T12:30:10Z","webTitle":"'Once this was all trees, but they burned them to plant cocoa': the ruin of West Africa's rainforest","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/sep/13/deforestation-ivory-coast-trees-chimpanzees-make-way-cocoa","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/sep/13/deforestation-ivory-coast-trees-chimpanzees-make-way-cocoa","fields":{"headline":"'Once this was all trees, but they burned them to plant cocoa': the ruin of West Africa's rainforest","bodyText":"Sinewy, silvery trees rise from the green landscape of Marahoué national park, their smooth trunks supporting branches only at the very top. Marahoué is one of eight national parks in Ivory Coast and 20 years ago it was covered by forest and home to chimpanzees and elephant herds. Now it is more common to see the skeleton of a tree, slowly burnt by fire to get rid of the shadow it casts over cocoa fields, or just a sawn-off stump. Henri, a traditional leader from the nearby town of Diafla, grew up with the forest, and speaks lovingly of its towering iroko trees – but he had a hand in destroying it. Like many others, he has cocoa plantations inside the park and employs people from Burkina Faso to work on them. “This all used to be trees, but farmers burned them to plant cocoa,” Henri says. When he was younger, he used to see chimpanzees and elephants make their way through the park. They have been replaced by people. Having run out of petrol on his way into Marahoué, Henri leaves his motorbike by the track and makes the rest of his journey on foot, passing herds of cattle, the ubiquitous scrappy cocoa plants, and the remains of a tourist lodge that was destroyed in 2008, shortly before the village of Zanbarmakro was founded nearby. Nobody uses the word “village” for Zanbarmakro, preferring the more temporary-sounding “camp”. But the large new church being built at one end, the mosque at the other, as well as the homes, shops and private clinic in between dispel any pretence that this place, home to 13,000 people, is not here to stay. Mid-afternoon, men arrive on their motorbikes from the plantations and rest on the stoop of a shop selling fizzy drinks. Women spread out their wares: one, a higgledy-piggledy pile of shoes, another, a rack of scythes, the sort every child carries for harvesting. Cassava mills whirr. By some estimates there are 50 illegal villages inside the park. Zanbarmakro is one of the biggest. Nestled at its entrance is a lookout post on stilts built years ago by the OIPR (Office Ivoirien des Parcs et Réserves), the state parks authority. Its rangers have the job of ensuring that no trees are cut down, no wild animals hunted, and certainly no villages built in the park. Strangely, they seem not to have spotted the bricks and cement for the church and mosque arrive, nor the trucks loaded with cocoa beans or timber leave. Henri introduces Zoughory Laji Bourema, Zanbarmakro’s chief, who steps round a large white tarpaulin spread with drying cocoa on to his verandah. “I get a bit of trouble from the OIPR,” he admits, smoothing down his shiny purple boubou. The OIPR’s rangers spend much of their time drinking tea and checking WhatsApp at the residence behind their office, a few miles from the park’s boundary. Occasionally, though, they leave their camp beds to go “hunting”. They descend on a plantation, arrest a few farmers every week, and lock them up until the community pays for their release. The ransom is well known: 100,000 francs per person (£140), or 150,000 francs if they are caught with a motorbike. “They come into the villages, collect money – a few million francs a time – and then go again,” says Henri, searching in vain for some tree shade of a tree to protect himself from the sun. “They come [for it] in their four-wheel drives about twice a month.” In May, locals say the bribe they handed over was the biggest ever – the equivalent of £13,000, paid to the local OIPR chief. (A request for comment from the OIPR’s chief, Colonel Tondossama Adama, did not elicit a response.) In return, they can stay and farm cocoa, which they sell to the agents of buyers in the nearby cities of Bouaflé and Bonon, who in turn sell it to Saco, a subsidiary of Barry Callebaut, which in turn supplies a string of global chocolate brands. When approached for comment, Barry Callebaut did not deny the specific allegation that illegal deforestation cocoa had entered its supply chains and said: “There is cocoa farming happening in high conservation value areas in West Africa.” Barry Callebaut restated a commitment to be totally deforestation-free by 2025. The Guardian travelled through Ivory Coast with the Mighty Earth group to investigate the impact of cocoa on the dwindling rainforest. We both interviewed traders and managers of cooperatives who said they bought cocoa from protected areas and sold to Olam, a global agri-business. Olam acknowledged one incident it said was isolated and added that it was pursuing a string of initiatives to assure a clean supply chain. “Olam is absolutely clear that deforestation by cocoa smallholders must be halted,” a spokesperson said, while adding nonetheless: “it is a complex and highly fragmented supply chain so the challenges of tracing back to each individual farmer are immense”. Despite Prince Charles’s success in extracting promises from industry that they would come up with a plan to reverse deforestation, the message has not got through to cocoa producers and traders on the ground. At one cocoa yard belonging to a buyer called Sivacco in the city of Man, men sift the beans through big metal rectangular sieves and shovel it into sacks, one wearing a Father Christmas hat. Opposite the yard is a sprawling sawmill with piles of sawdust, planks and logs, and smoke billowing out behind it. “We definitely have cocoa from the forest reserves here,” says the yard manager, who did not want to be named. “Pisteurs (motorcyclists) bring it here and we can’t tell where exactly it comes from. We sell to all the big companies.” Behind him is a big mural with the Rainforest Alliance symbol and a list of forbidden activities. “We don’t care. We don’t even ask the producers where it comes from. The big companies never ask where it comes from either,” says Bamogo Arouna, a buyer in Taobly, a town on the edge of Mount Tia, a classified forest in the west of Ivory Coast. Arouna says he sells to two big exporters who sell cocoa products to companies including Nestlé, Mars and Hershey. Farmers ride their cocoa-laden bicycles from the reserve to Arouna’s warehouse which emits the sickly raw cocoa smell that, strangely, smells nothing like chocolate. One farmer unloads a half-full sack of cocoa from his bike rack and men begin to toss it through giant sieves. “Cocoa is cocoa,” shrugs a trader, looking over the lush landscape in front of him. “We just pay whoever has it. We don’t differentiate between forest reserves or non-forest reserves.” When he came to the area from Burkina Faso 12 years ago the view was of tropical forest; now, it’s crops. To him, it makes no difference. “It was green when I arrived,” he says. “It’s still green.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/blog/2017/sep/07/premier-league-title-contenders-manchester-city-united-liverpool-chelsea-tottenham-squads","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-07T09:50:53Z","webTitle":"Premier League truly starts now – so how do the title contenders measure up? | Jonathan Wilson","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2017/sep/07/premier-league-title-contenders-manchester-city-united-liverpool-chelsea-tottenham-squads","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/blog/2017/sep/07/premier-league-title-contenders-manchester-city-united-liverpool-chelsea-tottenham-squads","fields":{"headline":"Premier League truly starts now – so how do the title contenders measure up?","bodyText":"August never seems an entirely satisfactory month. The closing of the transfer window and the scramble for last-minute deals always seems to deflect from the matches themselves – although these days, perhaps, it is the other way round – and then just as everything is about to get going for real, just as throats have been cleared and vocal cords are warmed up, everybody dashes off to play a series of internationals that, in the year before the World Cup, contrive to be highly significant while feeling like an unwanted distraction. The phoney war is over. For four months the transfer window is closed and barring the next two sets of internationals – which at least will settle who is going to the World Cup, making them far harder to begrudge – there is nothing to get in the way of the actual business of trying to win football matches, starting on Saturday lunchtime with a proper heavyweight clash as Liverpool go to Manchester City, the game that last season left Pep Guardiola happier than apparently anything else in his time in England to date, despite it ending in a 1-1 draw. Quite how happy he is now is hard to say. Guardiola’s moods are highly unpredictable – he can swing from prickly and morose to prickly and fey in the blink of an eye – but even after a summer of unprecedented spending, there is perhaps a slight sense of frustration at failing to complete the jigsaw by landing Alexis Sánchez. Many City managers in the recent past have tried to sign Arsenal’s best forward; Guardiola is the first to fail. Whether that was to do with Arsenal surprisingly discovering a backbone or unsurprisingly being too disorganised to bring in a replacement is open to debate – and of course it was not Guardiola himself conducting the deal – but somebody who plans so meticulously must have had a specific role in mind for the Chilean. Given the depth and quality of City’s squad, it should be a minor detail but the failure to land Sánchez contributes to a sense that Guardiola’s side are, at the moment, falling a little short. There is plenty of time to get it right, of course, and City are far from the only team lacking a little fluency at this stage, but what’s been striking this season, even as City have had the better of their three league games, is how unlike a Guardiola side they have looked. They have been just another very good team, rather than a side intent on expressing a philosophy. Again, that may come, but it may be by design as Guardiola, who has always insisted he is no aesthetic fundamentalist, has adapted to a league that seems a little robust for his filigree stylings. Thrilling as Liverpool have been, meanwhile, they too seem short in one key area. It is all very well thrashing a supine Arsenal but, however devastating they can be going forward, they appear to lack the defensive resolve for a title challenge. Signing Virgil van Dijk would not necessarily have changed that but he has come to represent that concern. At least Liverpool still have Philippe Coutinho, who – like Van Dijk and Sánchez – will have to work out just how committed he is after a move failed to materialise. The trio’s form will be a major part of the narrative between now and January. It is not just City and Liverpool suffering short-blanket syndrome, though. Perhaps that is simply the nature of the modern super-rich Premier League, that there’s always one area that needs improving, but none of the key challengers can be entirely satisfied. Chelsea have perhaps the best-balanced squad but it lacks depth, particularly after the failure to sign Fernando Llorente on the final day of the window. Tottenham, despite astute late dealing, look short of cover at full-back. Manchester United got their business done early and have begun with convincing wins against the sort of sides they struggled to dispatch last season but the suggestion is that José Mourinho wanted another full-back. Arsenal probably cannot even be considered challengers any more, their shortcoming being basic leadership. The sense of drift that had characterised the decade since the move from Highbury could come to be seen as something far worse should Alex Oxlade‑Chamberlain prosper at Liverpool and people begin to ask how many other young talents would have been better off outside the selfie-taking indulgence of the Emirates. Even at this early stage, Arsène Wenger is far from the only manager under scrutiny. The attempt to turn Crystal Palace overnight from a Sam Allardyce side into a mini-Ajax seems to have unravelled already, with Frank de Boer in danger of his second managerial stint of less than three months in a row. Slaven Bilic’s position is under threat as well, although a truer picture of just how bad West Ham are will come when they have played a home game. Potential sackings, crisis clubs, signings that absolutely have to be made in January – the soap opera is back in full flow. The awkward opening scene is over and September is here."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"social-care-network/2017/sep/08/child-protection-professionals-learn-child-deaths","type":"article","sectionId":"social-care-network","sectionName":"Social Care Network","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-08T08:16:44Z","webTitle":"When will we child protection professionals learn from child deaths?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/social-care-network/2017/sep/08/child-protection-professionals-learn-child-deaths","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/social-care-network/2017/sep/08/child-protection-professionals-learn-child-deaths","fields":{"headline":"When will we child protection professionals learn from child deaths?","bodyText":"For the last nine years I have taken every opportunity to explain to the media and public the complexities of child protection work. The question that stays in my mind came from Holly Willoughby on ITV’s This Morning, who asked me: “Joanna, when are you going to stop children dying?” But as I read the Ayeeshia-Jayne Smith serious case review this week, I found myself becoming increasingly angry because I cannot get away from the fact that, in some respects, agencies just pay lip service to the importance of learning from the lives and deaths of abused children. We make all the right noises but then seem to carry on doing exactly what we were doing before – and that is so wrong. In interviews, I am not there to defend or justify practice. All I want to do is use the platform to explain the context and why it is never as simple as journalists, and sometimes politicians, make it seem – but sometimes, actually, it is. Three of these simple aspects of practice are highlighted in the Ayeeshia-Jayne Smith serious case review [pdf]. Simplest of all is: “Missed medical appointments for children on a child-protection or children-in-need plan should no longer be recorded as DNA (did not attend) but always seen in the context of ‘was not brought’, to ensure that parental neglect is considered as a factor.” This comes up repeatedly in serious case reviews. Some health services have implemented this simple change, but many have not. Why is it so hard? I was delivering child protection training somewhere recently and an emergency department consultant said to me that as well as saying “did not attend” they also say “self-discharge”, even if it is a baby. There is absolutely no excuse for health services not making this simple change. A second issue to consider that comes up time and again is referred to in the Ayeeshia-Jayne Smith review: “Emergency department and paediatric staff must ensure that they always consider abuse or neglect within their differential diagnosis when considering the reasons for a child’s presentation.” This responsibility does not just lie with health professionals; it lies with all the agencies and, primarily, children’s social care as the lead agency in child protection. Again, there is no excuse. Medical evidence is absolutely crucial and the context always needs to be understood in order to assess effectively. This brought to mind a serious case review I did in which a paediatrician made an assessment, in isolation, that the injuries to a child that she was seeing were not as a result of sexual abuse but she had not been aware that a known predatory sex offender had been in the child’s home the night before. We all know the barriers, but this is absolutely fundamental to assessing levels of risk to children and bluntly, how likely they are to die, or suffer life-changing injuries, if they remain in that home. How many more times do we have to read this in a serious case review before it sinks in and practice changes? A learning point that frequently comes up in serious case reviews and is so simple to change relates to partnership agreements. In the words of the Ayeeshia-Jayne Smith review’s author, “written agreements and requiring individuals to sign them need to be used with caution”. How many times do we have to be told that written agreements are not effective in protecting children, particularly in domestic abuse cases, before we stop using them for that reason? I fully recognise they are useful to build evidence for a court, but as I set out in an article in 2014, there is no evidence base for written agreements. The social work profession should research this and directors of children’s services should email their staff to say that every case where there is such an agreement should be scrutinised and direction should be given to all social workers about when and how to use them. All the other issues present in this family also come up again and again but they are hugely complex – domestic abuse, substance misuse, mental ill-health, personality disorders, housing, honesty and transparency – with no easy answers. But there are easy answers to the ones discussed here and the changes must happen immediately. If they do not and we continue to hear of those three issues in reviews of children’s deaths, then we will have to accept our responsibility and acknowledge that we too, as professionals, have blood on our hands.

A disused office building has been transformed into the headquarters of the Kasang corporation, an imaginary South Korean outfit specialising in smart technologies designed to identify consumer habits and encourage us to spend more. The audience of about 40 are given “kpads” so they can shop in the company’s neon-lit mall and gain K points. As we do so, we unthinkingly reveal precious data about ourselves. We get a chance to try virtual reality, and play a real-world version of one of the company’s successful online games. But, in a show played out over several floors of the building and an adjoining multi-storey car park, the game gradually turns nastier and darker. We find ourselves lost in a maze and suddenly transported to a police station where stony-faced officers glare if we try to go the wrong way. First produced in Korea in 2013, One Day, Maybe was inspired by the suppressed 1980 Gwangju uprising in which 2,000 may have died, many as a result of detention and torture. The uprising is often seen as the turning point in South Korea’s struggle towards democracy. But what would some of the protestors think about what that democracy has achieved, particularly regarding South Korea’s role in the global marketplace? Did people die so you and I could have a smart fridge? With dozens of cast members playing Kasang employees and police, the show conjures up the past and the dead who stare back accusingly from photographs. Director Tristan Sharps has always been a brilliant conjuror of absence. The scale is always impressive, even if the content is sometimes thin. Some segments trail on too long and the show is so specifically about Korea that it risks losing universality. Although it does make you think what our ancestors might feel about how we use the freedoms they died defending. The piece becomes increasingly emotionally pungent, and Sharps smartly uses juxtapositions: in one segment the muted home life of the past is in tension with the shiny emptiness of the present day. It is often in the silent moments that the show is at its most eloquent. • At a Hull city centre venue until 1 October."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"business/2017/sep/07/uk-house-prices-properties-halifax-employment","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-07T08:42:06Z","webTitle":"UK house prices rising amid shortage of properties, says Halifax","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/sep/07/uk-house-prices-properties-halifax-employment","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2017/sep/07/uk-house-prices-properties-halifax-employment","fields":{"headline":"UK house prices rising amid shortage of properties, says Halifax","bodyText":"UK house price growth unexpectedly picked up last month, underpinned by strong employment growth and a shortage of properties on the market, according to Britain’s biggest mortgage lender. The average price of a house rose by 1.1% to £222,293 in August, said Halifax, which is owned by Lloyds Banking Group. Prices in the three months to August were 2.6% higher than a year earlier, up from an annual rate of 2.1% in the three months to July, which was a four-year low. Annual price growth has slowed from a peak of 10% in March 2016. The figures were surprising, as other surveys have suggested a slowdown in the housing market. Affordability is an issue as household incomes are being squeezed, with inflation outstripping wage growth, but this has been countered by low unemployment, low mortgage rates and a shortage of properties for sale. Russell Galley, the Halifax managing director, said: “Recent figures for mortgage approvals suggest some buoyancy may be returning, possibly on the back of strong recent employment growth, with the unemployment rate falling to a 42-year low.” Halifax noted that UK home sales have exceeded 100,000 for seven months running. Between June and July they edged up to 104,760, the highest level since March 2016, according to HMRC figures. The other closely watched monthly house price index, from Nationwide, Britain’s biggest building society, showed house prices dipped 0.1% between July and August, reducing the annual growth rate to 2.1%. Jeremy Leaf, a north London estate agent and a former Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (Rics) residential chairman, warned against being carried away by the Halifax figures. “It is worth remembering that house price growth is being underpinned by a shortage of supply, including housebuilding, historically low mortgage rates and relatively low unemployment, rather than strong buyer demand. Fewer transactions are taking place where affordability has been most stretched due to lack of new and existing stock – such as in London – and inflation higher than wage growth. “The short-term impact of Brexit on the housing market was probably overestimated but the longer-term effects may have been underestimated. However, now that the government is negotiating the UK’s exit from the EU, further uncertainty seems inevitable until the final outcome becomes clearer.” Samuel Tombs, a UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the pick-up in house price growth “should not be mistaken for underlying momentum”. He noted that Halifax’s measure rose by just 0.1% on a three-month-on-three-month basis. Tombs added: “House purchase demand undeniably has weakened recently — Rics has reported falling new buyer inquiries in five of the last six months — as the real wage squeeze has intensified and consumer confidence has deteriorated. We expect demand to weaken further before the end of this year as the real wage squeeze worsens and lenders follow through on plans to tighten lending criteria.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2017/aug/28/mondays-best-tv-game-of-thrones-finale-nadiyas-british-food-adventure","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-28T05:00:25Z","webTitle":"Monday’s best TV: Game of Thrones finale; Nadiya’s British Food Adventure","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/aug/28/mondays-best-tv-game-of-thrones-finale-nadiyas-british-food-adventure","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2017/aug/28/mondays-best-tv-game-of-thrones-finale-nadiyas-british-food-adventure","fields":{"headline":"Monday’s best TV: Game of Thrones finale; Nadiya’s British Food Adventure","bodyText":"Imagine: Margaret Atwood – You Have Been Warned! 10.30pm, BBC1 Alan Yentob meets Margaret Atwood, presently enjoying an even greater degree of acclaim than usual thanks to the TV adaptation of her 1985 novel The Handmaid’s Tale.

But something big is slowly stirring in the undergrowth of British politics. Fact by fact, announcement by announcement, the case for Britain to remain in the European Union’s single market and customs union is growing stronger and more irresistible by the day. Such an outcome is most definitely not this government’s policy. But, this autumn, something will have to give. Over the past 10 days David Davis’s Brexit department has published seven so-called partnership papers: important documents covering a wide range of subjects, from customs and Northern Ireland to civil justice and, most recently, disputes mechanisms, including the role of the European Court of Justice. According to the introductory blurb inside each, these papers are all about forming a bespoke post-Brexit partnership with the EU. Yet, by intention or accident, they do something very different. Together they make a case for sticking with the existing partnership as it stands, or at least with its key arrangements, such as the single market and customs union. In every case, the papers start from the reality of the Brexit vote and then gently proceed to undermine it. None makes the case that Britain should turn its back on the EU, as the Brexiteers would like. None heads off into the fantasy world in which nations, dazzled by British exceptionalism, queue up to make bilateral deals with Liam Fox. Instead, all seek to retain large parts of the cooperation and openness that Europe has given this country. The trajectory has shifted from go-it-alone – sometimes unbelievably so, as in the dogged refusal to recognise that the commitments to leaving the EU and maintaining an open border in Ireland are almost impossible to combine – towards the status quo. None of them quite say this, of course. The politics of the Tory party do not permit it. The relevant ministers continue to believe that Britain can have its cake and eat it. But as this week’s U-turn on the role of the ECJ exemplified, the hard Brexit policy that has sustained Theresa May for a year is now visibly crumbling around her. Today’s announcements about immigration are not, in a formal sense, part of this slow crescendo of government pragmatism towards Europe. In a political sense, however, they are cut from precisely the same cloth, not least in the way they brutally undermine some of May’s most trenchantly repeated mantras about Brexit – that the 2016 vote was centrally about a genuine migration problem, that migration can be slashed to the tens of thousands to the national good, and that foreign students must be treated as part of the migration issue. Amber Rudd’s blizzard of announcements and statistical documents today take a lot of this ground from under May’s feet. The prime minister may be tempted to say that the fall in net migration, down 81,000 from the 327,000 recorded in 2016, shows that Brexit is already clearing out foreigners who either are, or feel themselves to be, unwanted. More thoughtful people, however, see that the departed have taken significant skills, spending, taxes and goodwill with them. More departures and failures are likely, especially with the status of EU migrants after Brexit remaining unclear. The impact is already being felt in the growth of the eurozone: double that of the UK economy in both the first and second quarters of 2017. Rudd’s paper assessing the border exit checks programme is also subversive. Along with HMRC statistics on tax credit claims, also published today, the documents confront several of the myths and exaggerations that fire the immigration argument. Once again, the effect is to reduce May’s authority by undermining claims she has made her own. While the HMRC figures mock the idea that benefit tourism is a big problem (less than 2% of tax credit spending goes to recently arrived Europeans), the Rudd paper shows that at least 96% of the 1.34 million people to enter the UK on visas expiring in 2016-17 left before the expiry date. The share is more than 97% in the case of those on study visas. In other words, May’s insistence that students be treated like all other migrants in the figures does not hold water. All but a handful of students come to study, and then leave. Counting them as migrants simply inflates the figures and causes public anxiety. That such public anxiety exists is beyond question. This reality shapes the way that many in both the Conservatives and Labour have responded to the Brexit vote. However, the mass of evidence that is now being published ought to permit both parties to look again, with less panic and more thought, at the anxiety over immigration, at its context and drivers, and at what can be done about it. May is in danger of being trapped by this. She has treated the Brexit vote as a vote on migration. But was it? Voters were not asked about migration. They were asked whether or not they wanted to be in the EU. Migration was indisputably part of that, being especially prominent in the campaign waged by Arron Banks and Nigel Farage. But the vote was about many things: and in the end the only thing about which May or anyone else can be certain is that it was a vote to leave. Opinion polls suggest, by and large, that the majority to leave is still there. But some things have changed since June 2016. False claims, like the NHS dividend and the total collapse of the economy, have been discredited. May and Ukip have both had a bad year. And the case for engagement with the EU after Brexit now looks much more solid than the fantasies about global Britain. The logic of this summer’s developments, including David Davis’s papers and Amber Rudd’s figures, points clearly to the possibility that Britain could embrace the Norway option of single market and customs union membership while standing clearly outside the EU. This is a question that both Labour and the Tories are going to be forced to wrestle with in the coming weeks. Neither of them is particularly well prepared for the exercise. But the outcome will decide whether Theresa May has a future."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"books/2017/aug/26/the-princess-myth-hilary-mantel-on-diana","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-26T05:00:27Z","webTitle":"The princess myth: Hilary Mantel on Diana","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/aug/26/the-princess-myth-hilary-mantel-on-diana","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2017/aug/26/the-princess-myth-hilary-mantel-on-diana","fields":{"headline":"The princess myth: Hilary Mantel on Diana","bodyText":"Royal time should move slowly and by its own laws: creeping, like the flow of chrism from a jar. But 20 ordinary years have jog-trotted by, and it’s possible to have a grownup conversation with someone who wasn’t born when Diana died. Her widower is long remarried. Her eldest son, once so like her, shows signs of developing the ponderous looks of Philip, his grand-father. Diana should be as passe as ostrich plumes: one of those royal or quasi-royal women, like Mary of Teck or Wallis Simpson or the last tsarina, whose images fade to sepia and whose bones are white as pearls. Instead, we gossip about her as if she had just left the room. We still debate how in 1981 a sweet-faced, puppy-eyed 20-year-old came to marry into the royal house. Was it a setup from the start? Did she know her fiance loved another woman? Was she complicit, or was she an innocent, garlanded for the slab and the knife? For some people, being dead is only a relative condition; they wreak more than the living do. After their first rigor, they reshape themselves, taking on a flexibility in public discourse. For the anniversary of her death, the princess’s sons remember her for the TV cameras, and we learn that she was “fun” and “very caring” and “a breath of fresh air”. They speak sincerely, but they have no news. Yet there is no bar on saying what you like about her, in defiance of the evidence. Private tapes she made with her voice coach have been shown in a TV documentary, Diana: In Her Own Words. They were trailed as revealing a princess who is “candid” and “uninhibited”. Yet never has she appeared so self-conscious and recalcitrant. Squirming, twitching, avoiding the camera’s eye, she describes herself hopefully as “a rebel”, on the grounds that she liked to do the opposite of everyone else. You want to veil the lens and explain: that is reaction, not rebellion. Throwing a tantrum when thwarted doesn’t make you a free spirit. Rolling your eyes and shrugging doesn’t prove you are brave. And because people say “trust me”, it doesn’t means they’ll keep your secrets. Yet royal people exist in a place beyond fact-correction, in a mystical realm with rules that, as individuals, they may not see; Diana consulted psychics to work out what was going on. The perennial demand for them to cut costs and be more “down to earth” is futile. They are not people like us, but with better hats. They exist apart from utility, and by virtue of our unexamined and irrational needs. You can’t write or speak about the princess without explicating and embellishing her myth. She no longer exists as herself, only as what we made of her. Her story is archaic and transpersonal. “It is as if,” said the psychotherapist Warren Colman, “Diana broadcast on an archetypal frequency.” Though she was not born royal, her ancestors were ancient power-brokers, dug more deeply into these islands than the Windsors. She arrived on the scene in an era of gross self-interest, to distract the nation from the hardness of its own character. As she correctly discerned, “The British people needed someone to give affection.” A soft-eyed, fertile blond, she represented conjugal and maternal love, and what other source did we have? Until Tony Blair took office as a fresh-faced Prince Charming we had female leaders, but they were old and their cupboards were bare of food and love: a queen who, even at Diana’s death, was reluctant to descend from the cold north, and a prime minister formerly known as Maggie Thatcher, Milk Snatcher. * * * The princess we invented to fill a vacancy had little to do with any actual person. Even at the beginning she was only loosely based on the young woman born Diana Spencer, and once she was engaged to the Prince of Wales she cut adrift from her modest CV. In the recent documentary Diana, Our Mother, her son Harry spoke of her as “an ordinary 20-year-old”; then checked himself, remembering she was an aristocrat. But in some ways his first thought was right. Like a farmer’s daughter, Diana married the boy across the hedge – she grew up near the queen’s estate at Sandringham. As the third daughter born to Viscount Althorp, she was perhaps a disappointment. The family’s previous child, a son, had died within hours of birth, and Spencer and his wife Frances had to try again for an heir. The Jungian analyst Marion Woodman posits that unwanted or superfluous children have difficulty in becoming embodied; they remain airy, available to fate, as if no one has signed them out of the soul store. By Diana’s cradle – where the witches and good fairies do battle – stood a friend of the Queen Mother, her maternal grandmother Ruth Fermoy. When Diana was six, Frances left her young family. Fermoy took sides against her daughter and helped Spencer get custody of his four desolate children. Later, promoted to his earldom, he remarried without telling them. Diana is said to have expressed her views by pushing her stepmother downstairs. Diana’s private education implanted few cultural interests and no sense of their lack. She passed no public exams. But she could write a civil letter in her rounded hand, and since she didn’t have to earn a living, did it matter? In Diana: In Her Own Words, she speaks of her sense of destiny. “I knew … something profound was coming my way … I knew I was different from my friends …” Like Cinderella in the kitchen, she served an apprenticeship in humility, working as an upper-class cleaner, and in a nursery mopping up after other people’s babies. Then the prince came calling: a mature man, with a history of his own. By her own account, Diana was not clever. Nor was she especially good, in the sense of having a dependable inclination to virtue; she was quixotically loving, not steadily charitable: mutable, not dependable: given to infatuation, prey to impulse. This is not a criticism. Myth does not reject any material. It only asks for a heart of wax. Then it works subtly to shape its subject, mould her to be fit for fate. When people described Diana as a “fairytale princess”, were they thinking of the cleaned-up versions? Fairytales are not about gauzy frocks and ego gratification. They are about child murder, cannibalism, starvation, deformity, desperate human creatures cast into the form of beasts, or chained by spells, or immured alive in thorns. The caged child is milk-fed, finger felt for plumpness by the witch, and if there is a happy-ever-after, it is usually written on someone’s skin. In a TV interview before the marriage – the “ghastly interview,” as Diana called it – Charles wondered quizzically, “whatever ‘in love’ means”. He has been blamed ever since for destroying the simple faith of a simple maid. But off-camera, Diana was preparing. Her choice of hymn makes the marriage a patriotic duty, like signing up for a war: By Diana’s later account, the wedding day was “the worst day of my life”. But at the time – July 1981 – she looked dazed with happiness. Even for republicans there was much to enjoy. A great city en fête. The oily reverence of the commentators with their peculiar word order: “For the first time through the centre gateway of Admiralty Arch arrives Lady Diana …” Best of all, the outfits: Princess Anne dressed as an Easter egg, wearing a furious scowl. Diana’s entrance into legend prompted a national gasp, as she tumbled from her coach like a bride in a bag. Her gown unfolded perfectly, like a paper flower. But some palace lackey had erred; the vehicle was too cramped for a tall flouncing lassie and her frock. * * * It takes a lot a lot of know-how and behind-the-scenes sweat to transform Cinderella from dust-maid to belle. Fairytales do not describe the day after the wedding, when the young wife lost in the corridors of the palace sees her reflection splinter, and turns in panicked circles looking for a mirror that recognises her. Prince Charles’s attitude of anxious perplexity seems to have concealed an obtuseness about what the marriage meant to his bride. The usual young woman of the era had a job, sexual experience, friends who stayed within her circle – her wedding was simply a big party, and she probably didn’t even move house. But Diana’s experience as daughter of a landed family did not prepare her for Buckingham Palace, any more than Schönbrunn prepared the teenage Marie Antoinette for Versailles. It was Diana’s complaint that no one helped her or saw her need. Fermoy had expressed doubts before the marriage. “Darling, you must understand that their sense of humour and their lifestyle are different …” The bathos is superb. “Mind how you go,” say the elders, as they tip off the dragon and chain the virgin to the mossy rock. What would have happened to Diana if she had made the sort of marriage her friends made? You can picture her stabled in the shires with a husband untroubled by brains: furnishing a cold house with good pieces, skiing annually, hosting shoots, stuffing the children off to board: spending more on replenishing the ancestral linen cupboard than on her own back. With not too much face-paint, jacket sleeves too short for her long arms, vital organs shielded by a stout bag bought at a country show, she would have ossified into convention; no one would have suspected her of being a beauty. Like many women in mid-life, she would have lived in a mist of discontent, struggling to define something owing, something that had eluded her. But in her case the “something” would have been the throne. Even in childhood photos Diana seems to pose, as if watching her own show. Her gaze flits sideways, as if to check everyone is looking at her. One “friend” told a TV crew that as a teenager, “whenever you saw her alone she would have picked up some trashy romantic novel”. Leave aside the casual denigration of women’s taste: if Diana imagined herself – the least and youngest daughter – as magnificent, all-conquering, a queen, she had a means of turning her daydream into fact. Diana claimed that she and the prince met only 13 times before their wedding. Did she keep a note? She lacked self-awareness, but had strong instincts. It must have been child’s play – because she was anxious to please, or because she was crafty – to seem to share his visions and concerns. An earnest look, a shy silence, job done. Chaste maids were not too plentiful in the 1980s. The prince took advice: snap her up, sir. Diana was no doubt really shy, and certainly unused and unformed: a hollow vessel, able to carry not just heirs but the projections of others. After marriage she had power that she had not sought or imagined. She had expected adulation, but of a private kind: to be adored by her prince, respected and revered by her subjects. She could not have imagined how insatiable the public would be, once demand for her had been ramped up by the media and her own tactics. In her circle there were no solid witnesses to the nature of reality – only those who, by virtue of their vocation, were fantasists, exalting sentiment, exploiting the nation’s infantile needs, equating history with the history of a few titled families. She had a sense of her own fitness to be princess, and unfitness for any other role. But she had no sense of the true history in which she was now embedded, or the strength of the forces she would constellate. At first, she said, she was afraid of the crowds who gathered to adore her. Then she began to feed on them. When Diana became the most famous woman in the world, it is not surprising that less popular members of the Firm were miffed. The queen herself had been a beauty, but may have thought it vulgar to be too interested in one’s looks. Diana was allowed to interest herself in little else. Her dealings with the press and photographers were not innocent. The images had to be carefully curated – her good side, so to speak. There were unacceptable angles. And when an image is created by the lens it can fuzz and slip and blur. Unsure of her boundaries, the princess starved herself, as if her healthy frame could pare away to the elfin proportions of the models and dancers who fascinated her. She threw up her food, hacked at herself with a blade. In Diana: In Her Own Words she sneers at her young self – her tone contemptuous, punitive. She cannot forgive that girl, naive heroine of a gothic novel – whose fate is to be locked in a keep by a man of dubious intentions, and to be practised upon by older women who have secrets she needs to know. * * * In 1992 Charles and Diana separated. In 1996 the dead marriage was buried. This was not what had been negotiated, in the 13 encounters. The prince resumed his old narrative, with the woman he should have married in the first place. Another story had begun to tell Diana. Cut loose, she opened the doors of her identity and all the dead princesses floated in, those deposed and exiled, beheaded and shot. With them came the screen idols and the spoiled glamour girls – Monroe naked and dead, Garbo who wanted to be alone. As we grow up, we aim to be “self-possessed”, not taken over by others. But as the novelist Ivy Compton Burnett says, “People have no chance to grow up. A lifetime is not long enough.” Isolated by the pique and indifference of the other royals, neglected, crossed in love and bested by Mrs Parker Bowles, she found “affinity”, she said, with the rejected. To her credit, she had begun to work actively to lessen the amount of pain in the world. She visited the sick, and stopped just short of claiming the healing touch that custom bestows on the divinely anointed; had she become queen, she would surely have gone about raising the dead. Legend insists she showed the world that it was safe to shake hands with a person with Aids. Even in the unenlightened days of 1987, only the bigoted and ignorant thought casual contact would infect them, but any gesture from Diana was worth years of public education and millions in funding. She hung around with Mother Teresa, and did it while wearing couture; she moved towards suffering, rather than swerving from it. “When people are dying,” she said, “they’re much more open, more vulnerable, much more real than other people, and I appreciate that.” Among the weak she recovered her strength – transformed from peely-wally puking maid to an Amazon heading to battle. She knew dread diseases would not kill her. Like Joan of Arc, protected by her own magic, she walked unscathed. Campaigning against landmines, she passed through explosive terrain. Her armoured vest was inscribed, “the HALO Trust”. Her blond head gleamed like a fell invitation, inviting a bolt from the blue. The divorce was a sour one. It is difficult to extract sober truth from the bitching of the sycophants on either side. Diana won the War of the Waleses because she was ruthless, and had better legs. Her withdrawal from public life, dramatically announced, suggested that she would emerge as a new model. Possibly this transformation was under way, but it failed to complete, till death completed it. Instead she behaved like a daffy celebrity, and her fans began to laugh at her attempts to hoover up a hero. What kind of mate fits the bill, if your first has been a future king? The chance of an ordinary life of trial and error was what she had rejected long ago – when, as her sisters put it, they printed her face on the souvenir tea towels. But though her sheen was smudged a little by her failures in love, the marks could be polished away. It was possible for the public to hold two views of her simultaneously, and perhaps they were not contradictory: goddesses are not known for propriety. It’s no use saying to a super-being, “Keep your hands off my husband.” She takes and consumes, and spits out the tough bits. By the time of her Panorama interview, late in 1995, Diana had developed a habit of speaking of herself in the third person. Sphinx-like, unsmiling and with mater dolorosa makeup, she presented herself as both a victim and a person of great power, and though she spoke plainly enough, it was with the mysterious air of one forced to communicate in riddles. She was too much for the royal family, she said: wasted on them. She saw nothing good for Charles. “Who knows what fate will produce?” It was not a question. In her polite duchessy way, she was cursing him. But the end of royal status had stripped away Diana’s protection, both practically and mystically. After the Panorama broadcast there was a buzz in the air: a doomy feeling, as if her options were running out. She still played games with the press, but they knew a dirtier game. They spat at her, insulted her to try to draw a reaction. She teased them, and they chased her down, not killing her yet. She is supposed to have feared sinister forces, anticipated that her end was prepared. As every fortune-teller knows, such hints assume precision in retrospect. * * * A deathbed, once, was a location dense with meaning, a room packed with the invisible presences of angels, devils, ancestors. But now, as many of us don’t believe in an afterlife, we envisage no final justice, no ultimate meaning, and have no support for our sense of loss when “positivity” falters. Perhaps we are baffled by the process of extinction. In recent years, death narratives have attained a popularity they have not held for centuries. Those with a terminal illness scope it out in blogs. This summer the last days of baby Charlie Gard riveted worldwide attention. But what is the point of all this introspection? Even before the funeral, survivors are supposed to flip back to normal. “Keeping busy” is the secret, Prince William has advised. Grief is exhausting, as we all know. The bereaved are muddled and tense, they need allowances made. But who knows you are mourning, if there is nothing but a long face to set you apart? No one wants to go back to the elaborate conventions of the Victorians, but they had the merit of tagging the bereaved, marking them out for tenderness. And if your secret was that you felt no sorrow, your clothes did the right thing on your behalf. Now funeral notices specify “colourful clothing”. The grief-stricken are described as “depressed”, as if sorrow were a pathology. We pour every effort into cheering ourselves up and releasing balloons. When someone dies, “he wouldn’t have wanted to see long faces”, we assure ourselves – but we cross our fingers as we say it. What if he did? What if the dead person hoped for us to rend our garments and wail? When Diana died, a crack appeared in a vial of grief, and released a salt ocean. A nation took to the boats. Vast crowds gathered to pool their dismay and sense of shock. As Diana was a collective creation, she was also a collective possession. The mass-mourning offended the taste police. It was gaudy, it was kitsch – the rotting flowers in their shrouds, the padded hearts of crimson plastic, the teddy bears and dolls and broken-backed verses. But all these testified to the struggle for self-expression of individuals who were spiritually and imaginatively deprived, who released their own suppressed sorrow in grieving for a woman they did not know. The term “mass hysteria” was a facile denigration of a phenomenon that eluded the commentators and their framework of analysis. They did not see the active work the crowds were doing. Mourning is work. It is not simply being sad. It is naming your pain. It is witnessing the sorrow of others, drawing out the shape of loss. It is natural and necessary and there is no healing without it. It is irrelevant to object that Diana alive bore no resemblance to Diana dead. The crowds were not deluded about what they had lost. They were not mourning something perfect, but something that was unfinished. There was speculation that Diana might have been pregnant when she died. Was something of startling interest evolving beneath her skin – another way of living? The question was left hanging. Her death released subterranean doubts and fear. Even those who scorn conspiracy theories asked, what exactly is an accident? Why, on the last night of her life, did Diana go below ground to reach her destination? She need not have gone that way. But she didn’t choose – she was driven. Her gods wanted her: she had been out too late. From her first emergence in public, sun shining through her skirt, Diana was exploited, for money, for thrills, for laughs. She was not a saint, or a rebel who needs our posthumous assistance – she was a young woman of scant personal resources who believed she was basking with dolphins when she was foundering among sharks. But as a phenomenon, she was bigger than all of us: self-renewing as the seasons, always desired and never possessed. She was the White Goddess evoked by Robert Graves, the slender being with the hook nose and startling blue eyes; the being he describes as a shape-shifter, a virgin but also a vixen, a hag, mermaid, weasel. She was Thomas Wyatt’s white deer, fleeing into the forest darkness. She was the creature “painted and damned and young and fair”, whom the poet Stevie Smith described: In the TV broadcast last month, Prince William said, “We won’t be doing this again. We won’t speak openly or publicly about her again …” When her broken body was laid to rest on a private island, it was a conscious and perhaps superfluous attempt to embed her in national myth. No commemorative scheme has proved equal or, you might think, necessary. She is like John Keats, but more photogenic: “Here lies one whose name was writ in water.” If Diana is present now, it is in what flows and is mutable, what waxes and wanes, what cannot be fixed, measured, confined, is not time-bound and so renders anniversaries obsolete: and therefore, possibly, not dead at all, but slid into the Alma tunnel to re-emerge in the autumn of 1997, collar turned up, long feet like blades carving through the rain.

One in the south or the east, with a military dictatorship perhaps – a country that has a large oppressed religious or ethnic minority, or has a poor record of treating women as second-class citizens. Earlier this week, the US joined those countries; that publicly shamed stable of those that have incurred the wrath of the global human rights ombudsman. Inevitably, it was due to race. A UN committee charged with tackling racism has issued an “early warning” over conditions in the US and urged the Trump administration to “unequivocally and unconditionally” reject discrimination. The warning specifically refers to events in Charlottesville, Virginia, where the civil rights activist Heather Heyer was killed when a car crashed into a group of people protesting against a white nationalist rally. Such statements are usually issued by the UN committee on the elimination of racial discrimination (Cerd) over fears of ethnic or religious conflict. In the past decade, the committee has only issued six warnings. Those admonishments went to Burundi, Iraq, Ivory Coast, Kyrgyzstan and Nigeria. Civilisations are undone in many ways, not all of them obvious. We tend to think of decline along military or economic lines but it is actually a nation’s culture, particularly in terms of equality, that determines its civilisational credentials. America’s descent into what looks like a full on race crisis is graphically dragging it down the “development” scale. Reality is closing in on the country’s exceptionalist self-perception. But to be shocked by this is to have thought of the US as a superior civilisation in the first place. Having picked the brief window in between Trump’s travel ban appeals – while the ban itself was still suspended pending a court decision – I managed to secure a visa to the US and travelled to the east and west coasts. Even among some Trump supporters, it was clear to me that there is a sense that America has been “outed”. There is a burgeoning self-awareness that the country is now tarred with the brush of intolerance as indelibly as Africa is with that of ethnic warfare. Those countries that receive rebukes from the UN over human rights – as you can see from the list of those warned before the US – don’t tend to be ones that developed problems overnight. What the Trump era is graphically exposing is that America’s very public meltdown is an unravelling of issues that were suppressed, deflected or denied for many years. This didn’t all happen in the eight months since Trump became president. The pertinent fact here is that it took only eight months. It took only eight months to go from a nation that voted for a black president two terms in a row to one that is suffering from race riots and killings, with officials having to send troops out on to the streets and declare a state of emergency. The speed with which it happened is the clue that it was in fact happening all along, unseen. And the fact that it was lying in wait is an indicator of how little racial equality is prized in the United States’ DNA. There is a reason why ostensibly developed countries, once faced with adversity, a vacuum of authority or questionable leadership, tend to fall apart along the lines of race, LBGTQ and women’s rights. It is because in times of stability, when there is prosperity and rational leadership, the promotion and enshrining of the rights of the more vulnerable is cosmetic at best, undermined and papered over at worst. The foundations were there and continued to be laid even during Obama’s leadership. It is no coincidence that the rights most easily dislodged and taken back – whether it is those of transgender members of the military or Muslim US citizens of certain origins – are those of minorities. Even in the UK, it is no coincidence that the first jubilant spasm after the Brexit vote was manifested in a rise in hate crime. It is no coincidence that making America great again, or taking back control, inevitably involves wanting to claw back whatever little space was ceded to diversity and equality. This reclamation lies at the very heart of the US and UK’s modern nation-building. The UN cautioned that the Trump administration “should take the Cerd’s early warning very seriously and rescind its decision to eviscerate the mandates and budgets of US civil rights institutions; end its attempt to exclude white nationalism from the federal government’s Countering Violent Extremism programs; and end immigration and refugee policies based on anti-Muslim, anti-immigrant sentiment.” But even that will not be enough. The UN’s message is a good start in formulating the language and paradigm that sees discrimination not as an isolated phenomenon but fundamental to the infrastructure of the country, in the same way as the nation’s other inequalities. Race hate is not a temporary blip or hysteria that has come to pass because of a freak election or referendum. The only way forward is to remember that when the good are in power. • Nesrine Malik is a freelance writer"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/aug/24/the-guardian-view-on-the-new-gcses-missing-the-point","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-24T18:02:41Z","webTitle":"The Guardian view on the new GCSEs: missing the point | Editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/aug/24/the-guardian-view-on-the-new-gcses-missing-the-point","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/aug/24/the-guardian-view-on-the-new-gcses-missing-the-point","fields":{"headline":"The Guardian view on the new GCSEs: missing the point","bodyText":"It is traditional among Brits who have already left school to complain that GCSE exams get easier every year. This time they got harder. Sweeping reforms have made the curriculum more demanding, with increased rote learning and fewer opportunities to retake exams. Easy ways for some parents and schools to boost the grades of weaker students, such as coursework, have been cut back. And a more finely calibrated grading system for maths and English – where nine is the highest and one the lowest – will allow universities and employers to make a more nuanced choice between pupils, particularly the ablest. The reforms are good ones, but the reformers have their priorities wrong. For too long ministers have focused on the country’s highest-achieving pupils. They should now pay attention to everyone else. Only about a third of 18-year-olds go to university; for the rest the road from education to work is uncertain and full of potholes. There are plenty of places to start. One is changing a policy which dictates those who fail English and maths must resit them until they pass. Dismally low resit pass rates – currently at 23% – suggest room for a rethink. Another is addressing the country’s crumbling further education colleges, which aim to provide technical training for the vocationally minded. These were the only area of education openly targeted for cuts since 2010, and now face another drubbing. A third is the state of apprenticeships, which have been billed as an alternative to A-levels and a solution to Britain’s skills gap. In reality most are poorly paid – some below minimum wage – rated only as equivalent to a GCSE and of uncertain value in the job market. Employers who offer the coveted level 3 traineeships, equivalent to A-levels, tend to use GCSE performance as a way of selecting candidates, leaving the un-academic out in the cold. And Britain is one of the only countries in the world that have more adults in apprenticeships than younger people (a new levy, encouraging businesses to hire older people, may make matters worse). There are signs that ministers are thinking along the right tracks: more attention has been paid to apprenticeships in recent years, for example. But what is needed is reforming zeal. Britain is beset with low social mobility and a long tail of underachievement. This will continue until the country finds better options for the young and vocationally minded."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"science/2017/aug/24/martin-aitken-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-24T17:23:58Z","webTitle":"Martin Aitken obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/aug/24/martin-aitken-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2017/aug/24/martin-aitken-obituary","fields":{"headline":"Martin Aitken obituary","bodyText":"My father, Martin Aitken, who has died aged 95, was a scientist who pioneered the application of physics to archaeology. He coined, with the archaeologist Christopher Hawkes, the term archaeometry, helping to make huge advances in dating finds from as early as the Lower Palaeolithic period. He was born in Stamford, Lincolnshire, the younger son of Percy Aitken, an engineer draughtsman, and his wife, Ethel (nee Brittain), who farmed with her mother until her marriage. Martin was educated at Stamford school and studied physics at Wadham College, Oxford, before becoming a fellow of Linacre College and later a member of the Royal Society. He became Oxford professor of archaeometry in 1985 before retiring in 1989. In 1947 he married Joan (nee Killick), whom he met during the second world war at a radar station, when she was in the Women’s Auxiliary Air Force (the Waaf). They brought up five children in their cottage near Oxford, often taking us on archaeological digs. Based at the Oxford Research Laboratory for archaeology and the history of art from 1957, Martin expanded on research into radiocarbon dating. He developed the proton magnetometer and Squid (superconducting quantum interference device) magnetometer to detect and date buried archaeological remains by measuring differences in the Earth’s magnetic intensity. In the 1960s, he moved on to using thermoluminescence, a little known phenomenon at the time. When ceramic or lava are heated, they release electrons that become trapped within imperfections in their structure during firing. By measuring these, the length of time since their initial exposure to heat can be ascertained. Thermoluminescence enabled dating as far back as the Lower Palaeolithic period – 2.5m years BC to 200,000BC – for which dating was otherwise elusive. He later developed a similar technique: optically stimulated luminescence, which involves the exposure of quartz and feldspar to intense light. This is now a significant method of dating sediment. His work overturned contemporary assumptions regarding the age of several well-known ceramic artefacts. These included the so-called Hacilar ware, previously thought to be from ancient Turkey, and inscribed tablets found at Glozel, near Vichy, France, at one time thought to be Neolithic. This latter work, primarily carried out by his student Doreen Stoneham, initiated his love of the Auvergne. He retired to Le Garret, a small hamlet in the Monts de Forez, in 1996, where he and Joan lived in the house they had bought six years earlier. When Joan died in 2005, he stayed on at Le Garret with the support of the local community and my sister, Jennifer. My father was a generous, likable man with an insightful, logical mind. He was also a competitive sailor and keen camper. Martin is survived by his daughters, Sara, Jennifer, Hannah and me, and by nine grandchildren and five great-grandchildren. Niall, his son, died in 2015."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2017/sep/20/steve-reich-different-trains-1947","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-20T06:00:39Z","webTitle":"Ghosts of partition: a musical odyssey about the desperate train journeys that divided India","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/sep/20/steve-reich-different-trains-1947","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2017/sep/20/steve-reich-different-trains-1947","fields":{"headline":"Ghosts of partition: a musical odyssey about the desperate train journeys that divided India","bodyText":"In 1988, having turned classical music on its head with his radical minimalism, Steve Reich unveiled what remains one of his most recognisable and admired works. With its three movements of chopping strings, air raid-like drones and repeated snatches of speech, Different Trains was Reich’s meditation on rail travel, the American composer contrasting the easy cross-country journeys he made during the second world war with the enforced transportation of his Jewish kin in Europe. In that same grim period, just a few years after the liberation of the concentration camps, train travel again became a symbol of human tragedy. An exhausted postwar Britain carelessly scored a line through India, creating Pakistan, and sowed the seeds for decades of bitter conflict. In the chaos, Muslim families crammed themselves into carriages bound for Pakistan, while Hindus travelled in the opposite direction, both fearing for their lives. It wasn’t unknown for “ghost trains” to arrive at their destination ablaze, their passengers burned to death. Seventy years after partition, as living memories of 1947 fade, a group of musicians from Britain and India are using Reich’s work as an inspiration for their own examination of the subcontinent’s scars. In east Berlin, inside the crumbling DDR radio station building, three of them are patiently tweaking mixing boards and rearranging drum patterns on their laptops. In one studio is Jack Barnett, frontman of These New Puritans, the increasingly unclassifiable outfit whose last album featured flugelhorns, magnetic piano and the deepest voice in Britain. In the next is Actress, aka Darren Cunningham, whose mulchy, decaying take on techno has made him a cult club figure in the UK. And in the third is Sandunes, an Indian producer whose global electronic influences stretch from the LA beat scene to London raves. Soaking up the sounds are Iain Forsyth and Jane Pollard, the artist and film-maker couple tasked with providing a visual backdrop for Different Trains 1947 when it’s unveiled in three performances this autumn, starting at the world’s oldest passenger railway station – Edge Hill in Liverpool – before rolling on to London’s Barbican and Magnetic Fields festival in Rajasthan. Music is central to Forsyth and Pollard’s art: an early work saw them remake an infamous video of a Cramps gig in a psychiatric hospital, and they recently went inside the mind of Nick Cave for the award-winning movie 20,000 Days on Earth. Pollard says this project feels “a bit like tying our hands behind our backs. But that’s what we love – we have no control over the sound, the one thing that usually we have all the control over.” Earlier this year, Barnett and Cunningham travelled to India to explore the history of partition and learn from master musicians. Barnett, a Reich devotee who caught the minimalism bug through a record-shop listening post when he was 13, has taken the most conceptual route for his composition, one requiring the most health and safety form-filling. Played alongside a live drummer, “every sound within my piece is derived from one of two sources,” he explains. “The first is interviews with people who experienced the events of 1947 – all the harmonic material is derived from their voices. The second is a recording I made of a steam train that would have existed in 1947.” Barnett’s no stranger to gathering weird material. For the last New Puritans album, he brought a harris hawk into the studio to capture the sound of its wings flapping. His latest strange instrument may not have claws, but it comes with its own unique dangers: figuring out the practicalities of recording an engine. “Most of the ways you’d normally mic something are impossible, because the engine gets so hot that any mic stand would just melt.” His recording team tried holding booms out of train windows, “but obviously you don’t want to have things going too far out, because they get in the habit of hitting tunnels. It took a long time to find people who were willing to do it.” The result, as he demonstrates in prototype form, is a seven-minute “journey” through steel and steam. “It’s incredible,” says Pollard. “It lurches and it’s off-kilter – you’d imagine it would be really structurally dense and rigid. But it’s not, it’s just amazing.” In contrast to Barnett’s pared-down approach, Cunningham put himself through a crash course in Indian classical music, meeting masters of the tabla, tanpura and sitar while building a library of field recordings – but was soon overwhelmed. “The idea of using as many Indian instruments as possible became totally unrealistic. You need a certain level of understanding before you even go there.” So he just asked himself: what would Steve Reich do? Deciding to play with pitch and tempo, Cunningham sampled a train horn and transposed it into a cavernous low drone, and is now breaking down a fiendishly complex tabla pattern (“faster than any Aphex Twin break,” says Barnett) into a set of wobbly drum hits. To add a human element, he’s working with Hindustani vocalist Priya Purushothaman, whose singing – adapted from an Urdu poem by Faiz Ahmed Faiz – “is able to express the nuances I want to get across without it being fully brutal, fully dark”. The project has a different resonance for Sanaya Ardeshir, aka Sandunes, whose own family was torn apart by partition. “It doesn’t get recognised often enough as the largest mass migration of human beings in history,” says the Mumbai-based producer, who created her own archive of samples for her piece by interviewing her grandmother. “My grandfather is originally from Karachi,” she says. “He moved to India in 1945, just before partition. If he’d known how difficult it would be to go back, he would not have left his family and gone to India for work. Yet that’s where he met my grandma and got married.” Ardeshir’s piece is shaping up to be the most faithful to Reich’s original, with her grandmother’s story broken into repeated phrases over an awkward time signature, echoing the uneasy lurch of an old train carriage. The three musicians first met only a few weeks ago. “Sanaya came with something that was extremely developed,” says Cunningham sheepishly. “That set the tone. I was still faffing around.” Barnett had been waiting to receive his engine recordings, while Forsyth and Pollard were in the unenviable position of having to pull everything into a complete audiovisual spectacle in just a few weeks. To add yet another layer, the film-makers have been digging through BFI archives in search of the hidden history of partition. “The material that’s survived shows you such a tiny sliver of that period,” says Forsyth. “I’ve been reading about the end of empire and Operation Legacy, which was basically the British rewriting their colonial history. The industrial scale on which history has been rewritten and erased really pulls into focus when you see what is still there, so trying to imagine what you can’t see is just beyond comprehension.” To highlight the inauthenticity of these vintage reels, they’re planning a theatrical staging of the footage that will be filmed and then form part of the performance. It’s highbrow stuff, riffing on Brecht’s “epic theatre” and the video art of Bruce Nauman – but visceral too, with a certain rock’n’roll attitude; the steam engines have even given them an excuse to bring out the dry ice. “Our work,” says Pollard, “has always had a fascination with repetition, both inside the moment – a visual repeating – and that idea of the present being haunted by the past.” With so many hands on the wheel and so little time, the pressure’s on. For some, the peril is bracing. “It’s easy to work with things you know,” says Forsyth, “and return to the scene of the crime over and over. But I think, as an artist, it’s your job to run towards the fire – to find a way through the thing you don’t understand.” Different Trains 1947 is at Edge Hill station, Liverpool, 27 September; Barbican, London, 1 October; Magnetic Fields festival, Rajasthan, 17 December."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2017/aug/24/theodor-bergmann-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-24T16:37:10Z","webTitle":"Theodor Bergmann obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/aug/24/theodor-bergmann-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/aug/24/theodor-bergmann-obituary","fields":{"headline":"Theodor Bergmann obituary","bodyText":"My friend and colleague Theodor Bergmann, who has died aged 101, was a German communist and an accomplished agronomist and historian. He was the last living eyewitness to the powerful labour movement of interwar Weimar Germany. Born in Berlin, the son of Reform rabbi Julius and his wife, Hedwig (nee Rosenzweig), Theodor joined the communist movement at the age of 11, briefly participating in the Communist Youth League before joining his brothers Alfred and Josef in the Communist party (Opposition), or KPO, led by expelled anti-Stalinist dissidents. As a teenager he met many luminaries of German communism, including Heinrich Brandler, while helping out in the Junius Verlag publishing house, discussing politics with former party leaders after picking up their lunches from the local bakery and performing various errands. These experiences and relationships would shape his world view as a self-described “critical communist” for the rest of his life. After fleeing to Palestine to avoid Nazi persecution, 19-year-old Theodor travelled to the Sudetenland along the German-Czechoslovak border in 1936 to help with underground work being conducted by his KPO comrades across the border. Following the Nazi annexation of Sudetenland in 1938, Bergmann went to Sweden, where he spent the rest of the second world war. Returning to Germany in 1946, he moved around the occupied zones (both west and east) to reconnect with his former KPO comrades and spent several years editing the postwar group’s publications. Frustrated with the grim political outlook facing leftwing forces in the early 1950s, he left active politics and returned to his agronomy studies, completing a doctorate in 1955. He taught all over Germany and Europe before becoming a professor of comparative international agricultural policy at the University of Stuttgart-Hohenheim in 1973, and published numerous books and articles on international agricultural developments throughout his career. Following retirement in 1981, Theodor dedicated himself to documenting the history of the communist movement, publishing an immense catalogue of histories, biographies and analyses of the German and international movements. He visited Britain to interview Sir Fitzroy Maclean, the Scottish soldier and Unionist (Conservative) MP, several months before his death in 1996. Bergmann credited Maclean in his autobiography for being a principled opponent of fascism, unlike many conservatives. He also contributed to the British journal Revolutionary History. Until the end, Theodor remained involved in politics as a speaker and author, publishing nearly a book per year since 2009. His last, a critical defence of the People’s Republic of China, appeared earlier this year. His history of the KPO, Gegen den Strom (Against the Current), is planned for English translation in the Historical Materialism Book Series. His partner, Gretel Steinhilber, died in 1994."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/aug/24/we-wouldnt-put-up-a-statue-to-nelson-or-robert-e-lee-today","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-24T17:48:44Z","webTitle":"We wouldn’t put up a statue to Nelson or Robert E Lee today  | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/aug/24/we-wouldnt-put-up-a-statue-to-nelson-or-robert-e-lee-today","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/aug/24/we-wouldnt-put-up-a-statue-to-nelson-or-robert-e-lee-today","fields":{"headline":"We wouldn’t put up a statue to Nelson or Robert E Lee today","bodyText":"It would be a stretch to say the civil war monuments in the American south were only erected to be racist (Toppling statues? Here’s why Nelson’s column should be next, 22 August). Many civil war statues were funded by both the north and the south at the turn of the century, up until the 1920s when the vast majority of these veterans were dying off and their families wanted to put something up to remember their fathers and grandfathers. Their heroes and leaders were the natural subjects for these tributes. It should be noted that the north had the best sculptor, Augustus Saint-Gaudens. The south wanted more statuary and turned to Beaux-Arts and classical sculptors. North and the south artworks are best represented in Vicksburg over a period of years. None of the articles on statues in the news mention who the sculptors were and their value. It’s easier to trash them if that information is not discussed. Afua Hirsch also ignores the pedigree of Nelson’s column, which had a number of renowned sculptors involved at a cost of £47,000 in 1840 – £4,510,933.74 in today’s money. Confederate sculptures, including Lee in Charlottesville, were ignored until fairly recently. There are testimonies from city council hearings in Charlottesville from African-Americans saying no one paid attention to the statues until the city council started to activate the town against them. Recently Charles Barkley said: “I’m 54 years old; I’ve never thought about those statues a day in my life.” Patricia Saffran New York, USA • The claims by Geoff Clifton and Francis Blake (Letters, 19 August) that Robert E Lee was “unsympathetic to slavery” and that his support for the southern states in the American civil war was “not because he was (necessarily) a supporter of slavery” rather stick in the throat. In a letter to his wife, written in December 1856, Lee admitted that “slavery is a moral and political evil”, which he then proceeded to justify by claiming that slavery was “a greater evil to the white man than to the black race”. For good measure, he explained to her that the slaves “are immeasurably better off here than in Africa” and that “the painful discipline they are undergoing is necessary for their instruction as a race”. Lee may have been a skilful military commander, but that cannot obscure the reality: he owned slaves, he ill-treated slaves and he fought to preserve slavery in the name of a “wise and merciful providence”. Jacob Ecclestone Diss, Norfolk • It seems unlikely that the austere and patrician Lee would have approved of any statues of himself. He would probably have disapproved even more of the sort of people who still fly the stars and bars as a white supremacist symbol. And one can only wonder at what he would have made of the present incumbent of the White House. David Budgen Durham • I believe Afua Hirsch has missed the qualitative difference between Confederate generals and Lord Nelson. The former led a rebel army in a bitter civil war that caused a huge loss of life in the cause of slavery. Their continued presence after the war encouraged the segregation in the south. If you want an equivalent example in this country, it would be better to topple statues of Charles I, who caused a huge loss of life in order to defend the indefensible cause of the divine right of kings. Richard Ascough Thames Ditton, Surrey • Part of Nelson’s work had indeed been policing 1780s Caribbean trade, keeping the way open for the slave trade. Was he responsible for the policy decision authorising this? He married into the fringes of the Nevis slave-owning aristocracy. The widow he married had once personally owned one enslaved person, as Caribbean white girl children often did. Could this be his main qualification as an icon of British slave-ownership? The slave economy was a major sustaining power of much of Scottish, Irish and English landowning and commercial society in the late 18th and very early 19th centuries, and its tentacles reached down into every domestic sugar bowl or coffee pot. But Nelson, who had voted in the Lords to maintain the slave trade, was a bit player in this, compared to (almost at random) the Rendleshams, Harewoods, Gladstones and others, some of whom never even set foot on a Caribbean island. Or some of the patrons of All Souls, Oxford. Even with barn doors, it helps to select the target carefully. Jim Brennan Inverness • Without Nelson’s victories it would have been very likely that France would have ruled India, and much else, and the slavery which was returned by Napoleon in French colonies – thus outlasting that in the British ones – may have been reinforced. Despite Nelson’s views, the British anti-slavery movement gained strength and the opportunity should now be taken to respect its heroes. It would be a fine gesture and an appropriate completion of the story carried by the existing statues in Trafalgar Square, to provide the fourth plinth with a linked ramp on which such figures as Olaudah Equiano, Granville Sharp and Thomas Clarkson would take their turns, along with the Scotsman David Livingstone (who spoke forcefully against slavery eastward from Africa), and the Londoner Mary Kingsley, a pioneer of multiculturalism who gave her life as a nurse in the Boer war. Mallory Wober London • Keith Flett (Letters, 23 August) reminds us that London lacks a public reminder of the transported chartist William Cuffay. Neither is there, to this nation’s eternal shame, one to that truly great radical dissenter, chemist and educationalist Joseph Priestley who died in self-imposed exile in America the year before Nelson. Of whom George III remarked, on the burning down of his (Priestley’s) Birmingham home, laboratory and chapels by the mob: “I cannot but feel better pleased that Priestley is the sufferer for the doctrines he and his party have instilled, and that the people see them in their true light.” Having had the opportunity to see “Gunpowder Joe”, through the legacy of his many works, in a truer light than the intolerant George III, should we not redress this black hole in the nation’s heart? Another statue in Trafalgar Square, this time to the man who confined his use of gunpowder to words in a radical pamphlet would seem highly appropriate. David Hine Radstock, Somerset • When does the furious scrubbing of history cease? When will I be satisfied that the world and, indeed, the past, have been rendered acceptable to me? And am I sure that my own soul is equally shining and new? Such puritanism sets a fearsomely high standard.

Though final results from Wednesday’s voting were still being counted, the People’s Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA) said it was on track to win a two-thirds parliamentary majority, based on its calculations. In Angola, political parties are allowed to observe the elections by posting party members at every polling station and by assimilating results, the parties attempt to predict the election outcome. Though the MPLA has yet to lose an electoral contest since a return to multiparty democracy 25 years ago, the real significance of the poll was that 74-year-old Dos Santos, who has ruled Angola for 38 years, did not stand as a presidential candidate. His successor as president – should the MPLA projections be confirmed – will be João Lourenço, the 63-year-old defence minister and party veteran. “We can affirm that the future president will be comrade João Manuel Gonçalves Lourenço,” João Martins, MPLA secretary for political and electoral affairs, said. The main opposition, National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (Unita), disputed the MPLA’s projected result. “Looking at the trend, the MPLA won’t have a majority at all,” Unita’s parliamentary head Adalberto Costa Júnior told Reuters news agency. More than 9 million electors voted for a 220-seat parliament that would automatically select the candidate of the winning party as president. The MPLA won 72% in elections in 2012. The decision of Dos Santos, Africa’s longest-serving president after Equatorial Guinea’s Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo, not to stand surprised many observers. A series of leaders in southern and central Africa have employed a variety of strategies in recent years to hang on to power. President Joseph Kabila in the Democratic Republic of the Congo says logistical obstacles prevent overdue elections from being held. Paul Kagame in Rwanda was re-elected this month for a new seven-year presidential term after changing the constitution. In Zimbabwe, Robert Mugabe, 93, has indicated he will stand again in elections next year. Observers say Dos Santos, who is in poor health, will still exert significant influence as party leader and that his family’s grip on billions of dollars of businesses looks firmly established. His daughter, Isabel dos Santos, is thought to be Africa’s richest woman. His son, José Filomeno, is in charge of a $5bn state investment fund. “Even if he wanted to, Lourenço may find it difficult to free himself from the Dos Santos. Large-scale political change is unlikely and long-awaited democratic reforms needed to turn around Angola’s struggling economy unlikely to materialise,” said Julia Westbury, Africa analyst at West Sands Advisory, a UK-based consultancy. But Jensen Kirk Søren, of Chatham House in London, said it would be wrong to underestimate the departure of Dos Santos. “Lourenço is coming with a mandate. It’s not fair to say this is simply cosmetic,” he told the Guardian last week. A deep economic crisis has hit the MPLA’s popularity in recent years. Inflation reached 40% in 2016, eroding living standards in a country where millions remaining mired in deep poverty despite the massive income generated by oil. Graft has also been a cause of discontent. “There are no words to describe the level of corruption,” said former prime minister Marcolino Moco. The MPLA, which has been in power since 1975, is still popular among many older voters. But with two-thirds of Angolans under 35, many were voting for the first time. “We are voting for change,” said João Costa, 19, though he declined to specify for which party he had cast his ballot on Wednesday. Lourenço joined the MPLA as a teenager and fought in the independence struggle against Portugal and the civil war with Unita that followed. The war, during which the MPLA (backed by Cuba and the Soviet Union) took on Unita (backed by the US and South Africa), devastated Angola. It ended in 2002. Lourenço, who studied in the Soviet Union before rising up the ranks in the military and the party, navigated the MPLA’s swing from leftism to market capitalism with success. He has a reputation for relative probity and promised voters he would crack down on corruption. There was widespread concern about the fairness of the electoral process. The government has deployed state resources on a huge scale and has consistently repressed critics, moving on 12 August to ban protests and demonstrations by groups not running in the polls. A new law has given regulatory control of all media to a body administered by the government and the ruling party. Human Rights Watch said the election would be “marred by severe restrictions on freedom of expression and assembly”. The European Union scrapped plans to observe the elections after Luanda failed to agree to a package of conditions, including access to all parts of the country during the poll. It sent a small team of experts instead. André da Silva Neto, head of Angola’s election commission, said the poll was “an example of how elections should be carried out in any part of the world”. An unofficial result is expected by Friday. However, there may be no formal announcement for two weeks as ballot boxes wend their way along potholed roads and dirt tracks in a country of 28 million spread across an area twice the size of France. Moco has warned that change in Angola would be “slow and difficult”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"travel/2017/aug/28/efteling-fairy-tale-theme-park-netherlands","type":"article","sectionId":"travel","sectionName":"Travel","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-28T06:00:26Z","webTitle":"Once upon a time in … Efteling theme park, the Netherlands","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2017/aug/28/efteling-fairy-tale-theme-park-netherlands","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/travel/2017/aug/28/efteling-fairy-tale-theme-park-netherlands","fields":{"headline":"Once upon a time in … Efteling theme park, the Netherlands","bodyText":"Walking along windy paths through the forest, I can hear faint screams in the distance. They aren’t the blood-curdling type, more screeches of fear mixed with delight, and offer the only clue that we are staying in one of the oldest amusement parks in the world.

Loonsche Land boasts “you can’t get closer to nature” than staying here, and it does feel more Center Parcs (another Dutch invention) than Disneyland. The 75-room hotel, overlooking a purpose-built lake, is a modern take on the hunting lodge, a mix of brick and wood with gigantic antlers above the entrance. We (husband, one- and two-year-old sons and me) are in a family room. It’s basic but cosy, with dark green curtains, charcoal walls, and a wooden ladder leading to bunk beds. Those who want more space and privacy (and don’t mind the higher price tag) might prefer the houses and cabins dotted around the grounds – some on stilts, some up in trees, some by the lake, all blending into the forest. They sleep between two and 12, and a few have kitchenettes for self-catering. Breakfast is a great buffet, served at set time slots in De Proeftuyn restaurant. A contemporary open-plan space with alfresco tables by the lake, it’s also a good option for simple, tasty dinners – and there’s a play area. Adding an overnight stay to a park visit definitely has its perks. We get two days unlimited entrance to the park and access 30 minutes before it officially opens - handy in peak season when you can queue 90 minutes for the new Symbolica: Palace of Fantasy ride. The 180-acre site is split into four fantastical “worlds”, so you need at least two days to see everything. Piped classical music accompanies us as we navigate the maze of woodland paths and gardens. In the fairytale forest the boys are mesmerised by the animatronic displays – a talking parrot and Rapunzel are firm favourites. Though many characters may only be familiar to Dutch visitors – Pardoes or Jokie &amp; Jet, anyone? – it doesn’t detract from the magic: we simply make up our own tales. The boys love the Dreamflight ride, where a chairlift transports us into a twinkly world of fairies, elves and trolls. And they’re wowed by a fire-breathing dragon in the live theatrical Ravelijn show – which is free but must be booked. In sharp contrast to Disneyland, the characters here have a gritty, slightly creepy edge, and rides are based on darker, traditional yarns. But there’s plenty geared towards younger children – a major selling point for us – plus a few adrenaline-fuelled rollercoasters to keep older ones happy, too. After an action-packed day at the park, the calm of Loonsche Land is the perfect antidote. My boys are as content rolling around in the sandy playground or befriending sheep and goats (the holiday village has its own animal enclosure in a mini-barn too) as on the park rides. There are also two wooden activity bridges suspended over water to keep older kids entertained. For more immersion in nature, the Loonse en Drunense Duinen national park is on the doorstep. We hire bikes and in less than five minutes are inside the reserve, its thick forests and red toadstools mirroring the fairytale stories of Efteling. A gentle cycle ride leads past swathes of purple heather to expanses of shifting sand dunes (and the handily sited De Roestelberg restaurant). At Efteling itself, nature plays such a starring role that it’s easy to forget this is a theme park. Just a few subtle touches act as a reminder: Efteling’s own cartoon series, based on characters in the park, playing on TVs and there’s merchandise for sale in several spots. As we left there was more screaming, this time from my boys: they didn’t want our enchanting adventure to end. • Accommodation was provided by Efteling (efteling.com), which has one-night, two-day stays at the Loonsche Land Hotel from €319 for two adults and two children, including breakfast and unlimited park entrance both days.

ParkingEye went after Bowen for overstaying the free two-hour limit at a motorway service station and, when he wouldn’t roll over, decided to sue him. But the firm, owned by Capita, may now be regretting picking this particular fight after a judge struck out the case and ordered the company to pay his costs of £1,550. However, it probably wouldn’t be completely accurate to describe this as a case of the little man taking on the big company and winning, because Bowen arguably isn’t the sort of person you would want to get into a legal battle with: he is a renowned barrister and Queen’s Counsel who has undertaken a raft of high-profile cases. And in some ways he has been down this road before. Twenty years ago he got an injunction against a rogue clamper during the lunch break at Bournemouth county court – something that attracted media attention, including an article in the Daily Mail headlined “Rumpole beats the clampers”. This time round, exhausted and in need of a rest while driving from Hereford back home to London in May 2016, Bowen had pulled into Welcome Break’s Membury services on the M4, intending to have a short nap. “It was just before midnight and the car park was virtually empty,” he recalls. “I woke up at about 2.20am and, feeling refreshed, drove home.” But Bowen, who insists that where he parked there was no signage setting out any parking information, had exceeded the two-hour free period by, he estimates, about 20 minutes. The company says it was 35. He claims he was so tired when he drove in that he didn’t notice the signs that were there, and subsequently discovered (and says he has photos to prove it) that “the only reference to 24/7 charging was in microscopic print in a different part of the car park requiring 20/20 vision or a magnifying glass”. That triggered a parking ticket for £85. He wrote to ParkingEye to explain what had happened – but, after taking the trouble to go through its appeals system, the operator refused to waive the penalty. That was upheld by Popla, the independent appeals service for parking notices issued on private land. ParkingEye pressed ahead with its plans to sue Bowen through the county court to recover its claim for the unpaid ticket, a further penalty for non-payment and costs. At this stage he decided that if he didn’t stand up to them, “who would?” So he defended the case and threw the legal book at them. When the claim came to court on Friday 18 August ParkingEye was not there, and the judge ordered the company to pay Bowen’s costs as the case had by then been struck out. Consumer website Parking Prankster claims the company is launching up to 1,000 court cases a week, often to recover very small amounts of money. Many come from land controlled by hospitals and large supermarkets. Bowen said in an email to the company: “It is a pretty poor show that, having issued proceedings, ParkingEye lacked the courage of its convictions or confidence to even turn up to the small claims court to argue about the commercial and legal justification for your business model. “My defence was that your contract was unenforceable, and that you have no legal right to charge members of the public for night parking in service station car parks. Charging overstayers at night is unfair and a violation of consumer protection law. I defended your misconceived claim on a public interest basis, as it would have been far easier just to pay the ticket.” Bowen went further, telling ParkingEye that he was demanding the immediate payment of the costs for the work preparing his eight-page defence. He accused it of “indulging in pernicious bullying tactics against motorists” and claimed it was relying “either on apathy, or that most of your victims lack the ability or funds to fight back”. He added: “I hope ParkingEye will learn a lesson from losing this case, reconsider your contractual terms and change what is an unlawful and unconscionable practice.” But ParkingEye said it had sent a representative to court and that it had fully intended to present the claim and put forward its arguments and evidence. It said its representative was told the case had not been listed because it had not paid the hearing charge, which it had. In a statement ParkingEye said: “In this case, the motorist overstayed the two hours free of charge period by 35 minutes without purchasing a parking ticket. This was the reason for his parking charge being issued.” It pointed out that Popla upheld the firm’s original decision that the charge was enforceable. “No payment for the charge was received following Popla’s decision, so the case was taken to court. A representative of ParkingEye attended on 18 August to provide arguments to the judge alongside the motorist’s representative. However, upon arrival to court our representative was informed by a member of the court staff that the claim was not on the list. “In spite of us being told the hearing had been taken off the list, the motorist’s representative appeared before a judge without our attendance, and we have not had the opportunity to provide our arguments as appropriate and fairly, as we had intended. ParkingEye is now considering its options within the time limits set out by the court.” Notwithstanding the drivers of camper vans and other vehicles who might cheekily seek some free night-time parking, Bowen is hoping his experience might be the trigger for a campaign to ensure there is free parking at night on motorways for those who need a break. “Municipal car parks have chargeable periods, and I would have thought there should not be a charge – for instance between 10pm and 7am,” said the barrister, based at Doughty Street Chambers. “There should not be a disincentive to stop at night – as the sign say: ‘Tiredness kills, take a break’.” The AA points out that parking operators are supposed to give drivers a “grace period” of 10 minutes to leave the car park before they take enforcement action. It believes there is a case for a special area at motorway service areas where drivers could rest in their cars without incurring penalties. Edmund King, AA president, says: “Motorway service areas are essential for road safety and growing more important as motorways are widened on the cheap by using the hard shoulder. Tired drivers need somewhere to stop off, as it is estimated up to 10% of fatalities on motorways could be due to drivers falling asleep at the wheel. Our normal advice is to have a catnap for 15 minutes, a couple of coffees and then drive carefully.” The AA has genuine sympathy for drivers such as Bowen who take the advice to ‘take a break’ and then get penalised for overstaying their welcome, King adds. “Obviously, these areas need some parking restrictions in order to prohibit some from parking all day, but perhaps there should be a special area to allow tired drivers to sleep longer. However, if they overstay and are not in the car a ticket would be legitimate.” Next month the AA is due to launch a campaign for better tracking of where and how many tickets are issued by private parking enforcers, bringing them into line with council-run parking. It wants to be able to spot areas, identifiable by postcode, where there are particular problems with large numbers of drivers being slapped with penalty charge notices."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/aug/25/jeremy-hunt-attack-nhs-stephen-hawking-crisis","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-25T05:00:03Z","webTitle":"Jeremy Hunt can attack me all he wants – but he is wrong to say the NHS is working | Stephen Hawking","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/aug/25/jeremy-hunt-attack-nhs-stephen-hawking-crisis","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/aug/25/jeremy-hunt-attack-nhs-stephen-hawking-crisis","fields":{"headline":"Jeremy Hunt can attack me all he wants – but he is wrong to say the NHS is working","bodyText":"The secretary of state for health, Jeremy Hunt, has challenged me on Twitter and in an article for the Sunday Telegraph over a talk I gave recently to the Royal Society of Medicine in defence of the NHS. Having been accused by Hunt of spreading “pernicious falsehoods”, I feel the need to respond. Hunt doesn’t deny that he dismissed research contradicting his claim of excess deaths due to poorer hospital care and staffing at the weekend. He admits he relied on one paper by Professor Nick Freemantle and colleagues. But even if one accepts its disputed findings, the authors explicitly warn that “to assume these excess deaths are avoidable would be rash and misleading”. The editor-in-chief of the British Medical Journal, Fiona Godlee, wrote to Hunt to reprimand him for publicly misrepresenting the Freemantle et al paper. As a patient who has spent a lot of time in hospital, I would welcome improved services at the weekend. For this, we need a scientific assessment of the benefits of a seven-day service and of the resources required, not misrepresentation of research. Hunt’s statement that funding and the number of doctors and nurses are at an all-time high is a distraction. Record funding is not the same thing as adequate funding. There is overwhelming evidence that NHS funding and the numbers of doctors and nurses are inadequate, and it is getting worse. The NHS had a £2.4bn shortfall in funding in 2015-16, bigger than ever before. NHS spending per person will go down in 2018-19. According to the Red Cross, the NHS is facing a humanitarian crisis. There is a staff recruitment crisis. The BBC reported that on 1 December 2015 there were 23,443 nursing vacancies, and a 50% increase in vacancies from 2013 to 2015. The Guardian reported in May that the number of nursing vacancies had risen further to 40,000. There are increasing numbers of doctor vacancies and increasing waiting times for GP appointments, treatment and surgery. Hunt misquoted me, saying that I claimed the government wants a US-style insurance system. What I said was that the direction is towards a US-style insurance system, run by private companies. The increasing involvement of private health companies in the NHS is evidence for this. Hunt chose to highlight – dare I say, cherry-pick – the fact that private companies’ share of NHS contracts rose 0.1% over the last year. This is an anomaly among the data since 2006. The NHS private providers’ share was 2.8% in 2006-7 and rose steadily to 7.6% in 2015/16. The amount of private health insurance has fallen since 2009 as Hunt said, but that is because of the financial crash. We can conclude nothing about health policy from this and in any case, it is now increasing again. As waiting times increase, private companies report an increase in self-pay where patients pay directly for care such as hip and knee replacements. Further evidence that the direction is towards a US-style system is that the NHS in England is undergoing a complete reorganisation into 44 regions with the aim of each being run as an “accountable care organisation” (Aco). An Aco is a variant of a type of US system called a health maintenance organisation in which all services are provided in a network of hospitals and clinics all run by the HMO company. It is reasonable to expect the powerful US HMO companies such as Kaiser Permanente and UnitedHealth will be bidding for the huge contracts to run these ACOs when they go out to international tender. Hunt referenced Kaiser Permanente as a model for the future budgetary arrangements in the NHS at the Commons health select committee in May 2016. The NHS is political, but not necessarily party political. I am a Labour supporter but acknowledge that privatisation increased under Labour governments in the past. The question is whether democracy can prevail and the public can make its demands for proper funding and public provision undeniable by any government. • Stephen Hawking, the author of A Brief History of Time, is director of research at the Centre for Theoretical Cosmology at the University of Cambridge, where he was Lucasian professor of mathematics"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"books/2017/sep/03/the-red-haired-woman-by-orhan-pamuk-review-secrets-of-fatherhood","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-03T09:00:01Z","webTitle":"The Red-Haired Woman review – Orhan Pamuk finds truth at the bottom of a well","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/sep/03/the-red-haired-woman-by-orhan-pamuk-review-secrets-of-fatherhood","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2017/sep/03/the-red-haired-woman-by-orhan-pamuk-review-secrets-of-fatherhood","fields":{"headline":"The Red-Haired Woman review – Orhan Pamuk finds truth at the bottom of a well","bodyText":"Orhan Pamuk’s 10th novel, the short, deceptively simple The Red-Haired Woman, is prefaced by three quotes: one from Nietzsche on the myth of Oedipus, one from Sophocles’s play Oedipus Rex, then one from the Persian poet Ferdowsi, whose epic Shahnameh contains within it a kind of mirror of Oedipus Rex in which a father mistakenly kills his son. The Red-Haired Woman is a book that pores over father-son relationships with almost painful intensity. Unlike Pamuk’s last two novels, though – the overstuffed A Strangeness in My Mind and the beautiful but commodious The Museum of Innocence – this book has a lapidary, fable-like feel to it, closer in spirit to earlier novels such as Snow and The Silent House. Cem Çelik is a “little gentleman”, the son of a leftist Istanbul pharmacist whose politics take precedence over parenthood. During one of his father’s lengthy and regular disappearances, Cem, who is 16 when the novel opens, gives up his holiday job guarding his uncle’s orchard and apprentices himself to a master well-digger, Mahmut. He is taken to the (fictional) town of Öngören, a down-at-heel military base outside Istanbul, where he, Mahmut and another apprentice set about digging a well to provide water for a local businessman’s factory. Heraclitus said that truth lies at the bottom of a well. That’s the kind of well found in Haruki Murukami’s The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle: a place of revelation where the hero, Toru, retreats to gain perspective on the world. The wells of Pamuk’s Turkey are something quite different: here guilt and shame lurk in the darkness, forever threatening to come spewing up into the light. The novel turns on Cem’s encounter with the red-haired woman of the title and a subsequent act by the well that stains the rest of his life. The first half of the novel, where we see Cem gradually accepting the warm but irascible Mahmut as a surrogate father, and Mahmut slowly taking the “little gentleman” under his wing, is affecting. The older man tells Cem stories; they go into town and sit at the cafe (where Cem attempts to catch glimpses of the red-haired woman); they dig and hit seams of rock, sand, darker soil, which promises water. I’d never seen the link between Paul Auster and Orhan Pamuk before, but the building of the well in The Red-Haired Woman is a clear nod to the wall in Auster’s The Music of Chance, while in the twists of paternity, the shifting sense of what fatherhood really means, we get strong echoes of Moon Palace. I also wondered whether Auster acted as a model for Ekin Oklap’s translation of the book. It’s very hard to achieve that light, affectless prose that Auster does so well. Auster uses language that is self-consciously flat, deploying cliches whose hollow sound is part of the uncanny atmosphere that he creates. For the most part, The Red-Haired Woman is similarly unexceptional in the language it uses. The narrowness of the younger Cem’s experience is reflected in a bluff and unassuming narrative voice; the older Cem, still trapped by the events of the past, is a happily married but otherwise distant and joyless man, his voice full of trite and obvious observations, his language pat and predictable. It may be, though, that Pamuk merely wanted the book’s final section, which is narrated by the red-haired woman, to shine all the brighter against such a dull background. It’s an extraordinary piece of writing, tying the loose threads of the earlier narratives tightly together, granting us surprising new perspectives on the events of the novel. The twist in the tail isn’t perhaps quite as effective as that in My Name Is Red, but it still makes the reader feel as if they’ve emerged from the depths of a well into sudden and dazzling light. • The Red-Haired Woman by Orhan Pamuk is published by Faber (£16.99).

The recently elected Labour MP for North West Durham says she has “absolutely no intention of being friends” with Tory MPs because she feels “disgusted at the way they’re running this country”. It’s not the kind of language we are used to hearing from our politicians, who for years have happily supped with each other, referred to each other as “honourable members” and in all seem to have attended the same Oxbridge colleges. So it’s heartening to hear a Labour MP say that, because although she will obviously work with the blue side of the Commons, at the end of the day she won’t be socialising with any of them. “The idea that they’re not the enemy is simply delusional when you see the effect they have on people,” she told the Skwawkbox website. I don’t have a non-Tory rule about my friends; but I simply can’t imagine having a close relationship with a person who believes the strong have no obligation to help the weak, and who isn’t concerned about the atomised, self-centred, me-me-me society that has developed since Margaret Thatcher’s election in 1979. I see Tories as working to support, wittingly or otherwise, a privileged elite, and opposing any attempts to rebalance inequality. Yes, there are exceptions: some people are simply apolitical, voting Tory because that is the overriding message they get from the established media. Others, who I have more respect for, are those racial minorities who believe in self-reliance as a way of overcoming inequality rather than depending on unreliable white liberals: there is a strong conservative ethic within African, Caribbean and Asian communities that still endures despite the harsh realities of Tory Britain. Yet, the party that gave us Peter Griffiths’ “nigger for a neighbour”, Thatcher’s “swamping”, Norman Tebbit’s cricket test, Michael Howard’s “are you thinking what I’m thinking”, David Cameron’s fantasy immigration targets and Theresa May’s nationalist, anti-Europe posturing should repulse anyone from a minority background. In fact, I’d go further than Pidcock, and try to avoid all those who have cemented the Torification of Britain since Thatcher: the Blairites who embedded her policies in their 13 years in power, allowed inequality to grow and let the banks get off scot-free when they almost bankrupted the country, and the Lib Dems, who propped up Cameron’s government for five years and gave austerity the green light. It may leave me with a smaller social circle, but then, it’s always good to know who your friends really are. • Joseph Harker is the Guardian’s deputy opinion editor. He is a former editor and publisher of the weekly newspaper, Black Briton, and was previously assistant editor at the Voice Sonia Sodha: Yes. I see a big difference between being motivated by ruining people’s lives, and being misguided Would I be friends with a Tory? For me that’s not a hypothetical question: I can count several people who vote Conservative – or are active within the party – among my friends. People have the right to define their own friendship boundaries. I couldn’t bring myself to like someone who I genuinely believed was driven by the desire to do wicked and evil things. But I don’t think there are many people who fall into this category, regardless of their political affiliation. I wouldn’t actively seek out the friendship of senior Conservative ministers enthusiastically pushing an austerity agenda to the detriment of people’s lives. But I’d certainly be more than open to friendship with, for example, a Conservative MP who I knew was arguing against the worst of austerity and Brexit behind the scenes. Not only are they a far cry from evil,they’re vital in getting that argument heard within their own party. It’s not a route to social change that I’d personally choose, but I’m glad there are people doing it. I suspect we pick and choose our friends less than we would like to think. Friendships arise organically as a result of realising you like and care about someone you’re acquainted with, and there are very few of us who don’t find ourselves working, living and playing alongside people with different political views – MPs included. I wouldn’t filter my friends according to which political camp they put themselves in because I see a big difference between being motivated by ruining people’s lives, and being (what I see as) misguided. I don’t always succeed, but I try to value the perspectives of friends who think differently to me and accept that sometimes they may be right, and I wrong. Not only is arguing with someone about the big questions more fun if you genuinely like them and believe them to be well-meaning; you’re also more likely to be able to change their minds, and vice versa. At the very least, it helps you understand the perspectives of those you disagree with. I love and care about people who I think are wrong about all sorts of things – not just politics. Just as I’m sure that a lot of the people who love and care about me think there are certain things about which I’m deluded. That’s surely one of the beauties of friendship. • Sonia Sodha is chief leader writer at the Observer"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"books/2017/aug/25/daniel-tammet-why-autism-is-no-bar-to-becoming-a-bestselling-author","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-25T13:00:07Z","webTitle":"Daniel Tammet: why autism is no bar to becoming a bestselling author","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/aug/25/daniel-tammet-why-autism-is-no-bar-to-becoming-a-bestselling-author","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2017/aug/25/daniel-tammet-why-autism-is-no-bar-to-becoming-a-bestselling-author","fields":{"headline":"Daniel Tammet: why autism is no bar to becoming a bestselling author","bodyText":"Though English was the language of my parents, the language in which I was raised and schooled, I have never felt I belonged to it. I learned my mother tongue self-consciously, quite often confusedly, as if my mother were a foreigner to me, and her sole language my second. Always, in some corner of my child mind, a running translation was struggling to keep up. To say this word or that word in other words. To recompose the words of a sentence like so many pieces of a jigsaw puzzle. Years before doctors informed me of my high-functioning autism and the disconnect it causes between person and language, I had to figure out the world as best I could. I was a misfit. The world was made up of words. But I thought and felt and sometimes dreamed in a private language of numbers. In my mind each number had a shape – complete with colour and texture and occasionally motion (a neurological phenomenon scientists call synesthesia) – and each shape a meaning. The meaning could be pictographic: 89, for instance, was dark blue, the colour of a sky threatening storm; a beaded texture; and a fluttering, whirling, downward motion I understood as “snow” or, more broadly, “winter”. I remember, one winter, seeing snow fall outside my bedroom window for the first time. I was seven. The snow, pure white and thick-flaked, piled many inches high on the ground, transforming the grey concrete of the neighbourhood into a virgin, opalescent tundra. “Snow,” I gasped to my parents. “Eighty-nine,” I thought. The thought had hardly crossed my mind when I had another: “979”. The view from my window resembled 979 – the shimmer and beauty of 11 expanding, literally multiplying 89’s wintry swirl. I felt moved. My parents’ firstborn, I had been delivered at the end of a particularly cold and snowy January in 1979. The coincidence did not escape me. Everywhere I looked, it seemed, there were private meanings writ large. Was it from that moment – the sudden sense that my meanings corresponded to the wider world – that I first had the urge to communicate? Until that moment, I had never felt the need to open up to another person: not to my parents or siblings, let alone to any of the other children at my school. Now, suddenly, a feeling lived in me, for which I had neither name nor number (it was a little like the sadness of six, but different). I eventually learned the feeling was what we call loneliness. I had no friends. But how could I make myself understood to children from whom I felt so estranged? We spoke differently, thought differently. The other children hadn’t the faintest idea (how could they?) that the relationship between 89 and 979 was like the relationship between, say, diamond and adamant. And with what words might I have explained that 11 and 49, my mental logograms, rhymed? The children at school intimidated me. In the playground every mouth was a shout, a snort, an insult. And the more the children roared, the more they laughed and joked in my direction, the less I dared approach them and attempt to strike up a conversation. Besides, I did not know what a conversation sounded like. I renounced the idea of making friends. I had to admit that I wasn’t ready. I retreated into myself, into the certainties of my numerical language. The same understanding, the same excitement, also helped me learn to read. This was my luck, since reading had not initially come easily to me. My parents never read me bedtime stories, and because the anti-epileptic medicine I was prescribed at a young age made me drowsy in class, I was never precocious. I have memories of constantly falling pages behind the other children, of intense bouts of concentration in order to catch up. Back in those days, the mid-80s, it was possible for a teacher to give her young charge a repurposed tobacco tin (mine was dark green and gold) in which new words, written in clear letters on small rectangular cards, were to be brought home for learning. From that time on I kept a list of words according to their shape and texture: words round as a three (gobble, cupboard, cabbage); pointy as a four (jacket, wife, quick); shimmering as a five (kingdom, shoemaker, surrounded). One day, intent on my reading, I happened on lollipop and a shock of joy coursed through me. I read it as 1011ipop. One thousand and eleven, divisible by three, was a fittingly round number shape, and I thought it the most beautiful thing I had yet read: half number and half word. In writing the story of my formative years in the words I had back in 2005 (I was 26), with feeling but without confidence or high finish, I found my voice. The international success of Born on a Blue Day began a conversation with readers from around the world. Where some British and US critics saw only a one-off “disability genre” memoir, the account of a “numbers wiz”, German and Spanish and Brazilian and Japanese readers saw something else, and sent letters urging me to continue writing. The numbers spoke through the printed page to my far-flung readers, came alive in their minds, regardless of the translation that conveyed them. My lifelong struggle to find my voice, my obsession with language, appeared to them, as it did to me, like a vocation. I’d written a book and had it published. But it remained unclear whether a young man on the autistic spectrum could have other books in him. No tradition of autistic writing existed (indeed, some thought autistic author a contradiction in terms). I had no models (though, later, I made the discovery that Lewis Carroll – possibly – and Les Murray, the Australian poet and Nobel prize candidate, to name only two, shared my condition), no material. I was on my own. But then another reader’s letter arrived. It was in French, a language I had studied in high school, from a young Frenchman named Jérôme, who would, in time, become my husband. Through months of thoughtful and playful correspondence, Jérôme and I fell in love. For him, for his country and language, I chose willingly to leave the country and the language I had never felt were mine. We moved to Avignon, then north to Paris, settling among the bistros and bouquinistes of Saint-Germain-des-Prés. Before Jérôme, I had largely given up on literature. Novels and I had long since parted company. Now, though, in our apartment, surrounded by our books (Jérôme owned many books), we sat together at a brown teak table and, taking turns, read aloud from the French translation of Dostoevsky’s The Idiot. Reading a Russian work in French, I was not invaded by the feeling of foreignness that the pages of English novels had roused in me. On the contrary, I felt at home. I could, at last, read unencumbered by my self-consciousness, solely for the pleasure of learning new words and discovering new worlds. I could read for the sake of reading. Something had worked itself out in my head. All literature, I finally realised with a jolt, amounted to an act of translation: a condensing, a sifting, a realignment of the author’s thought world into words. The reassuring corollary – reassuring to a novice writer like myself, just starting out: the translatorese of bad prose could be avoided, provided the words were faithful to the mental pictures the author saw. I had more than one book in me. And each of my subsequent books – a survey of popular neuroscience, a collection of essays inspired by mathematical ideas, a translation/adaptation into French of Murray’s poetry – was different. Each taught me what my limits weren’t. I could do this. And this. And this as well. All the time that I was writing, I was also studying in my after hours with theUK’s distance learning higher education institution, the Open University. In 2016, at the age of 37, I graduated with a first-class degree in the humanities. I published my first novel that same spring in France.

If the art form is thriving here, perhaps it’s because in a world increasingly driven by dangerous and unpredictable forces, dance offers something unfakeable. The body tells its own story, and that story is always true, whatever the narrative. This is nowhere more clearly demonstrated than by the French performer Cécile da Costa of Prague-based Spitfire Company. The Narrator, which da Costa devised with director Petr Bohac, is her response to the loss of three children to miscarriage. Spare and unflinching, the piece is an hour-long cry of fury against the random cruelty of the universe. Da Costa is a petite, birdlike figure in a plain black dress. “I’m counting my unborn children,” she tells the audience. “Un, deux, trois.” The set is a pile of bricks, which at intervals she assaults with a sledgehammer, and a series of tanks containing rubble, shattered glass, sawdust and water, with all of which she makes brutal contact. Da Costa dances the physical memories she cannot escape: “I have to remember to forget everything.” She also sings, sometimes delicately, sometimes raucously, and at one point when almost entirely immersed in the water tank. Accompanied by a percussionist, she whirls and circles amid the debris, arms scything and fingers stabbing. By the end she is soaked and filthy, and stands there, shaking, with bleeding knees. The Narrator is harrowing, but it walks a precise edge, and never dissolves into incoherence. Instead, it reveals the hard, abrasive texture of a woman’s anger, and lays out, with pitiless exactitude, the topography of her pain. Dollhouse, performed by the choreographer and dancer Bill Coleman and the sound artist Gordon Monahan, shows a man whose living space is disintegrating around him. As Monahan’s score whoops and wails, mousetraps snap at Coleman’s feet, furniture collapses, and even the floor attacks him, as sticky tiles adhere to his body. In one passage, Monahan “plays” Coleman, applying electrodes to his belly and thighs that set off sympathetic squarks from the sound equipment. All of this has a slapstick, Buster Keaton-esque quality. But there’s a profound sense of entropy, too. Of things winding down, and ineluctably getting worse. Coleman has the etiolated look of a medieval martyr, an impression heightened by his impassivity. He makes constant reference to Christian iconography, appearing multiply pierced with arrows like St Sebastian, or slumped in a boneless cruciform shape, as if in a Rubens deposition. We have made a world of things, Dollhouse tells us. And now they’ve turned against us. Scottish Dance Theatre’s Velvet Petal: Bedroom, choreographed by company director Fleur Darkin, is a study in claustrophobia. Set in a twilit back-bedroom, its frowsty air charged with longing, this is a work about being trapped by circumstances on the margins, with only imagination and adolescent lust to sustain you. Ripped girls and Maybellined boys strut their stuff, toss their hair, and languidly attitudinise to a punk-inflected soundtrack by Torben Lars Sylvest. Hips roll and grind, hands are thrust into underpants. Darkin choreographs with a cool wit, and her cast whip off her demanding moves, and their clothes, with élan. The sex is unblinkingly portrayed, but for all its sweaty immediacy it has a dreamlike, fragmentary quality, which tells us that these are unrealised yearnings, rather than lived experience. Velvet Petal was inspired in part by the early Polaroids of Robert Mapplethorpe, whose photography documented the underground scene in 1970s New York (the title of Darkin’s piece is inspired by the photographer’s 1984 image of a calla lily). In one scene a Mapplethorpe self-portrait is held over the face of an otherwise nude female dancer, who then assumes a series of muscle poses copied from Mapplethorpe’s photographs of Lisa Lyon. All of this is gorgeous to watch, but in the end, frustratingly, the work becomes the victim of its own stifling intensity, and its cast remain locked in masturbatory dreams from which we are excluded. Caroline Finn became director of National Dance Company Wales in 2015, and created Folk last year. It’s a lovely, mysterious piece, full of dark flickerings and shiftings. The set is dominated by a giant white tree root, beneath which, with fine illogic, is heaped a pile of leaves from which a woman sleepily emerges. The nine-strong cast are a community of a sort, but one riven with testing, edgy behaviour, which sees individuals casually sidelined and excluded. Finn’s movement language echoes the numinous setting. Dancers scuttle, creep and shimmy enigmatically, but with absolute purpose. In one sequence they unite in ritualistic, March Hare leaps; in another a woman writhes as if ants have invaded her skin. Like Finn’s earlier work Bloom, Folk works at the blurred edges of memory and recognition. It’s like a reconfigured Midsummer Night’s Dream, encrypted but somehow familiar. It’s also a timely reminder, as is Darkin’s piece, that much of the most important British dance theatre is happening far from London.

Other days, the wind seemed normal, unremarkable. I didn’t know why. My south-eastern Ohio town in the Appalachian foothills is a small, rural place where the demolition derby at the county fair is a hot ticket, Walmart is the biggest store, and people in the even smaller villages surrounding the county seat must often drive for 30 minutes to grocery shop. We hold the unfortunate distinction of being the poorest county in the state: an area that is both stunning – rolling hills, rocky cliffs, pastures and ravines – and inaccessible, far from industry. It’s here that fracking companies dump their waste. The Hazel Ginsburg well, an injection well built in the hillside decades ago, was meant to deposit saline and sand underground into porous rock. For the last few years, however, the well has held waste from out-of-state fracking operations done in Pennsylvania, West Virginia and other states. A forgotten byproduct of fracking is the waste. What goes into the ground must come out: a sludge of toxic chemicals and undrinkable water, which trucks ship across the country. Far from the drill pads, far from the cities that profit from fracking, far from any city at all, the leftover wastewater is injected into the ground – my county’s forgotten ground. These hills once held coal. Some still do. Though many of the mines have shut down, coal’s legacy remains. Some streams in the woods run red from the acid leaking from abandoned shafts. My step-grandmother, the daughter of a Kentucky miner, used to tell me stories of washing her clothes in red water, downstream from mines. Coal companies exploited employees like her father, paying him in company scrip and keeping him poor and exploiting the land. That kind of abuse continues. It has just changed shape. Like the coal mines, which were often named to conjure up riches, fantasy and benevolence – the Century mine, the Freedom mine, the Rosebud mine – the injection wells of Appalachia have misleading, lovely names: Flowers well, Red Bird Injection well, Hazel Ginsburg. But the Ginsburg has a long history of violations, so many that the Ohio department of natural resources (ODNR) ordered it shut. It was not. It’s a pit well, which looks like an old swimming pool, covered by a tarp. No sign indicates the presence of chemicals, just a “no trespassing” sign on a gate across a gravel driveway, near a wooden shack where a security guard sits. Allegedly, the guard will snap your picture if you stop or turn your car around. The well is located in a residential area, with houses – some with swing sets – just down the road. In 2012, Madeline ffitch (whose last name is traditionally spelled lowercase and with the double ff, as per family custom) was arrested there. Her arrest was part of an action by a local anti-fracking group, Appalachia Resist. The then 31-year-old’s arms were locked into cement-filled plastic drums just before the gates, blocking the entrance. The protesters had thought carefully about who should be arrested – a landowner, a young woman, they decided. Thought also went into what she should be wearing: jeans, a ball cap from a nearby business to make her look relatable, friendly, local. Two years later, a local business owner, Christine Hughes, co-founder of the Village Bakery, was arrested protesting against another well site, as were seven others – including several of her employees, the co-owner of an organic farm, and the co-owner of a local mill and seed company. My town called them “the Athens 8” and they were hailed as heroes. Ffitch and her young family continue to protest wells, despite the attempts of the fracking industry to, according to her, “paint anyone who is organizing resistance around this stuff as outsiders or extremists”. Her husband, Peter Gibbons-Ballew, was arrested in a peaceful protest in 2016, while ffitch watched, their baby strapped to her chest. “It’s clear that impacted communities, mostly led by older women, indigenous people, and people of color, are fighting back,” she says. Our local economy now depends on tourism and farming – specifically organic farming, which requires extra and costly certifications and inspections. These lush hills are good for hiding wells, as they once secreted moonshine stills. But the long, humid growing season makes this part of Appalachia an ideal place for many crops and wild specialties such as pawpaws (green, mango-shaped fruits with sweet, white pulp), black walnuts, mushrooms such as morels, ground cherries, garlic scapes and ramps. By contaminating the environment with chemicals, fracking wastewater wells may threaten agriculture as well as the cabin rental businesses which thrive here. Canoe and kayak liveries, zip-lines, stables and campgrounds dot the woods. People rent to hunters; the county is legendary for its record-setting bucks. But in 2016, Bureau of Land Management began selling off land in the nearby Wayne national forest, the state’s only national forest. The bureau auctioned the land not just for injection wells, but for fracking itself: for drill pads, for bulldozed roads, for heavy truck traffic. Work began immediately, with 40,000 acres – of the 240,101-acre woods – set to be razed and fracked. That ceased almost as swiftly as it began. In April 2017, an unprecedented 3.0-magnitude earthquake struck the forest, in an area with seven utica shale fracking sites within miles. Fracking in the Wayne national forest has been suspended, pending further review. The trucks, though, keep coming. Day and night, tanker trucks carrying “brine” pull up to the injection wells of my county and unload waste into the ground. Deliveries to injection wells happen 24 hours a day, a volume which is simply stunning: nearly 29m barrels injected into the ground of Ohio in 2015 alone, four million of those to my small county. It can feel remote here to outsiders. A long hour and a half drive to the airport. Across state lines to West Virginia for a Target. I believe that’s also what drew fracking companies here – fewer people to make a fuss, and the kind of people that others sometimes don’t care about: the poor. I believe it is significant that states chose to bury their fracking waste in the hills of Appalachian Ohio, in a county with a median household income of $19, 855; it’s hard to know what goes on in these hills. It’s hard to see what’s behind the trees. And it’s hard to get answers as to what exactly the tankers contain, what they shoot into our ground. Chemical and Engineering News reported studies that analyzed spills of fracking wastewater – wastewater intended for wells like those in my town – and uncovered chemicals including radium and lead, which can linger in soil for decades. Jason Trembly, associate professor of mechanical engineering and director of the Institute for Sustainable Energy and the Environment at Ohio University, describes two types of wastewater from fracking. The first, flowback water, “comes up during the first days after fracturing is completed … [with a ] very similar chemistry as the hydraulic fracturing fluid”. Flowback water can be filtered, he says, and “nearly 100% of this water is reused”. But the second kind, called “produced water”, has “chemistry which is significantly different than flowback water … In particular, the produced water contains a host of components which are potentially problematic”. Components of this second kind of wastewater can include “suspended solids (TSS), bacteria, naturally occurring radioactive material (Norm), dissolved solids, and hydrocarbons”, and contain “materials such as barium and strontium”. Trembly is leading a local team which has received national attention for work developing a new technology to “clean” fracking wastewater using ultraviolet light, water softening techniques, and a high pressure reactor. It makes sense to me that a solution to the wells might come not from outside, but from people like Trembly, working and living in Appalachia. Partially because of isolation, and partially because of culture norms of stubbornness and self-reliance, people are used to doing things for themselves here – and used to the community helping the community, with a compassionate loyalty whose fierceness shocked me the first time the mechanic fixed my brakes for free out of kindness, the first time a neighbor left deer meat at my door. Now it’s commonplace for me to shovel the snow from my neighbors’ place, or to drop off extra firewood at the driveway of rural friends. I keep hoping more will be done to protect this place and the people who still live here, who build houses and try to maintain homesteads and plant crops and raise children who play on forgotten ground. “You want to forget it,” begins the Appalachian-born Ruth Stone’s poem Garbage – but the fracking waste in the injection wells of Appalachia can’t be forgotten forever. It’s a dark secret that will bubble up, one way or another, before long.

The 12 stories that make up What It Means When a Man Falls from the Sky are set in Nigeria and the US, sometimes moving between the two (the author was born in the UK, has lived in Nigeria and is now based in the States). Arimah’s focus is on the lives of girls and women, and while her perspective is often bleak, the collection is bracing and varied. Here is a debut writer showing serious range – drawing on realism, magical realism, the fantastic and speculative, myth and fable. In the title story, Nneoma, a “grief worker” in a post-apocalyptic future, possesses the power to draw grief and sadness out of people “like poison from a wound”. In “Second Chances”, a young woman’s mother returns from the dead, opening up the possibility of a longed-for reconciliation and forgiveness. In “Who Will Greet You at Home” a childless woman working in a hair salon makes herself a baby out of human hair. While the scenarios that Arimah depicts are at times fantastical, they are always rooted in human need and longing. The seam of bleakness running through the book concerns the diminishment of women: an outcome which starts to appear almost inevitable, even for girls born brave and quick-witted with a “streak of fire”. The story “Light”, a tender portrayal of a father-daughter relationship, opens: “When Enebeli Okwara sent his girl out in the world, he did not know what the world did to daughters. He did not know how quickly it would wick the dew off her, how she would be returned to him hollowed out, relieved of her better parts.” In one quietly heart-breaking line, his daughter “becomes aware that the world requires something other than what she is”. Arimah explores women’s dispossession from many angles, including the fraught relationships between mothers and daughters and the complicated dynamics of female friendship. In “Redemption”, a young servant, Mayowa, who “walked as though the earth spun to match her gait”, is punished for her audacity. In “Wild”, two cousins are rebuked by their mothers for bad behaviour: both struggle with the consequences of their boldness as they try to find their place in the world. In “Buchi’s Girls”, a daughter once thought of by her father as a hard diamond becomes reduced to “a jumpy mouse” when his death leaves the family dependant on others. Arimah keeps her readers on their toes, and the disorientation can come with great rewards. While at times her use of narrative or rhetorical devices brings a degree of self-consciousness to the page, it also brings energy, momentum and humour. Some stories hold readers at a distance; others address them directly; some pull them close into the physical and emotional realms of the characters – and some of the stories do all of these at once. Overall, the collection offers a rare combination of daring and nuance. Short stories can cover unexpected distances in a brief space of time – and at best, in this collection, the effect can be striking. In “War Stories”, inflections of humour are superseded as the story takes an increasingly troubled course. The passage of time is compressed as a father’s accounts of traumatic experiences as a young soldier sit alongside his 12-year-old daughter’s recent experiences at school, with the juxtaposition of these elements carrying real charge. In “The Future Looks Good”, Arimah telescopes time as she explores history in a very different way, presenting the dizzying stream of past events and family history that have led a young woman, Ezinma, towards the moment they will catch up with her. Here, and elsewhere, Arimah captures a sense of time and change as chaotic, fast and unsparing – slippery, and out of our hands. She is also skilled at stopping time, and allowing the reader, along with her characters, to dwell: offering the consolation that can come with getting lost in a moment, and paying attention to something or someone as vivid, insistent and vital as the unnamed girl in “Light” who, winning in a board game against her father, delights him as she “crows in a very unladylike way and yells, In your face!” • What It Means When a Man Falls from the Sky is published by Headline.

The new claims against Goop were lodged with two California district attorneys connected to the California Food, Drug and Medical Task Force by Truth in Advertising (Tina), a nonprofit group that says it conducted an investigation into Goop for using “unsubstantiated, and therefore deceptive, health and disease-treatment claims to market many of its products”. In addition, the group drew attention to claims that walking barefoot “cures insomnia” and that the company’s signature perfume “improves memory” and can “work as antibiotics”. Bonnie Patten, the group’s executive director, said that “marketing products as having the ability to treat diseases and disorders not only violates established law but is a terribly deceptive marketing ploy that is being used by Goop to exploit women for its own financial gain”. Tina said it had contacted Paltrow’s firm earlier this month to “remedy the deceptive marketing”. It noted that Goop had since made “limited changes” and called on California authorities to look into the matter further. Last month, Goop published a letter defending its unorthodox health practices. “Being dismissive of discourse, of questions from patients, of practices that women might find empowering or healing, of daring to poke at a long-held belief–seems like the most dangerous practice of all.” In the latest salvo against the company, the adverting watchdog listed dozens more products it says Goop makes claims for that are “unsubstantiated, and therefore deceptive, health and disease-treatment claims to market many of its products”. The complaint also listed Goop’s essential oils claimed to “help tremendously with chronic issues from anxiety and depression to migraines”; Goop’s Black Rose Bar, “brilliant for treating acne, eczema and psoriasis”; Goop’s Eau De Parfum: Edition 02, said to contain ingredients that improve memory, treat colds and work as antibiotics; and Goop’s Aromatic Stress Treatment that “treats the nerves (it’s been shown to help alleviate panic attacks)”. In June, Paltrow, 44, conceded on Jimmy Kimmel Live! that she is sometimes baffled by the unconventional products and practices her brand promotes. Asked about the practice of “earthing” – walking barefoot – she ventured “there’s some sort of electromagnetic thing that we’re missing. It’s good to take your shoes off in the grass”. Paltrow eventually conceded: “I don’t know what the fuck we talk about!”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"film/2017/aug/25/barbican-accused-of-showing-antisemitic-film-in-science-fiction-season","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-25T06:00:04Z","webTitle":"Barbican accused of showing antisemitic film in science fiction season","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/aug/25/barbican-accused-of-showing-antisemitic-film-in-science-fiction-season","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2017/aug/25/barbican-accused-of-showing-antisemitic-film-in-science-fiction-season","fields":{"headline":"Barbican accused of showing antisemitic film in science fiction season","bodyText":"The head of the UK’s main Jewish organisation has accused London’s Barbican arts centre of showing an antisemitic film, which she claims is “blatant propaganda about the Israel-Palestine conflict” masquerading as science fiction. Gillian Merron, the chief executive of the Board of Deputies, an umbrella organisation representing British Jews, called on the London arts centre to remove the film In the Future They Ate from the Finest Porcelain from the exhibition Into the Unknown: A Journey Through Science Fiction. The film by a Palestinian artist, Larissa Sansour, and a Danish author, Søren Lind, which combines live action, computer-generated imagery and historical photographs, is described in the exhibition as telling “the story of a fictional ‘narrative resistance’ group which attempts to implant the existence of a fictional civilisation in history by burying fragments of pottery in the ground”. In a letter to Sandeep Dwesar, the chief operating and financial officer of the Barbican, Merron wrote: “While the Barbican synopsis casts the film as a sci-fi feature about fictitious technologically advanced aliens who land in an area to implant a ‘false history’, I understand that the film is clearly filmed in Israel and that the dialogue is in Arabic and purports to show the ‘aliens’ seeding the land with porcelain in an effort to create the ‘false’ impression that they have a historical connection to it. Requesting its removal from the exhibition, Merron said: “It is therefore not much of a stretch to suggest that the film is a means by which to deny the historical Jewish connection to Israel and an exercise in delegitimisation. Accusing Jews of falsifying our connection to Israel smacks of antisemitism and is of grave concern.” In reply, Dwesar said: “The short film has been programmed for its poetical vision before anything else. ... Having spoken to the curator and the artists, the intention is that the symbolic visual language in the film speaks of history and tradition, yet it cannot necessarily be placed in any distinct or quantifiable time period.” But Merron said: “This is blatant propaganda, hiding behind the facade of a science fiction exhibition. It is deeply disappointing that an institution like the Barbican refuses to respond to the very real concerns of members of the community.” The film, whose production was supported by Arts Council England and the Danish Arts Council, has previously been shown in galleries and art centres in Nottingham, Bristol, Liverpool and the Whitechapel Gallery in London. The board’s complaint came after they were alerted to the film by a member of the Jewish community who saw it at the Barbican. In a statement on her Facebook account, Sansour said she and Lind were “deeply troubled to see the Barbican accused ... of antisemitism for showing our film”. She wrote: “Although our film makes an effort to avoid direct references to Israel – in a deliberate attempt not to limit its implications to a singular context – the film’s symbolism, its dialogue spoken in Palestinian Arabic and its topic matter certainly do situate it firmly within an Israeli/Palestinian framework. And yes, both Soren and I strongly oppose the Israeli occupation, but we thought and hoped that we had moved beyond the days when criticism of the policies of the state of Israel gave rise to automated accusations of antisemitism. I know that these are sensitive times, but this should give us all the more reason to refrain from simplistic and distorting political rhetoric.” The artists told the Guardian they were disturbed that the Board of Deputies had approached the film as if it was a piece of propaganda rather than art. Lind said the film did not in any way suggest that Israelis had falsified their historical connection to Israel. The background for making the film was an interest in the relationship between myth, fiction, fact and history, and the narrative components at play in the formation of national identity in a region marred by political turmoil. He said: “Nobody is falsifying anything. We’re tapping into a scenario in which Palestinians are politically unfavoured despite international recognition. Our film is an academic endeavour based on years of research that draws on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict but is not exclusively about that situation. It is a sci-fi film exploring the power of narrative, of defining history and influencing political realities.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"cities/2017/oct/30/guardian-cities-sao-paulo","type":"article","sectionId":"cities","sectionName":"Cities","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-30T12:00:00Z","webTitle":"Guardian Cities goes to São Paulo: what do you want us to cover?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2017/oct/30/guardian-cities-sao-paulo","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/cities/2017/oct/30/guardian-cities-sao-paulo","fields":{"headline":"Guardian Cities goes to São Paulo: what do you want us to cover?","bodyText":"Guardian Cities is heading to São Paulo for a week of in-depth reporting and live events.

My mind is full of questions, such as “What outfit will make me least visible in this caravan park” and, “If I am seen reading The Arabian Nights, will I be reported to the Home Office?” You see, we’re taking a holiday via the Sun. The Sun offers discounted stays at holiday parks if you collect tokens. It has changed our lives. Growing up in a single-parent family, we didn’t have the money to vacation. But through Sun Holidays (or hell‑idays), we took our first family trip three years ago, as grownups. I hold on to the beautiful memories: my siblings discussing how long Uncle Tariq has been a total tosser (his whole life or just the last few years?), or if we should bother with the nature walk because Auntie B – who has lived in the UK for 35 years – insists her Arctic coat is not warm enough for a mild British September morning. I wouldn’t change anything, apart from the anxiety that comes with staying in a flimsy box in the middle of nowhere with my clearly foreign family, surrounded by Sun readers. If only we had our own retreat by the sea, such as this elevated Edwardian six-bed in South Wales, offering isolation and no one tutting at you for cooking strong-smelling curry. Big enough to find time alone, even with my family, and with sea views from most rooms.

It was 2012 and Cameron had come over from his ranch in New Zealand to the Titanic museum in Belfast to promote the 3D Blu-ray release of Titanic. If you think that he would have been less than enthused about flying halfway around the world to talk about a movie he had made 14 years ago just because it was now in a format few truly give a fig about, you don’t know about James Cameron. Even in a town full of megalomaniac monsters, stories about Cameron’s obsessiveness are part of Hollywood legend: he would get so enraged when crew members’ phones rang on the Avatar set he would nail-gun them to the wall (the phones, not the crew members, that is, although it probably could have gone either way). During the shooting of The Abyss, the crew took to wearing T-shirts that said: “You can’t scare me, I work for Jim Cameron.” During our interview back then, in which he talked about the 3D-ification of a 12-year-old movie as if it were the most important development in cinema, he pretty well maintained his temper so it seemed safe to ask the question I’d always wondered about Titanic: “Why couldn’t Rose just share her giant board with Jack instead of leaving him to freeze in the ocean?” His face pinked with fury: “Wait a minute, I’m going to call up William Shakespeare and ask why Romeo and Juliet had to die!” You can’t scare me, I interviewed Jim Cameron. This time we are meeting in a hotel down the road from his home in Malibu, and we are once again talking about an old movie of his that he has rendered three-dimensional: Terminator 2: Judgment Day. But while he looks like the Cameron I met before – all 6ft-plus of him, with a puff of white hair and bright blue eyes – there is something undeniably different. Instead of prowling around the room, now he is relaxing in a chair, his handshake friendly as opposed to bone-crushing. Has he, perhaps, changed in the past few years? “Yeah, I think my demeanour at work is much more congenial,” he replies immediately. “I’ve learned that, OK, the film is important but quality of life is also important. But it’s a learned art for me. I think for Ron Howard it’s innate – he’s an innately nice guy. I’m an innately nice guy, but bringing that to work has been a learning curve.” I wonder if marital stability has given him this new congeniality – he has now been married to Suzy Amis, who played the granddaughter in Titanic, for 17 years, his longest marriage by far. But such a connection is far too basic for Cameron. Instead, he puts it down to the uniquely Cameron-esque reason of going on multiple deep sea expeditions. Because making the most ambitious movies in the world barely touches the sides of Cameron’s energy levels, he spends his free time time exploring the ocean in mini-submarines; in 2012, he became the first person to make a solo journey to the Mariana Trench, the deepest part of the ocean floor, in a mini-sub he designed with a team of engineers. “I’ve done eight deep-ocean expeditions and, at the end of the day there is no big movie, there is no red carpet. There’s just this little group of people who know how hard it is, and you’re all bonded around that. So I realised that it’s good to have a good movie at the end of a job, but it’s not the most important thing. The working environment is very important,” he says. Cameron has also made frequent dives to the wreck of the Titanic (“More than anyone else,” he points out, with some un-zen emphasis) and, going in the other direction, is working with Nasa to film a forthcoming manned mission to Mars. Does everything always have to be on such a big scale with him? Could he perhaps not make a small indie romcom, or go fishing in a rowing boat? “I look for things that haven’t been done. I like finding that gap between everything that hasn’t been done and what I think can be done. Everything I’ve ever done has been based on that little gap: every expedition, every piece of robotics that we built, every camera system, the deep-ocean stuff – it all falls into that same pattern,” he says. Which brings us to Terminator 2, my favourite Cameron movie. Partly this is because it was the first of his films I saw in a cinema – Cameron is the ultimate film-maker who needs to be experienced on the big screen – and feeling my mouth drop open as I saw the T-1000 (Robert Patrick) morph from liquid metal into human, using technology invented by Cameron, remains one of my most memorable movie experiences. “That’s so cool!” he grins. “We’ll never be able to reproduce the shock of the new that the film created in its day, but we can now give you a very sumptuous experience,” he adds. This need to create an “experience” is why Cameron has been spending such an inordinate amount of time rendering his back catalogue 3D. Heavens forfend that a James Cameron movie should fail to make jaws drop, even three decades after its release. But as much as he focuses on the special effects, what really gives his films an enduring appeal is that he is a proper storyteller, which is why his movies are so fun in a way say, Michael Bay’s are not. The first Terminator movie was never expected to be such a hit and, as such, has a grittily pessimistic, Dirty Harry-esque charm to it. When it came to writing Terminator 2, Cameron knew he was aiming for mass appeal and so he took Schwarzenegger’s character, a terrifying killing machine in the first Terminator movie, and turned him into a kind of comedy exchange student, an alien in a foreign world that both bewilders and charms him. “Arnold HATED it – he even tried to talk me out of it! But I said: ‘No, this is what we’re doing, it’s really cool.’ And along the way, he saw the wisdom of it,” he says, with some pride that not even Conan could cow him. As has since become par for the course with Cameron’s films, Terminator 2 was the most expensive movie ever made, costing more than $200m, and went on to become one of the highest ever earners, making more than $500m. But it could have all gone so wrong, had one of the producers had their way. “Mike Medevoy at Orion called me up one night and said: ‘I just went to this party and I got the movie cast!’ Now, of course, every film-maker loves to hear that some douche executive has cast your movie for you,” he says. “And he said: ‘OK, OJ Simpson for the Terminator.’ I was like: ‘Hey Mike! Bad idea! You’re going to have this black athlete chasing this white girl around LA with a fricking knife and a gun? We’re not doing that.’ Which was fortunate, but also unfortunate in that life ended up imitating art there.” But as wise as Cameron was to go with Schwarzenegger over Simpson for the Terminator, it’s really Hamilton as Sarah Connor who makes Terminator 2 stand out, today especially. Pumped up and utterly uninterested in pleasing anyone, let alone any male gaze, if the character was a rarity back in 1991, she looks shockingly unique now. The only precedent for her, really, was Ripley in Alien, who, five years earlier, Cameron had moved from the sidelines to the centre when he took over from Ridley Scott to direct the sequel, Aliens. For all his machismo, Cameron almost invariably puts genuinely tough female characters at the heart of his movies, from Dr Lindsey Brigman (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio) in The Abyss to Rose (Kate Winslet) in Titanic. So what did he make of the excitement over Wonder Woman? “All of the self-congratulatory back-patting Hollywood’s been doing over Wonder Woman has been so misguided. She’s an objectified icon, and it’s just male Hollywood doing the same old thing! I’m not saying I didn’t like the movie but, to me, it’s a step backwards. Sarah Connor was not a beauty icon. She was strong, she was troubled, she was a terrible mother, and she earned the respect of the audience through pure grit. And to me, [the benefit of characters like Sarah] is so obvious. I mean, half the audience is female!” So then why are movies still so bad when it comes to depicting truly powerful women? For the first time, Cameron is lost for words. “I don’t – I don’t know. There are many women in power in Hollywood and they do get to guide and shape what films get made. I think – no, I can’t account for it. Because how many times do I have to demonstrate the same thing over again? I feel like I’m shouting in a wind tunnel!” Cameron doesn’t only enjoy writing strong women – he has quite a habit of marrying them. He has been married five times now, and his previous wives include director Kathryn Bigelow and two women closely involved in the Terminator movies: first, producer Gale Ann Hurd and then Hamilton. “Being attracted to strong independent women has the downside that they’re strong independent women – they inherently don’t need you!” he says with a laugh. “Fortunately, I’m married now to a strong independent woman who does believe she needs me.” (Hamilton has a rather different take on why their relationship ended: “The very first night [I moved in with him], I realised I made a mistake,” she said in 2009. “He was the controlling director. The person I’d seen on set came back to life – we’re in his environment, and I didn’t have much of a say-so.”) Did he and Hamilton start dating during the filming of T2? “Oh no, obviously not. We got involved right after, but, you know, [dating an actor during filming] is a rule I will never break – well, I’m happily married now and it’s going to be for the rest of my life. But that’s a rule you can’t break as a director. As a matter of fact, Suzy and I, we were very attracted to each other when we first met [on Titanic], but we – we …” he breaks off, lost for words again. “I think about 10 seconds after we were done filming, well, you know ...” Cameron has a daughter with Hamilton and three children with Amis, and the family split their time between New Zealand and Malibu, which sounds idyllic but I can’t imagine being around Cameron is exactly a relaxing experience. “I’m not good at relaxing, that’s true,” he says. “My idea of a vacation is to take the whole family to Tahiti and spend the week doing underwater photography with underwater vehicles.” Nonetheless, Cameron looks so at ease you would never guess that he is tied up for the next eight years making another four – four! – Avatar movies, as well as feeling pretty doomy about the world’s future. A vegan and committed environmentalist, he is, unsurprisingly, not a Trump fan. “There’s nothing that he’s done since he took office that should surprise anyone, but it’s about as horrific as it can be. At a critical point in history when we should have been making progress, we’re going in the wrong direction. The toll in human misery in the future was going to be big anyway, and it’s now going to be greater,” he says. And on that cheerful note, our time is up. But I’m still not entirely convinced Cameron has really changed and there’s really only one way to test him. “So,” I say. “I always wondered, why couldn’t Rose share her board with Jack at the end of Titanic?” There is an ominous pause. “Yeah, yeah, I get that a lot,” he finally says. “I guess I needed to make a smaller board apparently.” He laughs. Oh James Cameron – you’ve GROWN.

Director Paul McGuigan finds the balance between pathos and humour, working from Matt Greenhalgh’s adaptation of a memoir by the actor and writer Peter Turner. As an unknown, struggling young actor in the late 70s, Turner met and fell in love with Gloria Grahame, the legendary Hollywood star and Oscar-winner who, incredibly, was living in the same north London boarding house. She was in the endgame of her career yet maintaining a never-say-die optimism, looking for stage work in Britain and suppressing worries about her health. Then, some time after their affair ended, Turner received a phone call: Grahame had collapsed in her dressing room while on tour in the UK, and had asked to come and stay with Peter and his family in Liverpool, convinced that she could recover there. Kenneth Cranham and Julie Walters play Peter’s mum and dad and Bell is very affecting in the role of Peter, exasperated and angry with his impossible superstar ex-girlfriend, and yet still in love with her to the very last. And Bening is excellent as Grahame: imperious, vulnerable, romantic, sexually excited about her younger man, wanly aware of secrets she cannot share with him. She is not so much a Norma Desmond figure, staying big while the movies got small; she is closer to someone her mother (played by Vanessa Redgrave) compares her to: Marilyn Monroe, an actor having to stay tough while life and showbusiness give her the fuzzy end of the lollipop. Peter and Gloria have a yearning to play Romeo and Juliet, and there is a Capulet/Montague tribal division: Brit and American, young and not-young, famous and not-famous. There is an interesting scene when Peter takes Gloria down to the local pub for a couple of pints of bitter. (90p – yowch! Pricey!) Gloria goes off to powder her nose while Peter pays for the drinks, and the landlord asks, with an air of disbelief: “Isn’t that Gloria Grahame …?” And he leaves it there. It was a pre-web age when movie history was more difficult to retrieve, when it was still possible for former film stars to go to British pubs and stay obscure, when the drinkers were not in a position to take out smartphones and tweet about her presence and watch YouTube clips. Later, you see Peter in a cinema, wonderingly watching Gloria in her glorious heyday in Naked Alibi from 25 years or so before. The lustrous and mythic black-and-white celluloid, so different from modernity’s colour, make it seem like she came from another planet. There is a great spark between Bell and Bening, and I think these are the most relaxed performances I have seen from either of them. It is very touching when Gloria first invites Peter into her room in the middle of the day to do a little disco dancing, ostensibly because she needs someone with whom to rehearse a routine. Of course, it is a seduction, and yet there is something very innocent, and absurd, and almost childlike, about the pair of them bopping around her room. Bell taps into his Billy Elliot spirit for this, and Bening is herself no mean dancer. It’s a scene that allows us to believe in their romance, and allows us to have a romance with the pair of them. Cranham and Walters are reliably excellent as Peter’s parents, as is Stephen Graham as his brother. Screenwriter Matt Greenhalgh has perhaps taken a decision to scale back the black-comic raucousness of the Liverpool household in which Gloria found herself at the last, preferring to emphasise gentleness and sadness rather than any how-are-the-mighty-fallen ironies. The movie makes the right decision to focus on the humanity and compassion. It’s a beguiling story and Bell and Bening are tremendous as the star-crossed lovers. •Film Stars Don’t Die in Liverpool screened at the Telluride film festival, and will be released in November."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"film/2017/aug/25/jane-goldman-hit-girl-limehouse-golem-gender-politics","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-25T05:00:03Z","webTitle":"Jane Goldman: 'The only way Hit-Girl could be not sexualised was by being 11'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/aug/25/jane-goldman-hit-girl-limehouse-golem-gender-politics","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2017/aug/25/jane-goldman-hit-girl-limehouse-golem-gender-politics","fields":{"headline":"Jane Goldman: 'The only way Hit-Girl could be not sexualised was by being 11'","bodyText":"There’s a thick pool of shiny yellow goo on the ground outside Jane Goldman’s Camden office, as if an alien has been sick. She answers the door and has a look herself, perplexed. A cynical person might suspect she set this up, this otherworldly substance on an unassuming side street. Since her screenwriting debut with 2007’s fairytale romp Stardust she has written films about the fantastical meeting the ordinary: Kick-Ass (kid with no powers becomes superhero), The Woman in Black (man gets haunted by a vengeful spirit), Kingsman: The Secret Service (petty criminal becomes superspy), Miss Peregrine’s Home For Peculiar Children (kid meets paranormal prodigies). She doesn’t know what the golden goo is, and, besides, it’s not really her office. She usually writes in the one at the end of her garden, but that’s being renovated, so she’s here for a bit, at the modest headquarters of a production company. She has made it her own though – a games console lies on the carpet, and there are books on The Walking Dead and World Of Warcraft, as well as Peter Ackroyd’s London: The Biography. She loves Ackroyd’s work, and her new film, The Limehouse Golem, is an adaptation of his Victorian thriller Dan Leno And The Limehouse Golem, another story about a distorted reality, featuring a series of grisly murders attributed to a supernatural beast. Goldman has made a central character of John Kildare (Bill Nighy), a detective mentioned only briefly in the novel, but it’s really about Lizzie Cree (Olivia Cooke), a complex, multifaceted music-hall performer who suffered an abusive upbringing and is accused of murdering her husband, despite an eclectic array of suspects on the loose (including, bizarrely, Karl Marx). The screenplay “wasn’t meant to be a gender-political statement,” says Goldman, vaping away on the sofa, but such issues bubbled under – in that era, women had no power, with men deciding what was best for them. In her final draft, she found herself bringing the theme to the fore. “Weirdly, I think I’d evolved as a person,” she says. “I had, I think quite deliberately, evaded that [subject] when I first wrote it. And then a couple of years passed and my two daughters both came of age, they became extremely passionate feminists. And that aspect became more interesting to me to explore, and really important.” Had she developed more of a feeling of social responsibility? “Yeah, absolutely. Women who grew up in my generation [Goldman was born in 1970] were conditioned to look back at things that were bad and say: ‘Well, it was a different time.’ Often, when my daughters expressed outrage about things that had happened in the past, I’d go: ‘Well, it was a different time, not that it’s OK, it’s terrible.’ But seeing things through the eyes of their generation, it’s like, no, you know what? A lot of the reason why things continued being not great for women were because we were all conditioned to say: ‘Ah well, shit happens.’ I had anecdotes that I thought were funny, about stuff that had happened to me, but my daughters responded to them by saying: ‘What, you mean you were sexually assaulted?’ I’d be like, wow, I had always told that as a funny story about the time some guy stuck his hand down my dress while I was waiting for a taxi. Mainly, because the guy in question was out of -” She names the band that included the man who molested her, then suggests we don’t print it. The point, though, is that the band lent the incident a sort of absurdity that lead her to recount it humorously. Not any more. “I thought: ‘No, hang on; I should be as outraged as [my daughters] are.’” We talk about recontextualising such experiences – it took her a while, she says – but now she has done so, it’s feeding into her work. “Because actually, in a society where a 16-year-old getting groped by a dude, while she’s waiting for a taxi, is considered a funny anecdote, I’m contributing by telling it like that. I suddenly realised, actually I do have a part to play.” Her new perspective influenced The Limehouse Golem, in how she portrays Lizzie and the male characters, whether ghoulish or good. And other social politics were at play, too. In the book, there is a passing mention of Kildare’s homosexuality, and Goldman included it in the script, deeming it to be important – maybe, she thinks, Kildare relates to Lizzie because he knows how it feels to be judged by society. Originally, Alan Rickman was cast as Kildare, and during a meeting with Goldman he gave her “a really useful contribution” regarding a moment in which the character’s sexuality is brought up, making the scene less confrontational, more sympathetic. Yet some suggested it needn’t be mentioned at all. Goldman fought for it. “Everyone was going: ‘But how does it affect the plot?’ I said: ‘I’m sorry, why does who he wants to sleep with have to affect the plot?’ The more people asked why he had to be gay, the more I was like: ‘Why the fuck shouldn’t he be?’” Even when Rickman became ill, he was still determined to do the film, but his condition steadily worsened and it became impossible. “It was just heartbreaking,” says Goldman. “Quite apart from the film – it’s just a film – but the loss of a lovely man.” Rickman was pleased that Nighy, whom he knew well, was stepping in. The film is dedicated to Rickman, and his spirit is there in Kildare, says Goldman. Such character notes are essential for her – she says she wouldn’t have done the Kingsman sequel, which she has co-written with director Matthew Vaughn, without new themes to explore. The first film was about hoodlum-turned-gent Eggsy trying to fit in; this one has him struggling to balance his life with the demands of the job, potentially sacrificing relationships for the colder reality he thought he wanted. But, Goldman says she needs that hook. She’s not interested in writing another film about Hit-Girl, Kick-Ass’s 11-year-old potty-mouthed heroine. In lieu of a third Kick-Ass film, after the second failed to inspire a trilogy, there has been talk of a solo Hit-Girl outing instead. “In terms of exploring a young woman who’s really great at fighting, that’s not particularly my thing,” she says. “The thing that felt to me subversive and original and incredible about Hit-Girl was to be able to have a physical female lead who was great at fighting, but it wasn’t sexualised. It says a lot of tragic things about our society that the only way she could be not sexualised was by being 11. But that’s the grim reality, folks.” Goldman does hope, however, that her adaptation of Daphne du Maurier’s Rebecca will be made – she loved the book growing up, and has been attached to a new production for a few years. She is drawn to the story’s moral ambiguity. “And actually,” she says, “it would be an interesting challenge to make it right now, because I think we’re still at that stage with female characters where they’re not really allowed to be flawed.” There are myriad exceptions, she says – she loves Alice Lowe’s work – but generally she thinks that writers, trying to improve on the work of previous generations, are inclined to make female characters “physically powerful, utterly moral, heroic. They can be sneaky, but only in the cause of absolute righteousness. And I like the complexity of the second Mrs De Winter,” she says of Rebecca’s female lead. “Your feelings towards her change the whole time. And when you root for her you feel slightly dirty. You really question yourself afterwards.” She’s visibly excited. It’s contagious. • The Limehouse Golem is in cinemas on 1 September; Kingsman: The Golden Circle is in cinemas 20 September"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"commentisfree/belief/2017/aug/24/it-took-the-horrors-of-the-trenches-to-finally-bring-a-democracy-to-death","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-24T15:29:48Z","webTitle":"It took the horrors of the trenches to finally bring a democracy to death | Giles Fraser: Loose canon","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2017/aug/24/it-took-the-horrors-of-the-trenches-to-finally-bring-a-democracy-to-death","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/belief/2017/aug/24/it-took-the-horrors-of-the-trenches-to-finally-bring-a-democracy-to-death","fields":{"headline":"It took the horrors of the trenches to finally bring a democracy to death","bodyText":"In my study I have a grainy oval photograph of Mr and Mrs Weldrick from Barnsley, both stern-faced and wearing hats, standing behind their son’s grave in a field in Flanders. The Weldricks had two sons and two daughters. At the age of 16, one of the daughters “got herself into trouble”, as they used to say, and the baby was brought up as one of the Weldricks’ own children. That baby was my grandmother. For years, she would also make the annual pilgrimage to Belgium to put flowers on her brother’s grave – though he was really her uncle. I remember that she kept pressed cuttings of the flowers. And this year, for the first time, I am also going and taking my own son with me. The Commonwealth War Graves Commission celebrates its centenary this year. For 100 years it has buried the dead, collected information about them, and maintained those distinctive white graves in famously well-kept cemeteries. Never before, and certainly never on this scale, had the bodies of ordinary soldiers been treated with such individual respect. For centuries, the rank and file were discarded in mass graves, with only the officers deemed worthy of individuation. With the work of the War Graves Commission, other ranks were given the same honour as officers; they were all buried alongside each other, all with the same sized headstone. This democracy in death was revolutionary stuff at the time, and there were many who complained that the commission gave the families of the dead little choice in how their loved ones were to be commemorated. “What freedom is it if you will not even allow the dead bodies of people’s relatives to be cared for in the way they like. It is a memorial not to freedom but to rigid militarism,” complained Viscount Wolmer, in a parliamentary debate on the subject in 1920. Some from such aristocratic families found it particularly egregious that all the bodies were to be treated the same. But the TUC spoke for many when it insisted that those visiting the dead “will expect to find equal honour has been paid to all who have made the same sacrifice, and this result cannot be attained if differences are allowed in the character and design of the memorials erected”. It was a fascinating debate – basically, freedom v equality – and though I cannot imagine the result being the same today, the fact that the War Graves Commission carried the day meant that the graveyards of the first world war stand as a powerful witness to the final obliteration of all social divisions. My son and I hire cycles in Ypres, and follow the map out of town into the sunny blissful pastoral that is the Flanders countryside. This must have been what it was like before the guns and the trenches, full of cows and goats and birdsong. We pass several little cemeteries, some with just a few hundred men. And then to George’s final resting place, at the edge of a field, a long way from Barnsley. Private George Weldrick of the 2nd Battalion York and Lancaster Regiment, died of his wounds 100 years ago next April. He was 25. His older brother had been killed at the start of the war but his body was never found. So, too, both of his cousins. But George fought throughout the worst of it, at the front, in the trenches, in the infamous Ypres Salient surrounded by lagoons of mud and death. In the end he was killed during the German spring offensive of 1918. As far as I can tell, George was wounded in the same battle that the Germans let loose 2,000 tonnes of mustard gas. Many were blinded. A few days later, he died of his wounds. Standing in this lovely field, I cannot begin to imagine the horror he experienced. I don’t much care for the larger cemeteries such as Tyne Cot or, worst of all, the Roman-style triumphalism of the Menin Gate – a “sepulchre of crime” as Siegfried Sassoon rightly called it. These places rally a militaristic spirit that doesn’t sit right with me. But out in the fields of Flanders, away from the trumpets, in the little cemeteries, behind a hedge, at the back of someone’s garden, there is space and calm to remember the stupidity of war. Lest we forget. • Giles Fraser was in Ypres to make a documentary on how the first world war changed the way we remember the dead.

In 2015 it was revealed that the fashion model Bella Hadid had the disease; that same year Avril Lavigne’s Lyme diagnosis appeared on the cover of People magazine under the headline “I thought I was dying”. In 2016 Kris Kristofferson discovered that the memory loss he had been suffering in recent years was not due to Alzheimer’s but to Lyme disease. And this week news that the former England rugby player Matt Dawson also suffers from the condition dominated headlines. (In a recent memoir, Kelly Osbourne said that she had kept quiet about her Lyme disease because she feared it had become “the trendy disease to have right now”.) Where once Lyme produced little interest and less cash, it is now the focus of high-profile fundraising galas and celebrity news. The Global Lyme Alliance, an American non-profit organisation, has said A-list interest is “essential” for raising money. Increased public awareness of the condition has helped too: rapid treatment with antibiotics is vital, and the early signs of Lyme disease – a tick bite and a circular rash – are easily missed. When a public figure gets an illness, other sufferers benefit. Publicity can encourage those at risk to seek out testing. In the 1990s, after the basketball player Earvin “Magic” Johnson announced that he was HIV positive, the US’s National Aids Hotline reported a spike of 28,000 calls from people looking for more information on the disease. A similar phenomenon followed Angelina Jolie’s announcement of her double mastectomy: there was a rise in the number of screenings for harmful mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes that increase the risk of breast and ovarian cancers. Around a third of people report that hearing about a celebrity’s cancer made them more likely to take a test for it. Celebrity endorsement also speeds up charity donations, studies show. In 2006 the Top Gear presenter Richard Hammond was severely injured in a car crash, resulting in brain and spinal injuries. In 2011 he presented an appeal for the Spinal Research charity on BBC1’s monthly Lifeline show, which was more successful than any other on either that programme or the weekly Radio 4 Appeal show since 2007. In the UK, celebrities willing to talk about their mental illnesses, such as Stephen Fry and Ruby Wax, have helped mental health charities and encouraged politicians to send more public funding their way. Public pressure, including from the A-list, resulted in parliamentary debates and a promise that psychiatric conditions would be given “parity of esteem” in the NHS. But those suffering from the kinds of diseases that celebrities do not get are not so lucky. There are many such people in Britain. There were 5,758 tuberculosis (TB) cases in England in 2015; rates in some parts of London were higher than those in Rwanda and Eritrea. Raising awareness would help: TB is an infectious and treatable disease. But it tends to affect rough sleepers and impoverished immigrants, not celebrities, and gets little attention. Doctors dealing with the illness in the UK have called it “a forgotten plague”. That celebrities have so much power to sway health priorities should give us pause. Their causes may be worthy, but diseases that fall beneath their radar deserve attention too."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/commentisfree/2017/aug/25/the-week-in-patriarchy-overwhelmed-paralyzed","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-25T20:54:03Z","webTitle":"The week in patriarchy: it's easy to feel overwhelmed and paralyzed | Jessica Valenti","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/commentisfree/2017/aug/25/the-week-in-patriarchy-overwhelmed-paralyzed","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/commentisfree/2017/aug/25/the-week-in-patriarchy-overwhelmed-paralyzed","fields":{"headline":"The week in patriarchy: it's easy to feel overwhelmed and paralyzed","bodyText":"I’ve been thinking a lot about how we can find time to rest when it feels like there’s no space or opportunity for anything but constant outrage and careful attention to what’s happening in politics.

Riddles inspired by card tricks","bodyText":"Ladies and gentlemen, Today, three magic tricks. I mean three riddles. Chess Boxing A hustler and a chess grandmaster are playing the following game. All the pieces from a chess set are in a box. The two participants take turns reaching into the box without looking, picking out two pieces at a time and placing them onto the table. If the two pieces are white, the grandmaster gets a point. If the two pieces are black, the hustler gets a point. If the colours don’t match, no one gets a point. They will take turns removing pairs until the box is empty. If, exactly halfway through the game, the score is 4-2 in favour of the grandmaster, who will ultimately win the game and by how many points? Tunnel Traffic A boulder falls onto a mountain road, temporarily blocking access to a tunnel. A few drivers get out of their cars to help move the boulder. After they successfully clear the entrance to the tunnel, they notice some unusual traffic has accumulated on the two-lane road behind them. The traffic jam consists of eighteen white cars and eighteen black cars. The first car in the left lane is white and the first car in the right lane is black. The colours of the cars behind them in each lane alternate perfectly. When passing through the narrow tunnel, the two lanes of traffic merge into one, and when they come out the other side the single lane branches to two toll booths. Assuming that the first car through the tunnel is a black car and the last car through is a white car, and that the cars reach the toll booth in pairs – meaning that the first two cars exit together, then the next two exit together, and so on – what is the greatest possible number of exiting pairs that will match in colour? Family Bike Race At the Froome family reunion, five sets of twins from five different generations decide to have a bike race, with two teams and one sibling from each set of twins on each team. Each team sets off with all five cyclists in a line behind their “captain”. At any point in the race, the last person in the line can cycle to the front of the line to become the new captain. All five team members must cross the finish line to complete the race. Both teams line up in age order but Team A starts the race with a little kid as their captain and Team B starts the race with an elderly woman as their captain. During the course of the race, the captains change six times between the two teams. When the teams cross the finish line, what are the odds that their captains will be the same age? You may have noticed that each of these riddles involve two different kinds of the same thing: black chess pieces and white chess pieces, black and white cars, members of Team A and members of Team B. That’s because the mathematical principles behind the riddles are taken from card tricks, in which cards are either black or red. With a bit of thought, you can probably figure out just how the tricks work. Compared to the usual level in this column, today’s puzzles are relatively easy, but the mathematical patterns they reveal are interesting, satisfying and surprising, which is why magicians have plundered them. The puzzles were devised by this column’s favourite cardsharp, Adam Rubin, who works with many internationally-known magicians.

But, like Grenfell, authorities ignore the warnings","bodyText":"As people swing and sway at this weekend’s Notting Hill carnival in London, it’s worth thinking about the critical failures of the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea (RBKC) to adhere to even the most basic principles of health and safety in relation to the Grenfell Tower fire. Questions arise as to whether that same culture of cost-cutting, incompetence and flagrant disdain for the safety of the poor has had any impact on the levels of public safety standards at Britain’s most popular cultural event. Let just remind ourselves of what carnival now represents. There can be no doubt that it has helped London achieve its world city status. It stands alongside other global festivals such as the New Orleans Mardi Gras, Brazil’s Rio carnival, Toronto’s International Carnival and New York’s Labour Day parade. It has helped define our capital city as open, inclusive and progressive. Carnival helped the UK win the 2012 Olympic games, for instance. What about the soul of carnival? For me it’s important to remember its roots as a celebration of black freedom, an event whose origins go back to the one-day annual “holiday” enslaved Africans were given off from working on massa’s slave plantation. After emancipation, the carnival became an essential component of the African diaspora’s cultural repertoire. In the UK, it was the west London Trinidadian community, led by local activist Claudia Jones who, responding to the racist murder of Kelso Cochrane, was a key figure in bringing the unifying power of carnival on to the streets of Britain. Since 1959 we’ve seen it become the most successful, popular and contentious cultural event in Europe. Once I became policing director for London in 2000, I immediately embarked on a mission to tackle the gross overcrowding and underfunding of carnival. As chair of the London mayor’s carnival review, I consulted with carnivalists and local stakeholders on how best to improve public safety and reduce dangerous levels of crowd density. In June 2004, after three years of consultation and detailed work, we published Notting Hill Carnival: A Strategic Review, the most detailed report on the event ever. It was our legal counsel’s view that ultimately, the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea and the Metropolitan police, whatever their protestations, bore the statutory responsibility for public safety, not the carnival organising committee. The project also found that the route (still in use today) was unable to provide the level of flexibility required to safely accommodate the carnival’s future growth. The average attendance growth of carnival year on year was about 5%. Given that visitor numbers cannot be controlled at a free and open event such as the Notting Hill carnival, the review group found that the critical weakness of the decision-making and planning process lay in its failure to plan for growth. That was true in 2004 and remains true today. I’ve often wondered, in the years since our report was published, who in the event of a catastrophic crushing at carnival (the most likely high-risk scenario), would be held legally responsible for public safety? In my mind there is no doubt that the major responsibilities will lie with RBKC, the Met police and the London mayor’s office. In the light of the Grenfell and Hillsborough tragedies, the issue of public safety has risen up the public and political agenda. The fact that over the last decade these three institutions have consistently fudged the question of carnival public safety has very likely put Londoners’ lives at risk. Cramming people into a tightly confined space and making the experience as unpleasant as possible, with few toilet facilities, no recycling, no adequate transport facilities – presumably in the forlorn hope they don’t come back – is simply not acceptable. In November 2016 Met commander Dave Musker told the London assembly police and crime committee: “Each year … we come exceptionally close to a major catastrophic failure of public safety where members of the public will suffer serious injury.” A London assembly report published in January echoed the concerns we expressed about public safety some 13 years earlier. No one wants take the responsibility, but the law is clear in my view. Either you ensure that public safety issues are addressed, or if you sanction a public event knowing the organisers cannot meet their licensing and public safety requirements, that responsibility by default falls to you, the licensing authorities. In effect RBKC and the Met are rolling the dice every year by sanctioning a public event that they know to be unsafe. Reading the latest London assembly carnival report is in many ways a similar experience to reading the prescient warnings of Grenfell Action Group when they complained they were not being listened to in relation to fire safety, tragically predicting that only a catastrophic fire would force people to take notice. Historically, the Met has tended to detest the carnival, despising the event, having little regard for the organisers. It sometimes seems they would do anything to remove themselves from having to police it in such large numbers. As a result they often police it with a bad attitude. As with Grenfell Tower, RBKC’s approach to public safety at carnival bears all the hallmarks of their routine and malicious disregard for pubic safety, particularly when those in need of protection are black and poor. • Lee Jasper chairs the London Race and Criminal Justice Consortium, and is a former policing director for the Greater London Authority"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"sport/2017/aug/25/lewis-hamilton-f1-belgian-grand-prix-200th-race-mercedes","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-25T15:53:14Z","webTitle":"Lewis Hamilton out for blood at Spa in his 200th F1 grand prix","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/aug/25/lewis-hamilton-f1-belgian-grand-prix-200th-race-mercedes","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/aug/25/lewis-hamilton-f1-belgian-grand-prix-200th-race-mercedes","fields":{"headline":"Lewis Hamilton out for blood at Spa in his 200th F1 grand prix","bodyText":"Rightly celebrated as one of the stone cold classics on Formula One’s calendar, Spa-Francorchamps is without doubt a drivers’ circuit. The fast corners and sweeping changes in elevation offer a combination of stern challenge and thrill ride; the best revel in both. Lewis Hamilton can certainly count himself among them and it is apt he should be starting his 200th grand prix at Spa. Yet while he has acknowledged reaching the milestone, his real focus in the Ardennes is the title fight. Numbers do matter to the Mercedes driver but for now he is concerned only with the ones that separate him from Sebastian Vettel and he is very serious about it. The Belgian Grand Prix is the first race since F1 took its summer break and Hamilton goes into it with nine races remaining and trailing Vettel by 14 points. The pair’s relationship has been convivial thus far, even through Vettel’s folly of the barge in Baku. Points dropped in the first half of the season, however, are viewed with greater equanimity than at the sharp end and Hamilton knows Spa is where that begins. “One thing for sure in this second part of the season, the most prominent thing is that I’m here for blood,” he said. “I’m here to win. I’m here to stay. It is strange when you have been racing so long, this is my 200th race, you would think the passion and desire to win would fade but it is stronger than ever. And that’s exciting for me.” A fourth world title is his goal and he has not lacked for motivation to achieve it but Vettel is equally set on claiming his fifth championship. The slender gap that divides them, Hamilton concedes, has been down to consistency. Ferrari have maximised every opportunity and put their weight behind Vettel as their No1 contender; Mercedes have struggled to master their car and Hamilton has dropped points when he struggled to find its sweet spot. The strength of his words reflects the seriousness of the task and how energised he is by the fight with Vettel and another team after three years of battling only his former team-mate Nico Rosberg. “This season is different from the last,” he said. “There is a difference in energy. The team wanted to win in the past but there was a comfort buffer, which is different to last year. That passion you hear about at Ferrari, you can now see that in our team.” It is a passion he and they will expect to convert to a victory in Spa. Mercedes should have an advantage in their power unit and a car designed to run best through the high-speed, flowing corners that abound at Spa, as it did in Hamilton’s dominant win at Silverstone. They should lead from the front and Hamilton was second fastest in first practice – on harder rubber than Kimi Raikkonen who topped the time sheets – and quickest in the second session before rain curtailed the running. Vettel has acknowledged Ferrari will be on the back foot in Spa. “Because of how strong Mercedes were at Silverstone and some similarities, I would say they are the favourites coming here,” he said. “But we’re not going to settle behind them. We’re going to attack, and we’ll see what we can do.” Hamilton will be looking to ensure he marks his milestone race. “I don’t remember every race, there have been so many amazing moments over these 10 years,” he said. “It has been such a blessing and such a great experience. I wouldn’t change any of it for the world. I have learned from the bad races at the difficult times. “There have been so many highlights. My first GP. My first GP win. Silverstone GP win. Monaco GP win. Winning the title in Abu Dhabi. Winning the title in Brazil is still a highlight. My favourite race would be a wet race when you have to overcome certain obstacles and you can exploit your car in a way nobody thought you could, that is amazing.” His performance in the wet at Suzuka in 2007 was exceptional but he topped it with a masterclass in changeable conditions at Silverstone in 2008. There he was a class apart and untouchable, starting fourth and winning 68 seconds clear of the field. With the chance of rain both Saturday and Sunday he may yet have the opportunity to once again overcome and he will hope, exploit. One further milestone is also within Hamilton’s range this weekend. He can equal Michael Schumacher’s record of 68 pole positions should he take the top spot in qualifying on Saturday. Schumacher’s son, Mick, will drive his father’s 1994 Benetton before the race on Sunday to commemorate the 25th anniversary of the seven-times world champion’s first F1 race win at Spa in 1992. Following a skiing accident in 2013, Schumacher spent six months in a coma and has been cared for since at his home in Switzerland. His son is 11th in the European Formula 3 Championship in his rookie season."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"small-business-network/2017/sep/16/letter-to-my-younger-self-pragya-agarwal-hedge-and-hog-prints","type":"article","sectionId":"small-business-network","sectionName":"Guardian Small Business Network","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-16T08:00:06Z","webTitle":"Letter to my younger self: you will achieve so much, against great odds","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/small-business-network/2017/sep/16/letter-to-my-younger-self-pragya-agarwal-hedge-and-hog-prints","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/small-business-network/2017/sep/16/letter-to-my-younger-self-pragya-agarwal-hedge-and-hog-prints","fields":{"headline":"Letter to my younger self: you will achieve so much, against great odds","bodyText":"Dear Pragya, You’re looking at your daughter for the first time and whispering in her ear: “I am going to look after you, and you are going to do amazing things in life”. You never expected to have a baby at 20, but once you realised you were pregnant, you knew you’d never love anyone more. You married early, into a traditional Indian family, where you were supposed to have no opinions and now you’re wondering where your life is heading. Know that you’re a bright spark who will secure her own release. You’ll get a scholarship to study in the UK for a PhD in environmental science three years later, and you’ll go despite all the doubts in your mind about leaving your little girl behind with your parents. There won’t be a single night that you don’t cry thinking of her. But your reputation will grow in your field and you’ll work hard to secure a prestigious fellowship so you can bring your daughter to the UK with you. You finally have sole custody but her father says moving her will ruin her life. Know that you’ll prove him wrong. As I write this, she’s now studying at Cambridge University. You did that, with that bloody-mindedness of yours. There have been sacrifices. You’ll live together in a tiny apartment, scrimping and saving. She’s initially unsettled moving to a new country, and adapting to a new culture. You’ll work hard to spend time with her, juggling your job and single parenting, as you progress to a senior academic position. It isn’t easy, and the cracks will begin to appear. You are stressed, overwhelmed, unsupported and bullied at work. You always thought that sort of thing only happened in the playground, not in academia, and surely never to someone as strong as you. You’ll work even harder but it’s never enough. It will break your spirit. Sadly, you have no other option than to quit. Even though you’ve been through so much, you can’t sit at home and do nothing. You start lecturing at US universities remotely, and tutoring students from home. Teaching is cathartic for you. You’ll teach your students to dream big, and to have the courage to chase their dreams. Your success surprises you. You’ll have a long waiting list, with students and parents driving for hours to see you. You have a natural instinct for teaching and mentoring young people. Ever the enterprising type, you’ll always be looking for new challenges. Your background in architecture means you’re often drawing and you’ll create your own stationery for your Scottish-Indian wedding after meeting your second husband, the most wonderful man. You receive so many compliments that you decide to start linocut printmaking, teaching yourself as you go. You tentatively start selling online as Hedge and Hog Prints and are amazed when immediately two sell, and then quickly some more. You’ll feel truly happy after re-discovering this creativity of yours. Your husband will call you a renaissance woman. There are still days when you’ll feel lonely, exhausted, depressed. You’ll become a mother again, and bringing up one-year-old twins definitely isn’t easy. You’ll go back to academia and have to juggle a full-time research position, while building your creative business and launching a new social enterprise The Art Tiffin. You’ll become a passionate advocate for creativity and mental health. You’ll work relentlessly, averaging only a couple of hours’ sleep every night. You’ll worry about the strain this puts on your life and be frustrated when you can’t find the time to work. You’ll wonder sometimes why it’s not enough to just be a mother, which is so rewarding in itself. Remember to be gentle with yourself. You’ve built this business because you want something just for yourself and to show your children that resilience is one of the most important qualities they can possess. You want them to go for things without fearing failure. Know that, slowly and steadily, you will rediscover your optimism.

The ad, taken out in March 2015 in a Silicon Valley freesheet, referred to Ellen Pao, who had recently fought a $16m sexual discrimination suit against her former employer, venture capitalists Kleiner Perkins. Pao claimed she was passed over for promotion and excluded from meetings after she accused a senior partner of sexual harassment. Although Pao lost the suit, coverage of the case shone a bright light on Silicon Valley’s gender problem. More legal suits followed, this time against Facebook and Tesla. The common denominator? The lawyers representing the women: Therese and Barbara Lawless. The formidable sisters, who have been practising employment law together since the late 1980s, have become the go-to attorneys in the battle against what they describe as America’s “wild west” of gender discrimination and sexual harassment. “For so long, women kept their mouths shut and did their jobs, and put their heads down because they were so afraid,” says Therese, 56, the younger of the pair, speaking from across a large boardroom table in their unassuming office. “But more and more women are just fed up.” In the wake of the Pao case, their phones haven’t stopped ringing. “I’ll get women in their 50s calling me up and saying, ‘I can’t put up with it any more’,” Therese says. The sisters take turns to lead the conversation. Therese, dressed in a trouser suit and with long, dark hair, chooses her words carefully. Barbara, 70, who has a softer voice but equally no-nonsense manner, punctuates Therese’s sentences, as if annotating out loud. “All of this has been going on for a long time,” Therese says. “For ever!” Barbara interjects. At the same time the Ellen Pao case went to court, Lawless &amp; Lawless filed a discrimination suit against Facebook, over allegations made by project manager Chia Hong, who claimed she faced gender and racial discrimination and harassment while working at the company. She alleged that her opinions were belittled in group meetings, and that a supervisor asked her why she didn’t just stay at home and look after her child. Eventually, after a mediation session between the parties, Hong dropped the case; Therese says the matter has been “resolved”, but can’t say whether there was a settlement. In February, the Lawless sisters squared up to Elon Musk’s electric vehicle company, Tesla, on behalf of 33-year-old engineer AJ Vandermeyden. She accused the company of ignoring her complaints of “pervasive harassment” from men on the factory floor, including inappropriate language, whistling and catcalls. Vandermeyden also alleged they paid her a lower salary than men doing the same work, promoted less qualified men over her, and punished her for being a whistleblower – eventually firing her after she spoke about her experience to the Guardian. Tesla rejected the allegations; the case is ongoing. But these high-profile cases represent just a small proportion of the Lawless sisters’ workload. More than 95% of their gender discrimination and harassment cases are settled behind closed doors and involve non-disclosure agreements. “If companies are going to pay X amount of dollars [the sisters’ website lists settlements of between $450,000 and $8m], then, as part of the deal, our lips are sealed,” Therese says. “It’s far worse than people know. People would be appalled at some of the behaviour that goes on at the workplace.” *** Therese and Barbara, originally from Buffalo, New York, grew up as two of 12 siblings: six girls, six boys. “It was great – crazy, but really fun,” Barbara says. She was the second child, born 14 years before Therese, the ninth. “It could be chaotic,” Therese adds, “but our mother was very organised – I always likened her job to running a small business.” Law is in the Lawless family blood. Their father, William, a liberal who believed in educating girls and boys equally, was a judge, lawyer, law school dean and professor. Both Barbara and Therese married lawyers (Barbara has since remarried an accountant), and they have two siblings, two nieces and a nephew in the field. Their family name is a frequent conversation starter. “It’s Irish,” Therese explains. “We don’t know what our ancestors did, but we’re trying to make up for it.” When Barbara, who graduated from law school in 1972, started out, women represented less than 10% of all law graduates. She would frequently find herself the only woman in a room of 100 lawyers. By the time Therese graduated in the late 1980s, it was less of a boys’ club, at least for entry-level lawyers. However, among trial lawyers and in leadership positions, the representation of women was – and still is – very low. Barbara tells me about an incident in 1975, when she attended a sentencing hearing while pregnant. The judge, a friend of her father, took one look at her and said, as Barbara recounts, “You are in a family way – go back and send your [business] partner down to make this argument.” “I couldn’t believe it, but he must have been 75 years old and was generally a nice man. Still, I thought, ‘This is what we are dealing with.’” She adds that this was at around the same time that schoolteachers were being forced into unpaid maternity leave in around the fifth month of pregnancy, over fears that it was dangerous for the mother and child, and distracting to students. “I was dealing with the last vestiges of this going on, and didn’t want to make an example of him at the end of his career,” Barbara says. “That’s why women go into business together: it’s almost as if you have to start your own business because men won’t give you the opportunity.” In 1988, Therese found herself in the type of large corporate law firm she had pledged to avoid. She stuck it out for nine months, until she found herself working on a case that was “so repugnant” she couldn’t take it any more. Two teachers had been fired from a private school for allowing students to create a poster about Aids, complete with a container of condoms – too much for the Catholic community in Boston. “I was supposed to represent the school,” she recalls, “but I picked up the phone to Barbara and said, ‘When can I come?’” *** Now the sisters are a force to be reckoned with in California. “If you have a case against them, you know it’s going to be serious,” says Donna Rutter, a defence attorney who represents companies that the Lawless sisters have sued. “They really care about advancing women in society and in the workplace.” The sisters have become used to facing aggressive tactics from defence lawyers, who often trawl through work emails and chats to find information that will put the complainant off pursuing a case. “They go into all of the dirt and try to shame the victims,” Therese says. “Sometimes they try and say she initiated it, or she was incompetent at work, therefore [engaging in a sexual relationship] was the only way she could move ahead.” In one particularly egregious case, a company accused of sexual harassment hired psychologists to assess the emotional distress of the victim during the pre-trial phase, and discovered that she’d had two abortions more than two decades earlier. “They tried to argue that her current emotional distress was impacted by the abortions rather than the harassment,” Therese says. “That was a little dirty.” She responded by persuading the judge to let her interview the jurors to screen out those with strong negative beliefs about abortion. Before the Ellen Pao case, it was rare, if not unheard of, for a woman in a senior position to take a tech company or venture capital firm to court over sex discrimination. Pao’s testimony was eye-opening, describing a “boys’ club” atmosphere, including men-only work trips and inappropriate behaviour by senior male partners towards junior female colleagues. “What Ellen did was important,” Therese says. “She took the lead.” Therese was approached by Pao’s attorney, Alan Axelrod, to work with him on the case just three months before the five-week long trial. She knew the case was emblematic of something bigger when they arrived at the courthouse and were told that they’d have to move to a larger courtroom, to accommodate all the cameras. But, ultimately, they were outgunned by Kleiner Perkins. “We did not have the resources that a VC [venture capital] firm with billionaire partners has,” Therese explains. “I don’t have six or seven lawyers working on the case, preparing my exams or attending the courtroom with a jury consultant.” The case was particularly tricky, too, she says, because being left out of meetings, spoken over by co-workers or asked to take notes are all very subtle signs of discrimination; none provides the kind of smoking gun jurors are looking for. Then there’s the cultural bias that many people still have when talking about gender. “I think misogyny is so deeply ingrained in our culture that even women perpetuate it,” Therese says. “We had a lot of female jurors who were willing to accept what were in my opinion simply untrue explanations as to why things happened.” Several witnesses described Pao as having “sharp elbows” and being “prickly” and “competitive”. “Men exhibiting the same type of ambition and wanting to move up in the company are seen as being assertive, while Pao was perceived as bossy and aggressive,” Therese says. It’s a type of discrimination that the sisters think is pervasive in the tech industry. “It’s also so much harder to prove,” Barbara says, because companies can always find alternative reasons to explain a lack of promotion, or why a woman wasn’t invited to certain meetings. In the end, the jury sided with Kleiner Perkins, but the impact was felt far beyond the courtroom. Pao emboldened other women to talk, something other lawyers dubbed the “Pao effect”. Women shared their experiences of discrimination online using the hashtag #ThankYouEllen. Trae Vassallo, a former partner at Kleiner Perkins, who testified against the firm at the Pao trial, went on to co-author a survey of women working in Silicon Valley: it found that 60% had experienced unwanted sexual advances and 90% had witnessed sexist behaviour at work. Pao has since launched a nonprofit venture called Project Include, unveiled in May 2016, which collects and shares data to help diversify the tech workforce. In February this year, Uber engineer Susan Fowler published a detailed account of unwanted sexual advances and discrimination at the company. She alleged that, when she joined, a manager immediately propositioned her for sex over the company chat tool, and that a director explained the shrinking numbers of women in her department by saying “the women of Uber just need to step up and be better engineers”. Following Fowler’s post on her blog, dozens of stories emerged from Uber, including a report of a trip by senior employees, including chief executive Travis Kalanick, to a South Korean escort bar, and the leaking of a company-wide email from Kalanick that set out rules about sex and drinking ahead of a company trip. He wrote: “Do not have sex with another employee UNLESS a) you have asked that person for that privilege and they have responded with an emphatic ‘YES! I will have sex with you’ AND b) the two (or more) of you do not work in the same chain of command. Yes, that means that Travis will be celibate on this trip. #CEOLife #FML.” This summer, a company-wide investigation into sexual harassment at the firm led to the termination of more than 20 employees’ contracts. Soon afterwards, Kalanick announced he was taking an indefinite leave of absence, before resigning in the face of a mutiny among Uber’s investors. Since then, several women have filed lawsuits against less well-known startups. In an ongoing wrongful dismissal suit, Elizabeth Scott accused the founders of virtual reality firm UploadVR of creating a “boys’ club” environment “marked by rampant sexual behaviour”, including setting up a room with a bed in the office referred to as the “kink room”. Shortly after that, several female entrepreneurs, including 31-year-old Sarah Kunst, accused tech investor Dave McClure of sexual harassment. Kunst alleged that she had been talking to him about a possible job when he sent her a Facebook message saying, “I didn’t know whether to hire you or hit on you.” McClure stood down from his role at investment firm 500 Startups and fell on his sword with a blogpost titled I’m A Creep. I’m Sorry. Last month James Damore, a software engineer at Google, circulated a 10-page memo in which he argued that there were biological reasons women were less suited to jobs in tech. Even the battle-hardened Lawless sisters were taken aback by its language. “That was so outrageous,” Barbara says. “That he could even think that way in this day and age… I was shocked.” The memo came just months after the US Department of Labor accused Google of systematically underpaying women, in an investigation that is still ongoing. More than 60 current and former Google employees are now considering bringing a class action, alleging sexism and pay disparities against women. *** Why does the technology industry have so many issues with discrimination? The Lawless sisters point to the way it celebrates rule-breakers, and how it frequently blurs the lines between social and professional lives – with long working hours, a lack of structure and human resources (HR) departments, and office fridges full of free beer. “The entrepreneurial personality makes people much bigger risk-takers,” Barbara explains. And that risk-taking can spill over into unwanted sexual advances. “They [Silicon Valley’s entrepreneurs] are more blatant and less sophisticated compared with other industries,” Barbara adds, mentioning certain law firms and accounting firms. “I really do think they are cowboys.” Increasingly, the Lawless sisters are seeing cases where individuals have gone to human resources for help, and not got it. Therese puts this down to a “lack of attention”: HR is not usually a priority for startups founded by a handful of computer science college graduates. If you’re building the next Facebook, you’ll hire software engineers, a sales person and an operations person; but you probably won’t invest in human resources until the company grows. By the time the company is big enough to hire an HR person, the culture will already be embedded, and other inexperienced managers may not be able to identify discrimination. “They might have studied [sexual harassment and discrimination], but they don’t know it,” Barbara says. “When you see it a few times, you recognise it fast.” Immature companies and their CEOs will often rally around a person accused of misconduct if that person is a key contributor to the company – the culture Susan Fowler describes at Uber. When she took screenshots of her manager’s sexual advances to HR, she was told that it was the “man’s first offence” and that he was a “high performer”, so would only get a warning. As technology companies mature and become more institutionalised, women will have more protection and opportunities, Barbara believes: “The cultures will get more genteel and the cowboys will no longer rule.” Meanwhile, in addition to the Tesla litigation, which is currently in the pre-trial phase, the firm is working on a mixture of cases, from pregnancy and disability discrimination to sexual harassment, though Therese is protective over the details: “I don’t like disclosing how many cases I have, because I don’t want my opponents using it against me,” she says. The sisters are increasingly concerned by the normalisation of hate speech used against women and minorities. After Google fired James Damore, he and other “free speech” advocates argued that Google has been subsumed by liberal groupthink, and is censoring anyone with different views about diversity and political correctness. Andrew Torba, CEO of the social network Gab, which offered Damore a job, said, “The message to conservatives is: if you dare step out of line and say something outside of the status quo of liberalism, you can expect to be fired.” “With the alt-right, we are getting these strange views that we haven’t had in the open for a long time,” Barbara says. “I wonder how many men really feel that way. I think a lot do.” Therese adds: “It’s troubling to see some people thinking that the workplace is an appropriate forum for hate speech. I hope he [Damore] is not the norm for the new generation.” Either way, the sisters won’t be out of work any time soon. As Barbara says, “It’s lifelong employment for sex harassment lawyers.” A brief history of harassment May 2012 Ellen Pao, venture capitalist and interim CEO of Reddit, brings a gender discrimination lawsuit against her employer, Kleiner, Perkins, Caufield &amp; Byers (KPCG). She is represented by Therese Lawless and Alan Axelrod. Pao losescorrect, but the high-profile case encourages other women to come forward. March 2015 Former product manager and technology partner Chia Hong sues Facebook for gender and race discrimination, claiming she experienced a “hostile environment” and was belittled by male colleagues. It was resolved out of court. March 2015 Tina Huang, one of the first 100 employees of Twitter, submits a class action lawsuit against the company, alleging that its promotion system discriminates on gender. Twitter denies the claims and hires the same lawyers who represented KPCG against Ellen Pao. The case is ongoing. September 2015 Computer security researcher Katherine Moussouris files a class action complaint against Microsoft, together with two other female employees, alleging that they discriminate against women in technical roles. The case is ongoing. July 2016 Before an action is filed, Smartphone chip manufacturer Qualcomm pays $19.5m to 3,300 employees who accused it of gender discrimination against women in tech, engineering and science-related roles. October 2016 Scott Ard and Greg Anderson, two former editors at Yahoo, file separate suits against the company, both alleging that they lost their jobs because the performance review system introduced by former CEO Marissa Mayer discriminated against male employees. Yahoo denies the allegations. February 2017 AJ Vandermeyden reveals that she has sued Elon Musk’s electric carmaker Tesla, accusing it of ignoring her complaints of “pervasive harassment”, paying her a lower salary than men doing the same work, and promoting less qualified men over her. She is represented by Therese Lawless. Tesla refutes her concerns and in June 2017 dismisses her from the company. The action is ongoing. April 2017 The US Department of Labor accuses Google of a “systemic” gender pay gap, saying it is in violation of federal employment laws. In August, it emerges that more than 60 current and former Google employees are considering a class action over pay disparities for women. May 2017 Former director of digital at virtual reality startup UploadVR Elizabeth Scott files a gender discrimination and wrongful termination lawsuit against the company’s founders. She alleges that they created a “boys’ club” environment “marked by rampant sexual behaviour and focus”, including setting up a room with a bed in the office referred to as the “kink room”. Scott alleges that women were paid less than men, and given menial tasks. The company denies the claims; the action is ongoing. • Commenting on this piece?

The town hall had the feeling of a revival meeting led by Sanders, who preached with the same urgency a message he delivered repeatedly on the 2016 presidential campaign trail: the system is rigged against the American people. But in Detroit he punctured the bleak prophecy with a glimmer of hope. “What this whole debate is about is what constitutes human rights: the right of freedom of speech, freedom of religion,” Sanders said. “Franklin Delano Roosevelt said we need economic rights, not just political rights. And healthcare is a human right. “The good news is that more people agree with us.” As Democrats feel their way out of the wilderness after sustaining one of the most stunning defeats in modern presidential history, the party’s ascendant left, emboldened by Sanders’s successes in 2016 and an energetic grassroots movement, is pressing ahead with an economic agenda that includes proposals for universal healthcare and debt-free college. And they are starting to feel that this may be their moment. Progressive leaders such as Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, the firebrand from Massachusetts, have helped steer the party toward a platform of economic populism, which they believe is a political roadmap to winning back the House of Representatives – and possibly even the Senate – in next year’s congressional elections, and stopping Donald Trump’s agenda in its tracks. This week, Sanders and Warren, both of whom have moved to fill the leadership vacuum atop the Democratic party, hit the road to champion their progressive politics. Sanders held three events in Rust Belt states that Trump won in 2016, a trip designed to show that his progressive ideas have appeal in rural America, while Warren, who is running for re-election to the Senate in 2018, crisscrossed Massachusetts to meet with constituents. At a town hall in Dartmouth, Massachusetts, Warren mocked her own wonkish reputation, stretching out her arms to illustrate a rising GDP chart, the start of her response to a question about how to address growing economic inequality. “OK, everyone settle in – she’s going to talk forever,” the former Harvard professor joked, before launching into a 10-minute critique of trickle-down economics. But Warren drew raucous applause when she told the crowd: “We have set up a series of policies in Washington that work for those at the top and leave everyone else behind. And what I say is it’s time to change that.” With polling indicating that support for a universal healthcare system in the US is growing, a number of progressive activists have declared the issue will be a “litmus test” for Democrats, threatening candidates who don’t support Sanders’s “single-payer” plan with a primary challenge. Warren rejects that kind of aggressive approach. “I don’t believe in litmus tests for Democrats,” she told reporters after the event. “I’m not voting anybody off the island.” Yet as the party moves leftward, centrist Democrats are finding their position on the island increasingly precarious. “The political energy has migrated to the polar extremes on both sides and it has left a large swath of the population feeling homeless,” said Will Marshall, one of the leading intellectual architects of the neoliberal “New Democrat” movement embraced by Bill Clinton and Al Gore in the 1990s. Worried that pragmatism will be relegated to the past, Marshall formed New Democracy, an organization that aims to “expand the party’s appeal across middle America and make Democrats competitive everywhere”. The group is looking to fight back against progressives’ attacks on their brand of market-friendly liberalism. “When you’re in the minority party, you can’t bet everything on one theory or voter group. You’ve got to expand in every direction,” Marshall said. “We need to win in a bunch of places and there isn’t one single message.” The ideological rift in the party is not new, but tensions between the liberals dreaming of healthcare reform and the moderates trying to win re-election in states where Trump dominated has only grown since the election. At a conference earlier this month, Warren declared progressives the “heart and soul of today’s Democratic party” and promised the party would not retreat to the centrist economic policies that dominated party orthodoxy for more than two decades. In an early attempt to reconcile the competing impulses, party leadership last month unveiled an economic platform that sought to appeal to both wings. The agenda, known as “A Better Deal”, includes progressive policies like a $15 minimum wage and a campaign against corporate monopolies while also promoting areas of clear agreement, like efforts to lower prescription drug costs and boost job training opportunities. Notably, however, the platform did not include the key progressive demand of a universal healthcare plan though leaders have not ruled out the idea. Jim Kessler, senior vice-president of policy at Third Way, a centrist Democratic research organization, agreed that Democrats should not uniformly return to Clinton-era politics. But he argued that too sharp a focus on gross economic inequality could turn off voters who live outside of the coastal states and liberal enclaves. “In much of the country the lived experience of people – the places where Democrats aren’t winning, frankly – is the lack of opportunity to earn a good life for them and their kids, not these huge disparities in wealth,” said Kessler, who has just conducted interviews with voters in midwestern and swing states. Democrats like Sanders and Warren hammer corporations and big business, but Kessler said voters in these cities value the companies as “heroes, not villains” because they provide the jobs. “It’s not that inequality doesn’t exist, it’s just not what they see,” he said. So far the moderates have yet to find a spokesperson who can offer a rhetorical alternative to Sanders or Warren. But an economic message that includes pro-trade, business-friendly themes is likely to be met with deep suspicion from liberal activists, who are growing impatient with what they view as a reluctance among Democratic leadership to fully embrace a progressive platform. In a New York Times editorial this summer, Sanders reasoned that Republicans control more than two-thirds of the governorships and gained nearly 1,000 legislative seats since 2008. “If these results are not a clear manifestation of a failed political strategy, I don’t know what is,” Sanders wrote. “For the sake of our country and the world, the Democratic Party, in a very fundamental way, must change direction.” Before the election, the Democratic congresswoman Debbie Dingell warned party leaders that Trump’s anti-trade message was resonating with blue collar voters in her state of Michigan, which had voted for the Democratic candidate in six consecutive presidential elections dating back to 1992. Trump narrowly won Michigan and went on to also clinch Wisconsin and Pennsylvania. “Donald Trump is not a progressive,” Dingell told the Guardian. “Donald Trump isn’t delivering on anything he said in last year’s election. But he understood this fear and anxiety.” Dingell, who supports a universal healthcare proposal in the House, said her party would be wise to shun the labels of progressive, populist, and moderate and focus on honing an authentic economic message. “I know people who are working two jobs, three jobs and they’re still at the poverty line,” she said. “We’ve got to talk about what’s happening to working men and women in this country. I don’t think that’s a populist message. I don’t think it’s a progressive message. It’s a real message.” At the town hall in Detroit, Sanders was asked by a supporter why he continues to work with Democrats rather than start a new party “separated from these elites”. Sanders, who remains an independent despite having run for the Democratic presidential ticket in 2016, said he was resolved to trying to “transform” the party from within rather than attack it from the outside. “I am not going to tell you that that effort is not meeting resistance, believe me,” Sanders said. “In some parts of the country, Democrats are smart enough to say: ‘We want your energy in.’ In other parts, you frighten them. But what we are seeing all over this country right now I think is a remnant – a carry-over – from my campaign is young people getting involved and running and winning seats on city councils and [state] legislatures.” Whether that approach is the right one to carry Democrats back to power in Washington is what the party now has to decide."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/sep/20/devout-generation-education-turkey-changing","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-20T04:00:36Z","webTitle":"'They want a devout generation': how education in Turkey is changing","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/sep/20/devout-generation-education-turkey-changing","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/sep/20/devout-generation-education-turkey-changing","fields":{"headline":"'They want a devout generation': how education in Turkey is changing","bodyText":"After 25 years of teaching, Ayşe Kazancı decided to retire early. The social sciences teacher, who asked that a pseudonym be used to avoid repercussions from the government, had long faced difficulties because of her activism, joining teachers’ union strikes and advocating for leftist and Kurdish causes. After last year’s coup attempt in Turkey, she was put under investigation. But the introduction of a new curriculum at schools across the country this academic year was the last straw. As children return to school after the summer break, they will find the introduction to the theory of evolution gone from their high school biology textbooks. The time dedicated to teaching the secular ideals espoused by the country’s founder, Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, has been greatly reduced, and public schools will now have to teach the concept of jihad, an attempt, the government says, to counter the use of religion to justify violence, but one that has elicited widespread opposition from secularists. “The government has an agenda for education because affecting the minds of youth is of the utmost importance to them,” Kazancı said. “The changes [to the curriculum] are ideological, not scientific and academic. This manipulating of history and avoiding evolution is no good for children.” Education has emerged as a key battlefield in a polarised Turkey that has yet to come to terms with a traumatic coup attempt last year. The country’s divisions have been exacerbated in the year following the coup with a wide-scale purge of suspected coup plotters as well as dissidents, and a controversial referendum that broadly expanded the powers of the president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, before elections in 2019. About 33,000 teachers have been dismissed as part of the crackdown. The battle between secularists and conservatives to influence the direction of society is just one of many divisions in Turkey today. Opponents of the changes to the curriculum say they betray the founding values of Atatürk’s secular republic and are an attempt to instil Sunni Muslim religious values in youth. The government insists the changes are necessary to prepare Turkey’s student population for a competitive career. “We are a middle-way people. We are moderates,” said Ismet Yılmaz, the education minister, at a recent press conference introducing and defending the education reforms. “We want a quality educational system that helps us look forward.” The elimination of evolution from the high school curriculum is one of the most controversial changes. Education officials said the the subject was too complicated for students and would therefore be deferred to university. Numan Kurtulmuş, the deputy prime minister, has described it as a theory that is archaic and lacks evidence. There is little acceptance of evolution as a concept among mainstream Muslim clerics in the Middle East, who believe it contradicts the story of creation in scripture, in which God breathed life into the first man, Adam. The concept of jihad has been added to the curriculum of religious classes alongside other tenets of Islam such as prayer, fasting and the pilgrimage to Mecca. The aim, officials say, is to seize control of the word, which means struggle, and emphasise Islam’s peaceful nature, so students do not see jihad as a violent concept. “We will teach it the right way,” Yılmaz said. “Islam is the religion of peace.” The July coup attempt, which is widely believed in Turkey to have been orchestrated by followers of Fethullah Gülen, an exiled US-based preacher, will also become a topic taught in school along with how it was defeated by people marching through the streets in protest – though the legacy of the coup attempt remains fraught amid ongoing trials for the alleged plotters. The changes were based on a broad public consultation in which parents and the public played a key role, Yılmaz said. They come hand in hand with an increase in the number of İmam Hatip schools, which were founded in the early years of the republic to train imams and preachers. Gaye Usluer, an MP with the opposition Republican People’s party (CHP) and a member of parliament’s education committee, said there was now an İmam Hatip school for every 5,000 people in Turkey, when in previous years that number had been as low as one for every 50,000. “The purpose of the new curriculum and also the issue on evolution are all ideological,” she said. “They want to raise a generation best suited to their ideological ideals.” Yılmaz defended the government’s decision to remove evolution, saying topics such as genetic mutation and adaptation would continue to be taught in school. The curriculum will also emphasise the contributions of Muslim scientists such as Avicenna, he said. But Usluer, the opposition MP, argued that the changes were just one step in an attempt at a wholesale transformation of society that aimed to raise a devout generation. In the undermining of secular values, the growing emphasis on religion and morality, and the decline of scientific discipline, exemplified by removing evolution from the curriculum, she saw a focus on Sunni Islam as the basis of religious education. “The values they will teach are not universal values,” she said. “They want to impose their own ideologies on children.” “Erdoğan said he wanted a religious, devout generation, and these changes are made for this wish,” she added."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2017/aug/25/bournemouth-manchester-city-match-preview","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-25T16:49:54Z","webTitle":"Bournemouth v Manchester City: match preview","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/aug/25/bournemouth-manchester-city-match-preview","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/aug/25/bournemouth-manchester-city-match-preview","fields":{"headline":"Bournemouth v Manchester City: match preview","bodyText":"Manchester City have beaten Bournemouth 15-1 on aggregate across their past four meetings, so a visit to the south coast seems the perfect match to remedy the wrongs of Monday night – when they rescued a draw against Everton.

A few go above the eyes. Second ball, Blackwood opens the face into a drive and gets four through cover point. Two to cover. And then he finishes the day with a four around the corner as Moeen drifts one down leg. Remarkable day for West Indies. Remarkable day for Kraigg Brathwaite and Shai Hope. They came together at 35-3, nine overs into the morning’s play and combined for 246 runs. Hope, maiden Test hundred in the bag, might be eyeing up a double tomorrow. Tomorrow should be a belter. 101st over: West Indies 319-5 (Hope 147, Blackwood 11) Solid from Hope, as he pinches two on the off side. Just when I was starting to wonder if he’d packed most of his attacking shots away, he goes for an expansive drive and has to pull out as Stokes finds a bit of movement off the surfrance. Not for the first time today, the ball flies through the gap at third slip and away for four. 100th over: West Indies 313-5 (Hope 140, Blackwood 11) Blackwood gets on strike and Moeen tosses a couple up. Two drives are played, both flamboyant, but only the second goes anywhere. It may be right to mid off, but Blackwood’s sharp and makes his ground with ease. Hope, meanwhile, is doing as Hope does. 99th over: West Indies 311-5 (Hope 140, Blackwood 10) Just a single from the over: a leg bye taken by Jermaine Blackwood, who ideally wanted to send Ben Stokes over square leg but has to watch the rest of the over from the nonstriker’s end. Change of tact as Moeen Ali comes into the attack for James Anderson... 98th over: West Indies 310-5 (Hope 140, Blackwood 10) Bit of shape for Anderson, away from Blackwood... so Blackwood follows the ball, opens the face, and slaps it over cover. YES. 97th over: West Indies 305-5 (Hope 140, Blackwood 6) Stokes to continue. He’s been excellent this evening. Blackwood plays a helicopter leg glance to the man out on the leg side fence for a single. High risk, low reward. 96th over: West Indies 302-5 (Hope 139, Blackwood 4) Excellent from Anderson, as he beats the new man, Blackwood, with a leg cutter that leaps off the surface. JB nabs a leg bye to get himself off strike. 95th over: West Indies 300-5 (Hope 138, Blackwood 4) No nightwatchman as Jermaine Blackwood walks to the crease. Like that. Like that a lot. Stokes greets him with a short ball which he ducks. Blackwood returns the jab with a haymarker through cover on the up for four. OUTRAGEOUS shot to get off the mark. Even Stokes is impressed. Now then... [/Athers]... Stokes gets Chase with a sharp, rising delivery that is fended to first slip. Seven overs after this one left in the day. Can England steal a march at the death? 94th over: West Indies 295-4 (Hope 137, Chase 5) James Anderson replaces an erratic Chris Woakes and is immediately on the money. A delivery that moves late catches Hope unawares. Leg stump is in danger but, somehow, an inside edge just misses and runs away for four. Next delivery, Anderson tempts a drive and gets one... through cover for three. 93rd over: West Indies 288-4 (Hope 130, Chase 5) Ben Stokes has turned things up a notch. He’s bowling at good pace – mid-to-high eighties – and nearly tempts Chase into a loose pull. Chase, however, pulls out well. 92nd over: West Indies 287-4 (Hope 129, Chase 5) Cracking delivery from Broad, third one up. Scrambled seam angles into the right-handed Chase, before holding its line off the pitch and beating his outside edge. He’s bowled some bad spells with some cracking deliveries in them, today. The very next ball, he offers Chase the chance to through his hands through the ball. Chase obliges – four through cover. 91st over: West Indies 282-4 (Hope 128, Chase 1) Solid maiden from Stokes, who sets up Chase for a delivery from wide of the crease, angled into the pads. Chase covers up well with his bat. 90th over: West Indies 282-4 (Hope 128, Chase 1) Roston Chase is the new man in. Broad, running in a little harder, tests out his defence. Solid enough. When he’s slightly short, Chase is off the mark with a whip to the boundary rider out on the leg side. Just before Broad started this over, Tom v d Gucht sent this email: “I reckon England are just about on top here. No doubt a massive batting collapse is awaiting the Windies just around the corner, limiting them to a lead of around 70-80, before Cook and the other decent England players all bosh out some runs before skittling the Windies second time around for under 100 following a Broad hot-streak.” WICKET! YES! REALLY! Broad gets one to move off the surface and into Brathwaite, who can’t cover the movement well enough. Stumps disturbed. What an innings through. Incredible effort from Kraigg Brathwaite, who gets a hearty ovation for his 249-ball effort. 89th over: West Indies 281-3 (Brathwaite 134, Hope 128) New spell for Stokes. A good diving stop from Root at wide mid off keeps a four through cover at bay and the dots that follow nearly bring about a dismissal when Hope drives loosely towards Mark Stoneman at cover point. However, the ball drops short and Stokes goes red. Again. “If Italy did play Test cricket,” starts Graeme Thorn, “then the president of the Italian Cricket Federation would have to be that famous Milanese cricketer, Ted Dexter.” Had no idea about that little bit of trivia on Ted. Here’s a nice little feature on cricket in Italy from 2013: 88th over: West Indies 281-3 (Brathwaite 134, Hope 128) Just two runs after the drinks break. Gorgeous blue sky about Headingley. Tickets still available for tomorrow by the way, if you in the area. £35 for adults, £10 for kids. Good value Test cricket. “For a while now, I’ve been trying to mentally fit Kraigg Braithwaite into the song Zabadakand I’ve just realised I was wrong,” writes John Starbuck. “The cue was Shai Shai for Mr Hope. I know it’s a bit ancient, but it’s quite good for a singalong to accompany an obdurate innings or two.” 87th over: West Indies 279-3 (Brathwaite 133, Hope 127) Nonsense review called by Joe Root but led by Jonny Bairstow. Woakes sends one down the leg side and Bairstow is so sure that Hope has tickled this through to him. He hadn’t, though. Bat far away from pad – a pad which diverted the ball to JB’s left. Woakes, struggling, drifts onto leg stump and is dealt with accordingly. Hope gloriously timing him through midwicket for four. Next ball, he’s check-driven exceptionally down the ground for a second boundary. 86th over: West Indies 271-3 (Brathwaite 133, Hope 119) The ball may be new but the approach is still the same. Brathwaite’s playing it under his eyes. Hope is adjusting the face of his bat with a shrug, finding singles here and there. One for him this over comes through gully. Gareth Berg with the new ball, Michael DiVenuto setting the tone at the top of the order. Tough ask. 85th over: West Indies 268-3 (Brathwaite 132, Hope 117) Not a long spell from Anderson. Just two overs and he has made way for Chris Woakes. “I think it’s about time you said West Indies are outplaying England,” writes Romeo. No doubt about that. Take a look at the score. I’ve been on the OBO for two days and only written about England wickets. “Six sessions in a row so far.” Woakes is loose – i.e. not very Woakes – and is flayed through backward point twice for boundaries. 84th over: West Indies 258-3 (Brathwaite 122, Hope 117). Brathwaite produces a carbon copy drive that Hope finished the last over with, only his timing is slightly off so he’ll only get three. Broad grunts, the spectators titters among themselves and Shai Hope walks down to do a bit of gardening. All is well with the greater game. And the scores are level. 83rd over: West Indies 255-3 (Brathwaite 119, Hope 117) What looks a standard Anderson over – probing, shaply, frugal – ends with a nice drive from Hope, who connects well enough to beat mid off on the inside, down the ground, for four bits. 82nd over: West Indies 251-3 (Brathwaite 119, Hope 113) Stuart Broad charges in, goes for the stumps, tumbles over and Shai Hope keeps his cool, driving straight back past Broad’s strewn body for four. One leaves the right-hander, but he plays deliberately inside the line. No harm. 81st over: West Indies 246-3 (Brathwaite 119, Hope 108) The first ball squares Brathwaite up, but he’s in enough to follow the ball effectively and push it out into the off side. All about playing themselves back in with this new, ruby-sheened Dukes. 80th over: West Indies 246-3 (Brathwaite 119, Hope 108) That’s that then. New ball, anyone? It’s taken straightaway and James Anderson gets to use it first. 22-overs left in the day. Here’s a window of opportunity for England... 79th over: West Indies 245-3 (Brathwaite 118, Hope 108) Hope finds a single to midwicket. Otherwise, we’re on the cricket equivalent of “walking” a batter as they do in baseball. Hurry up, out of the way, so we can gets to wickets taking with the new nut. 78th over: West Indies 243-3 (Brathwaite 118, Hope 106) Hope pads away a few from Moeen. Can we “simulate” the next three overs, a la Brian Lara Cricket? 77th over: West Indies 242-3 (Brathwaite 118, Hope 105) Hint of a caught behind from Tom Westley. Not out. Earlier this summer, I saw Tom Westley dismiss Kumar Sangakkara. The context? Sanga was 16 away from equalling the record for consecutive hundreds in first class innings. He was all set to join Don Bradman, Mike Procter and CB Fry before Westley stuck out a mit and took a diving return catch off his own tweak. Awful bloke. 76th over: West Indies 241-3 (Brathwaite 118, Hope 104) There’s a half-half-chance (quarter, then) as Brathwaite sweeps Ali and it rebounds off short leg and balloons down to fine leg. Dawid Malan does brilliantly to save two right at the sponge. 75th over: West Indies 239-3 (Brathwaite 116, Hope 104) Tom Westley returns to ensure we get this new ball as quick as possible. Aside from these two, the rest of the West Indies batting line-up doesn’t really have much to comfort them, aside from Jermaine Blackwood, who is in next. One brings four and all that... 74th over: West Indies 238-3 (Brathwaite 115, Hope 104) Moeen with another over as Ben Stokes seethes at first slip. One turns a fair amount and low, striking Brathwaite on the front pad. The appeal goes up, the umpire says not out and so England think “why not”, with reviews set to reload after 80 overs. He’s like a cat: 73rd over: West Indies 236-3 (Brathwaite 114, Hope 103) There’s the two-hundred partnership off 313 balls between Hope and Brathwaite as the latter drives Stokes aerially through cover. Hope springs, or something better 72nd over: West Indies 220-3 (Brathwaite 110, Hope 100) England keen to get to this new ball ASAP. Moeen Ali continues and rattles through six balls in the time it takes to unwrap a Kit Kat. Maiden. 71st over: West Indies 229-3 (Brathwaite 109, Hope 100) Utterly glorious from Shai Hope. A maiden hundred from 159 balls. The shot to get to three fiures was a tap around the corner. The one to take him to 99 needs to be put on display: Stokes short, Hope on one leg, whipping a pull behind square leg for four. 70th over: West Indies 221-3 (Brathwaite 107, Hope 95) Glorious from Hope, as he smites inside out for four. Looks like he fancies getting to that maiden hundred in a hurry... 69th over: West Indies 212-3 (Brathwaite 103, Hope 90) Ben Stokes back into the attack but running up the hill rather than running down it from the Kirkstall Lane End. The Sky commentators reckon it’ll make him hit the crease hard rather than lose his rhythm by getting carried away accelerating down and losing his line. Bang on the money, he gets the edge... but right through the gap at third slip! Oh my. He’s not happy. No one is. Other than Shai Hope, who moves to 90... 68th over: West Indies 206-3 (Brathwaite 102, Hope 85) Play back underway for the evening session and Shai Hope has to cover his toes as one from Moeen Ali keeps low. Just 15 away from his maiden Test hundred... Decent stat to have your name to, Kraigg Brathwaite: By the way, there is also over-by-over coverage of the Bangladesh-Australia Test series, which begins tomorrow. Adam Collins is out in Dhaka as we speak, wheeling away on Tuk-Tuks and preparing to wax lyrical on a resurgent home side and a few bloody Aussie noses. Read his first dispatch, here: Strikking, Kraigg 67th over: West Indies 206-3 (Brathwaite 102, Hope 85) Right, Tom Westley’s having a bowl, which doesn’t really make sense considering how little he bowls now compared to, oh I don’t know, Dawid Malan. Anyway, Kraigg’s not one to look a part-time bowler in the mouth and skips down the pitch to slap him over long on for six to take him to his sixth Test hundred! He’s been superb for all 189 of his balls faced, which has taken him close to five hours at the crease – 13 fours and two sixes to his name. A ball later, it’s TEA. West Indies trail by 52 with seven wickets remaining. Don’t adjust your sets... 66th over: West Indies 197-3 (Brathwaite 96, Hope 82) Root has positioned himself right next to the nonstriker, at straight mid on. He watches on as Broad gets the ball to move away from Hope, take the edge and through a vacant third slip. Broad tries to go for the stumps and Hope pumps him firmly down the ground for four. Pinches the strike, too. Class, that. 65th over: West Indies 188-3 (Brathwaite 96, Hope 73) A poor ball from Moeen is slapped through point by Shai Hope to bring up the 152-run partnership. It’s taken 264 balls and seen the run-scoring shared evenly (KG 70, SH 72). Oooo is that a drop? Think it is. Mark Stoneman is under the lid and Hope rocks back and flicks hard off his hip, straight into the midrift of Stoneman. He’s done well to stay focussed on the ball, but the pace off the bat was just too much to gather. 64th over: West Indies 183-3 (Brathwaite 96, Hope 69) False alarm. Sorry. There’s no Malan. As you were. It’s Stuart Broad replacing Stokes. First ball, he squares Brathwaite right up. Unfortunately, that usually packed cordon now has just a wide first slip and a gully. The leading edge flies down to third man for two. Then another goes big, threatening off stump before swooping away from Brathwaite’s edge. Some over that, out of nowhere! 63rd over: West Indies 181-3 (Brathwaite 94, Hope 68) Now it’s Hope’s turn to drive Moeen through the covers for four. He looks like he’s getting a second when he sweeps hard to square leg but brilliant work from Alastair Cook, diving and palming the ball away from the sponge with both hands, saves three runs. Ladies and gentlemen, it’s time for Dawid Malan... 62nd over: West Indies 173-3 (Brathwaite 92, Hope 62) In trying to go across the right-handers from around the wicket, Stokes goes far too wide and Brathwaite can reach across – just – to knock it on the head behind the gully. Stokes pulls his length back the very next ball and this time Brathwatite pulls out a classic back-foot punch through extra cover. Brathwaite into the nineties... 61st over: West Indies 165-3 (Brathwaite 84, Hope 62) “Are the Windies batsmen buckling down for long innings or is the bowling containing them?” A little bit of both, Andrea Ledward. England wasted the newer ball in the second part of the morning session and are paying for it now as these two look set for dinner and Sunday brunch. David Keech reckons it’s time for the leg spin of Dawid Malan: “He might give away a boat load of runs but with the ball spinning perhaps sharply away from the bat he could get that much needed breakthrough.” Moeen completes another over of, with three taken from it as Brathwaite finds two beyond bat-pad. 60th over: West Indies 162-3 (Brathwaite 81, Hope 62) The sting really has been taken out of England. Ben Stokes tries to get it back by coming around the wicket to Shai Hope. After moving men around at deep square leg, readying the field for a bounce, Hope has to dig out a yorker on leg stump. The next ball, he’s less diligent, flirting with one that goes across him. That mention of Graham Onions in Over 58 has sent me down a YouTube wormhole. This is a lovely video on the great man talking through his maiden five-wicket haul, on debut against the West Indies. Get him in! 59th over: West Indies 162-3 (Brathwaite 81, Hope 62) England lose a review. It was called for in hope rather than expectation. Brathwaite presses forward against Moeen Ali: the ball passing between bat and pad and through to Stokes, via a deflection off the later. Stokes and Bairstow reckont the former, too. Ultra Edge says no... 58th over: West Indies 161-3 (Brathwaite 81, Hope 61) Another maiden for Stokes and another six played well by Brathwaite. Stokes’ natural action on the ball, jagging into the right-hander, causes Brathwaite to hop up when defending into the leg side, but he does so with a degree of calm that suggests he’s quite enjoying this. “Your mention of pith made me think trees and gardens,” starts Andrew Benton. “Whatever happened to Graham Onions? Surely the only cricket player ever with a vegetable surname.” Interesting case, Onions. He’s in the last year of his contract with Durham and didn’t play a single one of the Jets’ T20 Blast matches. He’s 34 but still keen to play on. Worth monitoring that one as the County Championship season goes into the home-straight. 57th over: West Indies 161-3 (Brathwaite 81, Hope 61) Brisk over from Moeen Ali and just one from it. The turn that is out there is manageable off the surface. Single to Brathwaite as he blocks around the corner. 56th over: West Indies 160-3 (Brathwaite 80, Hope 61) John Starbuck has a cunning plan. Hear him out: “Time for Root to bowl himself? He will wait much longer than usual because captains who aren’t regular bowlers see themselves as a last resort and therefore discouraging to team spirit. Also, I thought of contributing to the fishy stuff, but decided not to rise to the bait.” Not my plaice to tell you otherwise (sorry sorry sorry sorry). A maiden for Stokes as Shai Hope gets in behind a few. 55th over: West Indies 160-3 (Brathwaite 80, Hope 61) Tidy from Kraigg Brathwaite as he leans into a full ball from Moeen, covers the spin and square-bat-drives through extra cover for four. Remember, you can get int touch on email with the clunky vithushan.ehantharajah.casual@theguardian.com or contribute pithier contributions over Twitter – @Vitu_E. 54th over: West Indies 156-3 (Brathwaite 76, Hope 61) Afternoon all. Vish here to take you through the rest of day two. Very tempting to open with a head-patting “aren’t they doing well?” Instead, I’ll let Samuel Honywill open for me (he’s well worth a follow on Twitter): Surprised that Ben Stokes is only bowling his eighth over, especially as he charges in and conks Shai Hope on the head with his second ball. Stokes asks after the batsman, who gives him a thumbs up. That’s nice. Stokes follows up with another short ball. Two from the over. 53rd over: West Indies 154-3 (Brathwaite 75, Shai Hope 60) On comes Moeen, as Joe Root sees what David Lloyd and Ian Botham saw 20 minutes ago. He has a slip, a short leg and a short mid-on, but Brathwaite, unruffled, plays out a maiden. And that’s drinks. It’s the end of another hour that belonged to West Indies, and also the end of my stint. Vish will be with you shortly, bringing his multimedia spark and Bairstow-like energy. So long, and thanks for all the fish. 52nd over: West Indies 154-3 (Brathwaite 75, Shai Hope 60) Stokes’s turn to mix up his lengths, but Hope keeps him out easily enough. England need to make something happen. 51st over: West Indies 153-3 (Brathwaite 74, Shai Hope 60) Anderson tries bowling inswingers from round the wicket to the right-hander, which is not his usual ploy: according to Ian Ward on Sky, only six of his 495 Test wickets have come that way. Brathwaite, staying watchful, tucks a single to square leg. The game is in danger of going to sleep. “Hello Tim.” Hello Matthew Doherty. “I think that England need Robert George Dylan Willis!” 50th over: West Indies 152-3 (Brathwaite 73, Shai Hope 60) A maiden from Stokes and another good stop from Bairstow, whose energy is exemplary. I wish England would pick Jos Buttler too though, when they have all these vacancies. In other news, Man City seem to have squeaked a win at Bournemouth with a late goal from Raheem Sterling, of all people – although he’s been sent off in the process. 49th over: West Indies 152-3 (Brathwaite 73, Shai Hope 60) Anderson rolls back the years to bowl a bouncer, which Brathwaite ducks and Bairstow does well to stop, flinging himself to his left. Then there’s one off the pads that no keeper could stop going for four leg byes. The crowd are making those indeterminate nosies that express a certain restlessness. You can smell the beer. 48th over: West Indies 147-3 (Brathwaite 73, Shai Hope 59) Stokes returns, bowling outswingers – two of which are so big and harmless that they are called wides. His bowling has been a bit middling this summer. I wonder, should he become a specialist batsman, at no.5, and just an occasional partnership-breaker? 47th over: West Indies 145-3 (Brathwaite 73, Shai Hope 59) Hope stabs Anderson into the covers for two, then drops his hands on one for two more, past gully. Anderson is still moving it both ways, but the edges have dried up. Tim Bresnan, of Yorkshire and England, has been telling the Sky commentators that England have bowled too short. My less informed opinion is that it’s a mistake to have Anderson and Woakes on together, as (with Woakes still not back to full throttle) they’re bowling at much the same pace, 79-80mph. 46th over: West Indies 141-3 (Brathwaite 73, Shai Hope 55) Woakes continues, and bowls one bad ball, a very wide one which Brathwaite slaps for four. “Time for Moeen Ali, I think,” says David Lloyd, and Ian Botham agrees. But I’m wondering if Joe Root is secretly wishing he still had Toby Roland-Jones to summon from fine leg. 45th over: West Indies 137-3 (Brathwaite 69, Shai Hope 55) Hope plays a neat on-block for four off Anderson, and that’s the hundred partnership off only 23.2 overs. Well played those men. Anderson now has 0-14 in this spell, which is like anyone else going for 40. 44th over: West Indies 133-3 (Brathwaite 69, Shai Hope 51) Woakes varies his lengths cannily – two bouncers, one yorker – but Brathwaite’s eye is well in now. He plays what seems to be a back-foot defensive shot, gives it a flick of the wrist, and gets four through cover. The batters get a lot of value for money square of the wicket at Headingley. 43rd over: West Indies 129-3 (Brathwaite 65, Shai Hope 51) Anderson continues, and he’s still asking all the right questions. He gets one to jag back and lift viciously at Hope, and finds the edge with another – saved by soft hands, yet again. In the crowd, some people start playing with a beach football. 42nd over: West Indies 128-3 (Brathwaite 64, Shai Hope 51) Woakes over-pitches and Hope says thanks very much with a crunching off drive to bring up a fine, busy fifty. He came in at 35-3 and turned a crisis into a chance to make his name. And Mac Millings is back for more. “I think your readership has missed a couple. Please allow me to present my All-time Fish XI: Salmon Robson Murali AnchoVijay Sachin TendulCarp Mahi-mahila Jayawardene Snapper Hussain Shark Waugh Sardine Jones Codfrey Evans Marlin Samuels Tino Bass Spratrick Patterson” 41st over: West Indies 124-3 (Brathwaite 64, Shai Hope 47) Heeeeere’s Jimmy, and Hope drives his loosener for four, on the up – classy. He adds a guide, perhaps an edge, for four more. Why are Test captains so averse to having a third man? 40th over: West Indies 115-3 (Brathwaite 64, Shai Hope 38) Root goes back to Woakes, who comes bouncing in with that lovely spring-heeled gait of his. But the sun is out now and Hope helps himself to a two and a three, with a cover push and a back-foot prod to backward point. “I know he’s not faced Jimmy yet,” says Brian Withington, “but might we be watching the early stages of the unlikely triumph of Hope over experience? Not sure where faith and charity come in just yet though.” In the meantime, Joe Jacob has found a short history of Italian cricket over on the ICC website. “The game of cricket in Italy dates back to 1793 when Admiral Horatio Nelson organised the first-ever recorded game in Naples. Exactly 100 years later, Sir James Edward Spensley founded the Genoa Cricket &amp; Football Club to be followed shortly afterwards by similar entities in Milan and Turin. The advent of Fascism, however, saw the disappearance of the game, which only resurfaced after World War II. The transformation from expatriate to integrated activity started in 1980 with the foundation of the Associazione Italiana Cricket. Recognised by the ICC in 1984 as the first Affiliate Member, the Associazione acquired Associate status in 1995 and, following government recognition, on 1st March 1997 became the Federazione Cricket Italiana.” More fishing. “Can I just point out that today’s fishy theme is nothing new on the OBO?” You may, Edmund King. “We’ve been here before, specifically during day 1 of the third test against Pakistan, almost exactly 7 years ago. That particular deep dive through the first-class and minor counties players’ listings resulted in the selection of the John Ashdown Where’s My Fish Pie? XI (scroll down to over 13 in Pakistan’s first innings): https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2010/aug/18/england-pakistan-live-cricket A moment of OBO (and indeed cricketing) infamy, surely?” And a statgasm, as he would call it, from the master, Rob Smyth. “Since the start of last summer, Anderson has 58 wickets in 12 home Tests at an average of 13.72. Obviously there are concerns about him in Aus, but he’ll surely be around for India next summer.” Some lunchtime correspondence. The tireless John Starbuck is coming right back at Mac Millings (38th over). “Thanks to Mac Millings for his concern and for the amount of time he must have devoted to his Fancy Dress XI.” Ooooh. “My concern about T-shirts was the design of just one of them, and I didn’t actually pay for any as they were gifts. Also, I don’t have any mental health issues at present, even if following cricket is a strong inducement.” And Garry Sharp is responding to Dave Bradshaw (39th over). “I used to be a member of the MCC – the Milan Cricket Club. We used to play up near Lake Maggiore, just glorious. There were a few Italian players but many more bemused spectators.” 39th over: West Indies 109-3 (Brathwaite 63, Shai Hope 33) Moeen finds the outside edge of Hope’s bat with the last delivery, but again the hands are soft and the ball drops short of slip. And that’s lunch, with West Indies coming back strongly after a wobbly start. They’ve only lost one recognised batsman, Kyle Hope, and since then his brother has joined Kraigg Brathwaite in a proper Test-match partnership – keeping out the good ones, walloping the bad, and picking their reviews superbly. They’ve added 74 in 18 overs, which is great going in the circumstances. The target I set West Indies, of 300-6, was looking fanciful an hour ago, but it’s just about feasible if Brathwaite can get the hundred he deserves. “Buongiorno Tim!” This is turning into quite the modern-language class. “Dave Bradshaw here in Tuscany at our agriturismo Mezzano in Chianti... Do you know if the Italiana play cricket?” Pocissimo, I’m told. “They have the weather and the charisma! I’d like to see an Italian lbw shout!!!” Me too. 38th over: West Indies 108-3 (Brathwaite 62, Shai Hope 33) Stokes, who has been mostly swinging the ball in, gets one to go the other way. Brathwaite flashes at it, hard enough to evade Root’s waving hand at second slip and pick up his eighth four. “Dearest Tim.” Steady on, Mac Millings. “I’m worried about the 20th over’s John Starbuck, what with his sadness about the current state of cricketer-themed fancy dress, and then wandering into rambling distress about t-shirts he himself paid for. Therefore, to cheer him up (or send him deeper into madness), here is my All-time Fancy Dress XI: Ian Wardrobe Rilee Trousseau Ball Gownton Ian ‘Disguise the Gorilla’ Botham Joel Garment Rodney Toggs Dandy Caddick Tino “Sunday” Best Regaliam Dawson Costumesh Yadav Raiment Illingworth” 37th over: West Indies 103-3 (Brathwaite 57, Shai Hope 33) Moeen, so improved this summer under Saqlain’s tutelage, still bowls the odd amateurish delivery. This one is a full toss outside off, which Hope gratefully cover-drives for four, to bring up the Windies’ hundred. 36th over: West Indies 99-3 (Brathwaite 57, Shai Hope 29) No alarms this time against Stokes, and Hope picks up a cheap three with a tuck to leg. The lights are on. Summertime in Yorkshire. “In response to Mr Benton (29th over),” says Ben Parker, “I have just trawlered my way through the 600-odd English test players and found four more: Laurie Fishlock Winston Place Doug Insole Steven Finn” 35th over: West Indies 94-3 (Brathwaite 56, Shai Hope 25) Brathwaite, facing Moeen, again mixes watchful defence with the odd big hit – this time, a smack over mid-on that goes like a drop-kick. He can begin to dream of an excellent hundred. An email comes in from another Wisden luminary, Dileep Premachandran. “When I was a teenager, it was English/Australian/Indian supporters who savoured the rare good session against mighty West Indies. Now, we look desperately to a four-wicket haul or a gutsy 40 as signs of a Caribbean revival that may never come. We’ve seen some sporting dynasties crumble in the last three decades - Liverpool, the Chicago Bulls and the San Francisco 49ers, to name just three - but no decline has been quite as heartbreaking as that of West Indies cricket.” 34th over: West Indies 90-3 (Brathwaite 52, Shai Hope 25) Stokes has two appeals against Hope, but England don’t quite review. The partnership is now 55 – shrewd and plucky stuff. “Brathwaite and Hope have played really well,” says Mike Atherton, who knows a bit about being the boy on the burning deck. 33rd over: West Indies 90-3 (Brathwaite 52, Shai Hope 25) So Root took Broad off, rightly, and brought on Moeen Ali, who almost gets a wicket, but goes for a few. Well played Mr Brathwaite – and well reviewed. On Twitter, my colleague Stephen Moss is back for more. “Will be funny if Windies win Test after Aggers &amp; Co banging on about their ‘demise’. They are useless, but the England VIII no great shakes.” Love those Roman numerals, though only some of this VIII would be any use in a boat. Brathwaite celebrates his reprieve with a glorious six, dancing down the track to Moeen, and that’s his fifty off 89 balls – a fine knock in a tough situation. It was hitting, but the impact was outside the line, so Brathwaite survives again, and that’s two excellent reviews from him. Given out, and it looks it. 32nd over: West Indies 80-3 (Brathwaite 43, Shai Hope 24) Root turns not to Anderson, yet, but to Stokes, who is fresh from making a curious hundred – two parts savage authority, one part sheer hamminess. His bowling is more straightforward. “Hola otra vez Tim.” You’re spoiling us now, Geoff Wignall. “Returning to the Ashes as this test drifts aimlessly towards a final-over cliffhanger, agreed Hales is more of a 5 or 6; but so are Bairstow and Stokes, so why not try Hales at 3 as Root clearly wants to and should be kept at 4? He’d only need to survive 90 minutes to do some serious damage to the bowlers’ morale and enhance the gaiety of nations. We keep hearing about test cricket’s need to entertain in order to retain its audience. At worst he’d be out cheaply but that keeps happening anyway. At best he’s a match-winner. There’d still be plenty of batting below him.” True. 31st over: West Indies 79-3 (Brathwaite 42, Shai Hope 24) Broad continues, and so do the runs. Hope, playing nice and late, waits for the inswing and then helps the ball to the very-fine-leg boundary. Root may want to think about having a long stop. Or bringing back Anderson. 30th over: West Indies 74-3 (Brathwaite 41, Shai Hope 20) A rare bad ball from Woakes, which Hope smacks to the point boundary. He’s been positive – 20 off 29 balls – in sharp contrast to Bishoo, first thing. And now the batsmen are even rotating the strike. 29th over: West Indies 68-3 (Brathwaite 40, Shai Hope 15) Broad strays down the leg side and concedes four byes. Fishy OBO today, says Andrew Benton. “After the flounder-ers, and Peter Salmon’s email, I discovered one Laudrup Withington (cf. Brian, 19th over) of Harvard University was the initiator of a goldfish swallowing craze in the late 1930s - 1939: The year of goldfish gulping. And long may it stay there. C.B. Fry and Arthur Dolphin seem to be the only England test cricketers with fishy names.” Does this count as clickbait? 28th over: West Indies 62-3 (Brathwaite 39, Shai Hope 14) Hope plays a big air-drive at Woakes, then edges for four, then plays and misses again. Woakes is already back to the form of last summer, finding lavish swing and maintaining an exacting line. It was tough on Toby Roland-Jones, who might have three-for here, but the decision to give Woakes some Test overs does make sense. And West Indies have saved the follow-on, which is progress. 27th over: West Indies 58-3 (Brathwaite 39, Shai Hope 10) So Brathwaite survives, and he then cashes in by cutting a low-flying long hop for four. He’s done well at picking off the bad ball, usually from Broad. There was indeed an inside edge. Bad news for Broad, good news for the contest. Given out. It’s plumb, but is there an inside edge? 26th over: West Indies 54-3 (Brathwaite 35, Shai Hope 10) Another edge from Hope, another four, because he made sure his hands were soft. Woakes responds with a beauty and a big appeal for caught behind, not given – rightly, as the bat clipped the pad. It was a huge outswinger, too good to take a wicket. And that’s drinks, with a spot of rain in the air. This has been Anderson’s morning – Anderson’s summer, in fact. Up pops another familiar name, Phil Sawyer. “Morning Tim. John Starbuck [20th over] isn’t trying hard enough. Large moustaches for David Boon and Merv Hughes, a blond wig for Shane Warne, a large false square jaw and a squint for Steve Waugh... ah, I’ve just realised that to pull off the cricketers’ fancy dress you’d have to go as the Aussies. As you were.” 25th over: West Indies 50-3 (Brathwaite 35, Shai Hope 6) Root TAKES ANDERSON OFF, which is actually a good sign, showing that he’s not in awe of his elders. Broad returns, and Brathwaite celebrates with a cut for four and a glance for four more. That’s the fifty up. 24th over: West Indies 42-3 (Brathwaite 26, Shai Hope 6) Hope, learning from Brathwaite, pushes at Woakes with soft hands and gets four. “Bon dia Tim.” Bon dia Geoff Wignall. “Surely the Ashes conundrum is actually quite straightforward: bring in Hameed and Hales at 2 and 3 along with an extra bowler (Crane?). 6, 7, 8, and 9 from this match all move up a place - into their rightful positions. It’s never difficult to be a hammock-chair selector.” Ha. Yes, Hameed is looking very much the best bet for no.2. But Hales is more of a 5 or 6 than a 3, isn’t he? 23rd over: West Indies 36-3 (Brathwaite 26, Shai Hope 1) Before play began, Sky had a seam-bowling masterclass from Darren Gough. Now they are showing one from Anderson, who continues to make the ball talk. His figures are magisterial: 12-6-10-3. Shai Hope does well to manage a single to fine leg. 22nd over: West Indies 35-3 (Brathwaite 26, Shai Hope 0) Woakes bowls a maiden at Brathwaite, who is now playing the role of the boy stood on the burning deck. Sky flash up the all-time Test wicket-taking list, showing that only two fast bowlers have more than Anderson: Glenn McGrath and Courtney Walsh. Formidable company. 21st over: West Indies 35-3 (Brathwaite 26, Shai Hope 0) After dispatching one Hope, Anderson greets the other with an inswinging yorker, as if he suddenly feels like being Waqar Younis. Hope does well to stab the bat down on it. Anderson has 2-4 this morning, and 495 Test wickets in all. OBO tradition states that wherever Starbuck goes, Copestake will go too. “I still expect England to grab a hefty lead. Will enjoy watching Blackwood though, as he looked untroubled until Broad got under his skin in the fateful debacle under lights.” Anderson finds the edge, as he was bound to do, and Root takes a sizzling catch, low to his left at second slip. The collapse is on, alas: Anderson must fancy reaching 500 today. 20th over: West Indies 32-2 (Brathwaite 25, Kyle Hope 1) Joe Root risks the wrath of Broad by replacing him with Chris Woakes, who immediately serves up some immaculate outswing and beats Hope twice. The OBO wouldn’t be the OBO without an early email from John Starbuck, who picks up on the Liverpool fancy-dress team (16th over). “It’s an odd thing, but you couldn’t have a whole team of cricketers past as a fancy-dress crowd, because the kit has hardly changed. Apart from anonymous umpires, you could have a few in civvies - Boycott in his hat and jacket, Benaud the same plus wig - but that’s about it, unless anyone can come up with others? “Also, I’ve yet to see a crowd in cricket-themed T-shirts; apart from my OBO version (‘Is it cowardly ...’) and a black job showing the Trent Bridge 2015 Aussie collapse, I’ve got one showing all the fielding positions, but on a dark green background. Why not a grass-green colour?” 19th over: West Indies 32-2 (Brathwaite 25, Kyle Hope 1) Somehow these two keep out Anderson, who gets one ball to go like a leg-break. Wicket no. 495 may be with us any minute now. “Morning Tim.” Morning Brian Withington. “It’s looking like an imminent apocalypse over Headingley - brilliant sunshine and a menacing filthy dark sky. Set up for Jimmy’s 500th or something out of a gothic novel? Start cranking up the Wagner on the gramophone.” 18th over: West Indies 31-2 (Brathwaite 25, Kyle Hope 1) Brathwaite edges Broad again, but his hands are soft enough to keep the ball down. And an email arrives from Pete Salmon. “I was supposed to spend today working in the garden, but fortunately I’ve fractured my sternum and been sent to bed for a week. I intend spending a lot of that time speculating about the English team for the Ashes. Here’s my funky opener – given the score is always 2/30, why not pick Hales to open and Roy at 3, and have them swinging from the backside from ball one, so things either end up at 2/30 in six overs, or 2/212 at lunch, with Cook 28 not out? Just a thought.” I like it, but something tells me it’s not going to happen. 17th over: West Indies 31-2 (Brathwaite 25, Kyle Hope 1) So there it is, wicket no. 494. Bishoo did his job as nightwatchman but was strangely inert this morning, ending up with 1 off 33 balls. Anderson’s worst ball of the morning – short, wide, but fatally tempting, as Bishoo plays a wafty cut. 16th over: West Indies 31-1 (Brathwaite 25, Bishoo 1) Brathwaite tickles Broad for four to fine leg and glides him for four more through the slips, quite safely. In the crowd, the early running is made by a gang who’ve come as the entire Liverpool team from their heyday, complete with Kevin Keegan afros, Terry McDermott moustaches and an uncanny facsimile of Bruce Grobbelaar. 15th over: West Indies 23-1 (Brathwaite 17, Bishoo 1) Anderson’s first over was too short, Nasser Hussain reckoned. This one is fuller, and he gets more swing. Another maiden: his 494th wicket is surely just round the corner. 14th over: West Indies 23-1 (Brathwaite 17, Bishoo 1) Stuart Broad targets the stumps and elicits an edge from Kraigg Brathwaite, which squirts away for four. This innings feels like it could so easily crumble, but it hasn’t done so yet. “Morning Tim.” Morning Robin Hazlehurst. “A great analogy for this test match just unfolded in a test match on the other side of the world. Last week the All Blacks battered the Wallabies in one of the most one-sided rugby matches you’ll see, and all the predictions for today’s rematch between them were of an even more uneven contest. But in fact it was a cracker that went down to the last minute and could have gone either way. “If this match follows suit then we’ll see last week’s embarrassingly uneven contest followed by a game decided in the last over of day five, and the side written off by everyone with questions asked about their continued existence emerge with a lot of pride and with heads held high.” 13th over: West Indies 19-1 (Brathwaite 13, Bishoo 1) Jimmy Anderson opens up to Devendra Bishoo, the nightwatchman, who lives up to his job title by blinking at the sunshine. This being the north of England in summer, there are plenty of dark clouds too. Anderson’s line is testing and has Bishoo flirting outside off stump. That’s a maiden. On Twitter, Andrew Benton has an answer to my question about all the top-order vacancies. “Only three extra @MoeenAli can fill the spaces left by the @englandcricket flounder-ers. We need sharks &amp; rays, not flat-fish!” A good question from Stephen Moss, who is one of the Guardian’s classiest writers and also the editor of a big fat Wisden Anthology. I did a tweet just now, trumpeting the fact that the Windies had remembered how to bowl. “But do they have anyone who can bat?” retorted Moss. “With Gayle, Pollard, Samuels, Chanderpaul, Bravo they’d be pretty competitive against the England VIII.” Two excellent points there: West Indies are fielding a virtual Second XI. And England are somehow winning Tests with an eight-man team. The three fringe batsmen, Stoneman, Westley and Malan, all floundered again yesterday. England’s runs, such as they were, were all made by Joe Root and Ben Stokes, who are, bizarrely, both the leaders of this team and its youngest members. As things stand, the three passengers can hardly go to the Ashes. But who should take their places? Morning. We have a Test that’s not a mismatch! West Indies only need another 40 to avoid the follow-on! They may even win! England 258 all out (after choosing to bat first), West Indies 19-1: this, kids, is what life was like in 1984. Except that in those days, the Windies held their catches. If they had done that yesterday, they would have been in the lead by now. Even with all those farcical fumbles, they attained some self-respect – nearly all of it thanks to their opening bowlers, Kemar Roach and Shannon Gabriel, who took 8-122 between them, and performed as if personally insulted by events at Edgbaston. Today, the Windies batsmen just have to hang in there, refrain from collapsing, and wait for Headingley to make one of its abrupt switches to a flat wicket, bursting with boundaries. They need to reach the close on something like 300-6, and go to bed tonight dreaming of a series victory that would be the biggest upset since Usain Bolt came third. The task for England’s bowlers is to bail out their batsmen. If they can skittle West Indies for under 170, on a Saturday, for the third time in two weeks, that total of 258 will begin to look perfectly adequate. But in the interests of the game, it would be better if that didn’t happen. One more good day for the Windies, and it’s series on."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"us-news/2017/aug/25/hurricane-harvey-preparation-texas-trump-fema","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-25T23:42:52Z","webTitle":"Hurricane Harvey: Texas braces for 'significant disaster' as storm intensifies","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/aug/25/hurricane-harvey-preparation-texas-trump-fema","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/aug/25/hurricane-harvey-preparation-texas-trump-fema","fields":{"headline":"Hurricane Harvey: Texas braces for 'significant disaster' as storm intensifies","bodyText":"As Texas residents boarded up windows, stockpiled supplies and evacuated their homes ahead of Hurricane Harvey, a storm which the federal official in charge of emergency management said would cause “a very significant disaster”, Washington braced for a major test of the Trump administration. Early Friday evening, hours before it is expected to make landfall, the hurricane was elevated to category 4 with sustained winds of 130mph, and was still intensifying. Hurricanes are rated on a 1-5 scale based on wind speed. Harvey is thus the most powerful storm to hit the US since Wilma pummelled Florida in 2005. Earlier that year, the Bush administration offered a calamitously inadequate response to Hurricane Katrina. Harvey was expected to make landfall near Corpus Christi early on Saturday, then potentially roll up the coast towards Houston and stall for days, bringing sustained rainfall and causing extensive flooding in the US’s fourth-largest city and surrounding areas. Forecasters warned of rising sea levels and 25in or more of rain in some areas. Greg Abbott, the Texas governor, said in a statement that Donald Trump, who spoke with the governors of Texas and Louisiana on Thursday, had “pledged all available resources from the federal government to assist in preparation, and rescue and recovery efforts”. On Friday, the president tweeted a picture of himself in the Oval Office, being briefed by key aides. Critics were quick to point to tweets from five years ago, when superstorm Sandy devastated the east coast. “Hurricane is good luck for Obama again,” Trump wrote on 30 October 2012. “He will buy the election by handing out billions of dollars.” The homeland security and counterterrorism adviser Tom Bossert told a White House press briefing preparations for the storm were “right up President Trump’s alley” as “his entire focus has been on making America great again”. The White House press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, said Trump, who was scheduled to spend the weekend at Camp David, would probably visit Texas early next week. Asked if Katrina was on the minds of those preparing for Harvey, Bossert said the storm that devastated New Orleans was “on the minds of all emergency managers in our community, especially those in Texas and Louisiana”. On Thursday, Trump tweeted a video clip of his meeting with Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) officials in early August, with the caption: “Remember, the USA is the most resilient nation on earth, because we plan ahead.” Brock Long, Trump’s choice to head Fema, was not confirmed by the Senate until 20 June, three weeks into the Atlantic hurricane season. Trump has not nominated a permanent head of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa), which plays a key role in weather forecasting. Fema is a branch of the Department of Homeland Security, which has been without a permanent secretary since John Kelly became the White House chief of staff last month. Kristy Dahl, a climate scientist at the Union of Concerned Scientists, told the Guardian: “I think we have to be hopeful that they’ll handle it properly. [Long] is certainly well qualified for the job and he was one of the rare appointments by the Trump administration that was widely hailed as reasonable and appointing someone with appropriate experience to the job.” Long is a former Fema regional hurricane programme manager and ran Alabama’s emergency management agency from 2008 to 2011, when the Gulf coast was hit by the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. That experience that may stand him in good stead if Harvey or a future storm seriously affects oil, gas and chemical facilities in the region, which environmentalists have cautioned is a catastrophe waiting to happen. “Texas is about to have a very significant disaster,” Long told CNN on Friday. “What concerns me the most right now is whether or not people have heeded the warning that local county judges have put forward. If they have not, their window to evacuate is rapidly coming to a close.” Trump’s proposed budget calls for a $667m cut to state and local Fema grant programmes that focus on disaster preparation. Many residents in Texas and across the country rely on the National Flood Insurance Program, which is about $25bn in debt, has been a target for congressional reform and will expire at the end of September unless it is renewed. In an interview with Bloomberg on Monday, Long declined to say whether he believed human activity was causing global warming. He also said he backed shifting more costs on to local authorities and limiting or refusing federal help for properties that flood often. “I don’t think the taxpayer should reward risk going forward,” he said. That would be worrying news for homeowners in places such as Houston, where thousands of homes stand on floodplains and several neighbourhoods were hit by severe flooding in spring storms in 2015 and 2016. Flood insurance premiums in the city can rise to thousands of dollars. “We know that things like storm surge flooding are going to be getting worse,” said Dahl. “Routine tidal flooding during high tide is going to become more frequent and more extensive. And this is going to be a problem not just in the Gulf coast in this immediate storm but for large swaths of our coastal areas. “So we really need the federal government to be playing a coordination role, helping to drive federal policies that will help local communities and state governments to keep their residents above water.” Last week, Trump signed an executive order repealing an Obama-era order from 2015 requiring public infrastructure projects to be built or rebuilt to standards that take into account the effects of climate change. Dahl said: “It’s incredibly frustrating that the science just keeps getting stronger and stronger and stronger and yet we’re seeing this gradual cutting away of programs and policies that would really help to make Americans more safe in the face of climate change.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"small-business-network/2017/sep/01/why-dont-universities-prepare-students-for-self-employment","type":"article","sectionId":"small-business-network","sectionName":"Guardian Small Business Network","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-01T06:00:36Z","webTitle":"Why don't universities better prepare students for self-employment?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/small-business-network/2017/sep/01/why-dont-universities-prepare-students-for-self-employment","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/small-business-network/2017/sep/01/why-dont-universities-prepare-students-for-self-employment","fields":{"headline":"Why don't universities better prepare students for self-employment?","bodyText":"Entrepreneurship is a hot topic within universities, and there are innovative programmes helping guide the next generation of business founders. But many students are still not accessing the support needed to go it alone. The student population has the potential to drive the UK’s boom in self-employment – since 2008 there has been a 66% increase in the number of 16- to 29-year-olds going freelance. But just 1% of freelancers learnt about self-employment in school or college and 2% in university, according to ComRes research last year. More must be done so that young people recognise self-employment as a viable career path. The largest group of freelancers are those working within arts and the media, and the fastest growing cohort is health professionals. Yet many universities place their entrepreneur support solely within their business departments and, as many faculties operate separately, this can mean self-employed education isn’t accessible to students from other disciplines. The International Entrepreneurship Educators Conference next week will focus on how institutions can better provide enterprise and entrepreneurial skills for everyone. We need to ensure that business advice and entrepreneurialism is not limited to business students. Middlesex University, for example, has modules such as Music Entrepreneurship which give practical guidance on self-employment for arts students. Universities also risk putting students off setting up a business by over-emphasising the importance of experience. Many talented people branch out without prior experience. The most important thing for students is to know their skillset, do their research, and commit to networking. Students regularly tell us at the Association of Independent Professionals and the Self Employed (IPSE) that they want to work for themselves but don’t have a “big idea” yet. Programmes like Dragon’s Den and The Apprentice have created a perception that a “big idea” is imperative and, unfortunately, too many universities focus on this as well. Instead, universities should promote how students can reflect on their existing talents and hone their skills to begin their own viable business. Entrepreneurialism doesn’t have to be about something ground-breaking, and careers officers should highlight the market for freelancers required to work on a project-by-project basis. In addition, more colleges need to bring practice into the curriculum. Nottingham Trent University has done this with its “live-trading” modules, offered as part of its decorative arts degree, in which students conduct a large-scale research project on how to start their own business. Along with the focus on a “big idea” comes the expectation that you need savings or investment to start your own ventures. Yes, it’s inevitable that some start-ups require investment, but you don’t always need tonnes of cash to start working for yourself and some universities offer entrepreneurial grants or start-up finance schemes when funding is required. A strong business plan, solid research, and your own talent are often the most important foundations. The main reasons people work for themselves are flexibility, autonomy and greater job satisfaction. Sure, the money can be good, but over emphasising turnover or scaling up as the primary measure of success may deter those who are motivated by different ambitions. It would be great to see more “How to get the best work/life balance”, or “How to build and diversify your client base” modules rather than focusing, primarily, on scaling up. It is worth noting that self-employed people can feel pressured or expected to work for free either in exchange for exposure or to add to their portfolio. Alarmingly, 20% of freelancers said it was standard practice in their industry to take unpaid work, according to a survey last year. The nofreework campaign aims to crackdown on companies taking advantage of students and graduates desperate to gain experience. Universities have an obligation to help eradicate bad practice by not advertising unpaid internships or job opportunities. Educational institutions need to continue to work towards broadening the understanding of what it means to work for yourself, and make freelancing and self-employment visible. In that way, young people will be prepared to positively kick-start their independent careers.

Genocide of over 80% of the natives of the Americas in the 15th and 16th centuries paved the way for the enslavement of millions of African people and the conquest of the world by European powers. At one point Britain’s empire was so vast that it covered two-thirds of the globe, so large that the sun never set on the dominion. The scientific, political and industrial revolutions the British school system is so proud to proclaim, were only possible because of the blood, toil and bounty exploited from the “darker nations” from across the globe. Colonialism left Africa, Asia and the Caribbean underdeveloped, as the regions were used to develop the west while holding back progress in what we now call the global south. Any discussion of progress in racial equality in Britain or the rest of the world has to acknowledge the damage that the west has inflicted on the former colonies and their descendants. Malcolm X explained that “if you stick a knife in my back nine inches and pull it out six inches, that’s not progress. If you pull it all the way out, that’s not progress. The progress comes from healing the wound that the blow made”. Instead of attempting to fix the damage, we are completely unable to progress on issues of equality because countries such as Britain “won’t even admit the knife is there”. It is the height of delusion to think that the impact of slavery ended with emancipation, or that empire was absolved by the charade of independence being bestowed on the former colonies. Descendants of enslaved Africans in the west find themselves subject to steep racial inequalities in every area of social life and are more likely to be killed by the state, as evidenced by the eruption of Black Lives Matter movements across the globe. This year marks 70 years since the partition of India and the region is still dealing with the consequences of British rule. The underdevelopment of the African continent continues with corrupt trade policies and the domination of the economy from the outside. One in 12 children dies in sub-Saharan Africa before their fifth birthday, in large part because the continent continues to be crippled by western “development”. Make no mistake, the knife is still planted firmly in our backs and it is time we not only removed it, but healed the wound. The only way to do this is for reparations to be paid to wipe out the unmistakable debt the west owes. Reparations have been routinely dismissed by British leaders, including David Cameron who told Jamaica that it was best to “move on” rather than expect so much as an apology. But as dismissive as Cameron was, there are plenty of precedents for the repayment of historical and economic debts. Reparations were paid out by the British government after the abolition of slavery – albeit to the slave owners. So great was the loss of wealth from the exploitation of human flesh that the equivalent of £2bn was paid, which has now been tracked by researchers at UCL. In 1804, Haitians had the audacity to carry out the only ever successful slave rebellion and declared independence from France. One of their rewards was being forced to pay 90m French francs, from 1825, with the final payment only being made in 1947. Slavery was clearly a lucrative endeavour and one for which those who produced the wealth have never received any compensation. It is not just governments that owe a debt; some of the biggest institutions and corporations built their wealth on slavery. Lloyds of London is one of Britain’s most successful companies and its roots lie in insuring the merchant trade in the 17th century. The fact that this was the slave trade has already led to civil action being taken by African Americans in New York. The church, many of the biggest banks, much of the ironworks industry and port cities gorged themselves on the profits from human flesh. It is clear that it would be just to pay reparations, and it is also possible to calculate the amount that Britain and other nations owe. A lot of work has been done in the United States to determine the damages owed to African Americans. The figure owed comes to far more than the “forty acres and a mule” that were promised to some African Americans who fought in the civil war. The latest calculations from researchers estimates that for unpaid labour, taking into account interest and inflation, African Americans are owed anywhere between $5.9tn and $14.2tn. It would not be prohibitively complicated to work out the debts owed by the western powers, or the companies that enriched themselves off exploitation. The obviousness of the issue is such that a federation of Caribbean countries (Caricom) is now demanding reparations, as is the Movement for Black Lives in America and Pan-Afrikan Reparations Coalition in Europe. In many ways the calls for reparatory justice do not take go far enough. Caricom includes a demand to cancel third world debt, and the Movement for Black Lives for free tuition for African Americans. Both of these are examples of removing the knife from our backs, rather than healing the wound. Third world debt was an unjust mechanism for maintaining colonial economic control and; allowing free access to a deeply problematic school system will not eradicate the impacts of centuries of oppression. In order to have racial justice we need to hit the reset button and have the west account for the wealth stolen and devastation caused. Nothing short of a massive transfer of wealth from the developed to the underdeveloped world, and to the descendants of slavery and colonialism in the west, can heal the deep wounds inflicted. We would need to perfect the mechanism for delivering this wealth transfer. Many governments in the developing world have as little interest in their native populations as the colonial administrations did, and sharing the money between individuals is the surest way to ensure that none of the issues are solved. But real reparatory justice would allow the developing world to build strong, sustainable economies that could eradicate global poverty. No one would need to live on less than a dollar a day and children would not die by the second. Racial equality at home would heal divisions between communities and absolve politicians from more handwringing. There’s even something in it for the “little Englanders”. People are not risking their family’s lives crossing deserts and the Mediterranean on makeshift boats because they crave the British way of life. Migration to this bleary island would turn to a trickle if people could make a decent life in their homelands. Of course there would be stark economic consequences for repaying this mountain of debt and no longer exploiting the developing world. But it is time we admitted that society currently works to benefit the few, and a rethink of how wealth is distributed more generally is long overdue. A factory reset of the political and economic consensus, in the form of reparations, would lead to a radically different and potentially fairer world for all. • Kehinde Andrews is associate professor in sociology at Birmingham City University.

Affectionately known as La Reina or La Stewarda, Steward, who has died aged 70 after a brain haemorrhage, was also a widely travelled author and journalist who worked for many titles – including the Guardian – a broadcaster and an adventurous club DJ. Her first job in the music industry, in the mail order department of Richard Branson’s Virgin records store in Notting Hill Gate, marked a change in direction from her degree in botany, zoology and chemistry and first teaching post. When Branson decided to start a record label, Sue became press officer, working closely with the big names of the 70s. She helped promote Mike Oldfield’s best-selling 1973 album Tubular Bells, and toured with Captain Beefheart and the experimental rock band Henry Cow. Later she worked with Malcolm McLaren and the Sex Pistols, and in another change of direction became office manager for Friends of the Earth. She had broad and adventurous musical tastes, and her fascination with Latin styles was inspired in part by her friendship with the composer, musician and writer David Toop. He played her recordings by the Fania All-Stars and the bass player Israel Cachao López, and she was hooked. She sought out Latin stars such as Celia Cruz, expanded her knowledge of the artists and repertoire, and began writing. In 1981 she was a co-founder with Toop of Collusion magazine, which covered music of all genres. Later in the 80s she began writing on Latin music for the influential magazine Straight No Chaser. Sue was keen to promote Latin and other world styles in any way she could. In 1985 she joined a team that included Paul Bradshaw and Gilles Peterson as a DJ for the pirate radio station K-Jazz, which broadcast from a rooftop in Crystal Palace, south London on Sundays. She would arrive at the secret studio with her albums hidden in a shopping trolley to deflect suspicion. Peterson remembers her as “an important influence on the boys. She gave me another direction on culture.” Peterson became known for promoting Latin styles, and 14 years later Sue joined him on a trip to Cuba and wrote the sleeve notes for an album by Danay Suarez, on Peterson’s Brownswood label. In 1987 she continued her DJ work – this time legally – as a co-founder with Gerry Lyseight and Max Reinhardt of the Mambo Inn club in south London. It became a favourite haunt for fans of jazz, African and Latin styles. Work for television included research for Channel 4’s 1989 music show Big World Cafe. Her first book, written with Sheryl Garratt, Signed, Sealed, Delivered: True Life Stories of Women in Pop Music (1999), was a groundbreaking study of women in music from the 50s to punk. Sue moved on to New York to continue her research into Latin music. The resulting book, Salsa: Musical Heartbeat of Latin America (1999), became a bible for enthusiasts of the genre. The salsa star Willie Colón began his foreword by saying “it’s going to be hard to explain what salsa really is”, but Sue did so in style, helped by impressive design work that reflected another of her passions – photography. She had now expanded her activities by becoming arts picture editor at the Daily Telegraph. And though she continued with musical projects, as founding contributing editor on Songlines magazine and working with Michael Nyman on his 2011 film about the bandleader Edmundo Ros, she became increasingly involved in photographic and art projects. She became photography critic for the London Evening Standard, curated events including the New Alchemists exhibition of contemporary photographers at the 2012 London Art Fair, and wrote knowledgably about “outsider” art for the magazine Raw Vision. In 2009 she dealt poignantly with the subject of photography and the dead in a piece for the Observer, which described how she photographed her mother, Jean, after her death. Sue grew up in the Leicestershire village of Stathern: her father, Francis, worked for a corn merchant and Jean (nee Gray) looked after their two daughters, a son and the home. From Melton Mowbray grammar school she went to the University of Liverpool, where her science degree was, she later remarked, “in retrospect, a very unlikely choice”. Easygoing and self-effacing, she was a passionate environmentalist. She loved to be by the water, and moved this year to St Leonards-on-Sea, East Sussex. Sue is survived by her brother, Malcolm, and sister, Alison. • Susan Steward, writer, broadcaster and exhibition curator, born 19 September 1946; died 24 August 2017 This article was amended on 28 August 2017.

She reported four separate incidents, between 2010 and 2013, claiming she had been sexually assaulted by six men and raped by nine, all strangers. One of the accused was convicted and serving a seven-year sentence when he was exonerated on appeal in 2015. Southwark crown court found Beale guilty of four counts of perjury and four counts of perverting the course of justice; the prosecution described her life as a “construct of bogus victimhood”. If this were fiction, one’s next question would be about Beale’s mental health: plainly, no one turns their life into a construct of bogus victimhood for fun. But there is no place for that question: to ask anything about the perpetrator, especially anything that might mitigate her mendacity, would be to minimise the suffering of the victims. Even those accused who were not deprived of their liberty must have had a life-alteringly horrific experience. The Crown Prosecution Service under Keir Starmer published a report on false allegations of rape, examining a 17-month period in 2011 and 2012. In that time, there had been 35 prosecutions for a false accusation, against 5,651 prosecutions for rape. Starmer explicitly drew the public’s attention to the fact that false claims “involved young, often vulnerable people. About half of the cases involved people aged 21 years old and under, and some involved people with mental health difficulties. In some cases, the person alleged to have made the false report had undoubtedly been the victim of some kind of offence, even if not the one that he or she had reported.” It is not the law that finds this difficult to comprehend, a perpetrator who is also a victim; rather, where the media intersects with the law, moral complexity is left at the sidelines of the hurtling imperative to find a goodie and a baddie. There lingers this question over the length of sentence: 10 years is atypical; recent, similar cases have resulted in two-year sentences. Yet it is by no means unheard of for a false accuser to get a 10-year sentence while a rapist is imprisoned for eight years. Prison is inevitable, according to Mr Justice Henriques in a 2009 finding, because false allegations drive “yet another nail into the conviction rate”. By this rationale, a mendacious woman has undermined the access to justice of all women, since she has made them less likely to be believed. There is common sense to this – rape defences hinge on the possibility that the putative victim is lying, which is made more plausible every time a woman lies. Yet it’s not something ever levelled at rapists, that they’ve made it more likely for other, innocent men to be convicted. Men never have to act as ambassadors for one another in a court of law. Arguably, a stiff sentence for a false allegation in itself compromises women’s access to justice: any reported rape, if it fails to secure a conviction, has the potential to be turned into a counter-accusation of perjury. The sexual offender is the criminal the law was devised to tackle: however much harm he caused, he has done nothing to undermine the system. The perjurer, meanwhile, has attacked the law itself. It is routine in cases of false allegations for the wasted police time and the cost of the trial to be central elements of the prosecution; you would never hear how much police time a rapist had taken up. That’s what the police are for – how could you call it a waste? All crimes are a waste of time, in the sense that, had they not occurred, the police could have done something else. Yet no crimes are a waste of time, in the sense that they are what justice is for. “It is precisely because these cases are so rare,” Frances Crook from the Howard League observed, “that the sentencing must be exemplary.” False rape claims get a lot of publicity, on the basis of that rarity, and the sentencing reflects this urgent sense that other women must be deterred. In fact, women generally do not need to be deterred, any more than they need case law to discourage them from child trafficking or smuggling rhinoceros horns. It is a well-documented nightmare to bring a charge of rape: to do so falsely is vanishingly rare for that reason, and not because we’re all waiting to see what kind of custodial sentence we can get away with. These three ideas – a woman as ambassador for all women, a woman as a threat not to the individual but to the system, and a woman as a dishonesty time-bomb, waiting for the right sentencing conditions before she unleashes her falsehoods – all spring from the same well: a system in which men are the norm and women the deviants. However far any given woman has deviated from honourable, law-abiding behaviour – and unquestionably, Jemma Beale deviated a long way – she wears shackles of cultural expectation that are punitive indeed."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"environment/shortcuts/2017/aug/27/snow-go-why-ben-nevis-is-frost-free-for-the-first-time-in-11-years","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-27T15:00:08Z","webTitle":"Snow-go: why Ben Nevis is frost-free for the first time in 11 years","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/shortcuts/2017/aug/27/snow-go-why-ben-nevis-is-frost-free-for-the-first-time-in-11-years","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/shortcuts/2017/aug/27/snow-go-why-ben-nevis-is-frost-free-for-the-first-time-in-11-years","fields":{"headline":"Snow-go: why Ben Nevis is frost-free for the first time in 11 years","bodyText":"Ain’t no mountain dry enough? Ben Nevis may well have grown by a metre last year but now it is also nude from basecamp up for the first time in 11 years. You would expect snow under foot atop the summit’s stone cairn at the lofty height of 1,345m, not a blunt, barren crown. So what on earth happened to the formerly covered peak? Well, Scotland has had its third warmest winter since 1910 but, even so, white mountain tops can be as hit-and-miss as white Christmases. Indeed, avid snow-watchers are keen to stress that it is a popular misconception to presume peaks are always snowy, or that the lower the altitude, the less the chance of a powdery summit. Many mountains in South America’s Andes are as dry as the arid Atacama desert upon which some of them reside – even when you get to the uppermost point. Monte Pissis, in Argentina, is the third highest in the western hemisphere and, at almost 7,000m, the tallest snowless peak in the world. Rising air temperature, driven by increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases – AKA global warming – has accelerated deglaciation in recent decades. As a consequence, researchers believe we are in a transition phase, from a world with glacierised mountains to a situation where permanent snow and ice cover is likely to be strongly reduced or even eliminated. This has potentially dire consequences for the half of the world’s population who depend on mountain water and who could soon be driven to stockpiling. But it’s not all doom and gloom – Ben Nevis expert Iain Cameron is confident the snow will return. “It can snow at any time on Ben Nevis, but snowfall at this time of the year is generally ephemeral,” says Cameron. “The first substantial falls you can expect are in October.” For how many more years that will periodically be the case remains to be seen. At this rate, snow-topped mountains could be primed to join proper Toblerones in the litany of things of which we may have seen the last."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/aug/28/raqqa-stealing-dead-civilians-electricity-water-food","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-28T10:30:31Z","webTitle":"Trapped in the ruins of Raqqa, we’re reduced to stealing from the dead | Tim Ramadan","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/aug/28/raqqa-stealing-dead-civilians-electricity-water-food","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/aug/28/raqqa-stealing-dead-civilians-electricity-water-food","fields":{"headline":"Trapped in the ruins of Raqqa, we’re reduced to stealing from the dead","bodyText":"Around three months have passed since the Syrian Democratic Forces launched a military operation to wrest back control of Raqqa from Islamic State. These forces are backed directly by the US-led international coalition, and they have so far succeeded in reclaiming half the city. But this counter-attack has resulted in the deaths of more than 1,300 civilians and the destruction of 70% of the city. Those of us in Raqqa who have survived the assault are facing a struggle to stay alive against a complete absence of all the basic components of life. Electricity and water have been cut off since the second week of the military operation, and the city is completely isolated. Besieged residents have no idea what is happening even in adjacent neighbourhoods, let alone the rest of the world – they just hear the sound of shelling and gun battles. Nobody can leave their street because of the mines and IED explosives that have been placed around the edges of neighbourhoods – and because of the Isis snipers who target anyone moving from one district to another. Residents relay information by yelling across the street to each other, sharing news of airstrikes and families who have been killed. Even walking the streets is difficult because of the constant shelling. Civilians have opened passages in the walls to move from house to house. They have to get water from old wells in the besieged neighbourhoods – wells that were closed back in the day but are now sorely needed. Normal life in the city has stopped. Nobody goes out to work, and the nature of my own work has changed. I used to walk the streets and take pictures and videos, or distribute pamphlets against Isis. But today I am a prisoner of the street I live in, confined to sending news of the dead, the shelling, and the outcome of battles. When the airstrikes stop, one person from each family goes out to look for food in the homes that have been bombed and whose owners have been killed. Most of the time they don’t find food but bring back news of the dead, along with some items that can be put to use like candles, pieces of wood or medicines. The grass and weeds that grow on the side of the road constitute the nutrition of half of those besieged in the city. People make soup out of these weeds and put dried-up bread in to it so it is easier to eat. The soup tastes extremely bitter and children initially refuse to even try it, but it’s the only food some of them have. They feel nauseated the first time they taste it and then they get used to it. People use old clothes, furniture and nylon bags to light fires for cooking. There is very limited oil in the city and families use it to fuel electricity generators for at least some lighting. The fuel I had has almost run out, so I have gone out to parked cars that were damaged in the fighting to take their batteries – if they are still working – to power the device I use to access the internet. I feel guilty for stealing batteries and I wish I could get the chance to speak to the owners to ask their forgiveness. I also feel guilty because I do not share electricity with my neighbours: I am trying to ration my use of fuel and batteries until the end of the battle, and I cannot reveal what I do to those around me. I have no other choice. Some families gather in the evenings in one of their homes, and every family brings the food that they have to share, even if it is just grass soup: often that is the only meal they eat that day. These gatherings of families aren’t just a way of sharing food; they also save fuel and candles and offer an opportunity to enjoy some time together, forgetting what is happening outside, particularly for the children whose families are trying to shield them from the war. Children will usually sit around a person who tells them stories about how near the end of the war is, that they will be able to go back to their schools and see their friends again, and there will be food in the city once more. Whenever anybody brings a new item to these gatherings, people ask where they got it from. The answer is usually from a home of one of the families killed in the fighting. Everyone feels guilty about that. I once told them about a TV drama I had watched called The Blacklist, and a quote from it that said, if you live inside a society built on criminality you must think and act like a criminal. One man asked had we become criminals. After a few moments of silence, a younger man said we were like Robin Hood, not like criminals, and that got a laugh. Another man said he hoped a plane would bomb an Isis house because then we wouldn’t feel guilty stealing everything in it. But these gatherings are also a reason for the high number of civilian deaths in the coalition airstrikes. You might have up to 50 people in a single house, mostly women and children, and the coalition don’t investigate their targets properly. It’s rare to actually find Isis fighters in the neighbourhoods still under its control, because they either hide inside homes or spread out in the frontline districts with the Syrian Democratic Forces. Their tactic is to force people living near the frontline to move to neighbourhoods that are further away, to prevent them from escaping if they lose control of the area. The other day a car belonging to Isis disposed of four corpses in one of the city’s streets with a sign that said: “They were killed because they tried to escape.” I once asked a man with four children why his family stayed in Raqqa and didn’t try to run away, and he said that his children had a better chance of surviving by not fleeing. The road out to escape is mined and in the line of sight of snipers. How far could his children run? I made a promise once to Naji al Jarf and Ibrahim Abdul Qadir, two journalist colleagues, that one day Isis would be gone and that, on that day, I would stand in the city square and distribute sweets. Both journalists are dead, killed by Isis, but I will stay to try to tell the stories of the 5,000 families still surviving in the city, for whom escaping is not an option. • Tim Ramadan is the pseudonym of a Syrian journalist based in Raqqa"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"football/2017/aug/25/jurgen-klopp-liverpool-signings-van-dijk-keita","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-25T21:30:00Z","webTitle":"Jürgen Klopp: Champions League will improve Liverpool’s belief 100%","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/aug/25/jurgen-klopp-liverpool-signings-van-dijk-keita","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/aug/25/jurgen-klopp-liverpool-signings-van-dijk-keita","fields":{"headline":"Jürgen Klopp: Champions League will improve Liverpool’s belief 100%\r\n","bodyText":"Jürgen Klopp says Liverpool’s self-belief and development will be taken to a different level thanks to Champions League qualification. The Liverpool manager has often lamented a lack of confidence in his players, claiming one bad result or performance is enough for doubts about their potential to emerge at Anfield. However, having qualified for the Champions League with victory over Hoffenheim in the play-offs on Wednesday – “the hardest way to get there”, according to Klopp – the former Borussia Dortmund coach believes a place among the European elite should banish any reservations about his squad’s quality. “It will help our belief 100%,” said Klopp, who will confront Spartak Moscow, Sevilla and the Slovenian champions Maribor in the group stage. “Since I came here in October 2015 we created in this building an atmosphere that is extremely special. We feel the power of this club, of the people, the skills of the people, all that stuff, but we can improve it outside of the building too. For this we need moments of qualifying for finals, and the will to win these finals, but we need to show up all the time and be part of the Champions League. If that is not a sign then I don’t understand what a sign is. It was the hardest way to get there but we did it and to be honest that feels even better. “It is very important, for the whole club it was like a thank you. That is the thing we want to reach, and we are happy with this because it is very important for us. For all of us it builds the confidence. Yes, you gain experience from winning or losing games like this, but you want to have the kind of experience we have got now and that’s really good for the boys. I think we really deserved it.” Qualifying for the Champions League group stage for the second time in eight seasons will also hasten the development of Liverpool’s players, according to their manager. Klopp, who expects the defender Trent Alexander-Arnold and midfielder Emre Can to recover from minor knocks in time to face Arsenal on Sunday, explained: “I think since we were together a lot of the players have improved. That’s because of the group, because of the things we did and the way we treat each other. We played Hoffenheim and people in Germany are now saying that they were naive against us. I don’t think that. Let me say that we were outstandingly good. “You always have to make the next step and that’s what we did with the players here. Of course, you have two bad games and everybody thinks we are not that good. Around the Chelsea game last year, people were saying: ‘Jordan Henderson is the [number] six? No way can he play as the six.’ Now he is the six for England. It is always too quick. We don’t think like this. I really trust these players and I really like developing with them.” Liverpool’s front three of Sadio Mané, Roberto Firmino and Mohamed Salah were outstanding against Hoffenheim on Wednesday and their form bodes well for Klopp before Arsenal’s visit to Anfield. But the German insisted there was more to come from the trio, who he expects to thrive on the Champions League group stage. Klopp added: “Sadio has made a big step, but first of all because it was possible for him to do it. He is being more clear in all the situations – passing in the right moment, dribbling in the right moments, always being a goal threat. “You can see Mo is on the way there. He is not that used to how we play, not using the body that much. A different player to Sadio, same speed but different player. He played a completely different position last season, he was a second striker at Roma, but he can play as a winger. He has already defended 500% more than he did last season and he is another player who needs to adapt. “Roberto Firmino – who was in any doubt about him? If anyone ever doubted him they lost my respect 18 months ago. He is an unbelievable player. Everybody spoke about his passing game against Hoffenheim but the challenges he made defensively, chasing them from behind, all over the pitch – they couldn’t get rid of him. “That is the character you need to make the next step with the team. It is already good but all the teams are already very good, so who wins? It is the team who wants it the most. And this game, for sure, we wanted it more.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"theobserver/2017/aug/26/letters-cutting-tuition-fees-in-half-fairer-than-abolishing-them","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-26T23:05:49Z","webTitle":"Cutting tuition fees in half would be fairer than abolishing them | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2017/aug/26/letters-cutting-tuition-fees-in-half-fairer-than-abolishing-them","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/theobserver/2017/aug/26/letters-cutting-tuition-fees-in-half-fairer-than-abolishing-them","fields":{"headline":"Letters: cutting tuition fees in half would be fairer than abolishing them","bodyText":"You report on the debts facing graduates who have taken out loans to cover tuition fees (“Getting to grips with a £32,220 student debt…”, Personal finance, last week).

That there is a common good and a private benefit suggests the cost should be shared. Fees at the current level of £9,250 cover the entire cost of tuition for most arts and social sciences and 85% of the costs of laboratory subjects, thus putting emphasis on the private benefit. But abolition would change the balance towards a common good view. Reducing fees to half the costs of tuition would be much fairer and would reduce any deterrent effect (particularly for students from poorer families). A debt on graduation of £20,000 to £25,000 would seem less of a mountain. Dr Kenneth Edwards Cambridge Name and shame those statues Catherine Bennett (“The once mighty are falling…”, Comment, last week) discussed the problem of revised social attitudes towards statues and whether offending ones should be removed. The answer might be that they remain in place, but as tastes change the inscription could be supplemented by one which could “name and shame”, or reaffirm, the character of the individual concerned, in line with public opinion. Len Gray Shipley West Yorkshire The cure for gender imbalance Your article “Councils need 12,000 more women to close gender gap” (News, last week) focused on ways to achieve quantitative equality in local government, but neglected the need to improve qualitative equality. Many local government norms and ideals are still oriented towards men. Hertfordshire’s county hall, where I serve, has a door marked “lady members cloakroom” – wording from a bygone age, tand a reminder that female councillors have been seen as an exception rather than a norm. Our minuting practice attributes the remarks of a female chair to a chairman. It is also custom in meetings to say, “Thank you, chairman” when invited to speak, a gender-loaded phrase which harks back to a time when women were waiting for an invitation from men to feed into the political debate through suffrage. If we are serious about breaking down barriers to encourage more women into politics, we have to think bigger than simply swelling their ranks to match those of men. Prevailing norms that hinder recruitment, selection, election and progression of aspiring female politicians need addressing. We need the most inclusive working environment possible for councillors of all genders and none, to match the modern, flexible, instructive and rewarding work that being a local representative entails. Charlotte Hogg Liberal Democrat councillor St Albans Milton’s well-trodden path We are told that Milton made a little-known journey to Italy and this surprising fact has “emerged” (“When Milton met Galileo: the collision of cultures that helped shape Paradise Lost”, News, last week). However, there was nothing not already well known to Milton scholars, and probably not to anyone who has read Milton, particularly when he described his visit in his Areopagitica: “There it was that I found and visited the famous Galileo grown old, a prisoner to the Inquisition, for thinking in Astronomy otherwise than the Franciscan and Dominican licencers thought.” So, familiar, rather than surprising. I look forward to other revelations, such as, “Tennyson smuggled money to revolutionaries in Spain” or, “Browning eloped with a disabled woman”. Brent Elliott Harrow Trouble on the top deck Thomas Heatherwick’s “expensive, inefficient and faulty” London bus (Profile, last week) features an unpleasantly cramped upper deck, with low headroom and mean little windows. The buses it replaced had a spacious upper deck with tall windows, which made travelling a pleasure. Heatherwick and his wealthy followers probably never need to travel by bus, but for ordinary Londoners he has diminished our daily lives. John Wilson London NW3 Rees-Mogg is no Bannon Lenin claimed that “worse is better”, meaning that the more unpopular governments make themselves, the more likely is revolution. On that basis, the defenestration of Steve Bannon (“An increasingly isolated Trump cuts a pathetic and discredited figure”, Editorial, last week) is bad news for those of us who oppose neo-liberal, authoritarian trends, since he undoubtedly encouraged the worst aspects of the Trump administration. In contrast, if the Tories choose Jacob Rees-Mogg as their leader, that would be brilliant.

You’ll have strengths in different areas and eventually find one or two aspects you do better at – this is normal.” • Don’t commit yourself to a part-time job in the first term. “Wait and see how you go before agreeing to do more than a few hours’ work here and there, and be prepared to warn your manager you will need certain weeks off,” says Dr Aleksej Heinze, of the University of Salford Business School. • Do expect to feel homesick. “Use Skype and social media to stay in touch and consider ways you can be involved in family life without being physically present,” says Rafique. • Do prioritise sleep. “Disrupted sleep patterns are closely related to anxiety and depression,” says Dr Fredrik Johansson, a consultant psychiatrist for Camden and Islington NHS Foundation Trust. • Do use the rest of the summer holidays to research the content of the first term. The more you know now about your course, the more confident you will feel. • Do organise yourself. The biggest new challenge students face is to manage time and organise all their social and academic activities. Get into the habit of keeping a planner, noting down deadlines and commitments so you feel on top of things. There are useful apps such as Listastic, Any.do, Finish and To.do for making lists and scheduling tasks. Nothing is better, however, than an old-fashioned planner. • Don’t compare yourself to others. “Often the people who seem to be hitting the library for 12 hours or partying all the time are not the happiest, and those students who appear to be mastering everything immediately are not actually doing so,” says Dr Ewan Jones, director of studies in English at Downing College, Cambridge. “Don’t put unnecessary extra pressure on yourself.” • Do register with a local GP as soon as you arrive. “A lot of access to mental health services goes through your GP,” says Johansson. • Do exercise to relieve stress and reset your brain, or just go for a walk. “I tell my students that if they take a walk when they’re feeling overwhelmed, the ideas will come to them,” says Jones. • Do make time to socialise and make friends. “Having at least one person to confide in helps increase resilience,” says Johansson. • Finally, don’t ever be afraid to seek help. “University pastoral teams are specially trained and, trust me, they won’t think you’re wasting their time if you decide to stop by for a chat,” says Rafique."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2017/aug/25/benjamin-zephaniah-revolutionary-minds","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-25T14:31:51Z","webTitle":"Benjamin Zephaniah: ‘I’m almost 60 and I’m still angry.

Everyone told me I would mellow’","bodyText":"Benjamin Zephaniah’s 1998 poem Carnival Days is a lyrical love letter to the Notting Hill carnival, where “We dance like true survivors / We dance to the sounds of our dreams.” Or, more accurately, it’s a love letter to what the carnival once was. He still supports the event, which takes place in London this weekend, and plans to be there on Monday, but reckons it has become less innocent, less spontaneous in the two decades since he wrote his poem. These days, even dreams have to be policed – and ideally sponsored. “It’s become more corporate and – to some people this might sound positive – more organised,” he says. “Stalls have to pay a fee; sponsors get involved. People used to take to the streets and do it for themselves. They’d say: ‘I’ll sell some food on this corner; you sell some food on that corner.’ It was organised anarchy. There was no big committee. There was a group of people and that was it. Now, it’s all about liaising with the police, which for me takes away the spirit of us really taking to the streets. The idea that we are in control, that we run things, that the authorities have nothing to do with this and the police have to stay out there – that’s gone.” Zephaniah says the carnival had a particular resonance in the late 1970s and 80s, when he became a regular attender and started performing his poetry there, because “there were no jobs for young black people and there were places we couldn’t go because of the NF or the way they [those places] were policed. The idea of carnival was to say: ‘These are our streets now, just for this long weekend. It was a celebration, but it was also a political statement. The carnival can’t happen in a park, as some people have suggested. That’s a concert.” He has been irked by the police crackdown on people they claim are out to cause trouble at the event? “It’s just an excuse,” he says. “If they are arresting people because they suspect they have knives and guns, I’m sure these people will have knives and guns all year round. There’s been no major shoot-out at the carnival; there have been a few scraps, but those scraps would have happened anyway. It happens when someone has a grudge against someone else. It happened to a friend of mine. He met someone at the carnival who had a grudge against him and they had a scrap, but it would have happened if they’d met at Spitalfields market.” The other controversy surrounding this year’s event has been the police’s proposed use of facial recognition software to identify supposed troublemakers. Zephaniah says the carnival has always been used by the police to test new equipment. “This, for them, is perfect,” he says. “A lot of people, mainly black, in one place.” He claims long-range listening devices were tried out at previous events. Zephaniah, as his argument suggests, is a fan of organised anarchy. “Deep down, I am a revolutionary,” he says on his new album Revolutionary Minds, his first foray into music for a decade. It is a little difficult to take this claim seriously when we meet in a tea room next to Peterborough cathedral on a gloriously sunny day, especially when Zephaniah – a lover of martial arts who treats his body as a temple – orders ginger beer. But he insists he’s serious. “I have no faith in the political system as it is,” he says. “I’ve voted, but it’s always for the least of the evils. On that track [called I Am a Revolutionary”], I say I go on Question Time and I talk to politicians and get involved, but actually I’d like to just burn the lot of them. The system stinks.” The young man who came of age amid the edgy street politics of the 1980s is still furious about the state of the world. “I can’t understand why I’m almost 60, and I’m still fucking angry. Everyone told me I was going to be mellow by now. I’ve got a house, I grow my own vegetables, and I’m still angry.” Last year he waded into the debate over Jeremy Corbyn, defending him against critics in both the media and his own party, but he demurs when I describe him as a “Corbyn fan”. “It’s not about being a Corbyn fan,” he says. “It’s not about the cult of personality. Corbyn is not even, in my view, a very charismatic speaker. People laugh at him sometimes, and say he sounds like a teacher, and he does, but what he says makes sense. It’s not about worshipping him; it’s about being desperate for something different. In terms of mainstream politics, he’s the best thing that’s happened here for a long time.” Zephaniah has been vocal about the treatment of the residents of Grenfell Tower, and criticised Kensington and Chelsea council for ignoring their plight in the aftermath of the fire. “What happened is a symbol of a divided Britain,” he says. “These people were abandoned for days, absolutely abandoned, at a time when they needed help the most.” The tragedy will form the backdrop to this year’s carnival: attendees are being encouraged to wear green in sympathy with those who died; there will be a quiet zone for reflection; and sound systems will fall silent as they pass close to the tower. In Zephaniah’s view, everything is political. He quotes Jamaican poet Elean Thomas: “I am not one of those people that say: ‘I don’t deal with politics.’ Because if I don’t deal with politics, politricks will deal with me. “One of the things I’m really good at,” he says, “is talking about politics and ideas to people who are not interested in it for one reason or another. They don’t think it’s for them, but usually I can explain why it is.” He says his poetry performs the same function. “I said something once that still stands: I started writing poetry because I don’t like poetry. Of course I liked using words, but I wanted to change the image of poetry. I wanted to bring it to life and talk about now and what was happening to us.” It was writing and performing poetry that allowed him to escape a difficult background. His parents, who were born in the Caribbean and emigrated to the UK in the 1950s, had separated; his large family had split and he lived with his mother; he fell in with a gang in Handsworth, the heart of the African-Caribbean community in Birmingham where he grew up, was sent to borstal for robbery, and by his early 20s feared for his life. “There were some people in Birmingham out to kill me,” he says, “and the police were also buzzing around. I watched about three people die, and thought, ‘What’s so special about me that I’m going to survive this?’ So I got up one morning and went to London. I told my mum: ‘The next time you see me it’s going to be on TV.’ She laughed and said, ‘Yeah, you’ll be on Police Five.’” Gangs are a curse, he says, but they also reflect human nature. “People are pack animals. We like our gangs. That’s the way we are. When I talk to kids, I tell them about me growing up in gangs in Birmingham and how one day I got up and I went to London and I got involved in another gang and these were a real hard lot. All these kids are listening to me, and they go ‘Oh, you poor thing.’ And I go, ‘It was a gang of poets and painters,’ and they all laugh.” He had always wanted to be a writer, despite the fact that he was dyslexic and that some of his friends told him writing books – as opposed to rapping in clubs, which he excelled at as a teenager – was “a white-man thing”. “When I was eight I knew what I wanted to do. I wanted to be a poet, and earn a living from it. I wanted to write poetry that was serious but could be funny; to put some stories into novels; and to talk about peace and freedom. I always felt that I was never going to be top of the pops, because I wouldn’t be completely accepted by everybody, and all that stuff has come true.” He is writing his autobiography, due to be published next year when he will turn 60; it should be a vivid read. He accepts that he is now part of the cultural establishment, but says he will never be part of the political establishment. “I can’t go to a bookshop and say ‘Please can you sell less of my books.’ But what I can’t do very well is sip champagne. Three or four times I got offers to go to one of those Blair parties and to Buckingham Palace [he turned down an OBE in 2003], but I can’t do that shit. I just can’t do it. I’m not establishment in that sense. I can’t spend time with them; I can’t even have sex with them; I have to go home on my own.” Being on his own is part of the Zephaniah mystique. We are meeting in Peterborough because he lives in a village in the Fens near Spalding – about as far as imaginable culturally from the Handsworth of his youth and the London that formed him politically. He likes the isolation and not being part of the London scene. “I wanted to go to a place that wasn’t known for its artistic community. People are just getting on with life.” He also finds it amusing that black people in Peterborough complain to him about eastern Europeans not speaking English and taking all the jobs. The demonisation of the other – one of his pet hates – is a universal affliction. Zephaniah admits working across so many genres – poetry, fiction, plays, music – confuses people. “A lot of people have said to me: ‘If you really knuckled down you could be a great novelist’. And other people have said: ‘If you concentrated on your music, you’d be the next Bob Marley’. But jumping from one to another, I’m never bored. People who don’t know me sometimes stop me and ask me what I do, and a lot of the time I say I’m a painter and decorator who does a bit of poetry on the side.” Revolutionary Minds is out on 1 September."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"media/2017/aug/25/ashton-kutcher-mila-kunis-settle-legal-dispute-mail-online-photos-daughter","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-25T12:25:39Z","webTitle":"Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis settle legal dispute with Mail Online","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/aug/25/ashton-kutcher-mila-kunis-settle-legal-dispute-mail-online-photos-daughter","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2017/aug/25/ashton-kutcher-mila-kunis-settle-legal-dispute-mail-online-photos-daughter","fields":{"headline":"Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis settle legal dispute with Mail Online","bodyText":"The actors Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis have settled their legal action against the Mail Online over the publication of images of their baby daughter. Kutcher and Kunis – whose film credits include Jobs about the founder of Apple, Friends with Benefits and Black Swan – sued the website over two articles published in 2015. The couple said the Mail Online stories featured “wrongful publication of paparazzi photographs of family outings”, and also the allegation that those stories were used to “promote clothing products by the Mail”. On Friday, the couple and Mail Online released a joint statement saying they had resolved the dispute. “Ashton Kutcher, Mila Kunis and MailOnline are pleased to confirm through their legal representatives that they have reached a satisfactory resolution of their legal action,” it said. “[It] includes an agreement to pixelate photographs of their daughter, Wyatt, their son, Dimitri, and any future children they should have together.” It was not clear whether the deal included any form of payment or financial settlement to the couple. Kutcher and Kunis had launched legal proceedings over the publication of images of Wyatt on 27 January and 19 May 2015. The photographs had been taken by a paparazzo using a long lens during the family’s outing to the beach. They did not know the shots were being taken at the time. At the time of the lawsuit, the couple said they valued their private family life and personal time with their daughter, who was born the previous October. “Like any other family, they should be allowed to enjoy family outings without being pursued by photographers,” a statement on the legal action said at the time. “They have made it clear that they do not agree to the publication of photographs of such occasions.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/aug/28/young-at-heart-why-children-who-exercise-become-healthier-adults","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-28T05:00:25Z","webTitle":"Young at heart: why children who exercise become healthier adults","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/aug/28/young-at-heart-why-children-who-exercise-become-healthier-adults","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/aug/28/young-at-heart-why-children-who-exercise-become-healthier-adults","fields":{"headline":"Young at heart: why children who exercise become healthier adults","bodyText":"Last week, Public Health England said 6 million middle-aged adults in England take less than 10 minutes’ brisk exercise a month, risking their health. But when does the problem start? It seems the answer is “very young”. Last year, a damning international study portrayed British children as among the least active in the world. Despite government guidelines urging parents to ensure their offspring do at least an hour of moderate-intensity exercise every day, compared with 38 other nations including Venezuela and Slovenia, England and Wales are currently third-worst in the list – with Scotland at the bottom. Only 22% of boys aged 11 to 15 manage the recommended amounts of daily exercise, and just 15% of girls. But while active childhoods can have many obvious short-term benefits, including reducing the rates of obesity – the latest figures suggest that nearly 20% of 10- to 11-year-olds in England are obese – the little we know of the long-term benefits point towards exercise being even more crucial than we might already assume. Denmark and Sweden, which have long been interested in the link between childhood physical activity and achievements in later life, have markedly less prevalence of metabolic-related conditions in children. Researchers examined a database containing the fitness records of 1.2 million Swedish men born between 1950 and 1976, on entry into military service at 18. They then traced their subsequent progress through life, and found that cardiovascular fitness appeared to be predictive of cognition in middle age. In other words, the more exercise they had done during adolescence, the more likely they were to be successful professionally. Neuroscientists believe there are a number of reasons for this. Studies show that doing enough physical activity to improve cardiorespiratory fitness in childhood is directly related to the structure and function of the developing brain, especially regions such as the hippocampus, which is involved in memory, and the prefrontal cortex, which does not complete its formation until your early 20s. “The developing brain in specific regions appears to be particularly amenable to exercise,” says Charles Hillman, professor at Northeastern University. “The development of the prefrontal cortex is involved in our ability to think, reason and commit purposeful action based on thought and not impulse. In everyday life, it is crucial in our ability to lead successful and healthy lives. Exercise increases metabolic demand and, in response, the brain increases angiogenesis – building more capillary beds to transport blood and oxygen to different regions. It also increases the formation of synapses between neurons, increasing the ability of different parts of the brain to talk to each other.” These benefits can be observed in MRI scans showing the blood flow to various parts of the brain, and the levels of a variety of chemicals involved in the strength and health of neurons. The data available suggests the neuroprotective qualities of exercise are present throughout life, with individuals in their 60s and 70s who exercise having a lower risk factor of developing Alzheimer’s disease. As such, scientists believe that one of the lasting benefits of exercising early in life is actually psychological. “There’s a strong tendency for childhood exercise to have a positive influence,” says Ted Garland, professor of biology at the University of California. “Those who have grown up doing regular exercise are more motivated to get out there and exercise as adults. This could be linked to the effect of exercise on the brain’s reward-feedback loops. We know that exercise increases the levels of neurotransmitters such as dopamine and, to an extent, serotonin, and that has a kick-back effect on motivation that persists for quite a lot of time.” But one of the most fascinating, and newly discovered benefits of childhood exercise is one hidden inside our skeletons. Studies have found that bones retain a “memory” of early-life exercise before the onset of puberty that lasts long after the exercise has ceased, and provides health benefits even in a relatively sedentary adulthood. “If you look at children who begin intense exercise very early in life – for example children whose parents get them involved in tennis or gymnastics – this induces a pattern of changes in the way their genes express themselves which stays with them for many years,” says Professor Elwyn Firth of the University of Auckland’s department of exercise sciences. “There are big differences in their bone mass, density and mineral content compared to those who haven’t done that exercise. Even if the exercise ceases in adulthood, these differences persist for 10 years or more, especially if the exercise began before puberty.” As well as making those individuals less prone in later life to bone diseases such as osteoporosis, these changes also have implications on the way food is processed, in particular, high-fat diets. Our bones are far more involved in energy metabolism than we might think, and the gene expression changes induced by early-life exercise affect a variety of pathways that alter the body’s inflammatory response to a high-calorie diet. These changes are retained in the bone marrow into adulthood, making those children less susceptible to inflammatory-related diseases such as diabetes and cancer when adult. Scientists have found evidence of exercise-related benefits even earlier in life, passed on by mothers who exercise during pregnancy, or even prior to conception. “Given that the mother is sharing her circulation with the offspring, all kinds of changes are passed on in terms of hormone levels or blood lipid levels, all of which affect the energy storage, oxygen capacity and muscle health of the child at birth,” says Garland. “This has an impact on their natural ability to exercise, but also perhaps on their motivation to exercise at a subsconscious level. This will then go on to benefit them throughout life.” Such are the wide-ranging benefits of exercise in childhood that scientists are desperately trying to reinforce the message of its importance. “Physical activity in humans in general is rapidly declining and looks set to get worse,” says Hillman. “Every chance we have to promote it is good for our health, the economy, the planet, everything really.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"us-news/2017/aug/25/gary-cohn-donald-trump-criticism-economic-chief-charlottesville","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-25T13:09:00Z","webTitle":"Trump's economic chief criticizes Charlottesville response: we must do better","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/aug/25/gary-cohn-donald-trump-criticism-economic-chief-charlottesville","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/aug/25/gary-cohn-donald-trump-criticism-economic-chief-charlottesville","fields":{"headline":"Trump's economic chief criticizes Charlottesville response: we must do better","bodyText":"Gary Cohn, Donald Trump’s chief economic adviser, has become the most senior administration official to criticize the president over his initial failure to condemn neo-Nazi and white supremacist groups, following the clashes in Charlottesville earlier this month that left one woman dead and dozens injured. “This administration can and must do better in consistently and unequivocally condemning these groups and do everything we can to heal the deep divisions that exist in our communities,” Cohn told the Financial Times in his first public comments on the issue. Cohn, who was president of Goldman Sachs before accepting a position in the Trump administration as head of the White House national economic council, said he had come under “enormous pressure” to resign after Trump equivocated in his denunciation of white supremacist groups, saying there had been “very fine people on both sides” at the demonstrations. The economic adviser said he had considered stand down but decided to stay on after discussions with the president. The New York Times reported he had gone as far as drafting a letter of resignation. Cohn said he’d “felt a duty to fulfill my commitment to work on behalf of the American people” but also “compelled to voice my distress over the events of the last two weeks”. “Citizens standing up for equality and freedom can never be equated with white supremacists, neo-Nazis, and the KKK,” Cohn added. “As a Jewish American, I will not allow neo-Nazis ranting ‘Jews will not replace us’ to cause this Jew to leave his job. I feel deep empathy for all who have been targeted by these hate groups. We must all unite together against them.” Cohn said several chief executives had urged him to stay in the administration to continue to push a pro-business agenda. Those executives included some who resigned from the White House advisory council in protest over Charlottesville, the FT also reported. In the days following the outcry over Trump’s remarks blaming “many sides” for the violence, Trump was forced to disband two high-profile business advisory councils, the American Manufacturing Council and the Strategic and Policy Forum, after eight executives, including Campbell Soup Co CEO Denise Morrison and 3M Co CEO Inge Thulin, quit in protest over his remarks. The Financial Times asked Cohn if his decision to stay was influenced by the firing of Steve Bannon, the former White House chief strategist, with whom he is reported to have frequently clashed over the administration’s China policy and whose allies reportedly called him “Globalist Gary”. Bannon’s website, Breitbart News, greeted Cohn’s criticisms on Friday with the headline: “White House Shock: 🌏Gary🌏 Trashes Trump in Press – Whitewash: No Antifa Violence, Just ‘citizens standing up for equality and freedom’”. Cohn said his decisions were his own. “I have to do what is best for me and my family. I have had numerous private conversations with the president on this topic [and] I have not been bashful saying what I think.” His chances of becoming the next chairman of the Federal Reserve would almost certainly be scuppered if he resigned. Other members of the administration who had also been dismayed at Trump’s remarks had made their own decisions about how to respond, he said. “This is a personal issue for each of us. We are all grappling with it. This takes time to grapple with.” Treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin, who is also Jewish, has defended the president and said at a White House press briefing on Friday he intended to stay in office. “I think there’s no question the president was not equating the hate groups who were peacefully and under no circumstances was I going to resign,” the Treasury secretary said. Trump’s confidante Roger Stone tweeted later on Friday that “Gary Cohen [sic], recommended for his White House job by Jared Kushner, should be fired immediately for his public attack on the president”. But White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said that: “Gary has not held back how he feels about the situation. He’s been very open and honest.” Cohn’s comments go beyond what most administration officials have offered in response to Charlottesville. Jeff Sessions, the attorney general, called it an “unequivocally an unacceptable, evil attack” but offered no criticism of Trump’s tepid response. Mike Pence described Charlottesville as a “tragedy” and a “heartbreaking situation”. On a trip to Chile, the vice-president said: “The president has been clear on this tragedy, and so have I.” Ivanka Trump commented on the violence, tweeting: “There should be no place in society for racism, white supremacy and neo-nazis. We must all come together as Americans – and be one country UNITED.” But she faced criticism for making no mention of terrorism or her father’s response. Later today, the Republican National Committee is expected to pass a resolution condemning white supremacists at the party’s summer meeting in Nashville. Bill Palatucci, an RNC committeeman from New Jersey who sponsored the resolution, said it was important for the committee to formally denounce white supremacists. “I think he got it wrong a week ago Tuesday, in regards to Charlottesville,” Palatucci said, referring to the president. Some attending the meeting expressed astonishment that the party had found itself in the position where it was forced to defend itself against accusations of racism. “It’s amazing that we have been lured into this argument that we’re not racists. It’s absurd,” said Colorado Republican chairman Jeff Hays. “Why would we feel compelled to do that?” But some stood by the “many sides” comment Trump made in the immediate aftermath of the clashes, “The president was not wrong to point out what the media has failed to point out” – that counter-protesters also “came for a battle” in Charlottesville, Pennsylvania Republican Chairman Val DiGiorgio claimed to Reuters. Most impartial witnesses agreed the anti-fascists fought back in self-defense. The Guardian’s Jason Wilson, who was there, wrote: “There was violence from some counter-protesters. But most, like Heather Heyer, who was allegedly killed by one of the far-right marchers, were entirely peaceful.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/blog/2017/aug/25/team-sky-bus-race-hub-cycling-vuelta-espana","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-25T16:21:10Z","webTitle":"Team Sky’s magic bus an unnecessary flexing of their financial muscle | Richard Williams","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2017/aug/25/team-sky-bus-race-hub-cycling-vuelta-espana","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/blog/2017/aug/25/team-sky-bus-race-hub-cycling-vuelta-espana","fields":{"headline":"Team Sky’s magic bus an unnecessary flexing of their financial muscle","bodyText":"In these troubled days, we’re learning that you can watch a bad thing developing in front of your eyes, in real time, and yet feel utterly powerless to stop it. Fill in the blank with your own choice of contemporary socio-political phenomenon. But it can happen at a much more modest level, too, even in something as essentially trivial as sport. Which is how we come to the appearance of Team Sky’s “race hub” at the Vuelta a España. The race hub is a large articulated vehicle decorated with the team’s logo and those of its various sponsors. It travels each day from one stage finish to another, where it is reconfigured – a little like a Transformer toy – into a two-storey building complete with facilities for (to quote from the official announcement) “communal eating, team briefings, pre- and post-race relaxation” and “guest hospitality and media”. The mention of using it to host media activities was a touch amusing since it came from the team who, during the Tour de France, ducked out of the leader’s traditional commitment to giving interviews to the print media on the two rest days, citing higher priorities – although more probably motivated by a desire to avoid uncomfortable questions about Jiffy bags and therapeutic use exemptions. But any complaints from the media are minor compared to the negative implications for Sky’s rivals. A contraption like the race hub does not come cheap. Apparently this one has been hired rather than bought but the expense even of renting one is still something most other teams would rather not have to contemplate at a time when sponsorship funding is hard to find. Dave Brailsford’s team are fortunate to have the annual budget of £25m or so provided by Sky, thanks to James Murdoch’s continuing enthusiasm for the sport, and no one can say they have failed to give value for the investment. But other teams in the Vuelta are having to put out similar nine-man lineups with a fraction of those resources. They will not be impressed by the latest escalation of a technical arms race triggered on Sky’s initial appearance in 2010, when they turned up for their first Tour de France with a fleet of sleek Jaguar cars for the use of their sporting directors and mechanics, instead of the humbler but perfectly adequate Skodas issued by the Tour’s sponsors. Others immediately felt the need to match the gesture. A year later, for instance, the Schleck brothers’ Leopard-Trek outfit arrived with a fleet of Mercedes. All this – like the creation of the Sky riders’ luxury coach, known to the peloton’s satirists as the Death Star, with its individual ergonomically designed seats and its special washing facilities and its compartments for personalised mattresses and pillows to be taken from hotel to hotel – is perfectly legitimate. If you have the budget, why should anyone prevent you from spending it as creatively as possible, choosing your equipment in order to give your riders and staff the best chance to perform at their maximum? But Sky went too far at the 2015 Giro d’Italia, when their team leader for the race, Richie Porte, was given his own mobile home in which to sleep at night instead of being quartered with the rest of the team at a hotel of the organisers’ choosing throughout the three-week race. That, too, is a logical and imaginative way of spending money in order to optimise a rider’s chances and Sky made it known they planned to extend the practice. But for once, thank goodness, the sport’s governing body moved quickly and decisively, banning the use of mobile homes and insisting all teams followed the normal procedure. If the riders have to put up with the occasional somewhat iffy accommodation, then that is a small price for maintaining the practice of treating each team as equally as possible. It also preserves a link with the sport’s more rustic past. The advent of the race hub revives another source of resentment, one provoked by Sky’s existing fleet of coaches and cars. This is the eternal battle for parking space on the Tour, always at a premium and particularly when the race starts or finishes, as it often does, in a village or a small town. If all 20 teams turned up with a Sky-sized caravan of vehicles, there would be chaos most days. In effect, what Brailsford and Sky are doing, on and off the course, is dehumanising the sport of cycling, eradicating the traditional informality and erasing the unpredictability that made it so cherishable when compared with, say, Formula One. And it is no accident the inspiration for the race hub comes from F1, to which teams such as McLaren – in the days when it enjoyed lavish funding from Vodafone – and Red Bull introduced multi-storey mobile hospitality centres of staggering cost and ostentation. The need to accommodate these complex monstrosities did much to explain why a much-loved circuit like Imola, with its cramped paddock, became unacceptable to those for whom entertaining VIPs in a luxury environment is the top priority on a race weekend. Brailsford could plausibly claim his approach is in harmony with the evolution of the sport, where youngish investment bankers and hedge-fund managers have turned their backs on golf, the favoured pastime of their elders, the Trump generation. Instead of upgrading their irons every year, they line up to pay £10,000 for a bike. (I saw one priced at £14k in a shop just outside London last week – and someone will buy it.) The consequence is some people are making a lot of money. A few months ago a majority stake in Pinarello, Sky’s bike supplier, an Italian firm with a traditional artisan background, was sold to a private equity firm part-owned by the Louis Vuitton luxury-goods conglomerate. Last month two heirs to the Walmart retail empire paid £200m for Rapha, Sky’s first clothing supplier. Founded in London 12 years ago, Rapha symbolises the up-market direction of the cycling boom in the UK and elsewhere: its chamois cream is scented with herbs from the lower slopes of Mont Ventoux. Nobody can justifiably complain about any of that but it’s important cycling retains its historical essence: the romantic, impossible-to-buy qualities that made the people who fork out for high-end bikes and clothing fall in love with it in the first place. All those fans, old and new, who line the roadside when the big race goes by are not there to applaud an articulated hospitality unit."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"cities/2017/sep/07/barcelona-photographer-symmetry-facades-instagram-in-pictures","type":"article","sectionId":"cities","sectionName":"Cities","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-07T12:11:09Z","webTitle":"Patterns of Barcelona: photographer captures symmetry of city facades – in pictures","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2017/sep/07/barcelona-photographer-symmetry-facades-instagram-in-pictures","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/cities/2017/sep/07/barcelona-photographer-symmetry-facades-instagram-in-pictures","fields":{"headline":"Patterns of Barcelona: photographer captures symmetry of city facades – in pictures","bodyText":"Barcelona is known for its iconic landmarks, but Roc Isern turns his camera to buildings others may tend to look past. Isern is a technical architect and photographer based in the Catalan capital. Since 2014, he has been capturing the facades of Barcelona’s buildings for tens of thousands of followers on Instagram at @barcelonafacades. Cropped to exclude context, the minimalist imagery presents the different textures and patterns of the city’s architecture. “I’m interested in geometrical shapes, patterns, colours and shadows, and obsessed with symmetries and perspective,” he says. He believes Barcelona’s different districts offer a varied urban style and an “inexhaustible source of possibilities”, allowing him to discover new areas through photography. Isern is a self-taught photographer and says there has been a learning curve in creating a visual style. “I’ve always loved the straight facade shots, but when I started on Instagram I wasn’t sufficiently dominating the technique to take and edit good photos.” The trick lies in taking the photo as perpendicular as possible to the building’s facade, and making sure the frame is free of obstacles such as cables, trees and street lights. “The most visible and accessible part of the architecture are the facades, and if they are shown through photography with sensitivity and good taste, they offer a great reward,” he says.

Think again","bodyText":"Self-driving cars feel like they should provide a nice juicy target for hackers. After all, a normal car has a driver with their hands on the wheel and feet on the pedals. Common sense suggests this provides a modicum of protection against a car takeover which a self-driving car, or even one with just the sort of assisted driving features already found on the road today, lacks. But that’s the wrong way round, says Craig Smith, a security researcher and car hacker. “One interesting thing about fully self-driving cars is they’re unintentionally more secure, which is really not what you would expect at all.” Alongside his day job as the head of transportation research at security firm Rapid7, Smith runs the Car Hacking Village at Defcon, the world’s largest hacking convention, in Las Vegas. Spend any time there, and you’ll start giving sideways glances to anything weird your car does. Now in its third year, the village is the nexus of a community capable of remotely hacking into a Jeep to cut the brakes and fooling a Tesla’s autopilot into thinking there’s a phantom pillar in front of it. At first automotive manufacturers saw hackers the way much of the world still does: irritations at best, and hardened criminals at worst, maliciously trying to break their products and endanger the world. These days attitudes have softened , with hackers seen as potential allies, or at least uneasy partners, in the war against cybercrime. The bugs that let hackers into a car are there from the start; it’s better if someone like Smith finds them rather than an unscrupulous gangster who wants to start experimenting with in-car ransomware. The most obvious example of the thawing of attitudes was a Mazda 2 rolled in by the Japanese carmaker for the denizens of Defcon to have their way with. But it’s only halfway there, Smith warns: “I like that Mazda’s here, but everybody has a lot of work to do in this particular field, in terms of being more open about their stuff.” Mazdas are good cars to learn from, he explains, because all the electronic systems send instructions around the car through one bottleneck, the high-speed bus. In most cars, the bus is reserved for the most safety critical messages, such as steering or braking, meaning it’s not really the sort of thing you want to mess around with. But you can learn how the bus works by fiddling with something as mundane as the windscreen wiper commands on a Mazda. Those sorts of considerations still form the bread and butter of car hacking research right now. The inner workings of most cars are obfuscated, complex and locked up, leaving researchers struggling to even understand what an in-car computer looks like when it’s working, let alone how to start pushing the boundaries of what it can do. Obscurity might bring safety for a while, but it also renders security research expensive and time-consuming. The really dangerous flaws are likely to be discovered, not by hobbyist researchers, but by those who stand to make money from hacking. One of the biggest stories from the sector in 2015 and 2016 was the hacking of a Jeep. In 2015, two researchers from IOActive discovered a way to hack their way from the internet-connected entertainment system of the car into the low-level system which controls the vehicle. That let them send commands to brake or steer the car wirelessly prompting a mass recall of affected models. In 2016 the pair presented an update at Defcon that illustrated just how much more they could have done after slowly reverse engineering the Jeep’s low-level system. They went from only being able to break control the car when it was travelling less than 5 miles per hour, for instance, to being able to control the speed of the car at will. That distinction is also why Smith is counterintuitively optimistic about the future of cars, as they move from human- to computer-controlled. Smith explains: “The way cars work today is you have a few sensors. You can see how they work in a lot of commercials: a car is backing up, or parking, it sees a kid in a driveway, and it stops. “You have one signal coming in, saying ‘I see an object, stop the car’. It’s a computer overriding a human. The human is saying ‘I’m going to drive, I’m giving it gas’, and not only is it ignoring it, the car is doing the opposite of what the human says. ‘That’s nice, I’m going to stop’.” Those signals are sent through that same low-level system that hackers have been penetrating for years. It is called the Can bus, short for Controller Area Network. It’s generally the case that once a hacker has access to it, the rest of the game is largely reverse-engineering what signals are sent when. As one security engineer for a major car firm joked, “it’s called the can bus, not the can’t bus, because once you’ve got access to it, there’s nothing you can’t do”. Smith explains that from a hacker’s point of view having just one sensor makes it much easier to fake a signal or event to fool the car into doing something. But self-driving cars are, by and large, smarter. Smith said: “In a self-driving world, fully self-driving, they have to use lots of different sensors.” That’s because simple proximity-detection doesn’t cut it if you need a car to drive in different conditions and through different streetswithout human intervention. How, for example, do you tell the difference between a pile of leaves lying in the road – safe to drive through – and a child who has fallen off their bike? No single-reading depth detector can tell you that. “Each of the sensors used in autonomous driving comes to solve another part of the sensing challenge,” said Danny Atsmon, the head of self-driving vehicle testing company Cognata, who explained that cameras on autonomous cars have been confused by an RV with an image of a landscape on it or by a car with a picture of a bike. “Lidar can not sense glass, radar senses mainly metal and the camera can be fooled by images, hence, the industry decided on a sensor redundancy and sensor fusion approach to solve that, but each of the edge cases that we present here raises the bar,” said Atsmon. That fusion of sensor doesn’t just help get a better picture of the world, it also, accidentally, solves part of the security problem. “The interesting thing that happens is that each sensor doesn’t trust the other,” Smith says. The radar no longer has the ability to bring the car to a juddering halt, for instance, because the camera and Lidar might overrule its findings. To convincingly fake all the systems at once, you can’t just feed in a few false signals: you have to model an entirely fictitious world. “It’s way closer to the way humans figure out whether something is an illusion or not. And that’s harder for a hacker to deal with. Even the most secure corporate networks tend not to take that sort of approach: once you’re in the secure zone, they assume you’re one of the good guys.” The future won’t be a hack-free heaven. Software is complex, mistakes happen, and there are other ways to sneak through the code of self-driving cars – even if that entails hacking, not the car, but the world itself. Take the researchers who printed fake Stop signs that are readable by a human but not a car. But it looks like sitting in a car controlled by a computer may at least be safer than sitting in a car that thinks it’s controlled by you. That’s certainly true in my case. I can’t drive. The sooner this stuff gets solved, the better."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2017/aug/25/police-budget-cuts-to-reduce-face-to-face-visits","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-25T15:12:42Z","webTitle":"Met police cuts will mean fewer face-to-face visits, says senior officer","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/aug/25/police-budget-cuts-to-reduce-face-to-face-visits","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2017/aug/25/police-budget-cuts-to-reduce-face-to-face-visits","fields":{"headline":"Met police cuts will mean fewer face-to-face visits, says senior officer","bodyText":"Police will increasingly have to prioritise whom they respond to in person as budget cuts bite deeper and deeper over the next few years, a senior officer in the country’s largest force has said. The Met police’s deputy commissioner, Craig Mackey, said Scotland Yard would probably have to concentrate on the more vulnerable as the number of officers at its disposal fell. He said elderly people, as well as people with learning difficulties and those who did not have a strong grasp of English, would be more likely to be assessed as in need of a face-to-face visit from an officer. He added that certain types of crime, such as burglaries, would usually elicit a response in person. With cases such as vehicle crime, however, the vulnerability of the victim was likely to be taken into account. “It’s absolutely feasible as we go forward that, if my neighbour is a vulnerable elderly person who has experienced a particular type of crime, that she gets a face-to-face service that I don’t get. So we triage things … we assess people’s vulnerability,” Mackey told the Evening Standard. “Vulnerability can manifest itself in a number of ways: people with learning difficulties, a whole range of things, some people for whom English isn’t a first language. That’s about how we get those resources focused on the things you can make a difference with. But also, as we go forward [and] as demand grows, you have to have a way of controlling and triaging.” He said that, as the number of officers fell, police would get into “difficult areas” as they had to decide whether to offer the same service to everyone. Mackey said: “Increasingly, as we go forward we will look at things like trying to assess people and crime on the sort of the threat, the harm, the risk, and people’s vulnerability.” Police forces across the UK have been highlighting the risks associated with failing to provide proper funding. In June, Merseyside police’s chief constable, Andy Cooke, warned that planned budgets cuts could mean reports of lesser crimes would not receive a response as staffing was “stretched to the limits”. He told the Liverpool Echo he had “never known a situation where Merseyside police officers have been pushed to the limit in dealing with everything we need to deal with to keep our communities safe”. Under threat of further cuts after an almost £100m reduction already imposed, Cooke said he feared the public would see “a significant reduction in the service offered to them”. Police Scotland officers have become less visible to the public as a result of budget cuts, a report this month by the Scottish Institute for Policing Research said. According to the Daily Telegraph, the report found concerns among officers that they were becoming “increasingly stretched over larger geographic areas”. Mackey indicated that the number of Met police officers, which stands at about 30,700, was likely to fall to about 30,000 next year as the force deals with an expected £400m real terms budget cut as a result of inflation. “It’s almost impossible to predict beyond that.” He said that, under those circumstances, the key was to “maximise what you’ve got”. Mackey said that some jobs could be saved if buildings owned by the Met could be sold. And he stressed: “Nothing in this changes when people ring us and say: ‘Please, please come.’ That 999 service is absolutely not changing. “The reality is that the core part of the service, that there’s an emergency, please come quick, is what we all joined policing to do, to protect and to make sure it’s the best we can possibly do.” A Home Office spokesperson said: “Every victim of crime deserves a good service from the police, regardless of their circumstances. We expect the crimes reported to them to be taken seriously, investigated thoroughly and, wherever possible, the perpetrators brought to justice. “That is one of the reasons why this government has protected overall police spending in real terms in a fair funding deal and why we are currently engaging with forces about the demands they are facing.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2017/aug/27/rough-night-review-faux-feminist-gags-scarlett-johansson","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-27T07:00:01Z","webTitle":"Rough Night review – faux-feminist gags fall flat","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/aug/27/rough-night-review-faux-feminist-gags-scarlett-johansson","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2017/aug/27/rough-night-review-faux-feminist-gags-scarlett-johansson","fields":{"headline":"Rough Night review – faux-feminist gags fall flat","bodyText":"This gender-swap of Peter Berg’s 1998 film Very Bad Things is a Very Bad Thing indeed.

Laurent Koscielny, the defensive linchpin, has certainly been missed. The focus for the travelling support will be Alexis Sánchez, the unsettled forward, who continues to exist in the eye of a storm and is primed – following extended leave, a bout of man flu and an abdominal strain – to get his first action in Arsenal colours since May. More on him later. But the parallel comeback story involves Koscielny and, in the context of Arsenal’s season-opening defensive performance in the 4-3 home win over Leicester City and the shoddiness that precipitated the 1-0 defeat at Stoke City, it is no less significant; at least, in technical terms. When Koscielny stretched into a 14th-minute challenge on Everton’s Enner Valencia on the final day of last season’s Premier League, he thought he would get the ball. He did not and the consequences have been brutal. The red card brought a three-match ban that ruled him out of Arsenal’s FA Cup triumph over Chelsea. But it would cast long shadows over his pre-season and torpedo his start to the new campaign. Knowing Koscielny would be missing against Leicester and Stoke, Arsène Wenger decided to omit him from the Community Shield penalty shootout win over Chelsea, reasoning it was more urgent to get other defenders up to speed. The manager had left him out of three of the club’s other six pre-season friendlies. “It’s been very hard for Laurent because I didn’t even consider him for friendly games, because I had to play some defenders,” Wenger said. “What hurt him a lot was to miss the Cup final. “He had a reaction against Everton that was unlucky. He’s a very quiet guy and sometimes he can get rushed. He always thinks he has the speed to win the tackle and, in this case, he didn’t. I think we lost the game at Stoke because, defensively, we gave a cheap goal away. It’s good to have him back.” There was hysteria in some quarters after the Stoke result but Wenger has been keen to point out it was only Arsenal’s second defeat in 13 matches, including the Community Shield. They have won the other 11. With Koscielny restored at Anfield, Wenger hopes to benefit from his pace and organisational prowess while he will carry an additional threat on attacking set pieces. Koscielny faces a test of his mentality after such a frustrating period and so, too, does Sánchez, albeit for different reasons. His focus, understandably, has been questioned, given his refusal to extend his contract at Arsenal – which has less than one year to run – and his desire to leave, with Manchester City his destination of choice. The Liverpool midfielder Philippe Coutinho submitted a transfer request in an attempt to force a transfer to Barcelona whereas Sánchez has not gone down that route. Yet he has been after the same thing. No one at Arsenal is under any illusions about what Sánchez wants and even Wenger has not attempted to sell the club’s decision to hold him to the final year of his deal as anything to do with the player’s wishes. The best slant Wenger could offer before the Liverpool game was to agree Sánchez had the opportunity to leave fans with some positive memories from his final year. “What is good is that our mutual interest is he does well for us,” Wenger said. “On top of that, I deeply feel he loves to be here, he loves the club. He arrives at the age of 28 and he looks at the quality of his contract but I think he deeply loves to be here.” In the corresponding fixture at Anfield in March, Wenger took the decision to drop Sánchez to the substitutes’ bench in the wake of his involvement in a training ground bust-up – when, coincidentally, he clashed with Koscielny. Wenger insisted it had been a tactical move; that he wanted to play a more direct game up to Olivier Giroud and Danny Welbeck in order to get past the Liverpool pressing game. He was fooling no one. Sánchez came on at half-time and laid on Welbeck’s goal for 2-1 but Arsenal would lose 3-1. How Wenger would love to see him have a similar impact this time, whether he starts him or uses him off the bench. “When Alexis is in the squad, he can score a goal for you and that is always good for morale,” Wenger said. What has sustained Wenger in terms of the Sánchez situation and the club’s stance on it is the Chilean’s innate fighting spirit. Whenever he steps on to a field, he wants to play; he wants to win. Everything else is forgotten. In this summer of the sulky player, Wenger feels Sánchez is somehow different. “It is difficult for me to know about the individual cases [at other clubs] but, sometimes, players have been promised things that have not been kept to,” Wenger said. “I can only tell you what happens here, and Alexis works hard and is focused to play. In a professional job, I always think you have to make sure with your commitment that the guy who pays you gets what he is paying you for. Alexis is in that mode and I think he will be until the last day he is here. He will give his best.” Inevitably, Wenger veered on to the subject of financial imperatives. The sporting decision to retain Sánchez, he said, had been “easy” but it also involved a “financial sacrifice” for the club – in terms of the potential for lost transfer fees. With Mesut Özil and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain also out of contract next summer and standing to leave as free agents, it was put to Wenger the club could pass up north of £100m in fees. “It’s still not a Mbappé, no?” Wenger replied, with a nod towards Monaco’s Kylian Mbappé who, he said, had been mentioned in the €180m bracket. “But I agree that it’s a financial sacrifice for the club. You have to calculate what you can afford and what you can’t afford.” So, could Arsenal afford to take such hits? “Er, I’ll let you know later,” Wenger said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"politics/2017/aug/25/viscount-jailed-gina-miller-threats-drops-appeal-sentence","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-25T12:03:57Z","webTitle":"Viscount who was jailed over Gina Miller threats drops his appeal","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/aug/25/viscount-jailed-gina-miller-threats-drops-appeal-sentence","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/aug/25/viscount-jailed-gina-miller-threats-drops-appeal-sentence","fields":{"headline":"Viscount who was jailed over Gina Miller threats drops his appeal","bodyText":"The man jailed for offering £5,000 to anyone willing to kill Gina Miller, whose court victory forced the government to consult parliament over Brexit, has dropped his appeal over his 12-week sentence. The 4th Viscount St Davids, Rhodri Philipps, was sentenced on 13 July for “extreme racial abuse” of Miller and another man in a series of Facebook posts, having been convicted of sending malicious communications. On Friday, he dropped his appeal after being warned his sentence could be increased if he continued and was ultimately unsuccessful. Philipps served only five days of his jail term before being released on bail while his appeal was pending. Deborah Taylor, the recorder of Westminster sitting at Southwark crown court, said: “In those circumstances the sentence which was imposed at magistrates courts in full will [re]commence from today.” Philipps initially planned to appeal against his conviction and was granted bail until his case could be heard. He dropped that appeal on 1 August but, until Friday, still planned to attempt to get his sentence reduced. During the hearing at Southwark, his barrister, Oliver Blunt QC, told the judge: “Despite the number of character references and medical reports which my lady has been kind enough to indicate that you and your fellow judges have read in detail, and will no doubt have been moved by the aspects of the material contained within and the sentiments of the more positive aspects of this appellant’s character, the appeal against sentence is abandoned.” On top of his return to jail and the £865 he was ordered to pay in compensation, surcharge and costs at his sentencing, Philipps was ordered to pay a further £500 in costs at the abandonment of his appeal. He was convicted over online racist attacks on Miller, who was born in Guyana, and another man, Cameroon-born Arnold Sube. Miller had said the abuse was “genuinely shocking” and left her feeling “violated” and “very scared for the safety of herself and her family”. She had been “subject of a vicious hate campaign and vilified on social media outlets”, as well as “racial and offensive personal slurs”, according to a statement read by Philip Stott, the prosecutor at Philipps’ trial. Stott said: “In addition to finding it offensive, racist and hateful, [Miller] was extremely concerned that someone would threaten to have her run over for a bounty. He added that Miller “took the threat seriously, and it contributed to her employing professional security for her protection”. Referring to the Brexit campaigner shortly after her court victory, Philipps had offered “£5,000 for the first person to ‘accidentally’ run over this bloody troublesome first-generation immigrant”. He also called her a “boat jumper”, adding: “If this is what we should expect from immigrants, send them back to their stinking jungles.” Sentencing him, senior district judge Emma Arbuthnot said: “Why public figures deserve this warped behaviour is beyond me.” She said he had displayed hatred by “publicly directing abuse at others, which is a criminal offence in this multicultural society we are fortunate to live in”. She accepted Philipps’ apology, delivered in mitigation after his conviction, but said she found it difficult to believe he had changed his views on race in such a short space of time."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2017/aug/27/eu-not-enemy-of-state-labour-think-again-brexit","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-27T06:00:02Z","webTitle":"The EU is not the enemy of the state.

Time to think again on Brexit","bodyText":"When I referred in my last column to Chancellor Philip Hammond as the only grown-up minister in this chaotic cabinet, I was unaware that he had just put his name to a joint article in the pro-Brexit Sunday Telegraph with his arch-foe Liam Fox, making the following statement: “We respect the will of the British people – in March 2019 the United Kingdom will leave the European Union. We will leave the customs union… we will leave the single market… ” True, this was followed by reports that he wanted, in effect, to retain quasi-membership for several years, but the two emphasised that such a precaution “cannot be a back door to staying in the EU”. There were also reports that Hammond had in some mysterious way scored a victory, which contrasted vividly with other reports that his attempt at some kind of coup had been foiled. Certainly, what he put his name to in that article was not good news for those of us who firmly believe it is not too late to arrest the progress of Brexit in its tracks. But then the shenanigans in the present cabinet’s approach to Brexit negotiations call to mind the Queen in Through the looking-glass telling Alice: “Sometimes I’ve believed as many as six impossible things before breakfast.” The fact of the matter is that this government is so unstable that anything could happen in the next two months. It is an open secret that up to half a dozen members of the cabinet, and at least one double-breasted outsider, are metaphorically polishing their daggers. As my colleague Andrew Rawnsley has pointed out, the only thing holding up a revolt against Theresa May is fear that, by precipitating yet another election, the assassins might end up with Jeremy Corbyn in Downing Street. But Shakespeare’s “vaulting ambition” is a powerful factor in politics, and there are those who wonder how Theresa May can survive the party conference in October unscathed. Which brings us to the Labour party’s position on Brexit, which most people seem to regard as every bit as confused as the Conservative one. It is generally assumed that the problem with Jeremy Corbyn’s lukewarm opposition to Brexit during the referendum was that he is a lifelong Eurosceptic and thinks the EU is a capitalist conspiracy against workers. But most enlightened Labour MPs and trade unionists are more aware than Corbyn seems to be that the EU is in fact very strong on workers’ rights. As for Corbyn’s apparent fear that the EU is the enemy of publicly owned corporations, he must surely be aware of the degree to which so many of our so-called “privatised” utilities and much of our transport network are already in the hands of continental state-owned concerns. It seems to me that Labour now has a golden opportunity to capitalise on the strong pro-European feelings of the young, as manifested in recent surveys and, indeed, in the last election. In which context, there was a powerful open letter not long ago to Corbyn in his (and my) local paper, the Islington Tribune, from a longtime Labour party member, Michael Wolff. He told Corbyn: “Despite your current popularity, your ambiguity about the EU and that sense that you are out of step with our nation’s youth on Brexit won’t keep the momentum you’ve created rolling in your favour.” The message was epitomised in the headline: “My message to Jeremy: Don’t let our young people down, burst the Brexit bubble.” For those of us who care more about this nation than the Brexiters, the situation is urgent. Professor Vernon Bogdanor at King’s College, London, maintains that Labour’s electoral gains in June “raise the question of whether the decision in the 2016 referendum is final: for, although Labour was not a Remain party this year, the British Election Study found that the party’s ‘soft Brexit’ policy played a large part in its substantial gain in votes. In constituencies where over 55% voted Remain, the party achieved a swing of around 7%.” Bogdanor concludes that “the election was the revenge of the Remainers”. The state of our nation is pitiful enough without the addition of self-inflicted damage. The hospitals, the care homes, the rail service – too many services are, to adapt May’s phrase, “just about managing”. This is bad enough, but the economy has slowed down as well: as the economist Simon Wren-Lewis points out, the slowdown was at first aggravated in 2015 and 2016 by the continuing austerity policy, but more recently has been hit by the impact on real incomes of the Brexit-induced devaluation of the pound. Now, in theory one of the few benefits of that depreciation should have been a rebalancing towards exports, and some surveys suggest that export orders are rising. But, as Wren-Lewis says, so far the depreciation “has not led to any compensating increase in exports because firms are not going to expand markets that might soon disappear because of leaving the single market or customs union”. We are coming up to the 50th anniversary of the devaluation of the pound under Harold Wilson in 1967. Then as now, commentators worried that for a long time the trade balance was not improving. Then they discovered the “J-curve” – the immediate effect had been to worsen the balance of payments by making imports dearer and exports cheaper. But eventually the improvement in price competitiveness led to a better trade performance. But I am with Wren-Lewis: this time, any J-curve effects are likely to be offset by the deleterious impact of Brexit if our political leaders do not have the gumption to tell the electorate it made a grave mistake in last year’s referendum.

Martin’s archive was first deposited at the Cushing library at Texas A&amp;M University in 1993 – three years before A Game of Thrones, the first novel in his A Song of Ice and Fire series, was published. Today it runs to more than 300 boxes of notes, manuscripts and papers and more than 1,300 books. Now the university’s chancellor, John Sharp, is encouraging students and members of the public to look through the archive. “The papers and hand-written notes by George RR Martin possibly could contain clues about upcoming storylines, and anyone is welcome to search for themselves,” Sharp said. “Whether you’re developing fan theories or just want to take the opportunity to see Martin’s fantasy writing in its rawest form, A&amp;M’s library staff are happy to show off a true treasure of modern literature.” Game of Thrones, the popular HBO television series based on Martin’s books, has now extended its storylines well beyond those written by Martin. Last month, the author said that the sixth book in the series, The Winds of Winter, could be published next year. This week, he told Metro US that: “several times the plot has led me to a dead end, from where there is no way out. I had to go back and rewrite everything again.” He also revealed that “about 20” of the characters who “are killed right and left” in the television adaptation remain “quite alive to me and will appear in a new book”. Pressed on his writing speed, Martin said that he had not slowed down. “I was working on the first book for six years and four years on the second one. Fantasists who release their novels every year, do not offer books of large volume. These are not 1,500 pages like mine, but, for example, 500,” he said. “In addition, I have not become younger. Age does not add enthusiasm.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"music/2017/aug/25/prom-53-charles-mingus-revisited-review-starry-tribute-to-jazz-revolutionary","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-25T12:00:24Z","webTitle":"Prom 53: Charles Mingus Revisited review – starry tribute to jazz revolutionary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/aug/25/prom-53-charles-mingus-revisited-review-starry-tribute-to-jazz-revolutionary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2017/aug/25/prom-53-charles-mingus-revisited-review-starry-tribute-to-jazz-revolutionary","fields":{"headline":"Prom 53: Charles Mingus Revisited review – starry tribute to jazz revolutionary","bodyText":"Miles Davis famously opined that the history of jazz in his era could be told in four words: Louis Armstrong, Charlie Parker. He might also have included himself, Ornette Coleman, John Coltrane – and Charles Mingus. Mingus was the gospel-rooted and classically influenced composer and virtuoso bassist who transformed structure for bigger jazz lineups in the 1950s and 60s, and set alight revolutions in jazz-fuelled orchestral methods that are still burning. The Proms has paid tribute to his legacy, using the title of Mingus’s incandescent 1971 autobiography, Beneath the Underdog. The night featured a starry crop of international soloists and the Netherlands’ genre-bridging Metropole Orkest, under Jules Buckley’s direction. The show opened with the spirited Boogie Stop Shuffle, and established the gleaming tone and shapely, spontaneous pacing of the young American trumpet star Christian Scott, one of the five principal soloists. The early stages of the concert brought sophisticated orchestral jazz – from rippling ballads to swaggering swingers – that was creatively rearranged but short on Mingus’s capricious musical curveballs and belligerent drive. But the storm clouds of low strings and spooky brass squeals that introduced the quietly eloquent singer Kandace Springs, performing the 1946 composition Weird Nightmare, set more ambiguous implications loose, which were patiently developed in a bass clarinet solo of sonorous twists by British saxophonist Shabaka Hutchings. Scott, along with the melodically mischievous Orkest trombonist Bart van Lier and the hard-rocking American baritone saxist Leo Pellegrino, then delivered a roaring account of the uptempo 1959 classic Gunslinging Bird, and in the second half a dissonantly jangling Fables of Faubus. Springs gave a delicate if faintly overawed account of Duke Ellington’s Sound of Love, and cheers erupted for a stop-time jam between Van Lier, Scott and Hutchings on the punchy blues Hora Decubitus (formerly E’s Flat, Ah’s Flat Too). The gospel-wailing Better Git It in Your Soul was the turn-it-up-to-11 finale – showcasing the scarlet-haired Pellegrino’s hook-punctuated sax playing and busker’s line in simultaneous pirouettes, knee-trembles and high kicks. The notoriously short-fused Mingus might well have been tempted to land an educative left hook on Pellegrino before the young saxophonist managed to turn the last stages of a tribute gig into his own show – but by accident or design, the newcomer did emphasise the joyous impulsiveness of an American musical giant often characterised as only a tortured genius. • On BBC 4 on 25 August.

In all other respects the game is the same, but with fewer professional egos competing for Ayoade’s space, it’s a slightly less stressful watch. The Watson family comprises mother Fiona, 22-year-old twins Becca and Catriona, 21-year-old Paul (“That’s too soon,” says Ayoade, looking pained on Fiona’s behalf. “Too soon”) and 25-year-old Chris (Ayoade approves – “That’s a decent buffer”). They are an impressive lot. Through the mental and physical challenges in the Aztec, industrial and futuristic zones they go, picking up crystals as easily as breathing until Fiona panics during a dominoes/synonyms game (“That’s words that mean similar things,” says Ayoade to the camera. “I’ve been asked to provide that definition by Channel 4, who don’t believe in you”), swiftly followed by Paul running out of time during his task and suffering a lock-in. “This is a long period of disappointment for a family show,” points out their host. As with the original series, it stands or falls by how much you enjoy the presenter’s way. I always found Richard O’Brien too cold and creepy, and enjoy Ayoade’s ironically, bemusedly detached bystander approach much more. This may simply be a function of my greater age – it would be easy to understand anyone’s antipathy towards his frequent puncturing of the fantasy bubble in which the Maze works best. The games are still inventive, fun and just complicated enough to provide the moment of bafflement that makes their eventual resolution (usually) so satisfactory. Designer Peter Gordon has retained the Heath Robinson-esque quality that always got your adventure glands juicing and made you long to climb into the screen and have a go yourself. Catriona was elected to play the final game, which turned out to depend on riddles. Catriona couldn’t do riddles, her family said at once. In this they were entirely correct. They ended up winning a VIP experience at York Dungeon (“including guidebook!” said Ayoade, momentarily channelling the spirit of Les Dawson on Blankety Blank), which was a reward exactly in keeping with the low-tech, make-your-own-fun vibe of this homegrown, still charming show."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/aug/25/png-tells-australia-it-cant-leave-manus-asylum-seekers-behind-report","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-25T10:10:00Z","webTitle":"PNG tells Australia it can't leave Manus Island asylum seekers behind – report","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/aug/25/png-tells-australia-it-cant-leave-manus-asylum-seekers-behind-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/aug/25/png-tells-australia-it-cant-leave-manus-asylum-seekers-behind-report","fields":{"headline":"PNG tells Australia it can't leave Manus Island asylum seekers behind – report","bodyText":"The new Papua New Guinea government is reportedly refusing to allow Australia to close the Manus Island detention centre, leaving behind hundreds of asylum seekers, by its vaunted deadline in October. The newly sworn-in attorney general, Davis Steven, has told Australia’s high commissioner that his government had not agreed to a 31 October closure, as flagged by Australia before the PNG election, the ABC reports. Steven said the Australian government had not explained its deadline or what lay ahead for men in the centre, whose prospects of resettlement in the United States under a deal with Australia remain unclear. PNG was “not going to allow a situation where Australia has withdrawn and leaves behind all these international fugitives who they expect us to carry on our steam”, Steven said. “It’s not going to happen,” he said. The detention centre’s ultimate closure was guaranteed when the PNG supreme court ruled the men inside had been illegally detained. But Steven said Australia and PNG “really need to come up with a clear understanding on the transition and how we manage the aftermath of the withdrawal”. He also said as the “chief legal adviser to government, I have not sighted a formal document that confirms that date has been mutually agreed”. Australia, which runs the facility – one of two overseas it uses to detain asylum seekers who have tried to reach Australia by boat – had been asked to halt moves to shut it down until the PNG government’s next national executive council meeting, Steven said. About 700 of the men inside have been found to be refugees but it is unclear whether they will be able to resettle in the United States in a “swap” deal with Australia. The US president, Donald Trump, has promised “extreme vetting” of the asylum seekers detained by Australia. In a highly publicised phone call with the Australian prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, Trump was urged to stick to the deal by assessing the asylum seekers but with no obligation to accept them, according to a leaked transcript."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"membership/live/2017/aug/26/weekend-reading-us-gazes-at-eclipse-while-uk-looks-to-norway","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"membership","sectionName":"Membership","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-26T07:00:29Z","webTitle":"Weekend reading: US gazes at eclipse while UK looks to Norway","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/membership/live/2017/aug/26/weekend-reading-us-gazes-at-eclipse-while-uk-looks-to-norway","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/membership/live/2017/aug/26/weekend-reading-us-gazes-at-eclipse-while-uk-looks-to-norway","fields":{"headline":"Weekend reading: US gazes at eclipse while UK looks to Norway","bodyText":"The tragedy of Japan’s tsunami In 2011 a tsunami engulfed Japan’s north-east coast.

But you can be sure that when he mentions in passing that he has accidentally purchased 250 tennis balls, the principle of Chekhov’s gun will hold: those tennis balls are coming for us, probably in the form of one of the unlikely prop gags with which dorky clown Jones is fast making his name. In his previous two shows, performed in character (sort of) as his alter ego The Herbert, Jones’s ramshackle brand of comedy has supplied big laughs but minimal structure or coherence. Here, no longer sure whether he’s in character or not, he delivers his richest show yet. Its story, about Jones being invited to audition for a Steven Spielberg robot movie, furnishes it with a stronger backbone, while our host has dialled down the childlike dorkiness a notch. The Audition is still flamboyantly stoopid: he’s wearing tights and a hunchback, he’s still shaving with honey and playing a ukulele with a battery-operated fan. A dozen or so of those tennis balls have been doctored to make weirdly expressive puppet people. Another, halved and held over the eyes, forms part of a “bank-robbing fish” disguise that turns out to be Jones’ straight-laced brother Adam. But there’s an easier way about this set, a feeling that Jones is happier to be himself and let his jokes breathe. Occasionally, that leaves too much space around the gag: a little speech about how he met his wife and started a family is curiously punchline-free. More often, the laughs keep coming, as Jones rehearses his melodramatic robot speech and conducts a crazy-logic dialogue about “where adults come from” with his infant son. The theme, as ever, is how out of step he is with the world. There’s a song about his insignificance, performed in a mask made from all the screenplays he unsuccessfully auditioned for. But , as ever, the show renews Jones’s commitment to optimistic idiocy. It also contains one of the most purely joyous and funny sequences I’ve seen on the fringe, involving a vibrating platform, a man from the audience and an impromptu Arctic Monkeys singalong. It’s hard to pitch this kind of gleeful gormlessness right, to avoid being cloying or false. Jones nails it here, his put-upon grownup and irrepressible inner child working in harmony to create a lovely hour of madcap comedy. At Heroes @ Monkey Barrel, Edinburgh, until 27 August.

Some residents of Woodside Terrace in Crumlin who believe their health is suffering, or despair at the constant roar of traffic, have welcomed the idea of the houses being razed. Others who have invested money, time and love into their homes hope alternatives such as a bypass or restrictions on lorries might be introduced instead. The Guardian revealed last year that government data showed the levels of nitrogen dioxide on this stretch of the A472 were exceeded only by part of Marylebone Road in central London. Though the spot in Crumlin is surrounded by fields and hills, the road is a main cross-route between two valleys, carrying more than 21,000 vehicles a day. “I’ve had enough,” said Gloria Matthews, a 60-year-old carer who has lived on Woodside Terrace for 17 years. “From 6am to 7pm the cars and lorries and vans rumble by. You can feel the vibrations, you can smell the fumes and you can never open your windows. “It’s got much worse over the years. Some people live in their cellars now to try to get away from the traffic.” The route is busy with local traffic, commuters travelling to Newport and Cardiff and is a shortcut for lorry drivers keen to avoid the M4, which is often congested, and the Severn Bridge tolls of £20 for HGVs. Though HGVs and vans represent only 4% of traffic on the road, they account for more than a third of emissions. The geography of this spot in Caerphilly county exacerbates the problem. Even if the road happens to be clear, the steep hill slows the trucks down to a crawl. And the area is hemmed in by the terrace on one side and a hill on the other so that, especially on a still day, the fumes linger. Barbara Smith moved to the road four months ago but has already put her home back on the market (for offers in the region of £89,950). The estate agent’s website blurb does not mention the road and the only images are of the interior and back garden. Smith said she had invested £3,500 on secondary glazing to counter the effects of the road but it did not solve the problem. “I can’t sleep, I can’t breathe. I want to leave.” A report on the situation has been produced for Caerphilly county borough council and residents have been asked what they would like to happen. Options included in a draft action plan include: • Compulsory purchasing homes on Woodside Terrace and demolishing them. • Building a bypass. • Introducing management measures to help the traffic at least flow more freely. • Working with businesses, schools and other bodies to try to encourage more use of public transport and to walk. • Reducing the number of lorries on the road. Martin Brown has put up homemade signs asking drivers to slow down. He has lived on the road for almost 50 years but he is in favour of compulsory purchase. “My suggestion is to knock them all down,” he said. Deanna Harwick, a mother of two young children, said she could never open her windows, “so at this time of year the house feels pretty airless”. She believes the value of her home has decreased by up to £20,000 since she bought it 10 years ago. “I’m worried I’d lose money if there was a compulsory purchase. I’d favour a bypass,” Harwick said. The Wales Green party said the health of residents was being sacrificed because lorries and cars had been prioritised over people. The party spokesperson for Gwent, Ian Chandler, said: “There are no easy answers to this particular problem. Building a new bypass will move some of the pollution away from the most affected houses, but the initial reduced congestion risks encouraging more traffic to use that route and so the problem returns. “Purchasing and demolishing the homes removes the residents from the problem, but does nothing to reduce overall pollution.” Caerphilly council said it would listen carefully to what residents said they wanted to happen next. Eluned Stenner, a councillor and cabinet member for the environment and public protection, said: “We remain fully committed to doing all we can to help improve the air quality situation, and I’d encourage our residents to contribute their views on the contents of this draft action plan by taking part in this consultation.” Jayne Davies, who has lived on the terrace for 25 years, said she loved her house. “We’ve made a lot of improvements over the years. The road is noisy but it’s lovely out the back, with woods and a stream. So it’s not all bad. “I hope they can find a way to improve the road. Demolition seems too drastic.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2017/aug/27/million-skilled-eu-workers-planning-to-leave-uk-brexit","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-26T23:05:49Z","webTitle":"A million skilled EU workers see their future outside Britain","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/aug/27/million-skilled-eu-workers-planning-to-leave-uk-brexit","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/aug/27/million-skilled-eu-workers-planning-to-leave-uk-brexit","fields":{"headline":"A million skilled EU workers see their future outside Britain","bodyText":"Almost a million EU citizens working in Britain – many of them young, highly qualified and much sought-after by businesses – are either planning to leave the country or have already made up their minds to go as a result of Brexit, a study has found. A survey of 2,000 EU workers in Britain by KPMG, the professional services firm, found that 55% of those with PhDs and 49% of those with postgraduate degrees were either planning to go or were actively considering it. Based on its overall findings, KPMG estimated that a group equivalent to 3.1% of the national workforce – about a million people – now see their future in Britain as over or hanging in the balance. The main reasons given were that they felt “less welcome and valued” post-Brexit, that the UK “is no longer the place that attracted them” and that they are “pro-European and disagree with Brexit”. KMPG’s study, to be published this week, also surveyed 1,000 people in the 10 EU countries judged as most likely to supply labour to the UK. Although it found that Britain remained in the top five most desirable EU countries (behind Germany and Sweden but ahead of Denmark and the Netherlands) in which to work, 49% of those questioned said they felt it was now less desirable than before the referendum in June last year. The findings will reinforce fears of a substantial brain drain and suggests that the loss of talent will hit important sectors such as IT particularly hard. KPMG describes those most likely to leave as “the independent, in-demand, educated and young”. The problem is particularly serious for companies that have relied on young talent, especially at higher-income levels in sectors such as engineering, construction, property, business services, law and IT – 53% of people working in IT said they would leave or were considering doing so. The higher the income bracket the higher the proportion of those thinking of leaving. While 33% of those earning £15,000 to £20,000 were reassessing their future in the UK, 77% of those earning above £200,000 were doing so, KPMG found. The report comes amid mounting evidence of a fall-off in the number of EU students applying to British universities. Last week there was also a furious argument within government over whether overseas students should continue to be included in immigration statistics after official figures showed the vast majority returned home after graduating. This contradicted Theresa May’s long-standing assertion that huge numbers stay on even after their visas have expired. Karen Briggs, head of Brexit at KPMG, said employers would have to work harder to retain key staff from other EU countries and warned that competition from overseas would intensify. “Although almost half of the EU citizens working in the UK plan to stay, what other EU citizens choose to do is definitely hanging in the balance,” she said. “Against this backdrop we expect to see increased competition for talent between employers, and numerous firms seeking to supplement their workforce with AI [artificial intelligence], robotics and automation.” Briggs added: “Our survey reveals a serious situation for employers relying on EU staff, particularly those who employ independent, in-demand, educated and younger workers. Too few employers are doing enough to support their EU employees and that means the UK is vulnerable to losing IT professionals, creative minds, engineers and specialist finance professionals. “Compounding this issue we’re seeing a fall in applications from EU citizens to UK universities. This could create a high-end talent pipeline problem and a shortage of chemists, linguists, and other professionals. At the very top end of the graduate market, those who are most sought-after, and thus most highly rewarded, will be the biggest issue for employers.” In June, the government tried to reassure EU citizens about their future in the UK with what it described as a “big and generous” offer. It set out how they could achieve “settled status” after the UK leaves the EU. But KPMG found that it has left EU workers divided. Some 53% said it had made “no difference” to their views on whether they would leave or stay, while the rest were split between those who said it would make them more likely to leave, and those who said the reverse."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2017/aug/27/josh-o-connor-gods-own-country-the-durrells-interview","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-26T23:05:49Z","webTitle":"Josh O’Connor: from The Durrells to the ‘Yorkshire Brokeback Mountain’ … and beyond","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/aug/27/josh-o-connor-gods-own-country-the-durrells-interview","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2017/aug/27/josh-o-connor-gods-own-country-the-durrells-interview","fields":{"headline":"Josh O’Connor: from The Durrells to the ‘Yorkshire Brokeback Mountain’ … and beyond","bodyText":"For Josh O’Connor, known for his role in ITV’s The Durrells, it was the bright Mediterranean sun and the sparkling sea of the hit show’s Corfu setting that lit a path to fame. But this autumn the 27-year-old actor has swapped the heat and goats of the Greek island for the rain and sheep of the Yorkshire dales. O’Connor is the star of an unusual new romance, God’s Own Country, out in cinemas this week and already hailed by critics as among the best films of the year. The unexpected impact of the story, set on a financially imperilled Yorkshire farm, has left him with a choice to make. Will he stick with British independent cinema, or take up one of many offers from Hollywood? Perhaps even donning a superhero’s cape? “I do have a lot of scripts coming in from the States all the time now, including some action stuff,” he told the Observer. “Although I am not sure I am in enough shape for that yet. I must say, I wouldn’t turn down a superhero role, although there do seem to be a lot of British actors out there doing that.” O’Connor’s portrayal of Johnny, a depressed and promiscuous young gay farmer in God’s Own Country, has invited favourable comparisons with the 2006 western Brokeback Mountain, and earned him laurels from Empire magazine for the “bleakness that O’Connor powerfully articulates with slight dialogue and subtle physical cues”. The Telegraph’s critic Robbie Collin has praised the “extraordinary delicacy and deftness” of his performance. “The last couple of weeks have made me see that working in America is actually possible,” O’Connor said this weekend. “People are interested, simply because we have had such a success story with this film.” He was signed up by an American agent after the film’s premiere at the Sundance festival in January, although his next project is another independent British production, a love story to be made later this year in Glasgow. Last week the actor, who lives in south London, was busy filming the third series of The Durrells during the day and then publicising God’s Own Country in the evenings. Long days, but nothing that compares to the hours he put in on the Yorkshire farm near Keighley where the film was shot. After choosing his lead actor, first-time director Francis Lee sent O’Connor to work on the hillsides alongside a real farmer for a fortnight. “I’ve never worked as hard,” said O’Connor. “It was an intense time. We would get up at 6am, go up the hill to the sheep in the Land Rover, then come down later in the morning to fix a fence or a broken paddock. That was the time for all the odd jobs, really. And then we would maybe go to have a bacon butty in the farmhouse. “After that we often had to lift some bit of heavy equipment, or walk sheep along the roads. It is a way of life that is totally unforgiving and extreme, but it opened my eyes and gave me a new way of looking at the countryside. It put it all in perspective, because I grew up in Cheltenham and the farming around there is very different.” The experience also established a friendship between O’Connor and the farmer, who he has since visited two or three times. “John remains a very good friend of mine, although we are from completely different worlds. His farm sits above Keighley, which is in a kind of bowl below, and he is there seven days a week. As an actor, I always have this thing where I can’t plan ahead for holidays or a break because I don’t know when I might be needed for the next job. But John has gone without a holiday for 13 years. He can’t leave the farm.” And it was his new friend’s judgment on the finished film that O’Connor was particularly nervous to hear. “He came out of a screening and said, ‘that was all right, that,’ which, from him, is the best thing you could get.” Lee had wanted to make sure his lead actors, O’Connor and Romanian co-star Alec Secareanu, who plays immigrant worker Georghe, were both capable of doing all the farm work required by the screenplay. The result is convincing and often highly unappealing. As the Guardian’s Peter Bradshaw commented: “We are far from James Herriot country.” For O’Connor, however, the strength of God’s Own Country lies in its refusal to show the tough life of the farmers as without hope. “My character admittedly starts out leading a life of casual sex and booze, and he has a troubled relationship both with his father and with the landscape, but those things change.” The British countryside in general, the actor believes, is under-represented on film. “And what is particularly lacking are more hopeful representations of the north, or even just of the working classes. It doesn’t have to be grim.” O’Connor is also glad the film is being received as something of an artistic anti-Brexit statement. “All good art should be political, I think, and inevitably it all becomes political really, in one way or another. The fact this film is being talked about as the first of the pro-European films is interesting. It was never, as far as I know, the intention. It was just that it was all happening – the referendum campaign – as we were filming. So I feel that it is a happy coincidence.” Lee has revealed that when he first watched O’Connor’s audition tape he assumed the actor was from the north of England. “I quickly realised he has a rare gift – the ability to totally transform himself into the character he’s playing,” he said. O’Connor has also had supporting big-screen roles in The Riot Club, and alongside Meryl Streep and Hugh Grant in Florence Foster Jenkins, but hopes to return to the theatre one day. For now he must instead return to the rigours of portraying The Durrells on their sunlit Greek isle. And he said that playing eldest son, and fledgling writer, Lawrence “Larry” Durrell over such a long period has given him an unexpected appreciation of his work. “I have got really into his writing. He is now a rather unsung hero of British literature. Although a lot of his work is really not easy to read, I do love The Alexandria Quartet.” SCREEN CV Raised in Cheltenham, the middle son of an English teacher father and midwife mother, he graduated from Bristol Old Vic theatre school in 2011.

A growing number of critics are warning that France is a “powder keg” waiting to blow. After an unconvincing summer, in which his popularity has plummeted, crunch time for Emmanuel Macron has arrived. The new French president is facing the prospect of a September standoff in the streets over his controversial plans to revamp the labour laws. In his election manifesto Macron pledged to use a special presidential decree to force through measures making it easier, among other things, for employers to hire and fire. He has a clear parliamentary majority, so the biggest menace to Macron’s plans comes from the unions and the street. The CGT trade union has called for a day of “action and strikes” on 12 September; Jean-Luc Mélenchon, leader of the hard-left party La France Insoumise (FI; France Unbowed) has called for a “day of action” two weeks later. The stakes could scarcely be higher. Macron’s success or failure on his flagship reform will define his term in office and may make or break a nascent French economic recovery. Previous presidents have tried and failed for 20 years to make France’s weighty and hugely complex code du travail (employment code) more flexible. In 1995 the conservative president Jacques Chirac’s prime minister, Alain Juppé, tried to modify France’s pension provisions and caused a general strike that paralysed the country. Macron’s predecessor, the Socialist president François Hollande, attempted to simplify the code, but backed down in the face of violent protests. Macron knows the history. During a visit to Bucharest last week, he told an audience: “France is not a reformable country. Many have tried and they have not succeeded because the French hate reform.” The political scientist Frédéric Dabi, deputy director of the pollsters Ifop, said it was impossible to predict what would happen in the next few weeks. “With Macron’s popularity at such a low and the honeymoon period now gone, he has to be careful not to cause major disappointment,” Dabi said. “It’s important the he and his government don’t do anything that leaves people with a feeling of injustice. He cannot risk losing the moderate left, the Hollande supporters who fuelled his election, and he has to have a good communication strategy to explain where he is taking the French. We cannot forget that he [Macron] got only 24% of the vote in the first [presidential] round. This could rapidly coalesce into widespread discontent with him and the government. Now is the hard part and we cannot say for sure what will happen; it’s a case of wait and see.” Last week Hollande used his first interview since leaving office to warn his successor not to impose “useless sacrifices” on French workers. The president and his prime minister, Édouard Philippe, were clearly annoyed. Macron, on a visit to Austria, responded testily: “France’s problem is that it’s had mass unemployment for 30 years … it is the only big European country that hasn’t won the battle against unemployment.” Philippe went further. “What struck me about the former president’s remarks is, basically, he wants everything to continue as when he was in power,” he told RMC radio. “The message I took from the presidential election was that the French don’t want that, they want profound change.” The June general election gave Macron’s government a clear majority in the national assembly allowing the president to deploy the rarely used device of a presidential decree to pass the reforms. Former Socialist MP Émeric Bréhier, now director of the Jean-Jaurès Foundation thinktank’s political observatory, said there was in effect no opposition. “Macron’s popularity is even lower than François Hollande’s was at this stage, but there is no credible alternative, so Macron remains at the centre of the game.” An outline of the proposed labour law changes, which also include capping industrial tribunal payments and allowing employers to negotiate with unions at local rather than national level – a threat to collective bargaining that is the motor of French union power – were presented to the unions last week. The government will send its draft decrees reforming the code du travail to the state council this week. The texts are expected to be published on Thursday and passed before the end of September. Macron’s strategy appears to be to divide the unions, making minor concessions to some and marginalising the more militant CGT, which was behind last year’s more virulent protests against Hollande. One of the more leftwing unions, Force Ouvrière (FO; Workers’ Force), has already indicated it is predisposed to negotiate and that “everything is on the table”. “We haven’t had the full details yet. We are watching out as you watch a saucepan of milk on the stove … the devil is in the details,” the FO president, Jean-Claude Mailly, said last week. Other union leaders have warned there are “red lines” in workers’ rights that cannot be crossed. One insisted they would not allow workers to be forced “back to the Middle Ages”. Bréhier is sceptical of warnings that Macron and his government are facing a turbulent, even violent, return to work. “It will depend on the unions. If it’s just the CGT that opposes the labour laws, I don’t believe we will see many protests,” he said. There are signs that the French economy is growing and the latest drop in unemployment could temper the protests. “People are saying to themselves, ‘things are getting better, let’s give him a chance’, but the most important thing is this lack of opposition,” Bréhier said. Mélenchon’s FI, with the support of Socialist MPs, has lodged a legal demand to have the use of a presidential decree to pass the labour law changes as “unconstitutional”. Alexis Corbière, FI spokesman, told Europe 1: “We will see what the government does. It is possible that it will be more wary than expected, it knows full well the country is a social tinderbox. The French have a passion for equality and will not accept the expected reversal of social benefits.” The last week of August, when the French traditionally return from their summer holidays and prepare to go back to work, is known as la rentrée (the return). For Macron, la rentrée of 2017 is set to be a stormy one. It may yet come to define his presidency. Labour reforms Emmanuel Macron, the French president, says his code du travail reforms will “bring France into the 21st century”. His plans, which will be revealed this week, are expected to include: Hiring Loosening tax and social charge obligations on expanding small and medium companies to encourage them to take on more staff. Firing Limiting the amount of compensation awards from industrial tribunals. Negotiating Firms would be able to make local agreements to adapt working hours and conditions, bypassing national union officers."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/aug/27/frankie-boyle-donald-trump-embodies-twitter","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-27T08:00:02Z","webTitle":"Maybe Trump is a kind of cry for help from the Earth, a human flare | Frankie Boyle","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/aug/27/frankie-boyle-donald-trump-embodies-twitter","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/aug/27/frankie-boyle-donald-trump-embodies-twitter","fields":{"headline":"Maybe Trump is a kind of cry for help from the Earth, a human flare","bodyText":"So are we heading for a Mad Max-style future? I don’t think so. After having lived through Donald Trump we’ll surely just call him Max. Trump is behaving so strangely, we’re probably about a month away from not being allowed to make jokes about him. He’s gone past Charlie Sheen and we’re now entering the bald Britney phase. It’s hard to imagine how America can go back to having a normal president after this. The next president will have to be a car with guns for wheels. After Trump, a Saturday Night Live sketch about Mike Pence would look like something by Samuel Beckett. Trump is sort of like Father Dougal killed a man, so is wearing Father Jack as a disguise. He looks like the image burned into your retina should you watch a completely normal man burst into flames. Even on an HDTV he looks like a sixth generation VHS recording. A president with the temperament of a wasp that’s spent 40 minutes on musical hold, his Twitter feed reads like he’s building up a credible insanity defence for when he’s finally impeached. It’s not just that he lives on Twitter, he embodies it: digressive, petty, trivial, poisonous and self-aggrandising. He basically speaks like a totally random stream of tweets. One minute he’s on Mexicans, then he’s talking about his shoes, then a threat, then a joke about a cat. Last week he held a rally in Phoenix, Arizona – possibly because he thought he’d blend in to a state that is orange, desolate and has a cavernous gap in its heart so huge, people travel the world just to gasp and cry. Phoenix is best known for the song By The Time I Get To Phoenix (She’ll Be Rising), in this case referring to Lilitu the she-demon of the apocalypse. Trump delivered one of his random rightwing word collages in front of a crowd who if they were any whiter would have had carrots for noses. Imagine standing up in Arizona and talking about preserving white culture: a state so recently colonised that the dry cleaners still offer a smallpox cleansing service. White guys have only been in Arizona for 150 years – that’s not even enough time to fill a Costa loyalty card. He’s literally standing in Apache land, 150 years after their genocide, talking about protecting American culture; standing amid a culture people like him destroyed, talking about building a wall, like Simon Cowell launching the next series of The X Factor in the Cavern Club. But what else can we expect from Trump – he doesn’t get his history from reading, he gets it from staring at lumps of stone. A statue to Robert E Lee? If they want to look up to a white guy who’s rubbish at attack and can’t remember which side he’s on, we can send James Milner over there to stand on a box. Arizona is on the Mexican border, meaning his shouting the word “WALL” goes down very well, especially since they know they can get better quality drugs through their border with Hollywood. People will still try to jump over whatever makeshift fence he finally manages to put up. All Trump is doing is turning America into a giant Glastonbury; there’s a headliner no one approves of, but you’ll still go for Dolly Parton and the van making smoothies. Obviously, Trump’s pivot to Afghanistan is depressing. The only comfort to Trump getting in was that he intended to keep his horrific Armageddon packed tightly within his walled up, hermetically sealed Thunderdome America. I suppose this is the kind of consistency we should expect from someone who can’t finish a sentence. Under investigation by the FBI, he is now at war with intelligence in two ways. It’s hard to pick out a single low point of the Trump presidency, but it seems like the KKK now feel relaxed enough to march without their hoods. “Jews will not replace us!”? Looks like if your sister keeps saying no, nobody will mate. Can we even think of Trump in terms of intent? Aren’t we then like those shamans who used to project anger on to erupting volcanoes? Maybe Trump is a kind of cry for help from the Earth, a human flare. Or perhaps he has been produced by the Earth to destroy mankind, and his personality is actually nature’s critique of humanity. How fitting that life on Earth will be extinguished by a reality TV host, over a mediocre golf-club burger at his nuclear winter White House, a kind of 3-star Black Lodge. The US has always been balanced on uneasy contradictions. Even the constitution promises both the right to freedom of speech and the freedom to have a gun to shoot people who annoy you. Right at the heart of its contradictions are the twin ideas of liberty and enslavement, its founding principles of “freedom” and “but not for everybody”. If I had to guess what was at the forefront of the minds of the American right at the moment, I’d say voter suppression. It doesn’t matter that the US has a rhetorical attachment to democracy. Through its actions as a state it has long undermined any connection between its stated ideals and its actions. I think the US will now face a long struggle to avoid a slide into totalitarianism, led of course by people calling themselves libertarians.

Konta and Murray enter the final major of the season in contrasting moods and circumstances that may yet play out to a script that has been written in pencil rather than indelible ink since Wimbledon. Murray, beaten by Sam Querrey in the quarter-finals at his home tournament, has not played since, nursing a hip injury that, at worst, could signal the early signs of arthritis (he was still limping slightly in practice this week), while Konta, denied an historic appearance in the final at the All England Club by an inspired Venus Williams, has regrouped to her satisfaction – if not that of Chris Evert, who has described her preparation for Flushing Meadows as “disappointing”. Murray can relax a little with the prospect of an undemanding first fixture in an easy section of the men’s draw against Tennys Sandgren – a young American of Swedish descent – and Konta, too, starts her campaign with reduced pressure, against the 24-year-old Russian Aleksandra Krunic, ranked 77 in the world. The seventh seed, relaxed and in rude health despite unsubstantiated rumours she came away from Wimbledon carrying an injury, looked surprised when Evert’s remarks were relayed to her over breakfast at one of Manhattan’s finest hotels on Friday morning. Konta has played more matches this year than last, going deeper in the big events, although she has played only four matches between the third and fourth majors of the schedule, as opposed to 14 in 2016. “I think I did pretty well in Australia,” Konta said. “I like to think I did pretty well at Wimbledon and that I will do well at some point at the French Open. I feel like I’m improving in every slam that I’m playing – maybe not results-wise but I do think each year I am getting better. I think I made the most of my build-up here. My first match after Wimbledon [in Toronto] I played against [Ekaterina] Makarova, whom I have played a lot of good matches with. “People forget that she has made the fourth round or better at every slam and she just came off the back of winning Washington. In three weeks I hadn’t played a match, so I knew it wasn’t going to be easy. I felt quite happy with how I played. “In the three matches I played in Cincinnati [losing to Simona Halep in the semi-finals] I got better with each match. I could have won both events but it didn’t happen. But it doesn’t mean that I feel bad about it. I feel pretty good with where I’m at right now.” Konta’s rivalry with Halep, who fell to pieces in the Cincinnati final against the Wimbledon champion Garbiñe Muguruza – and has drawn Maria Sharapova in the first round here – is developing into something special. They could meet in the quarter-finals. “We definitely match up well on court,” the Briton said. “You’ll always have that on tour: certain game styles match up better than others. Simona’s the kind of player who makes a lot of balls, who moves the ball around the court and builds points very well. Her game is very inviting for, I guess, showman tennis, because the points develop.” While Murray has been agonising in every way possible, Konta has been enjoying herself away from the circuit. A year ago here she collapsed from heat exhaustion. Since Wimbledon she has turned her mind to music, specifically U2, whom she met in Dublin after attending to fitness and a revamped diet on a trip to Liverpool and Manchester. “I got to meet Bono at the end, which was amazing,” she said, smiling. “When I was going to meet them, I was like: ‘Oh, are you sure? I feel like they are probably being forced to meet me.’ It was so nice because Bono kissed my hand and said he’s so happy that I’m there, and The Edge as well: ‘We are so happy you are here, you did so well.’ I was, like: ‘Oh my goodness, they know my name.’ It was one of those moments.” There will be more of the same if she establishes herself among the elite elbowing their way towards the pinnacle vacated by the absent Serena Williams. Eight players in the women’s draw have a chance of finishing the fortnight as No1 in the world, an unprecedented mathematical oddity. That position is currently held by the Czech Karolina Pliskova. How Murray would love to be in with a shout of regaining the top spot he has surrendered to Rafael Nadal after 41 weeks. A sliver of good news for the Scot: Nadal and Roger Federer, who have never played each other here, are scheduled to meet in the semi-finals, while Murray can work his way through a quarter of the draw containing David Ferrer, Lucas Pouilly and two more Americans in Jared Donaldson and Steve Johnson. He will be disappointed if he does not hobble into the second week."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/aug/27/high-street-betting-must-clean-up-its-act-fixed-odds-machines-victoria-coren-mitchell","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-26T23:05:49Z","webTitle":"High street betting must clean up its act | Victoria Coren Mitchell","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/aug/27/high-street-betting-must-clean-up-its-act-fixed-odds-machines-victoria-coren-mitchell","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/aug/27/high-street-betting-must-clean-up-its-act-fixed-odds-machines-victoria-coren-mitchell","fields":{"headline":"High street betting must clean up its act","bodyText":"Since my column last week about fixed-odds betting terminals, I’ve been getting hundreds of messages a day. Ninety-five percent of them agree with my view that these high-stakes modern slot machines should be restricted. I don’t think I’ve ever written a column that encountered more assent – or less dissent – apart from the one about “funeral crashers” who skulked around misleading the bereaved in hope of free booze. Not many people came out in support of those guys. But FOBT machines are equal to the funeral crashers in their rapacious appetites, and inspired almost as little praise. The unanimity of the response was heartening and baffling at the same time: left-wingers and right-wingers, Labour MPs and Tory MPs, betting-shop workers, betting-shop punters and people who have never been in a betting shop; old and young, the addicts and the free; all united in agreement that the machines should be capped. And yet the machines remain uncapped. Everybody wants them gone, yet they keep appearing – like the opposite of post offices. It’s a mystery. Before the election, all the main parties promised a curb on the maximum bet (the Conservatives in the form of John Whittingdale warning bookmakers to “brace yourselves” for “quite radical measures”). But that’s gone silent. Political unanimity reigns here, too: a Labour administration waved FOBTs in and a Tory administration fails to wave them out. So I’m paying closer attention than I otherwise might to the handful of people who sent me counter-arguments. It was a few voices of dissent in a loud chorus of agreement, yet they seem to hold the balance of power. So let’s listen to them. “The government can’t afford to lose the tax revenue from the machines.” This, according to a Whitehall leak in the Daily Mail, is Philip Hammond’s reason for not capping them. But the maths is plain wrong. These machines pay 25% in duty and they trigger family breakdown, rehousing needs, job loss, erosion of small businesses, crime and court proceedings, all of which – ignoring the moral and social aspects – costs us all a lot of money. They are often concentrated in areas of high welfare dependency; in many cases, 100% of the money going into the machines has come direct from the Treasury and 25% goes back. These machines are a loser for the country. “You can also win on them.” This came from the Association of British Bookmakers who said I had failed to make this point. I thought it was implied. But sure, you can have a one-off win. In the long run, you can’t win. “Fixed odds” means the odds are fixed and they’re fixed against you. That’s why the machines made a profit of more than £1.7bn in a single year. The ABA also want me to explain that the number of betting shops is falling, not rising. But I didn’t say otherwise. What betting shops are doing is grouping, with large numbers of them sprouting in stretches of urban high streets (to get round the rule of four FOBTs per outlet) while single or rural shops go under. The ABA said I wrongly claimed you can lose £500 a minute. I did and I’m sorry. It’s a maximum of £300 a minute per machine – although, as I wrote to them, you can lose £600 a minute if you’re playing two at once. They asked the Observer to forward evidence that it’s possible to play two at once. I think they knew that was daft. Of course it’s possible. I’ve done it myself. I don’t really know how to forward that. I don’t have a box big enough to hold myself and two FOBTs from Coral’s on the Edgware Road. Whether it’s £600, £500 or £300, you get the gist: you can go totally skint in half an hour. By the end of the day, you can be in a hole you might never get out of. “People should take responsibility for themselves. You’re a bleeding-heart leftie.” Yes I am, but that’s a different argument. I’m just saying the government is wrong to suggest these machines make “revenue” for the nation. You and I may have different sympathies. Eric Baptista, a Liverpool taxi driver, was in court recently after vandalising FOBTs following his massive losses. He smashed machines and threw water balloons at them, shouting “I’m sick of losing!” Yes, even that makes my heart bleed. I find the detail of the water balloons desperately poignant. I see the helplessness of a child hammering its tiny fist against authority. I see a good man driven to madness by loss upon loss upon loss (he volunteers at a boys’ club in Dingle; he confessed to the vandalism immediately and asked to face the consequences). I think: there but for the grace of God. I want to put my arm round him. Frankly, I want to help him smash up the machines. You may see only the weakness and violence. You may think it’s not our job to protect a man from his addictions, nor our responsibility to keep these things off the high street. That’s fine. I respect your different view. But it’s beside the point. All I’m saying is: when 25% of Eric’s losses trickle back to the Treasury, Great Britain has not made a profit. “Things shouldn’t be banned.” I’m of that school too. I wouldn’t ban these machines, but a betting cap of £2 or £5 a spin would transform the landscape. Right now, if you start at £2 a spin but go £100 behind, you can spin for £100 to “get it back”. Twenty seconds later, you’re £200 behind. So a £200 spin becomes the “quick route” to getting back where you started. That’s what destroys people. “You promoted an online gaming company. You’re not to be trusted.” It’s hard to know who to trust in the FOBT debate. People either know nothing about gambling or they have a dog in the fight. Bookies make millions from FOBTs; online gaming corporations gain if bookies disappear; there’s huge money and lobbying involved. But you can trust me. I like casinos. I like bookies. I enjoy live gambling. I love poker (a game you can actually beat) and I’m happy to recommend it. But solo, mechanised roulette (on your phone, your laptop or in Billy Hill’s next to Lidl) is nothing but a black hole. I used to receive a large annual sum to promote an online poker company. In 2014, that company launched an online casino and I quit the next morning. I miss the action and the tournaments; God knows I miss the money. Nobody would have objected if I stayed. It was just between me and my conscience, where I wanted my wages to come from. Maybe I was an idiot to walk away, but I’m a clean idiot. When I give an opinion, it’s about nothing other than what I think is right. I gave up a lot to protect that. If the government is also clean, it should listen to me. “If the machines are capped, thousands of high street bookies will disappear.” For me, this is the big one. Yes they probably will and I don’t want them to. I want bookies to stay on the high street, not be burned away by the furnace of the internet. But the world I loved is already gone. Bookies are no longer places to swap tips, laugh, grumble and celebrate together. FOBTs have made them pits of anger and misery. Abuse of workers has soared. The 3.30 at Plumpton comes and goes unnoticed, as the zombies thump, thump, thump their money into the machines, chasing losses that won’t come back. Capping them won’t restore the past. Maybe 2,000 bookies would close. But that’s about a changing world. If they’re only being kept open by the uncontrolled losses of the poor and addicted, that’s not the answer. Bookshops and toyshops – even fishmongers and greengrocers – can’t seem to compete with the internet either. Nobody wants them to close. And they wouldn’t close if they got a licence to sell smack, at 25% duty to the government. But that’s not the answer. It’s a bitter pill I’m swallowing here. I love bookies, but if uncapped FOBTs are the only thing keeping them open then they have to go under."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/aug/26/my-familys-love-story-helped-out-may-on-migration","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-26T23:05:49Z","webTitle":"My family’s love story helped out May on migration | Jess Phillips","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/aug/26/my-familys-love-story-helped-out-may-on-migration","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/aug/26/my-familys-love-story-helped-out-may-on-migration","fields":{"headline":"My family’s love story helped out May on migration","bodyText":"I’m writing this in France, where I’m staying with my brother and his family.

With the euphoria of promotion a rapidly receding memory, tensions behind the scenes are escalating and the squad look ill-equipped for the Premier League. So how has it come to this, why is the “cold war” between Rafael Benítez and Mike Ashley intensifying? Surely it cannot be true the manager and owner rarely speak, let alone meet? Bizarrely it is. Benítez and Ashley have met once this year, in May, and do not talk on the telephone. Instead Lee Charnley, Newcastle’s managing director, serves as a conduit, passing messages between the two. When Ashley made a rare trip to Tyneside to watch Newcastle lose to Tottenham on the opening day of the season, he departed without speaking to Benítez. Matters are complicated by the involvement of Justin Barnes, an abrasive lawyer and long-standing Ashley confidant, in club business. Introduced in January, apparently to ready Newcastle for a possible sale, Barnes’s input is understood to affect transfers. Benítez has made it plain he does not believe he has had proper transfer market backing this summer. How strong is his case and what is Ashley’s counter-argument? Although Benítez has spent around £35m on six new signings they are not his first choices and he has been forced to take significant risks at the cheaper end of an inflated market. Javier Manquillo, for instance, lost his right-back berth to Billy Jones at relegated Sunderland last season, while Joselu struggled to get a game at Stoke City. Ashley, though, is said to be perplexed that a Championship side he spent £55m reinforcing last summer (although the Spaniard made a £30m net profit on transfer dealings) is not stronger. He wants to slim down an over-size squad by offloading unwanted players including Grant Hanley, Jack Colback and Tim Krul before making further signings. The problem is that Colback and company are on high wages and their largely Championship suitors will wait until deadline day to attempt to force cut-price deals through. While Ashley’s parsimony may also reflect disappointment at his failure to sell the club this summer, his annoyance at what he perceives as Benítez’s sniping in front of the media was perhaps reflected by the presence of Keith Bishop, the sports retail tycoon’s PR adviser, monitoring the press conference Benítez staged on Tuesday to preview Wednesday’s home League Cup defeat to Nottingham Forest. Was he on a spying mission? On Friday Bishop was absent and Benítez more forthcoming. “Last year we signed players for the Championship and made a profit but after promotion you have to change the players, which makes you busier than established Premier League teams,” he said. “We have to improve the team but I am signing the players I can, not the players that I want – although that doesn’t mean I don’t like the players I have. The reality is that, if you cannot pay £25m, you have to go for a different kind of player. To buy quality you have to pay; we haven’t done that.” The most Benítez has spent on an individual this summer is £10m for the former Norwich winger Jacob Murphy. Asked if he would be permitted to invest £15m on a single player he replied: “I don’t think so.” Instead a man desperate to borrow Stevan Jovetic from Internazionale this week is using his peerless contacts to facilitate potential loan deals. Ashley has told Benítez he cannot recruit further without moving people out first but the manager is wary. “How can I let players go in certain positions if I don’t have definite replacements,” he said. “Sometimes you cannot get your targets.” Why doesn’t Rafa walk out? For assorted reasons, most notably loyalty. Behind that sharply forensic, ruthlessly analytical mind, lurks a football romantic who relishes the adoration of Newcastle’s fans and is excited by the club’s immense potential. Benítez does not want to let those supporters down – or his staff and players. A confirmed Anglophile, he enjoys the Premier League and wants to remain reasonably close to his Merseyside-based family. Then there is the compensation clause in his contract which is understood to stipulate he, or another club, must pay Newcastle around £6m if he resigns. “When I said I would stay it was because of the city, the fans, the stature of the club, being in the Premier League and living close to my family,” said Benítez. “I was expecting we could be in a better position now but we’re not. We will see if we can improve in the final week of the transfer window. “I will try to do my job. My aim is trying to improve things, so when I leave, whenever it is, the team and the club will be better. “ Normally, managers talk about projects saying they need four or five years. I’m not talking about that, because you never know in football … what I want here is that we have a football vision, that we allow the business to make a profit but football is the priority.” What is the dressing room consensus? Mohamed Diamé, Newcastle’s former West Ham midfielder, is not underestimating the importance of this meeting with his old club. “West Ham’s a big game,” he said. “After the start we’ve had, it’s become massively important. We need some points as soon as possible.” Diamé hinted that debilitating off-field politics are exerting a detrimental dressing-room impact. “If some stuff happens outside it can maybe affect us in, how can I say, our preparations for the game,” he said. “But we won’t allow that to happen on the pitch. We’re always hearing a lot of people saying we need new signings and more strength but I believe we have enough quality. We need to fight, show character and carry the responsibility ourselves. No one said it was going to be easy.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/blog/2017/aug/25/england-batting-stoneman-westley-malan-fail-to-convince","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-25T19:20:00Z","webTitle":"England batting trio of Stoneman, Westley and Malan fail to convince | Andy Bull","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2017/aug/25/england-batting-stoneman-westley-malan-fail-to-convince","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/blog/2017/aug/25/england-batting-stoneman-westley-malan-fail-to-convince","fields":{"headline":"England batting trio of Stoneman, Westley and Malan fail to convince","bodyText":"It was just muggy enough at Headingley on Friday morning for the spectators to work up a sweat on the short walk from Burley Park station. A lot of them were left mopping their brow and muttering about how close the weather was. England’s batsmen seemed to be suffering with clammy palms and sticky collars too, especially the three greenhorns, Mark Stoneman, Tom Westley and Dawid Malan. They had a warm morning of it, toiling away against a very different sort of West Indies attack underneath all that heavy grey cloud. And soon after lunch, all three had come and gone, Westley lbw for three, Stoneman caught behind for 19, Malan bowled for eight. The trio have made only two fifties in 12 Test innings between them. Westley was the first to go. From a distance he seemed the most nervous of the three. He had spent the morning’s training session practising his straight driving against a series of short-range throw-downs and was still rehearsing the shot even as he walked out to bat, as if the last-minute cramming was going to make all the difference. His was a skittish little innings, which included an edge just short of slip, a single squirted out to the leg side, one whippy cut shot which he did not quite catch cleanly, and then ended when he missed with that very same stroke he had spent the morning working on. Westley got out in a similar way in the first Test. Once is a misfortune; twice begins to look like carelessness. Westley, who was so endearingly enthusiastic about his intentions when he was first called up – “I’ll walk down the wicket and whip it!” he told an interviewer in All Out Cricket – now has the air of a man who is four weeks into a severe crash course on the particular difficulties of Test cricket. He is making a close study, in particular, of all the extra scrutiny a Test player can expect to be subjected to, from the media and the opposition’s analysts. He looks horribly exposed at No3, where there is barely a lick of cover for him to shelter behind as he tries to figure out how to cope with the step up. A similar thing is true for Stoneman. He followed Westley back four overs later. Stoneman had looked comfortable enough holding one end in those early overs, as unobtrusive as a man napping in a corner chair. He has the knack of playing late, with a flickering backlift, in which his bat twitches like the second hand of a stopped clock before he finally commits to his shot. He saw off Shannon Gabriel, who bowled superbly well in his first spell, by batting out back-to-back maiden overs but he fell the very minute he decided to try something more ambitious against Kemar Roach. Stoneman threw a loose drive at a delivery that moved just enough to slip between the wide gap between his bat and pad. It flicked his inside edge on the way and he was caught behind. Mindful of all that and the fact England were three down, Malan, next in, decided to try to play very conservatively indeed. He made two scoring shots in the 31 balls faced before lunch, his admirable assiduousness undone when he played on off Jason Holder soon after the break. Holder had only just switched to bowling round the wicket and the change of angle seemed enough to fox Malan’s thinking. In amid all that upheaval Joe Root mustered more authority in one shot, a cover drive for four, than his three new team-mates did in all the 97 balls they faced. Root’s bat cracked like a teacher’s ruler on a desk, an announcement of his own authority. This was the 12th consecutive Test in which Root has made at least 50 but even he cannot succeed every innings. And the fact he was dropped at slip when his score was eight was a reminder of just how fragile England’s top six are at the moment. They are running out of time to fix it, too. There are 10,000 miles between Leeds and Brisbane but that first Ashes Test is starting to come into view. It is 90 days away and Malan, Westley and Stoneman have, at most, three more Test innings to prove they should be in the XI for that match. The Australians are watching. Mitchell Starc has been talking about how England “are certainly not as settled in the batting stakes as they were a little while ago,” on Cricket Australia’s in-house podcast. “You don’t really quite know who they’re going to bring to Australia yet,” he added. “It will be interesting. It’s a nice one to watch for the bowlers.” Before this Test Root said that, if his new batsmen wanted to “nail down those spots”, they would need to “get in and make it really count”. None has done it yet. But then they are not alone in that. England have given debuts to 10 batsmen since they were last in Australia and Stoneman, Westley and Malan, the last three in, are the only ones still in the team. Whether they still will be come that first Test in Australia or not depends on what they do with those few chances they have left. If West Indies seemed a warm proposition on a sticky August day in England, one would guess the Gabba is going to be much too hot to handle."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2017/aug/28/strike-the-cuckoos-calling-review-jk-rowlings-detective-dalliances-come-to-life","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-28T05:00:25Z","webTitle":"Strike: The Cuckoo’s Calling review – JK Rowling’s detective dalliances come to life","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/aug/28/strike-the-cuckoos-calling-review-jk-rowlings-detective-dalliances-come-to-life","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2017/aug/28/strike-the-cuckoos-calling-review-jk-rowlings-detective-dalliances-come-to-life","fields":{"headline":"Strike: The Cuckoo’s Calling review – JK Rowling’s detective dalliances come to life","bodyText":"The body of a young model lies dead on a snowy London pavement, having fallen from a penthouse flat. Did she jump, or was she pushed? This looks like a job for Cormoran Strike. I haven’t read any of the crime novels JK Rowling has written under the nom de plume Robert Galbraith, but it is easy to imagine the problems she might encounter plonking a down-on-his-luck private investigator into contemporary London. How does he afford his Soho rent? What purpose does an old-fashioned gumshoe serve, now that the rest of us do all our own snooping online? And how can a character called Cormoran Strike introduce himself to strangers with a straight face? In the new BBC adaptation Strike: The Cuckoo’s Calling (BBC1, Sunday), most of these difficulties are at least acknowledged. Early on, someone says: “Private detective? That’s a bit Roger Rabbit.” Cormoran Strike (Tom Burke) is himself is a very modern PI: he lost a leg in Afghanistan, and he is also the estranged son of a rock star. In fact, he is rather more interesting than he needs to be, but his elaborate backstory will no doubt come in handy later. Strike’s new office temp, Robin (Holliday Grainger), walks into his life just as his girlfriend is walking out – they pass each other on the stairs – and just before a childhood acquaintance, John Bristow, presents him with the case of the dead model, who was Bristow’s adoptive sister. You weren’t hard to find, says Bristow, because there aren’t that many Cormoran Strikes out there. Tick. Actually, almost everyone has a singular name – Guy Some, Tansy Bestigui – but this is a convention of detective fiction. There are at least half a dozen potential suspects, and we can’t afford to get them mixed up. This adaptation works hard to maintain a balance between raw authenticity and the hokier demands of the genre. Sometimes the contrast jars – as when a woman on a street corner shouts “Fiver for a hand job?” at the passing Strike – but mostly it succeeds. Burke plays Strike with just the right amount of grubby nobility: he is dishevelled, but not quite disgusting. He talks to his artificial limb, and pees in a cup when he can’t be arsed to put it back on. Strike inhabits a London that is both quaint and menacing, full of greasy cafes, darkened boozers and the kind of restaurant where villains might have a regular table. No one ever eats lunch at Pret. Grainger and Burke are an engaging double act, while stalwarts Martin Shaw and Tara Fitzgerald form part of the wide range of suspects. We haven’t met Striker’s rock star dad yet, but I’m sure he is in the wings. Henry Singer’s film Diana: Seven Days (BBC1, Sunday) looked back 20 years at the week preceding the funeral of Princess Diana. Princes William and Harry were among those speaking about their memories of that sad and strangely febrile interval, along with Tony Blair, Alastair Campbell and some key members of the royal household. We all remember where we were that week, but it can be hard to accurately recall the public mood: the charged air in the country, the process by which sadness gave way to anger. The footage, more than the recollections, brought it all back. A man looks directly into a TV camera and says: “It’s you, the press, that killed her. You’re the scum.” As the week progressed some of that anger was transferred to the Queen. The outpouring of public grief – the flowers, the wailing, the vigils at the palace gates – caught those in charge on the hop. They didn’t know what it was, or what to do about it. Tony Blair sought to characterise it as a successful resetting of the relationship between the British people and the royals, a transition he artfully stage-managed. With the advantage of 20 years’ hindsight, it all looks rather more toxic than that. The public, abetted by the media, gave itself permission to embark on a mass intrusion into private grief by trying to own it. The Express headline’s appeal to the Queen – “Show Us You Care” – now reads like a challenge: show us you care as much as we do. It was the week we forgot that two young boys had lost their mother. Then again, hindsight isn’t always the best vantage point. A man camped along the funeral route described the mood at the time in a way that seems devastatingly accurate now. “Without any disrespect,” he said. “It’s like going to the movies. Diana’s something we’re allowed to cry about. We’re allowed to touch on our emotions through her.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2017/aug/25/netflix-marijuana-strains-original-shows","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-25T21:45:48Z","webTitle":"Netflix develops marijuana strains based on its original shows","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/aug/25/netflix-marijuana-strains-original-shows","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2017/aug/25/netflix-marijuana-strains-original-shows","fields":{"headline":"Netflix develops marijuana strains based on its original shows","bodyText":"Netflix has co-created a set of cannabis strains based on a selection of its most popular original shows.

But don’t take my word for it. In what looked suspiciously like an audition to write this column, the president reviewed his own live gigs with a series of tweets on Thursday: “Well, there was Afghanistan (somber),” he recalled, lamenting media criticism of his wildly see-sawing speaking styles, “the big Rally … (enthusiastic, dynamic and fun) and the American Legion – V.A. (respectful and strong). Too bad the Dems have no one who can change tones!” It’s probably not the tones the Dems want to change. Last weekend The fallout from the president’s initial refusal to condemn white supremacists in Charlottesville, Virginia, continued last weekend, with the news that he and his wife would be skipping a prestigious arts awards ceremony and White House reception “to allow the honorees to celebrate without any political distraction”. At least two of the five stars due to receive the awards had already indicated they would boycott the reception, joining Republicans, business leaders, charities and sports stars in denouncing Trump after he suggested that neo-Nazi protesters in Charlottesville, Virginia, were morally equivalent to the anti-fascist activists opposing them. Trump seemed eager to wade into a new controversy when he described anti-racist demonstrators who converged on Boston as “anti-police agitators”, but he later rowed back, praising the right to demonstrate and applauding “the many protesters in Boston who are speaking out against bigotry and hate”. As conservationists nervously awaited a decision from the White House on which of 27 national monuments might be reviewed – possibly opening up these stunning landscapes to the oil, mining and timber industries – campaigners criticised the administration’s decision to reverse a ban on the sale of plastic water bottles in national parks. Monday After risking blindness and public mockery by staring directly at the total solar eclipse that crossed the US on Monday, Trump headed to Fort Myer in Virginia to make a major speech on Afghanistan, indicating he was going to increase the US military presence there but not spelling out exactly how many more troops he would send, claiming not to want to telegraph his policies to America’s enemies. Speaking slowly and deliberately, Trump admitted that his “original instinct was to pull out”, but noted: “All my life I’ve heard that decisions are much different when you sit behind the desk at the Oval Office.” And he included a harshly worded warning to Pakistan that it had “much to lose by continuing to harbor criminals and terrorists”. While some praised “a new President Trump” for “acknowledging a flip-flop and talking about gravity of office, history &amp; substance”, others noted very little substantive difference from Barack Obama’s strategy, while some warned that the president could leave the US “without a clearly defined mission, and stuck in the middle of a worsening conflict”. Among the critics was the website run by Trump’s former chief strategist, Steve Bannon: Breitbart, which accused the president of becoming little more than a puppet of generals in the White House and characterised his move as a U-turn that contradicted a campaign pledge to limit US intervention abroad. Tuesday It was a very different Trump who turned up at the Phoenix convention center in Arizona on Tuesday night, delivering a rambling, belligerent 75-minute speech in which he read out at length his previous statements on Charlottesville – crucially omitting the key phrase “on many sides” that had ignited the firestorm in the first place – and returned to his criticism of anti-fascist activists, at one point yelping: “Antifa!” He criticised the state’s senators, John McCain and Jeff Flake, and told the crowd the media was attacking them, disliked America, and was “trying to take away our history and our heritage” – a familiar phrase from his argument that Confederate monuments should stay in place. And he dropped a clear hint that he intended to pardon Joe Arpaio, the former sheriff of Maricopa County, after his conviction for intentionally defying a judge’s order to stop his traffic patrols that targeted immigrants. Wednesday Trump’s Arizona speech certainly worried one listener, with the former US intelligence chief James Clapper saying he found it “disturbing” and calling the president’s access to the nuclear codes “pretty damn scary”. Clapper was joining a growing chorus of alarm over Trump’s erratic behaviour. The Republican chairman of the Senate foreign relations committee, Bob Corker, said last week that Trump “has not yet been able to demonstrate the stability nor some of the competence that he needs to demonstrate in order to be successful”, and Ted Lieu, a Democratic congressman who has introduced a bill that would prohibit the president from launching a nuclear first strike without a declaration of war by Congress, tweeted after Trump’s speech: “Freaked out yet?” At his third speaking event in three days, the president swung back to the calmer tone of his Afghanistan remarks, delivering a message of unity to an annual veterans’ convention in Reno, Nevada. “It is time to heal the wounds that have divided us, and to seek a new unity based on the common values that unite us,” he said. Thursday Trump himself was driving those divisions, according to more than 62% of voters surveyed in a Quinnipiac poll, which also found that the president’s job approval was 35%, with 59% disapproving, and that 60% disapproved of his response to the events in Charlottesville. But Trump’s Republican support was solid as a rock, with 77% giving him their approval. Voters also said they trusted the media more than Trump by 54%-36% “to tell you the truth about important issues”. Looking ahead to the problems facing Congress when it returns on 5 September, Trump lashed out at the GOP leaders Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan for failing to take his advice over increasing the country’s borrowing limit. “Could have been so easy – now a mess!” he lamented. Some considered another post – a retweet of an allegedly antisemitic supporter’s set of images entitled “The best eclipse ever!” which showed Trump’s face gradually obscuring that of Barack Obama – slightly unpresidential. Elsewhere, the interior secretary Ryan Zinke announced he was considering rolling back conservation safeguards on a “handful” of national monuments, with sources claiming the Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante monuments in Utah and the Cascade-Siskiyou monument in Oregon were among them. Friday On Friday, Gary Cohn, Trump’s chief economic adviser, became the most senior administration official to criticize the president over Charlottesville. “This administration can and must do better in consistently and unequivocally condemning these [neo-Nazi] groups and do everything we can to heal the deep divisions that exist in our communities,” Cohn told the Financial Times. The former president of Goldman Sachs and bête noire of Bannon supporters who call him “Globalist Gary”, Cohn said he had considered resigning over Trump’s remarks but “as a Jewish American, I will not allow neo-Nazis ranting ‘Jews will not replace us’ to cause this Jew to leave his job”. As Hurricane Harvey bore down on Texas, Trump prepared to deal with the first major natural disaster on his watch, tweeting a photo of himself being briefed by Brock Long, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) chief. On Thursday, he also put out a video clip of his meeting with Fema officials in early August, with the caption: “Remember, the USA is the most resilient nation on earth, because we plan ahead.” Critics pointed out that Long had only been confirmed on 20 June, three weeks into the Atlantic hurricane season, and the president has not yet nominated a permanent head of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which plays a key role in weather forecasting. “I think we have to be hopeful that they’ll handle it properly,” said Kristy Dahl of the Union of Concerned Scientists. While the focus shifted to the hurricane, the White House announced a number of controversial decisions, pardoning former sheriff Joe Arpaio, the hardline Arizona lawman who was convicted of contempt of court in July for defying a judge’s order to stop racially profiling Latinos, firing nationalist adviser Sebastian Gorka, and signing a directive banning trans people from joining the military. It was hard to see the three decisions as anything other than an attempt to bury bad news while all eyes were on Texas.

It’s been the question on his supporters’ lips ever since Donald Trump won the presidential election on 8 November. This week the debate was reignited again when Brian Schaffner, a political science professor at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, tweeted out data from the Cooperative Congressional Election Study of 50,000 people. Schaffner used the CCE data to estimate that in Wisconsin, 9% of people who voted for Sanders in the Democratic primary voted for Trump in the presidential election. In Michigan, 8% of Sanders supporters voted for Trump, in Pennsylvania, 16%. Political scientist G Elliott Morris did some quick math to show how those numbers could have translated to victories for Sanders. It’s intriguing, but there are caveats. For one, Schaffner hasn’t actually presented his findings yet beyond those tweets. And, as NPR points out, “other statistics suggest that this level of ‘defection’ isn’t all that out of the ordinary”. According to Schaffner, large numbers of people who supported Rubio and Kasich ended up voting for Clinton. And one 2008 study claimed that 25% of people who voted for Clinton in the Democratic primaries went on to vote for John McCain. A progressive mayor for Birmingham? There was a breakthrough for Randall Woodfin, a progressive Democrat running for mayor of Birmingham, Alabama, on Tuesday, when he came top in a 12-candidate race. Woodfin, a 36-year-old attorney and former president of the Birmingham board of education, won 41% of the vote, ahead of 37% for incumbent William Bell. The two will head into a runoff on 3 October. Woodfin, who was backed by Our Revolution, supports debt-free community college and reinvestment in black neighborhoods. Mayhem on the National Mall: juggalos v ‘racist patriots’ An unlikely combination of juggalos, anti-racist activists and pro-Trump demonstrators will congregate on the National Mall in Washington DC on Saturday, 16 September. The Juggalo March on Washington, organised by the horrorcore band Insane Clown Posse and their record label, Psychopathic Records, aims to draw attention to a years-old ruling by the FBI that claims the labels the bans fans, known as juggalos, as gang. The march has been scheduled for more than a year. The pro-Trump demonstration, named the “Mother of all Rallies”, was thrown together more recently and will feature people who “demand protection for traditional American culture”, according to its website. A left-leaning protest outside the White House, intended to draw attention to Russia interfering in the presidential election, was already scheduled for the same day, according to the Washington Post. Since then activists have organized a counter-demonstration to the pro-Trump event – the aim of which is to “tell Trump’s racist ‘patriots’ to go home”. What we’re reading • “Rightwing radicalism holds more political and social power in America than it has for decades,” writes Emily Crockett, in her Rolling Stone piece How the Left Can Stop Arguing and Beat Trump. “But that doesn’t mean the left needs to pivot to the center or compromise its values. It just needs to fight for those values in a smarter, more inclusive way.” • “To build a coalition, everyone has to give a little,” says Joan C Williams in the Guardian. Williams argues that compromise might be essential to success for the left: “Democrats need to prioritize good jobs for non-college grads affected by or alarmed about the hollowing out of the middle class ahead of some issues that matter more to me personally, notably abortion rights and gun control.” Sign up for weekly news updates about the protests and activism in the US"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"science/2017/aug/28/did-you-solve-it-riddles-inspired-by-card-tricks","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-28T16:03:20Z","webTitle":"Did you solve it?

Riddles inspired by card tricks","bodyText":"On my puzzle blog earlier today I set the following three riddles, here reprinted with the answers. The ideas all come from card tricks. In the comments section you might want to suggest the best way to perform card tricks that are based on these mathematical patterns. Chess Boxing A hustler and a chess grandmaster are playing the following game. All the pieces from a chess set are in a box. The two participants take turns reaching into the box without looking, picking out two pieces at a time and placing them onto the table. If the two pieces are white, the grandmaster gets a point. If the two pieces are black, the hustler gets a point. If the colours don’t match, no one gets a point. They will take turns removing pairs until the box is empty. If, exactly halfway through the game, the score is 4-2 in favour of the grandmaster, who will ultimately win the game and by how many points? Solution The game will always be a draw. The number of black and white pieces is the same, so if two white pieces are taken from the box, the box will have two more black pieces than white ones, so there must be a turn later in the game in which two black pieces are taken, levelling out the scores. If the score is 4-2, at least 8 white have been taken and 4 black, meaning that the box has 4 more black in it than white, since when one of each colour is taken the colour surplus does not change. If the box has 4 more black pieces than white pieces, this guarantees two points for the hustler, meaning the final score will be 4-4, or a higher scoring draw. Tunnel Traffic A boulder falls onto a mountain road, temporarily blocking access to a tunnel. A few drivers get out of their cars to help move the boulder. After they successfully clear the entrance to the tunnel, they notice some unusual traffic has accumulated on the two-lane road behind them. The traffic jam consists of eighteen white cars and eighteen black cars. The first car in the left lane is white and the first car in the right lane is black. The colours of the cars behind them in each lane alternate perfectly. When passing through the narrow tunnel, the two lanes of traffic merge into one, and when they come out the other side the single lane branches to two toll booths. Assuming that the first car through the tunnel is a black car and the last car through is a white car, and that the cars reach the toll booth in pairs – meaning that the first two cars exit together, then the next two exit together, and so on – what is the greatest possible number of exiting pairs that will match in colour? Solution: None. Imagine one lane is BWBWBW... and the other is WBWBWB... If the first car through the tunnel is a B, then car behind is either the second car in the first lane or the first car in the second lane, which is always a W. These two cars will exit together and do not match in colour. The third car through the tunnel is either a W or a B. If it was a W, then this means that two lanes of remaining cars BOTH have a B at the front. (Sketch the order of the lanes down and cross them out as they go through the tunnel and you will see the pattern emerge). And if both have a B in the front, the fourth car must be a B. So, again, when the third and fourth cars exit together they will not match in colour. If the third car is a B, then the two lanes of cars must both have a W at the front, and so on... The process of the two lines of traffic merging into one is the same as merging two sets of cards into one. The order of the cards within each set do not change relative to each other, and this produces the nice effect that when you count them out in twos from one end of the pack, you always get one of each colour. Family Bike Race At the Froome family reunion, five sets of twins from five different generations decide to have a bike race, with two teams and one sibling from each set of twins on each team. Each team sets off with all five cyclists in a line behind their “captain”. At any point in the race, the last person in the line can cycle to the front of the line to become the new captain. All five team members must cross the finish line to complete the race. Both teams line up in age order but Team A starts the race with a little kid as their captain and Team B starts the race with an elderly woman as their captain. During the course of the race, the captains change six times between the two teams. When the teams cross the finish line, what are the odds that their captains will be the same age? Solution 100 per cent. Lets call the five sets of twins in age ascending order 1A and 1B, 2A and 2B, 3A and 3B, 4A and 4B and 5A and 5B. So, Team A starts in this order 1A 2A 3A 4A 5A Team B starts 5B 4B 3B 2B 1B The last person replaces the first person six times. So either one team does it six times and the other zero, or five times and one time, or four and two, or three and three. You will see that in each case, the leaders of the teams are the same set of twins. For example, let’s say Team A replaces its leader once. The order will then be 5A 1A 2A 3A 4A. And let’s say Team B replaces its leader five times. Which puts them back to the starting formation 5B 4B 3B 2B 1B. Twins 5A and 5B - who have the same age! - are the finishing captains for their teams. I hope you enjoyed these puzzles. Thanks again to Adam Rubin from the magical website Art of Play.

The year was 1999 and Floyd Mayweather was the 22-year-old super featherweight champion of the world. The offer on the table was a four-fight, $5m extension. It was, HBO insisted, one of the best contracts any young fighter in the world had been offered. But for the Olympic bronze medallist who had signed with Bob Arum’s Top Rank Promotions, it was a non-starter. Or, as he put it at the time, “slave wages”. “I’m not any young fighter,” Mayweather told the room. “I’m not like the rest of those guys. I’m going to be the greatest. I’m never going to lose.” And here we are. Nearly two decades on, Mayweather is widely recognised as the finest boxer of his generation, unbeaten in 49 professional fights and 26 world championship contests with titles in five weight classes. He will surpass $1bn in career earnings whether he wins or loses in Saturday’s 12-round boxing match against Conor McGregor, a two-division UFC champion who is making his professional boxing debut. But as the 40-year-old from Michigan prepares for what appears to be his final ring outing, he remains a figure with a complex legacy that can only be drawn in shades of grey. He overcame a chaotic upbringing filled with drug abuse and violence to rise to the 1% but in turn has been dogged by allegations, and a conviction, of domestic abuse. As the frontman for his nascent promotional company, he speaks passionately and credibly about advocating on behalf of fighters but when I asked him last week about his thoughts on Charlottesville, he pirouetted from the query with the elusiveness he’s shown for years. Ali on Vietnam this was not: states are neither red nor blue on Floyd’s map, only green. Behold Mayweather at the peak of his promotional heft: now he will earn a nine-figure guarantee fighting a non-title bout against an opponent with no boxing experience on the pro or even senior amateur level. DiBella, who opened shop as a promoter in New York after departing HBO in 2000, remembers the young Mayweather as “a star in terms of ability but not in terms of popularity or recognition” – a precocious talent frustrated with the lack of traction he’d made after signing with Arum. As the network and fighter dug in over the contract extension, DiBella suggested they could walk down to Times Square, a one-avenue jaunt from HBO’s midtown Manhattan headquarters, and if people started stopping Mayweather on the street then the network would renegotiate. Mayweather never did sign the extension but the implication was clear: there is a difference between an elite boxer and an attraction. Just being good at what you do is not enough. One can only speculate where that demonstration fits into the origin story of Money Mayweather, the pantomime-villain persona that Floyd launched after buying himself out from Arum in 2007 for a lump sum of $750,000 and has since leveraged to untold riches. There is something to be admired about Mayweather’s ascent in a business that has traditionally conspired to exploit and defraud fighters for as long as anyone can remember, in the way he has leveraged his success to rewrite the rules for himself. Nearly all other boxers receive a contracted purse, with their promoters pocketing the rest. Not Mayweather, who has worked with an enigmatic adviser named Al Haymon – a Harvard-educated former concert promoter who obsessively keeps to the shadows – to develop a unique financial structure based on the exchange of upfront risk for back-end profit. Of course if it was that easy, everyone would do it. Some, such as Adrien Broner, have tried. But Mayweather did not hack the sport because he was brash or cocksure. It happened because he works harder than anybody else, from his impossibly rigorous training sessions to those famous 4am runs. Unlike so many of his fistic brethren who balloon up and down in weight between fights, Mayweather stays in fighting shape all year round; his is a deceptively monastic lifestyle. So much of Mayweather’s allure hinges on the zero in his loss ledger, that he has never been down or seriously hurt so much as lost a fight as a professional. Not until he turned heel eight years ago did the eight- and nine-figure paydays become the norm. The fact is, more fans will plunk down $99.95 on Saturday night to watch him lose than to watch him win. They are almost certain to come away disappointed. Mayweather spent his boxing career so far ahead of everyone else it was embarrassing. The proverbial “puncher’s chance” that is McGregor’s best hope is never less meaningful then against a slippery technician such as Floyd. No, this is yet another first for Mayweather: a valedictory lap for a fighter. Happy endings such as these are as rare as it gets in this cruel trade. As goes the timeworn chestnut: you don’t retire from boxing, boxing retires you. The decline is almost never gradual. The night when it becomes evident that a fighter no longer has what it takes to compete at the highest level it is often wildly brutal and dramatic, it is not signified by something as harmless as shooting 20% from the field or completing 10-of-35 passes with four interceptions. When it’s gone for a fighter, they find themselves positioned across from a very dangerous individual who is trying to hurt them. It is a life-threatening situation. Perhaps that is the fate that awaits Mayweather on Saturday night but the possibility is so astronomically remote that it is barely worth discussing. Instead, even if you despise the man and what he represents, it is time to doff your cap and send him on his way. The last laugh is Floyd’s – and surely he has earned it. “I still find it remarkable that this cocky little fucker, he was right,” DiBella said, with a laugh. “It’s nearly 20 years later and this kid still hasn’t lost and he’s amassed the biggest fortune that any fighter ever has in boxing.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/aug/28/line-queueing-money-priority-access-dunkirk","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-28T08:00:28Z","webTitle":"It’s the end of the line for queueing.

What’s replaced it is far worse","bodyText":"If you walked in late to Christopher Nolan’s Dunkirk and missed the passing reference to the Anglais, the first scene on the beaches would leave you in little doubt that this was a film about the British. Amid the horrors of war, with the threat of imminent death hanging in the air, the soldiers are shown standing in orderly lines, waiting to board the boats that aren’t even there yet. Queueing has become a symbol of Britain’s civilised, fair, quiet way of doing things. To undermine the queueing system is to undermine the national way of life. But that is precisely what is happening. Increasingly, if you’re prepared to pay, you can jump the line. For the private sector, this is an easy way to cash in on surplus demand. For example, by offering her fans the opportunity to boost their position in the concert ticket queue by buying more merchandise, Taylor Swift’s profits can rise without prices changing. Because this rewards real fans rather than the touts, Swift can also claim the moral high ground with some credibility. In contrast, there’s little to be said ethically in favour of services such as TaskRabbit which enable you to pay a modern-day servant to take your place in a line. More striking still is that public as well as private services are now abandoning one queue for all. At airports, those with cash in hand can get not only priority boarding but fast-track passport control. This is preferential treatment by the UK Border Agency, a department of the Home Office. Given that many governments even offer citizenship to people prepared to write large cheques, perhaps this should not be surprising. If all this outrages you, get in line. But while you wait there patiently, think about whether the queue is all it is cracked up to be. If it promotes a kind of fairness, it is very different from social justice. If we think we should give each according to their need, queueing is a very bad way to go about it. The person at the front of the soup kitchen line gets fed even if the one at the end is hungriest. The sprightly youth at boarding gate 5 gets to sit down before the pensioner with an arthritic hip. There is more genuine fairness in Mediterranean countries where people do not have the decency to queue but they do have the decency to not queue well. When buses arrive, for example, you don’t see groups of burly young men muscling their way to get on first. People generally give way to the weakest and frailest, irrespective of how long they have been waiting. To think of queueing as morally superior is to confuse fairness with orderliness, a particularly British mistake. It is no coincidence that the golden age of queueing was when the class system was still rigidly in place. Queues offered reassuring images of egalitarianism when the reality was anything but. Rich and poor rarely had to queue for the same things. No one needed to pay for speedy boarding because hoi polloi didn’t even fly. While workers queued up at turnstiles to enter racetrack enclosures, the well-to-do would be greeted with a tip of that hat as they waltzed into the grandstand. The orderly queue to cash a giro at the Post Office was always longer than the one to deposit a cheque at the smart bank. Queues only equalise the people in them, they do nothing to address the inequalities that put people in different lines in the first place. The rise of the brazen paid-for queue-jump is in part a manifestation of a wider democratisation and egalitarianism. It is only because so many of us now want the same desirable things that used to be for the few that demand is so high. What used to be organically rationed by class is now being allocated by cash. First come, first served may be a better principle than highest-bidder-takes-all, but neither is ideal. When none are more deserving of a particular good than another, forming a queue is inefficient. It leads to frustrations such as spending hours watching a computer screen announcing how many hundreds of people are ahead of you in the ticket queue, as I did today, only to end up with nothing at the end of it. The most egalitarian way to manage demand is by ballot. Nor is queueing the simple solution to the problem of money trumping need. When two people are in equal need of an operation, it is reasonable to treat the person who has waited longest first. But when one needs treatment much more than another, queue-jumping is not just morally acceptable, it’s desirable. Queueing has always been much more a pragmatic means of keeping order than an ethical practice to promote fairness. It is not therefore the end of queueing that should disturb us but the money-talks culture that has replaced it. • Julian Baggini is the author of Freedom Regained: The Possibility of Free Will"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"football/2017/aug/26/tottenham-hotspur-burnley-match-preview","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-26T08:00:31Z","webTitle":"Tottenham Hotspur v Burnley: match preview","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/aug/26/tottenham-hotspur-burnley-match-preview","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/aug/26/tottenham-hotspur-burnley-match-preview","fields":{"headline":"Tottenham Hotspur v Burnley: match preview","bodyText":"Burnley enjoyed themselves on their trip to London on the opening weekend when they stunned nine-man Chelsea and they intend to further Tottenham’s Wembley woes.

But Donald Trump has revived it","bodyText":"The word from the White House is that the events at Charlottesville are behind them now, and they’re ready to move on. Sure, there is still some fallout from the 12 August march by neo-Nazis, white supremacists and the Ku Klux Klan, as well as from Donald Trump’s subsequent declaration that those racists and fascists who carried flaming torches and swastika flags included some “very fine people”. There are reverberations too from the president’s initial non-condemnation condemnation, in which if he saw “hatred, bigotry and violence” at all, he saw it “on many sides”. One such aftershock came today, when Gary Cohn, Trump’s chief economic adviser, told the Financial Times the administration “must do better” in denouncing such groups unequivocally, and that, “as a Jewish-American”, he had considered resignation. Still, the message from Team Trump is that all this is in the past. They want the focus to switch to the legislative battles ahead, especially to their plan to give a gargantuan tax cut to the richest people and corporations in America. They might just get away with it. One of the dizzying lessons of this presidency is that outrage can be dulled by outrage, that fury at one atrocious act is hard to sustain if fury at another soon replaces it. Consider that only four weeks ago Trump all but called for police brutality, telling an audience of uniformed officers they had no need to treat suspects gently. Or that a week or so later he took the world to the brink of nuclear confrontation with North Korea. There is a numbing effect to the frequency of such horrors. We become punch-drunk. But if Trump succeeds in moving past Charlottesville, it won’t only be thanks to an unavoidable process of attrition that has worn liberals down. I’m afraid Trump’s opponents made a tactical error. He wanted to change the subject to the question of Confederate statues – and they let him. Days after those violent clashes had seen an antiracist protester murdered, the national conversation centred not on that act of terrorism but on which historical figures should be remembered, and how. Make no mistake, that’s an important argument. But it is inevitably a nuanced one that, as we have seen in Britain too, divides liberal opinion. Two people, equally fervent in their loathing of racism, might disagree on whether it’s better to remove a monument, or keep it as a reminder of a shaming past. And there will never be an easy consensus on where to draw the line. If owning slaves is the key criterion, should the statues of George Washington and Thomas Jefferson come down too? Trump’s opponents have spent much of the past two weeks talking about Confederate generals and US history, when they should have maintained a laser focus on the key and shocking point: that an American president spoke with sympathy and admiration for neo-Nazis; that he put these fascists on a moral par with those who oppose them; and that he was more animated in condemning what he called the alt-left than he ever was in lambasting those who parroted the slogans of the KKK, who brandished the symbols of white supremacism and who chanted: “Jews will not replace us.” These are the key facts that should shock every American and a watching world. And here’s what’s at stake. For 70 years, since the end of the second world war, a consensus held across the democratic world that seemed so obvious it barely needed stating. It declared that some ideas are beyond the pale, that certain beliefs are taboo because they are unconscionable. The key prohibition was on any ideology whose organising principle was genocidal racism. It meant, therefore, that even to use a phrase or image associated with the Nazi credo ensured instant ostracism: think of the periodic controversies over public figures accused of dressing up in Nazi regalia, replicating the “sieg heil” salute, or using the phrase “final solution”. Whatever else we might disagree on, all but a tiny, isolated fringe understood and accepted that Hitlerism was out of bounds. Incredibly, Trump has ditched that understanding. When he praised those marchers, he stomped all over that taboo. What’s more, and crucially, he has done it without paying a price. Cohn may have agonised privately, as perhaps have some other Trump aides. (It’s barely worth mentioning Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, who the novelists Michael Chabon and Ayelet Waldman predict will be remembered as one of the Jewish people’s “greatest traitors and greatest fools”.) But not one of them has resigned. A few Republicans have rebuked him. But the collective repudiation of Trump that this act surely merited has not come. It is this non-reaction that announces that the Nazi taboo is dead. Now it’s clear that it can be broken without consequence, it has lost its force. Indeed, the effect of Trump’s action is to have opened up the veins of the US, allowing the poison of the far right to flow into the bloodstream. A poll taken after Charlottesville found that 9% of Americans believe holding neo-Nazi or white supremacist views is acceptable. That’s 30 million people. It never used to be this way. When the KKK burned a cross on the lawn of a black home in Maryland in 1982, Ronald and Nancy Reagan visited the Butler family to reassure them that the racists did not represent America. And now the man sitting in Reagan’s chair praises those who wear the Klan’s robes as “very fine people”. All this is a cue for Trump’s opponents to redouble their efforts to bring this horrific presidency to an end. But it is also a warning against our own complacency. We may have believed that the tacit prohibition on Nazi ideas was sufficiently entrenched that it no longer needed defending. The history is taught in schools, and replayed in endless TV documentaries. But when almost one in 10 Americans see no problem in the ideology of a movement that killed tens of millions – and that sought the total eradication of a specific group, namely Jews, from the face of the earth – then the task is clear. We need to teach the darkest chapter in human history with renewed vigour, as if for the first time. And we have to do it with the urgent understanding that this is no longer about the past – but about averting a deadly future."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/aug/27/my-gran-was-a-raving-tory-and-a-lovely-woman","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-26T23:05:49Z","webTitle":"I’m friends with all sorts… my dear gran was a Tory","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/aug/27/my-gran-was-a-raving-tory-and-a-lovely-woman","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/aug/27/my-gran-was-a-raving-tory-and-a-lovely-woman","fields":{"headline":"I’m friends with all sorts… my dear gran was a Tory","bodyText":"August is a cruel mistress to politicians. Silly season means that if you say anything you will find yourself splashed all over the papers. This week Labour MP Laura Pidcock said that she would not be friends with a Tory. The reaction to this story would have most people thinking that she had expressed a desire to steal the first-born children of anyone who had ever voted Conservative. And Laura found herself, as we all have, having to clarify her statement – asserting that she is a grown woman who knows that in Westminster she needs alliances to win battles, but won’t be necking champagne at the Conservative black and white ball any time soon. I was briefly in Westminster last week, accidentally on the day that Big Ben binged its final bong for four years. My husband, children and I found ourselves in a scrum of lobby journalists desperate to tell the story of MPs saddened by the event. There weren’t any. Still, a woman approached us from the Daily Mail and declared her credentials; my husband responded to hearing the name of her employer by pulling a face that could sour milk. Later I scolded him for his rudeness: “You might not like the Daily Mail but she was simply trying to do her job.” I told him that in Westminster we are all trying to do a job and we have to rub along together, often with people we deeply dislike. He made apologetic noises for his open rudeness but stayed firmly of the view that he could never appease, with generosity of spirit, someone who chose to work in an establishment he deems abhorrent. I told him that this is exactly how lots of people treat me. We settled on a view that civility but mistrust was the most appropriate response. In real life, my husband is friends with lots of people who read the Mail, as am I. My paternal grandma was a raving Thatcherite, one who had a xenophobic turn of phrase for most proceedings. “Dear God, girl, you sound like a German drinking pea soup,” she would say if I ate noisily. She was also the most generous woman I have ever met, who rolled up her sleeves for her community quicker than most. She was best mates with my maternal nan, who was as socialist as the day is long and an active anti-racism campaigner. What united them was so much bigger than their choice of newspaper. They were hard-as-nails working-class women with a sense of fairness, family and community that united their world view everywhere but the ballot box. They laughed with each other and rolled their eyes at each other in equal measure. I don’t know how all of my friends vote; it doesn’t come up. But it would be a lie to say that I don’t surround myself with people who have a similar moral code to mine. This is not to say that we don’t fall out about politics all the time. There is no one in the world I argue with more than my dad, even though we agree on most things. Our relationship is typical father/daughter (or typical at least in a political family). He plays the role of old-guard leftwing ideologue, I play the petulant zeitgeist-obsessed sulky teen that he will never understand. Personally, I find the decisions and actions of my Tory colleagues appalling, but I also know plenty of Labour voters who are less than perfect. My mother used to say: “Voting Tory is like reading the last page of a novel before beginning the story.” Tame by modern standards of hateful insults, but to her this was the worst kind of gratification-obsessed behaviour. It also perfectly sums up how, from our different bunkers, we simply cannot understand why some people behave in a certain way. I guess, for me, I have learned that life is more interesting if I befriend different sorts of people, and then do as I do with all the people I truly love – row a lot and spend a lifetime taking the piss out of them. How to keep women safe on trains Being in France means that I am surrounded by examples of nationalised services that work. While I think that few Brits would consider subsidised cinema tickets (my sister-in-law genuinely works in a state cinema) a priority, I think, for many, the argument of nationalised transport is won. The Labour party is good on trains. It is a bit baffling to me, then, why last week’s Labour train stories seem to have been for the few, not the many. This might be the only time I ever do this, but I shall cut Chris Williamson MP some slack. He said something ill thought out, not in his area of expertise, in a slow news week. And the suggestion that women-only carriages might be a good idea was roundly dismissed by all, including Jeremy Corbyn. My favourite argument against it was that we don’t try to tackle rising racial hate crime by segregating black people. I received a series of emails on the subject, with one suggestion of a gropers’ carriage, where gropers and those who want to be groped can get it on. I fear, however, that gropers would have to settle for groping each other. I’ll stick with the tried and tested solution of more train guards, good CCTV on trains and actually prosecuting the crime. I realise my suggestions are less amusingly Carry On, but they work and help explain why reporting of this crime has gone up enough to cause this furore. Please God, let this be the end of this nonsense. Then we had the resurfacing of the Corbyn-sits-on-the-floor “Traingate” incident after some new footage was released – which seemed to be a relatively self-indulgent chance for Corbyn fans (not the man himself) to go on about Corbyn rather than the issue. It seemed very much like feasting ground for the few. The Labour party is good on trains; let’s stick to policy, not pantomime. My family’s love story helped out May on migration I’m writing this in France, where I’m staying with my brother and his family. He met his French wife Julie while they were studying in Glasgow. Figures last week have shown that it turns out foreign students are not sticking around in the UK as much as our prime minister had said. Just like them, Julie didn’t overstay in our green and pleasant land; on the contrary, when she returned to France, she took one of ours with her. Instead of lying about people like my sister-in-law, Theresa May should have given her a sticker that said: “I came to the UK and improved the net migration figures.” My brother moans about how long his French citizenship paperwork is taking, and I lament that he now needs to bother to do this. He’s lived in France for 13 years and raised two kids who speak perfect English with a Birmingham accent. He won’t ever come home, but stresses that he will always be British and a proud Brummie. I wonder why so many people felt that their Britishness was so fragile. Theresa May felt so fragile about hers that she fiddled the books to make it seem like she loved our country. I’m certain that my migrant Franglais family love it and its people much more.

I know London was one of his favourites,” explained his sister Tyka Nelson. “It’s the perfect place to start the exhibition.” My Name is Prince is at the O2, in London, from 27 October. Imagining the Divine Already billed as “unmissable” by the great Mary Beard, this show, at Oxford’s Ashmolean museum from 19 October, examines the artistic roots of five major world religions; Christ, it will be revealed, was once portrayed as clean-shaven, while Buddha was represented by mere footprints and hands. Simon Rattle and Akram Khan Two great homecomings for leading British talent are ahead: Simon Rattle’s arrival from Berlin to take up the baton as music director of the London Symphony Orchestra is marked by This is Rattle, 11 days of special concerts at the Barbican Centre, LSO St Luke’s and the Guildhall School’s Milton Court concert hall, while, for ballet fans, Akram Khan’s acclaimed Giselle returns to Sadler’s Wells on 20 September, before travelling to the Liverpool Empire. Duchamp, Dalí and Basquiat Big autumn art shows abound, with Duchamp and Dalí arriving at the Royal Academy on 3 October, Cézanne at the National Gallery from 26 October, and the work of the late New York artist Jean-Michel Basquiat explodes on to the walls of the Barbican’s gallery from 21 September in Basquiat: Boom for Real, his first major show in this country. Yet a strong pull is exerted too from outside London, with the reopening of Tate St Ives on 14 October. British sculptor Rebecca Warren, a 2006 Turner prize nominee, will fill the new Cornish space with her first solo show in a national museum. The unseen work includes large bronzes, steel and neon figures and collages. Hamilton The scrum surrounding the opening of the Broadway mega-hit Hamilton at the Victoria Palace threatens to dominate the West End from November. Less high-profile but equally safe artistic bets include Hull Truck theatre’s staging of Tanika Gupta’s adaptation of A Short History of Tractors in Ukrainian in the UK City of Culture and James Graham’s new political jousting match Labour of Love. But interest is surely most piqued by Prism, Terry Johnson’s new play, starring Robert Lindsay and Claire Skinner, about British cinematographer Jack Cardiff, at the Hampstead theatre. Lindsay plays Cardiff, “the man who made women look beautiful”, from 6 September. Larry David Autumn cheer is heading your way in the rumpled form of comic anti-hero Larry David. “The world needs him now more than ever,” reads the Sky Atlantic tagline as the network, despite the hacking and leaking of a few of the 10 new episodes, prepares to launch a ninth series of HBO’s dyspeptic Curb Your Enthusiasm from 1 October. Many of Curb’s key supporting actors are involved, with appearances expected from Jeff Garlin, Susie Essman and Cheryl Hines, as well as from Ted Danson, Mary Steenburgen and Richard Lewis, who all play themselves again. Science Cassini’s final mission On 15 September US space engineers will send their giant probe Cassini – which has been studying the planet Saturn and its moons for almost two decades – on its final manoeuvre. They will direct the craft to spiral into the planet’s atmosphere where it will be destroyed – bringing to an end one of the most successful planetary missions ever undertaken. Cassini’s achievements included the release of a small, European-built probe, Huygens, which landed successfully on Saturn’s largest moon, Titan, revealing the seas of ethane and methane that cover its surface. The Naked Ape is 50 The 50th anniversary of the publication of The Naked Ape falls on 12 October. In the book, zoologist Desmond Morris wrote about humans in the same way that scientists describe other animals – thus offending a great many sensibilities. Among Morris’s claims was the assertion that Homo sapiens not only has the largest brain of all higher primates, but also the highest ratio of penis size to body mass – while the more rounded shape of human female breasts means they are mainly a sexual signalling device rather than simply a means for providing milk for infants. Expect more controversy as the anniversary approaches. Drug resistance: the fightback At least 700,000 people a year die from drug-resistant infections, and if nothing is done this number could rise to 10 million a year by 2050, costing the global economy up to $100 trillion and pushing a further 28.3 million people into extreme poverty. That is the background to a major international conference – held in Berlin on 12-13 October – that has been set up by the Wellcome Trust, the UN and the UK government. The aim is to coordinate a cohesive international campaign backed by government, private and philanthropic sources to halt the spread of anti-microbial resistance. Gene editing humans Results from one of the most controversial scientific projects of recent years – the use of gene editing techniques to alter the makeup of human embryos – are expected to be released before Christmas. The work, approved by the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (the fertility treatment regulator), will be carried out by biologist Kathy Niakan at the Francis Crick Institute, London. She plans to alter genes active in the days after fertilisation; experiments cease after seven days, and the embryos destroyed. The aim is to help develop treatments for infertility. Robin McKie Sport The Ashes England’s efforts to defend the urn start in Brisbane on 23 November: a tough ask because 1) Australia haven’t lost a Test there since 1988; 2) It will be sub-tropical. In an effort to acclimatise, the pre-Ashes friendlies include a four-day affair in the heat of Townsville in northern Queensland. The series, on BT these days rather than Sky, is preceded by the Women’s Ashes: Australia adapting to life without injured star Meg Lanning. The first women’s one-day international is on 22 October, also in Brisbane. World Cup qualifiers Russia 2018 is looming. England, first in European qualifying Group F, play Malta on Friday in the first of their final four games; Scotland in fourth go to Lithuania. In Group D, third-placed Wales face Austria on Saturday; the Republic of Ireland in second go to Georgia. And Northern Ireland, second in C, play San Marino on Friday. Nine European group winners qualify, the best eight runners-up facing play-offs in November. The draw for the finals is at the Kremlin on 1 December. Autumn internationals Four months after the home unions united for the Lions rugby tour, they split again for the fierce end-of-year series. The backdrop has shifted hemispheres, too: England hosting Australia, Argentina and Samoa at Twickenham in November; Scotland facing Samoa, New Zealand and Australia at Murrayfield; Wales playing Australia, Georgia, New Zealand and South Africa at the Principality; and Ireland facing South Africa, Fiji and Argentina at the Aviva Stadium. Raising the curtain: the 4 November unofficial Lions decider, the Barbarians versus the All Blacks. Premier League It’s that time of year when title contenders start to strut or stumble, and managers start being sacked. Among the key autumn fixtures: Chelsea hosting Manchester City on 30 September then Manchester United on 5 November; Liverpool playing Chelsea at Anfield on 25 November; and, on 9 December, a pre-Christmas six-pointer/festive personality clash: José Mourinho versus Pep Guardiola in the Manchester derby at Old Trafford. Expect hype. US Open tennis With the heavily pregnant Serena Williams absent, the women’s competition in New York is as open as it was at Wimbledon, with one notable addition: 2006 champion Maria Sharapova making her first grand slam appearance since her 15-month drug ban. In the men’s event, Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal face a field minus the injured Novak Djokovic, Milos Raonic, Stan Wawrinka and Kei Nishikori. Andy Murray is second seed – but how will his hip hold up? It all starts tomorrow. David Hills Trends Belt up It’s a subtle thing, the difference between the way you’ll wear your coat when it gets cold next month, compared with the way you wore it last winter. And the difference is the belt. Wide or thin, cinched tight over massive coats, as well as dainty jumpers, wafty dresses and even shirts, this season you use a belt like control underwear. If you need to hold your coat together and also hold your keys, thanks to Gucci, bumbags are back too. In vogue After 25 years as editor, Alexandra Shulman announced her “Vrexit” in January, but it’s not until November that we’ll see the first issue under Edward Enninful, the first black, and first male, editor in the magazine’s 100-year history. He has hired film-maker Steve McQueen and models Naomi Campbell, Kate Moss and Adwoa Aboah as contributing editors and, in what the Times described as a “posh girl exodus”, said goodbye to many Vogue veterans. Free from ... We’ve been saying it for a while, but this time, THIS time, it’s true. There’s a huge growth in demand for vegetarian, vegan and “free from” options. This Christmas is set to be turkey-free for more families in the UK than ever before. Expect more vegan street food festivals, and watch as ingredients such as jackfruit (a breadfruit family native to south India, widely used as a meat alternative) get a supermarket push. Mindful drinking Raise a glass to “mindful drinking”. Young people are drinking less than their parents (fewer than half of those aged 16 to 24 report drinking alcohol in the previous week compared with 66% of those aged 45 to 64) and helping usher in this new form of mindfulness. It’s not quite teetotalism, it’s not quite… not. There are mindful pub crawls, around venues with decent selections of low-alcohol drinks, and since a mindful drinking festival in August, a whole community of gentle drinkers is beginning to emerge. Hats! Honestly, wear a hat. They’ll be everywhere, after Dior’s leather berets, Loewe’s bread printed sou’westers and Coach’s furry caps. Also: socks. If you’re not already wearing socks, wear socks. This season is basically your nan hassling you before you leave for the park. Eva Wiseman UK politics Brexit talks resume in Brussels There’s so much to get through in Brexit negotiations in so little time that even before August is over talks resume in Brussels on Monday. The EU’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, has said he will not allow any discussion of trade issues until substantial progress has been made on the thorny matters of money, the Irish border and the rights of EU citizens in the UK post-Brexit. But there is no sign of agreement on any of these issues as the clock ticks towards an EU exit in March 2019. The time for both sides to make hard choices is approaching just as the full complexity starts to dawn. Labour conference in Brighton After a better-than-expected result in June’s snap general election, Jeremy Corbyn will receive a hero’s welcome from Labour supporters in Brighton (from 24 September), even from a good many who doubted him. The party will, though, want to look forward as well as back. Tory conference in Manchester By contrast Theresa May will arrive in Manchester on 1 October with her political tail between her legs. The damaging June election and Brexit divides the Conservatives more by the day. Any hint that May is backing away from the “hard Brexit” she promoted a year ago will anger the right of her party. Last year she looked all-powerful during the conference season. This year she needs the speech of her life to shore up her weakened power base. Philip Hammond’s second budget The chancellor has replaced autumn statements with a full budget. No date has yet been set for this year’s, but it will be a key event. Hammond messed up his first budget and had to perform a hasty U-turn on reforms to national insurance within days. Since then he has made himself unpopular with many in his own party by pushing for a pro-business, soft Brexit and warning of disastrous consequences unless transitional agreements are reached. May’s election fiasco, paradoxically, saved Hammond from the sack (she was too weak to get rid of him). His second budget will be a key test of the economy’s – and Hammond’s – resilience as Brexit approaches, and of whether the Chancellor himself has continued to repair his power base at May’s expense. Toby Helm Global politics Fall of Raqqa The fall of the Islamic State’s most important stronghold in Syria is said to be imminent. After Isis was ousted from its Iraqi bastion in Mosul, this will mark a decisive end to the group’s claims to establish a new caliphate. But it will not be the end of Isis. And the fall of Raqqa will set the stage for a struggle to control territory by the Syrian regime and a host of outside players, including Russia, Iran, Turkey and the US. Showdown at UN assembly Donald Trump and Emmanuel Macron will both deliver maiden speeches on 19 September to the UN general assembly – historically a platform for politicians who aspire to global leadership. It will be high theatre and a study in contrasts: the US president vowing to break from the customary civilities and assert US superiority against a young, urbane European urging a resumption of collective effort to save the planet. German elections It’s now Germany’s turn to weather the dyspeptic mood rippling across Europe. On 24 September, Angela Merkel and her Christian Democratic Union should emerge from parliamentary elections as the strongest force, followed by some distance by the Social Democrats. The anti-immigrant AfD has been on the wane since the peak of the refugee crisis, but it could still cross the 5% threshold for guaranteed Bundestag representation. China’s 19th Party Congress One of the most carefully orchestrated political events on earth is likely to be a raw display of power this October/ November. It will consolidate Xi Jinping’s grip on power as China’s most powerful leader since Mao Zedong, and comes at a time when China is asserting its role as a global power player, challenging the US and its allies in the Pacific. Centenary of the Russian revolution It is called the October Revolution, because Tsarist Russia was using the Julian calendar at the time. On 7 November – 100 years on from the turning point in world history that ushered in the 70-year Soviet experiment – Russians will have a lot to reflect on. And for once, their government will not be telling them what to think.

One Muslim organisation proclaimed: “Good riddance.” Gorka’s hardline views on immigration and terrorism were a source of discord inside the Trump administration and beyond. On Friday night, he told the Associated Press he had quit. An unnamed administration official, however, said Gorka did not resign but “no longer works at the White House”. Activists had been calling for Gorka, known for his illiberal views on immigration and terrorism, to follow his friend and fellow hardliner Steve Bannon, Trump’s chief strategist who quit the administration a week earlier and returned to the conservative Breitbart News. Farhana Khera, executive director of the group Muslim Advocates, said: “Good riddance to Sebastian Gorka. Muslim Advocates has vocally advocated for his ouster from the very beginning, because, even in a White House crawling with white supremacists, Gorka stood out for his consistent and lifelong commitment to anti-Muslim and antisemitic causes.” Vanita Gupta, president of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, a coalition of more than 200 groups, said: “Sebastian Gorka’s departure is long overdue and welcome, but he should not have been working in the White House in the first place. No one who supports white supremacy and neo-Nazi ideas should be serving in this or any administration.” Richard Painter, former chief White House ethics lawyer for president George W Bush, tweeted: “Gorka: Probably the most stupid of the alt-right in the White House.” Gorka, 46, is a US citizen born in Britain to Hungarian parents. A former editor at Breitbart, he joined the administration as a counterterrorism adviser. But he was not part of the National Security Council and his responsibilities and relevant experience remained nebulous. On Saturday, the Axios website described him as “a bombastic White House aide known only to cable-news viewers”, although his British accent also became familiar to watchers of the BBC. Axios also reported: “Trump raved about Gorka’s performances, telling colleagues he had no idea what Gorka actually did but loved him on TV.” Gorka, who clashed with national security adviser HR McMaster, declined to discuss the reasons he left the White House but pointed toward excerpts from a resignation letter posted by the Federalist website. He wrote to Trump: “Regrettably, outside of yourself, the individuals who most embodied and represented the policies that will ‘Make America Great Again’ have been internally countered, systematically removed, or undermined in recent months. “This was made patently obvious as I read the text of your speech on Afghanistan this week … The fact that those who drafted and approved the speech removed any mention of radical Islam or radical Islamic terrorism proves that a crucial element of your presidential campaign has been lost.” Gorka, who has previously worn a medal awarded to the Hungarian group Vitezi Rend, linked by some to Nazi collaborators, appears to be the latest casualty of a purge by the new chief of staff, John Kelly, in an attempt to impose discipline on the West Wing chaos. Recent departures include Bannon, chief of staff Reince Priebus, press secretary Sean Spicer and communications director Anthony Scaramucci, who lasted just 10 days in the role. Gorka quickly changed his Twitter home page, introducing a new photo and describing himself as an “irregular warfare strategist”. He tweeted a parody wartime poster, “Keep calm and MAGA on” – a reference to Trump’s slogan “Make America great again”. Responding to a user’s comment that Gorka was now unleashed, he replied with a reference to the 1981 version of Clash of the Titans: “You make me sound like the KRAKEN. Love that movie!”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"}]}}
