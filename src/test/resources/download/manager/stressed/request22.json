If the church was a school, “it would have been closed down a long time ago”, David Greenwood, a lawyer representing survivors, said on the final day of three weeks of hearings focusing on abuse in the diocese of Chichester. The C of E had proved itself “incapable of self-governance in the care of children”, he added. He urged independent oversight of safeguarding and for the reporting of allegations and disclosures of abuse to be made mandatory. Evidence had been given of “collusion and cover-up among clergy”, and the inquiry heard that abusers were a “tribe” who looked out for one another, he said. In his closing statement, Richard Scorer, another lawyer representing survivors, said the hearings had been the first opportunity for his clients to be properly heard. Although the inquiry had focused on abuse in Chichester, perpetrators existed in every diocese, he said. “These offenders are everywhere.” The C of E had “deep-seated cultural and structural problems” regarding safeguarding, and “changing that will take generations”. He also called for independent oversight and mandatory reporting. An independent body must have “the power to enforce action over the heads of bishops,” he added. When considering big changes in society over the past few decades, such as protecting minorities from discrimination or dealing with drink-driving, “what embedded them in the culture, and normalised them in the culture … was the fact of some legal compulsion, the fact there was a legal consequence if you didn’t do it”. Addressing the panel, he said: “Survivors that you have heard from in these hearings have lost years of their lives trying to challenge the church and get the church to change, and it would be a tragedy if another generation of survivors have to undergo that same experience. So we urge you to act and put in place effective measures to ensure this never happens again.” Nigel Giffin QC, the lead counsel for the C of E, reiterated the “unqualified apology” for the church’s failures issued by Justin Welby, the archbishop of Canterbury, when giving evidence earlier this week. Giffin acknowledged “reluctance or outright failure” to report abuse, and a church culture of blaming other people for shortcomings. Apologies must be followed through with action, he added. The inquiry will convene again in July to examine the church’s handling of abuse by Peter Ball, the former bishop of Lewes who was jailed in 2015."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2018/mar/23/stepping-up-for-the-homeless-at-the-opera","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-23T16:41:57Z","webTitle":"Stepping up for the homeless at the opera | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/mar/23/stepping-up-for-the-homeless-at-the-opera","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/mar/23/stepping-up-for-the-homeless-at-the-opera","fields":{"headline":"Stepping up for the homeless at the opera","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"As Chris Addison says (Journal, 21 March), opera does not only to belong to the privileged elite. I am involved with an organisation called Streetwise Opera, founded by Matt Peacock over 15 years ago. The aim is to use opera to transform lives, mainly working with homeless people. There are weekly workshops in several cities across the UK, two of which are in Manchester. Matt had been working at a homeless centre, and saw an article where a politician had said: “The homeless? Aren’t they the people you step over when you are coming out of the opera.” He decided to turn this image of opera on its head, and bring the most elite art form to some of the most marginalised and deprived people in society. We have two workshop leaders in each group, all of whom are opera singers. All participants are currently or recently homeless. Some are from other vulnerable groups, eg those with mental health problems. We do not attend to discuss our hardships, but to lose ourselves in singing opera. I have attended in Manchester for almost four years. In that time, my confidence has grown exponentially. We also have opportunities to attend theatres, classical music concerts and operas. We also perform opera every few months, and the aim is to produce quality work. We staged The Passion, an immersive opera based on Bach’s St Matthew Passion, in Manchester two years ago. We worked alongside the world-renowned choir the Sixteen and Harry Christophers. It was televised on BBC4. I played Jesus in Gethsemane. My self-esteem soared! People are given a voice when no one ever listened before, and treated as equals. I have seen many people blossom as they put all they have into their singing. We see how high the human spirit can climb when given the chance. There is now an international movement called With One Voice, which aims to use the arts to enhance the lives of homeless people. It is working. We recently attended an opera and I heard an old man, who had never had a chance to go to the theatre before, say: “This is brilliant. I thought this kind of music was just for posh people!” Wonderful! Anita Ferguson Bolton • Opera receives a disproportionate amount of public subsidy compared to other art forms. In a time of continued austerity, there are two opera houses in London, soaking up substantial public funding. The Arts Council’s funding decisions are based on the bounded rationality of the past. The lack of art form policies guiding funding decisions has bedevilled the arts in England since the instigation of the National Portfolio bidding process in 2012. The National Portfolio scheme was an abrogation of the Arts Council’s duty to ensure funding by art form on an equitable basis. The result is that in 2018/19, opera will receive £57.1m, of which 32.5% will be spent outside London. Classical music will receive £19m of which 55% is allocated to the English regions, and jazz will receive a total of £1.6m, of which 30% is spent outside London; 3.4 million people attend classical music concerts, 2.1 million attend jazz concerts and 1.7 million attend opera. Chris Hodgkins London • Thank you, Chris Addison, for helping to combat the myth of elitist opera. Prices for the forthcoming Rolling Stones concerts at the London Stadium range from £100 to £273. Tickets for the current performances of Verdi’s Macbeth at Covent Garden, with diva assoluta Anna Netrebko, range from £17 to £245. Alec Nacamuli London • In the 40s my parents – dad a gardener, mum a shop assistant – did their “courting” by going to the opera. In the 70s they had season tickets to Scottish Opera and greatly enjoyed opera until mum died. Dad continued to enjoy opera and made trips to Verona. Not your typical opera lovers? Margaret Vandecasteele Wick, Caithness • Speaking of trade unions (Letters, 21 March), I’ve yet to read any coverage of the daily protests at the dismissal of six cleaners/porters from the Royal Opera House, London, organised by the Cleaners and Allied Independent Workers Union. Joining them in solidarity recently, as the visibly well-heeled arrived for a performance, was a stark illustration of the inequity ravaging this country.

On Monday the scientist received the devastating news that Sudan, the last male of the species, had been put down in his northern Kenyan home, aged 45. Hildebrandt’s office is full of pictures of him, on which he points out the species’ unique pearl-like skin, furry ears, huge feet for tackling swamps, and horns capable of lifting two tons. “We were extremely sad,” Hildebrandt said. “He was old and very sick, and we knew the day would come, but I’d known him for 18 years and he was the gentlest of creatures who had become an important ambassador for species protection,” he said. Hildebrandt has short videos of Sudan in his final weeks of life that the rhino’s carers in Ol Pejeta conservancy sent him so that he could follow his decline – he gradually stopped eating and walking, whereupon the decision was made to put him down. Sudan did not live to see another northern white rhino being born, despite efforts to mate him in Kenya with southern white rhinos to at least produce a hybrid. But Hildebrandt said he is very hopeful that the last two remaining members of his species, Fatu and Najin, his 28-year-old daughter and 18-year-old granddaughter, will. Prof Hildebrandt is head of reproduction management at the Leibniz Institute for Zoo and Wildlife Research in the eastern suburbs of Berlin. He holds the keys to rescuing the species, discovered in Belgian Congo by the British geologist Richard Lydekker in 1908, when there were hundreds of thousands of the animals, before it was hunted to virtual extinction for its valuable horn. Unlocking the door of a nondescript concrete block at the institute this week, Hildebrandt showed off a cryogenic tank in which 300ml of northern white rhino semen is stored in liquid nitrogen at -196C. Hildebrandt has been collecting the samples with colleagues for about 15 years. He couldn’t expose the samples, “because it’s just too delicate,” he said, “it’s truly priceless. Part of the world’s cultural heritage.” The tank sits next to many others in the high-security complex – a potential treasure trove of samples including semen of the cancer-resistant naked mole rat, disease materials, tumours and microbes – that could provide the answer to some of the world’s diseases. Following the death of Sudan, the rhinos are uppermost in his mind. In what he calls a race against time, he plans to deploy IVF techniques and fly to Kenya to collect eggs from the ageing females, Fatu and Najin, in May or June via a method called ovum pick-up. The incubated eggs will be flown from Ol Pejeta via Nairobi to Zurich and then onto Cremona in Italy where Cesare Galli, who specialises in assisted reproduction of large animals, will mature and fertilise them and develop embryos suitable for transfer. They will then be implanted in southern white rhino surrogates – neither Fatu nor Najin are able to carry calves themselves – in the hope they will carry them to full term. “It’s very foreseeable in the near future that we’ll have offspring,” Hildebrandt said. Even if Hildebrandt and his team manage to produce a lot of offspring from the two females using IVF with the frozen semen they have, they will be unable to achieve the necessary biological variety to create a long-term sustainable population, he said. Which is where stem cell research is crucial. Within the next three to five years the institute should be able to use skin cell samples taken in 2014 from Sudan and other northern white rhinos, add genes to them in order to turn them into stem-cells, and encourage them to become eggs. These would be fertilised with the sperm samples stored by Hildebrandt to create test-tube rhinos which southern white rhino surrogates would, it is hoped, carry to term, producing genetically-variable offspring. The brains behind the stem cell technology are those of Katsuhiko Hayashi who in 2016 made headlines after he successfully used mice stem cells to grow eggs which produced healthy offspring. “This technology will provides us with the missing link,” Hildebrandt said. When asked why it matters, and is there not an argument for seeing extinction as part of evolution, Hildebrandt becomes irate. “It is very arrogant to ask why this is important,” he said. “We humans kill a species in its very fragile habitat, and then ask: ‘why is it important to rescue it?’ This animal is at the end of a complex biological system. Its faeces provides food for thousands of insects, its skin living space for ox picker birds, the branches it breaks down through walking through the jungle provides food for antelopes and produces pathways to escape from leopards. It is like a landscape architect on which many species are dependent. “We learnt a bit about disturbed ecosystems through the ebola and AIDS crises. We don’t know what the long-term effect on the ecosystem might be, but we definitely disturb it by removing such an animal.” Given its potential for success and the way it has captured the public imagination after Sudan’s death, it is a surprise to discover that the rhino preservation project is something most of the scientists involved are mainly doing in their spare time. “Everything would have been a little faster had we had solid financing,” Hildebrandt said. “We’re not running out of money, the truth is we never had any money for this.” The institute is trying to use the momentum created by Sudan’s death to galvanise support. “A 10-year-old girl donated the €100 from her piggy bank towards our work this week. So kids really recognise the importance of this, even if politicians don’t,” Hildebrandt said. “After all, if this works, it could have a huge impact as a role model for other extinct or near-extinct species.” At the end of April Hildebrandt will travel to Borneo to try a similar strategy to save the Sumatran rhino of which there are as few as 30 left.

Kiko Matthews arrived in Barbados on Thursday after 50 days at sea, beating the previous record by almost a week, although official timings have not yet been released. Matthews was diagnosed in 2009 with Cushing’s disease – caused by a tumour on the pituitary gland at the base of the brain – and had a second tumour last year. The former science teacher, who left her job to help found the charity The Big Stand and a paddle-boarding business, had symptoms including memory loss, insomnia and osteoporosis during her illness. She had never rowed before taking on the 2,800-mile challenge, which began in Gran Canaria. As she stepped off the boat, the 36-year-old from Herefordshire said she hoped her story would inspire others. “The thought that eight months ago I was lying in hospital having my brain operated on, and now I am here having rowed the Atlantic, I guess I am a bit proud,” Matthews said. “I have shown that anyone can attempt anything given the right attitude, belief and support. I want to use my story to inspire women to challenge themselves.” Her journey has raised more than £70,000 to help build an intensive care unit at King’s College hospital in London, where she received life-saving treatment. In a message on her fundraising page, she said: “Hello everyone! Back on dry land … I did it, I have rowed the 3,000 nautical miles from Gran Canaria to Barbados. “I have met my personal challenge to become the fastest female to row the Atlantic, solo and unsupported.” The previous record for a female rower was 56 days.

Such is the rate of decline that the risks posed by biodiversity loss should be considered on the same scale as those of climate change, noted the authors of the UN-backed report, which was released in Medellin, Colombia on Friday. Among the standout findings are that exploitable fisheries in the world’s most populous region – the Asia-Pacific – are on course to decline to zero by 2048; that freshwater availability in the Americas has halved since the 1950s and that 42% of land species in Europe have declined in the past decade. Underscoring the grim trends, this report was released in the week that the decimation of French bird populations was revealed, as well as the death of the last male northern white rhinoceros, leaving the species only two females from extinction. “The time for action was yesterday or the day before,” said Robert Watson, the chair of the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) which compiled the research. “Governments recognise we have a problem. Now we need action, but unfortunately the action we have now is not at the level we need.” “We must act to halt and reverse the unsustainable use of nature or risk not only the future we want but even the lives we currently lead,” he added. Divided into four regional reports, the study of studies has been written by more than 550 experts from over 100 countries and taken three years to complete. Approved by the governments of 129 members nations, the IPBES reports aim to provide a knowledge base for global action on biodiversity in much the same way that the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change is used by policymakers to set carbon emission targets. Although poaching often grabs the headlines for the demise of the rhino and other animals, worldwide the biggest threats to nature are from habitat loss, invasive species, chemicals and climate change. Conversion of forests to croplands and wetlands to shrimp farms has fed a human population that has more than doubled since the 1960s, but at a devastating cost to other species – such as pollinating insects and oxygen-producing plants – on which our climate, economy and well-being depend. In the Americas, more than 95% of high-grass prairies have been transformed into farms, along with 72% of dry forests and 88% of the Atlantic forests, notes the report. The Amazon rainforest is still mostly intact, but it is rapidly diminishing and degrading along with an even faster disappearing cerrado (tropical savannah). Between 2003 to 2013, the area under cultivation in Brazil’s northeast agricultural frontier more than doubled to 2.5m hectares, according to the report. “The world has lost over 130m hectares of rainforests since 1990 and we lose dozens of species every day, pushing the Earth’s ecological system to its limit,” said Achim Steiner, administrator of the UN Development Programme. “Biodiversity and the ecosystem services it supports are not only the foundation for our life on Earth, but critical to the livelihoods and well-being of people everywhere.” The rate of decline is moreover accelerating. In the Americas – which has about 40% of the world’s remaining biodiversity – the regional population is gobbling up resources at twice the rate of the global average. Despite having 13% of the people on the planet, it is using a quarter of the resources, said Jake Rice, a co-chair of the Americas assessment. Since the start of colonisation by Europeans 500 years ago, he said 30% of biodiversity has been lost in the region. This will rise to 40% in the next 10 years unless policies and behaviours are transformed. “It will take fundamental change in how we live as individuals, communities and corporations,” he said. “We keep making choices to borrow from the future to live well today. We need a different way of thinking about economics with a higher accountability of the costs in the future to the benefits we take today,” Rice said. “It’s because of us,” added Mark Rounsevell, co-chair of the European assessment. “We are responsible for all of the declines of biodiversity. We need to decouple economic growth from degradation of nature. We need to measure wealth beyond economic indicators. GDP only goes so far.” The authors stressed the close connection between climate change and biodiversity loss, which are adversely affecting each other. By 2050, they believe climate change could replace land-conversion as the main driver of extinction. In many regions, the report says current biodiversity trends are jeopardising UN global development goals to provide food, water, clothing and housing. They also weaken natural defences against extreme weather events, which will become more common due to climate change. Although the number of conservation areas has increased, most governments are failing to achieve the biodiversity targets set at the 2010 UN conference in Aichi, Japan. In the Americas, only 20% of key biodiversity areas are protected. The authors urged an end to subsidies for agriculture and energy that are encouraging unsustainable production. The European Union’s support for fishing was among those cited for criticism. Watson also urged people to switch to a more sustainable diet (less beef, more chicken and vegetables) and to waste less food, water and energy. There are glimmers of hope. In northern Asia, forest cover has increased by more than 22% as a result of tree-planting programs, mostly in China. But this was from a very low base and with far fewer species than in the past. In Africa, there has been a partial recovery of some species, though there is still a long way to go. Watson – a former chair of the IPCC and a leading figure in the largely successful campaign to reduce the gases that were causing a hole in the ozone layer – said the biodiversity report was the most comprehensive since 2005 and the first of its type that involved not just scientists, but governments and other stakeholders. Despite the grim outlook, he said there was cause for hope. The report outlines several different future paths, depending on the policies adopted by governments and the choices made by consumers. None completely halt biodiversity loss, but the worst-case scenarios can be avoided with greater conservation efforts. The missing link is to involve policymakers across government and to accept that biodiversity affects every area of the economy. Currently, these concerns are widely accepted by foreign and environment ministries; the challenge is to move the debate to incorporate this in other areas of government, such as agriculture, energy and water. Businesses and individual consumers also need to play a more responsible role, said Watson. “We don’t make recommendations because governments don’t like being told what to do. So, instead, we give them options,” he said. The IPBES report will be used to inform decision-makers at a major UN conference later this year. Signatories to the Convention for Biodiversity will meet in Sharm El-Sheikh in November to discuss ways to raise targets and strengthen compliance. But there have been more than 140 scientific reports since 1977, almost all of which have warned of deterioration of the climate or natural world. Without more pressure from civil society, media and voters, governments have been reluctant to sacrifice short-term economic goals to meet the longer-term environmental challenge to human wellbeing. “Biodiversity is under serious threat in many regions of the world and it is time for policymakers to take action at national, regional and global levels,” said José Graziano da Silva, director general of the Food and Agriculture Organization. Others have put the crisis in starker terms. Biologist Paul Ehrlich, has warned that civilisational collapse is a “near certainty” in the next few decades due to the destruction of the natural world."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2018/mar/31/ruth-jones-sex-scenes-challenge-novel-never-greener-interview","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-31T17:00:18Z","webTitle":"Ruth Jones: ‘The sex scenes were quite a challenge’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/mar/31/ruth-jones-sex-scenes-challenge-novel-never-greener-interview","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/mar/31/ruth-jones-sex-scenes-challenge-novel-never-greener-interview","fields":{"headline":"Ruth Jones: ‘The sex scenes were quite a challenge’","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Ruth Jones is a Welsh actor and screenwriter who has appeared in Little Britain, Nighty Night and Gavin and Stacey, which she co-wrote with James Corden. Her most recent role was Stella in the Sky 1 series of the same name, which she also wrote and produced. Her debut novel, Never Greener, about a mid-life couple who try to recapture the lost love of their youth, is published next month by Bantam Press (£12.99). Why did you decide to write a novel after so many years writing for television? I originally wrote Never Greener as a screenplay and nothing came of it. Then a couple of years ago I went for a spa break and, flicking through my laptop, I came across the screenplay and 1,000 words I’d forgotten I had written trying to adapt it as fiction. I picked it up again and started writing, just for the love of it really, and found I really enjoyed it. Where did the storyline come from? The original idea came to me back in 2002. Facebook and Twitter weren’t around then, but everybody was into Friends Reunited. So you heard all these stories about people contacting not just old friends but also old loves, and thinking that if only they’d stayed with them then everything would have been fine in their life. That was the impetus. What’s the difference between writing a script and a novel? It was a completely different experience because there are no rules. I didn’t have to think, “Oh, I’ve got to write this to the part-break and it’s got to be X number of minutes long and will we have cast availability?” So it was great to have that freedom to be able to go wherever I wanted with it and also to be able to go inside the characters’ heads. You can’t really do that on screen unless you have a voiceover. What’s more important, character or plot? I like to observe people, and I find people pretty fascinating. So I think character is my strength. I also think you can get story from character and character can inform plot. That’s probably just an excuse for not being very good at plot. I wish my plot muscles were stronger. How did you approach the sex scenes? I hope I’ve done it elegantly without making it twee. It was quite a challenge. But it was an enjoyable challenge, to keep the sexiness but not rely upon the graphic. Having said that, I am still worried about my mum reading it. What books do you have on your bedside table? Marian Keyes’s The Woman Who Stole My Life and Munich by Robert Harris, which I have just downloaded on my Kindle. I don’t usually read political thrillers, although I love them on screen. But I heard him being interviewed on Today and thought: let’s go in a different direction. Which genres do you particularly enjoy reading? Are there any you avoid? I am never going to like sci-fi or horror. The world’s bad enough as it is, quite frankly. I love multigenerational sagas. I am just finishing the Cazalet Chronicles by Elizabeth Jane Howard. I know it’s been televised before [in 2001, as The Cazalets] but you could easily do it again. It’s much better than Downton. What I love about it is how the legacies from people’s stories are threaded through the narrative and the way things that happen in childhood carry on having repercussions for generations. It uplifts me, which it shouldn’t do, because it also makes me aware of my mortality. Is there a book that changed your life? Hollywood Wives by Jackie Collins. It was the answer I gave at my interview to do drama at Manchester University in 1985 when they asked me what bedtime reading I’d done recently. Not surprisingly, I didn’t get the place. So you could say it was a life-changing book in the wrong way – but also in a good way, because I ended up going to Warwick University to do theatre studies and spent the best three years of my life there, really. Didn’t Jackie Collins also feature in Gavin and Stacey? Yes, for some bizarre reason we called Smithy’s grandmother Jackie Collins. The real Jackie Collins was a fan of Gavin and Stacey and loved the fact she was referenced and she invited me out for dinner, which was amazing. She was absolutely charming and wore dark glasses the whole time, and I just thought she was very elegant. Which authors working today do you admire? Jojo Moyes is pretty much up there for me, with the whole tragi-romance thing she manages to achieve. I literally found myself weeping when I was reading After You. Not just delicately sobbing: I was gulping. I also think Dawn French is incredibly clever. How do you organise your books? We’ve got a room you walk through to get to the kitchen where we’ve got floor-to-ceiling books. They’re not alphabetised or ordered at all and we have to have a cull now and again to make some room for new ones. But I do love having books, so it’s hard to let go of them, especially ones that have been around for a long time. I’ve still got all my university texts with my little notes in them. What’s that saying, a house without books is like a body without a soul? I believe that. Do you a favourite literary hero or heroine? I love Betsey Trotwood from David Copperfield, with her harsh, stern, loving ways. What kind of reader were you as a child? We used to go to the library a lot in our home town, Porthcawl, where my sister still lives and still visits the same library. My mum used to encourage us to read, although I wouldn’t say we were particularly bookish. I used to read Enid Blyton – The Secret Seven, The Famous Five and Malory Towers. My mum loved Little Women and I’ve still got the copy she bought me as an Easter present. When I got older, I discovered Thomas Hardy and loved his whole idea of fate. Dickens as well: he was someone I got really into, and Wuthering Heights. Although I read that again when I was 30-ish and it really got on my nerves. I thought it was so hedonistic. I just wanted to bash their heads together and say, “Stop being so bloody selfish”. What’s the best book you’ve ever been given as a present?

Over the years I’ve met many people from all parts of Russia, and feel I have some understanding of the country. I am increasingly dismayed by the jingoistic responses to the Salisbury attacks from the government and especially from the foreign secretary (World Cup will be like Nazi Olympics, says Johnson, 22 March). Most people in Britain do not seem to understand the historic nervousness of Russians to being encircled and invaded. Russians remember the second world war well, and the millions who died. For Boris Johnson to compare Putin to Hitler is about as foul an insult as anyone could devise. Theresa May’s talk about a new cold war serves no one’s interests apart from her own, and possibly those of MI6 and the armed forces. Russian oligarchs who are based in London and UK tax havens are the people that the UK should go for. Many are not the cosy families who wish to make their home here, as Theresa May would have it. They are hated in Russia even more than here, and investigating them for money laundering and tax evasion would be far more effective and conducive of building good relations with Russians than is the current focus on Putin. James Pitt York • When Ken Livingstone compared a reporter to a concentration camp guard, it virtually finished his career. When Boris Johnson targets a superpower with the same sort of language, he retains his job. How long before the PM realises that Johnson is somebody who causes far more trouble than he is worth?

The last part was an understatement. The Academy Awards were Sciorra’s first major Hollywood appearance since alleging that Harvey Weinstein raped her in the early 1990s. But really, she’d been out of the spotlight for decades, the bright star of Jungle Fever and The Hand That Rocks the Cradle mysteriously snuffed out. Not so mysterious any more. After the attack, she said she didn’t work for three years. When she returned to movies, Weinstein reappeared, too, reportedly pounding on her hotel door on several nights over the next several years, once in his underwear clutching a bottle of baby oil. Sciorra knew he was destroying her career. Two decades later, everyone in the Dolby Theater also knew, along with the millions more watching the Oscars at home. A woman in the audience yelled, “We love you!” Sciorra finally smiled. The curse was broken. For real. Ten days after the awards, Netflix announced they’d picked Sciorra for a plum role as the lead villain in the second season of Marvel’s Luke Cage. For the last six months, we’ve watched Hollywood fall apart. Or rather, we’ve finally seen the cracks that allowed men like Weinstein to sweep away women’s careers. Now, we’re gauging how it puts itself back together – and it won’t be stable until the women he attempted to destroy are put back in place (Weinstein’s spokesman says he has “unequivocally denied … any allegations of nonconsensual sex”). It’s a long list of names. But restoration is already under way. In December, Peter Jackson admitted Weinstein had sabotaged his plans to hire Mira Sorvino and Ashley Judd for The Lord of the Rings. Sorvino, who claims Weinstein assaulted her in 1995 while promoting Mighty Aphrodite, a Miramax role that would win her an Oscar, saw the news and burst into tears. “I have to say, the general atmosphere since those allegations came out, those revelations, there seems to be a lot of goodwill toward me in the entertainment business,” said Mira Sorvino at the TCAs in January. Since Weinstein no longer has the clout to hang up on directors who mention her name, Sorvino is in perpetual motion. This year, she’s got major roles in nine movies, a guest spot on the hit sitcom Modern Family, and, fingers crossed, a star network gig as a top-ranked marine lawyer in the CBS pilot The Code. However, acting gigs are only part of the solution. Off screen, Sorvino has introduced four California bills to combat sexual harassment, including one that bars confidentiality agreements like the clause that silenced Rose McGowan. Sorvino and Judd walked the Oscars red carpet together, and when a reporter handed her the mic, she spoke with confidence: “I want people to know that this movement isn’t stopping.” Several of Weinstein’s accusers are channeling their energy into making their own films. That side of the lens is where the power is, recognized film-maker Brit Marling, who credits her behind-the-scenes background for rescuing her unscathed from Weinstein’s attempted massage. “Of those dual personas in me – actor and writer – it was the writer who stood up and walked out,” said Marling in the Atlantic. “Because the writer knew that even if this very powerful man never gave her a job in any of his films, even if he blacklisted her from other films, she could make her own work on her own terms and thus keep a roof over her head.” Currently, Marling is shooting the second season of her supernatural Netflix series The OA, which she created and wrote. Darryl Hannah also took charge. When Hannah was in Rome for Quentin Tarantino’s Kill Bill: Volume 2’s Italian premiere, Weinstein allegedly burst into her hotel room and insisted he squeeze her breasts to prove they were real. When she refused, Weinstein retaliated by cutting her out of the Cannes segment of the tour. “After Kill Bill, I never got another movie meeting. Not even a meeting or an offer,” said Hannah to the New Yorker, adding, “Some of that had to do with Harvey and his bad mouthing.” So Hannah has begun to direct her own films. At this month’s SXSW, she premiered her feature directorial debut Paradox, an experimental western musical starring Neil Young and Willie Nelson. Paradox, which Netflix is releasing this weekend, is two-steps between arthouse concert film and a comedy about treasure hunting. The reviews haven’t been great, but Hannah is more concerned with the direction of her career than how the film is received. As she said in Austin: “It is a patriarchal system that is beginning to feel a little bit that its foundation is being chipped away.” Heather Graham went after the patriarchy with a sandblaster. Three months after sharing her story about an alleged Weinstein encounter where he heavily hinted he wanted her to trade sex for a film role, Graham released her own directing debut, Half Magic, a Wiccan romantic comedy with a furious subplot about a misogynistic film executive. The creep might liken himself to Napoleon and Jesus, but Graham makes the audience see he’s a blustering, overcompensating bully, and a hypocrite to boot, the kind of narrow-minded, self-congratulating guru who says things like, “I’m not saying I’m against women’s rights, I’m just saying there’s no market for their films.” “Your directing career hasn’t gotten off the ground yet because you look like a big booby dummy,” he sneers to her character, a would-be filmmaker, when she suggests a more feminist angle on a film he’s dubbed, Kill the Sluts. It’s a clunky line, yet it bruises like the truth. And while Half Magic isn’t a great film, Graham clearly has a lot more she wants to say. Still, for every step forward, there’s an actor still pacing for her comeback, or wondering what her trajectory might have been if Weinstein hadn’t gotten his paws on it. Asia Argento, Paz de la Huerta, Minka Kelly, Connie Neilson and Natasha Henstridge continue to hustle for roles. Many others appear to have simply stopped. Sean Young was recently seen in Blade Runner 2049 … as a computerized imitation. Eva Green, whose mother told reporters that Weinstein “threatened to destroy her professionally”, might finally have gotten her major all-ages blockbuster break in Tim Burton’s upcoming live action remake of Dumbo. And Salma Hayek has openly questioned why after her Miramax film Frida won her a best actress nomination, she couldn’t get a starring role for over decade. “I’m so full of emotion, I’m a little bit shaky,” said Hayek on stage next to Sciorra and Judd at the Oscars. The three women are no longer united just by the worst working experience of their lives – together, they’re trying to blaze the way forward. Despite their nerves, they seemed to draw strength from each other, just like people watching might draw strength from them. “This year many spoke their truth,” concluded Sciorra. “The journey ahead is long. But slowly, a new path has emerged.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"us-news/2018/mar/23/donald-trump-threatens-to-veto-spending-bill","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-23T18:17:08Z","webTitle":"Trump reluctantly signs $1.3tn spending bill despite veto threat","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/mar/23/donald-trump-threatens-to-veto-spending-bill","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/mar/23/donald-trump-threatens-to-veto-spending-bill","fields":{"headline":"Trump reluctantly signs $1.3tn spending bill despite veto threat","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Donald Trump announced on Friday that he had reluctantly signed Congress’s $1.3tn spending bill, despite a threat he made hours earlier to veto the budget and shut down the federal government. The president caused consternation with a tweet in which he said he might exercise his right to veto over the bill’s lack of immigration measures. But in impromptu remarks at the White House, Trump said he would sign because of the need to strengthen the military. “My highest duty is to keep America safe,” Trump told reporters. “We need to take care of our military … As a matter of national security, I’ve signed this omnibus budget bill. There’s a lot of things that I’m unhappy about in this bill.” He added that “in a sense we were forced”, describing the rushed nature of the negotiations on Capitol Hill as “a ridiculous situation”. The 2,232-page bill was released to lawmakers hours before it passed the House and Senate on Thursday, a day before the shutdown deadline. He vowed: “I say to Congress: I’m never going to sign a bill like this again. Nobody read it. It’s hours old.” He blamed Democrats in particular for not giving priority to the military – which gets a $66bn increase over 2017 spending – and insisting on their own measures being included. “We have tremendous opposition to creating really what will be by far the strongest military we’ve ever had,” Trump said. The president admitted he was disappointed with just $1.6bn for his much-trailed wall on the Mexican border, far short of the $25bn he wanted. “Not happy with $1.6bn but it does start the wall and we will make that $1.6bn go very far,” he said. The bill takes some actions on gun control and the opioids crisis but does not include protections for young undocumented migrants brought to the country as children, known as Dreamers and previously protected under an Obama-era executive order, Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals or Daca. Trump sought to blame Democrats. “The Republicans are with you,” he said. “The Democrats fought every single inch of the way. They did not want Daca in this bill … Republicans are much more on your side than the Democrats, who are using you for your own purposes.” But Nancy Pelosi, the House minority leader, hit back. She said: “The GOP shamefully offered only a temporary patch for only a few Daca recipients, tied to billions for the border wall and extreme interior enforcement that many Dreamers made clear they could not support.” She went on: “Speaker Ryan has failed to live up to his promise to bring a Daca solution to the floor, and we will continue to press him to give us a vote to protect Dreamers.” The bill passed the House 256-167 and the Senate by 65-32. Trump called for the Senate to remove its filibuster rule, to allow legislation to advance by a simple majority of 51 votes, and for Congress to give him a line-by-line veto of future budgets to prevent a repeat situation. The budget passed the House and Senate despite opposition from groups on the right and left. Without new funding the federal government would have been partially shut down, a third such closure in months. The bill’s $1.6bn for border security is not authorized to be used on the wall prototypes Trump recently viewed in California. Trump’s presidential campaign made building a wall a signature issue, the candidate repeatedly promising that Mexico would pay for it. “I am considering a VETO of the Omnibus Spending Bill,” Trump wrote in his Friday morning tweet, “based on the fact that the 800,000 plus DACA recipients have been totally abandoned by the Democrats (not even mentioned in Bill) and the BORDER WALL, which is desperately needed for our National Defense, is not fully funded.” Daca was canceled by Trump in September. However, litigation has kept protection for many Dreamers in place. Trump rejected a deal with Democrats that would have protected Dreamers in exchange for $25bn for his wall. “DACA was abandoned by the Democrats,” Trump tweeted on Friday. “Very unfair to them! Would have been tied to desperately needed Wall.” Trump made his veto threat despite being scheduled to leave Washington for his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida on Friday evening. In the capital, the House had adjourned. Mark Meadows, the chair of the hard-right House Freedom Caucus, tweeted his support. Bob Corker of Tennessee, a Senate budget hawk who has clashed fiercely with Trump, tweeted: “Please do, Mr President. I am just down the street and will bring you a pen. The spending levels without any offsets are grotesque, throwing all of our children under the bus. Totally irresponsible.” Before Trump made the bill law, a senior Democratic aide on Capitol Hill told the Guardian: “One of two things will happen. He either signs the bill by the end of the day or he ends up signing a bill he likes even less after Republicans have to renegotiate with Democrats to get out of a shutdown.” After Trump signed, a Republican staffer combined the president’s campaign slogan with an acronym for “Republicans in Name Only” to complain that Trump had increased the national deficit. “He’s made Rinos great again,” the staffer said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2018/mar/25/brexit-joke-nation-even-before-blue-passports","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-25T06:59:45Z","webTitle":"Brexit was making us a joke nation even before the blue passports | William Keegan","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/mar/25/brexit-joke-nation-even-before-blue-passports","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/mar/25/brexit-joke-nation-even-before-blue-passports","fields":{"headline":"Brexit was making us a joke nation even before the blue passports","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Did I hear aright? Is the new, or rather “retro”, post-Brexit, true-blue British passport going to be manufactured in France? What a wonderful symbol of the futility and duplicity of the Brexiters’ promise to “take back control”! And what is this dire threat from the ubiquitous Jacob Rees-Mogg that the UK risks becoming a “joke nation” by giving in on so many fronts to Michel Barnier? Surely Mr Rees-Mogg has noticed that, thanks to the disruptive antics of himself, his fellow Brexiters, their puppet master Nigel Farage, and the pernicious sway they hold over Theresa May, the UK is already a joke nation in the eyes of the rest of the world. Indeed, it is a laughing stock. As the Financial Times journalists George Parker and Alex Barker commented after following my misguided friend David Davis around: “The Brexit secretary may be enthusiastic about leaving the EU but, on his tour around European capitals, he has struggled to find interlocutors who think the project is anything other than mad at worst or an unwelcome distraction at best.” Now, apart from their well-publicised objections to the continuation of present fishing arrangements, some of the leading Brexiters have been noticeably sanguine in the face of a “transitional” deal heralded by many of my fellow Remainers as a rejection of most of their initial demands. They don’t all agree with Farage that it is “a complete sellout”. This, of course, is because unless a great act of prime ministerial or parliamentary statesmanship puts an end to the farce, the Brexiters see the transitional deal as a mere postponement of their plan to take this benighted country to the edge of the cliff. It may seem like a great victory for the Remain campaign that the plan is for us to remain in the customs union and single market until the end of 2020. But I have two concerns about the optimistic approach to this. One is that unless something turns up, this could well amount to a mere postponement of disaster. The second is that, on present plans, we shall actually be departing from the EU on 31 March 2019. How do we know that, for all the patience they have exercised so far, the others would make it simple for us to rejoin the full EU, if there is a change of heart after the official beginning of “transition” or “implementation”? Some of us are old enough to recall decades of frustrating efforts to join in the first place. Whichever way one – at least this one – looks at it, the most sensible thing the prime minister could do is to rise to the occasion, to be true to her own instincts (and, I understand, those of her not-uninfluential husband) and make a Churchillian broadcast to the nation. In this she would explain that – God knows! – she has tried to honour the referendum result and reconcile the conflicting forces within her party, but enough is enough. It may be that the continuing and mounting damage being wreaked by the government’s austerity programme will finally make more of the electorate wake up to the full implications of what 37% of them voted for. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell recently observed of that shock referendum result on 23 June 2016: “It was like a byelection where everyone’s grievances piled into that one vote.” I agree. The sad thing is that the vote against the misguided Cameron-Osborne austerity programme should have taken place in the general election of 2015, and not in reaction to their rash decision to call that referendum. It is, incidentally, highly unfortunate for the country that George Osborne, who claims to have had doubts about the wisdom of holding the referendum, did not stand up to be counted at the time. We shall never know, but it is my belief that a strong chancellor – which he certainly was – could have put a stop to the whole idea. To be fair, he is now trying to make amends in his new career as a journalist. In this, he differs from that old friend of mine, and predecessor of Osborne’s as chancellor, the one and only Lord Lawson of Blaby – or should I say Lord Lawson of La France Profonde, which is where he actually lives. Lawson sees Brexit as a chance to complete the Thatcherite revolution – which I opposed in these columns at the time, and still do – noting, with some satisfaction, that given so many of the unfortunate economic and social consequences, even the Economist has recently registered doubts about the wonders of the Thatcherism it once espoused.

When Simone is subpoenaed to appear before Senator Paley’s judiciary committee he is furious. He gallantly buttonholes Paley on her behalf who tells him: “I don’t think you know her as well as you think you do,” and on that we can definitely agree. Before you can say “honey trap”, Simone lawyers up and begins negotiating an immunity deal. When he confronts her in a tapas bar, she stages an altercation that is duly filmed, uploaded and sent viral by the same army of bots that spread the ‘JJ is dead’ story. Wellington is thrown under the bus like an indie drummer and it hurts. He’s so far out of his depth, it’s not funny. We terribly overestimated him. “You think Dante might be a part of that? You think I might be a part of that?” Carrie wangles herself a seat at the committee and like everyone else present, is struck by what she hears. Unlike everyone else, she has the Carrie-o-vision eyes and ears in the Wellington household showing that David is as innocent as a babe. It prompts a return to that solid Homeland staple, Carrie in trouble, calling on Saul. He is naturally appalled by her illegal surveillance operation, but he quickly slips into problem-solving mode. He lends a sympathetic ear to her predicament and so much more. He joins the dots between the Simone Martin affair and what happened at Lucasville. He points out that it was Dante who brought Simone’s parking ticket to her attention and the scales fall from her eyes. Carrie wants Dante’s guts immediately, but Saul insists she lay low for a while as he works the Russian angle – he can’t risk her alerting anyone. She agrees. It’s the only sensible thing to do. She reneges on that agreement and puts together an operation with her squad which involves honey trapping and sedating Dante in his own apartment. He will awaken to the sight of a seriously pissed off Carrie and her crew of ill-informed underpaid goons. Dating Carrie really is more trouble than it’s worth. “If you’re right, whoever’s bankrolling this woman also wants McClendon’s murder pinned on the White House.” Naysayers will gripe that his handling of the Lucasville standoff was not an unqualified success, but Saul is still smarter than the average bear. He works his socks off this week initially hitting up Russia expert Sandy, another refugee from Allison Carr’s downfall in season five. He teams her up with Clint – “the best information scientist at Darpa” – and they get to work back-engineering the Russian conspiracy. Ivan, meanwhile confirms himself as a rotter by meeting up with Yevgeny Gromov. He tells Gromov that Saul is on to him and berates him for recycling his methods but like all social media influencers, Gromov is not one to be put off by a few haters. He’s part of a new breed, one that disdains the old Russia that Ivan embodies, contemptuous of its protocols and its failures. Realising he’s in trouble, Ivan arranges a meeting with Saul. It’s the last thing he ever does. Yevgeny intercepts him, sticks him tied up and alive in a body bag before dumping him over the side of the boat. It’s a grisly death and further evidence if it were needed that this Gromov kid does not play. Notes and observations Simone getting a parking ticket always felt a bit unlikely and it makes a lot more sense if it was engineered as now seems the case. Many of you in the comments called that Dante was up to no good, but don’t claim victory just yet. At least wait until Carrie and her squad have a few hours’ quality time alone with him. I do like the look Elizabeth gives David when she hears about Simone Martin for the first time (“The convoy, now this?”) It really takes the wind out of the announcement of her bond program for public schools which I was looking forward to hearing more about. It feels like a bit of a misstep to portray Krupin as the Bible-quoting Christian when Putin’s Russia is so closely enmeshed with the Orthodox Church. It does, however, give Gromov the chance to recite the Old Testament back at him before he kills him, like Jules from Pulp Fiction. He has the makings of a great Homeland villain. Will Dante survive ordeal by Carrie? Is David doomed? Can Yevgeny be stopped? Let me know below."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"business/2018/mar/23/pineapples-set-to-topple-avocados-with-britons-wanting-more","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-23T17:23:30Z","webTitle":"Pineapples set to topple avocados with Britons wanting more","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/mar/23/pineapples-set-to-topple-avocados-with-britons-wanting-more","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/mar/23/pineapples-set-to-topple-avocados-with-britons-wanting-more","fields":{"headline":"Pineapples set to topple avocados with Britons wanting more","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"For a while avocados had it all their own way as Britons smashed them on toast and whizzed them up for smoothies but there is a new pretender to the fruit crown – 2018 is shaping up to be the year of the pineapple. Supermarkets say demand for the tropical fruit is at an all time high after a dramatic reappraisal by shoppers who increasingly view it as as an ingredient for curries, barbecues and cocktails as well as fruit salads. Such is the fervour, the pineapple has overtaken the avocado as the UK’s fastest growing fruit, according to supermarket giant Tesco, with sales surging nearly 15% last year. “Pineapples have become the fruit taste of the moment and could soon rival the avocado as a once niche fruit suddenly gaining mainstream popularity,” said Tesco’s fresh pineapple buyer Morgan Jaquemet. “In the last few years we have seen demand jump because of the fruit’s rising popularity as a versatile and healthy food.” The rise of the avocado – sales in Tesco still increased by nearly 10% last year – was fuelled by social media as trendy restaurants created Instagram-worthy brunch dishes and its reputation as a superfood won it a place in numerous fad diets. The interest in health is reflected in fruit sales which rose more than 5% to £5.6bn in the year to end of February, according to the grocery market experts Kantar Worldpanel. Customs data shows the UK imported more than 168,000 tonnes of pineapples in 2017 compared with 148,000 tonnes in 2016, an increase of almost 14%. The vast majority came from Costa Rica which has more than trebled its production of the fruit over the last 15 years, leading to concerns about environmental degradation as well as the pay rates of plantation workers. “There has been a big increase in fresh pineapple exports into Europe,” said Neil Murray, head of processed commodities at Agribusiness Intelligence. “People like it and a lot of it is coming from Costa Rica, but production is probably peaking there now, as they are getting worried about the amount of land under pineapple.” Britons still have a way to go if pineapple sales are to overtake the avocado. Britons munched their way through £175m worth of avocados in the last 12 months compared with spending about £44m on pineapples. Tesco said pineapple flavours were popular across the board with demand for juice up by more than a fifth and sales of tinned pineapple chunks up 5% (80g of tinned or fresh pineapple counts as one of your five a day). The controversial Hawaiian pizza is also staging a comeback, Tesco said, and whether down to laziness or fears of avocado hand-style injuries, sales of ready chopped pineapple “fingers” were up 30%. The national hankering for pineapple has probably been fuelled by subliminal cues picked up on social media and the high street. The motif was one of the hottest trends of last summer, plastered on everything from kitsch T-shirts to pool inflatables, cushions and knick knacks. In the Georgian era, pineapples were a status symbol which could be hired from “pineapple merchants” to dress a house for a party. By Christmas 2017 that trend had come full circle with entire pages on Pinterest devoted to pineapples that had been adorned with fairy lights and were being used as alternative Christmas trees."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/mar/31/dita-von-teese-staying-pale-takes-some-effort-in-los-angeles-this-much-i-know","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-31T13:00:13Z","webTitle":"Dita Von Teese: ‘Staying pale takes some effort in LA’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/mar/31/dita-von-teese-staying-pale-takes-some-effort-in-los-angeles-this-much-i-know","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/mar/31/dita-von-teese-staying-pale-takes-some-effort-in-los-angeles-this-much-i-know","fields":{"headline":"Dita Von Teese: ‘Staying pale takes some effort in LA’","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Burlesque has become a place for an alternative feminist movement.

I just bought a 1956 Woodill convertible, a very rare kit car. They look like something from Disney, like they’re smiling in the front. I’ll drive it for a few years, then I’ll flip it. Losing George Michael was a body blow. Working with him [on his 2008 stage show] was a high point in my life. I can’t think of an artist I’ve listened to more consistently since I was a teenager. You can put on Listen Without Prejudice Vol 1 any time, and everyone in the room goes: “Oh, God, it’s so good.” I was also close with Amy Winehouse and Prince. How could my favourite three be gone? Staying pale takes some effort in LA. I spend a lot of the day inside. When I go to the flea market, I will slather on sunscreen and wear a big hat. I’ve had bad sunburn before and it’s totally traumatic. I can be quite low-maintenance. I love glamour and getting ready – I’ll spend three hours preparing for my show. But on a normal day, as long as I have my red lipstick on and my hair is doing something OK, either in a chignon or freshly washed, I’m good. I don’t regret my divorce from Marilyn [Manson]. It was the right thing to do. He and I are birds of a feather in many ways. I have really fond memories of the first half of our seven-year relationship. It was this romantic artist-muse time – he made a record [2003’s The Golden Age of Grotesque] inspired by my world. But then the other half got pretty dark. Maybe I’ll quit striptease at 50. And if I set my mind to it, I might be able to sing live. I’ll be like Marlene Dietrich and stand there in front of all my ladies and my gays, in a fabulous beaded dress. There’s nothing that can light your spark like a glass of the iciest, bubbliest, sharpest champagne. I’ll throw back half a glass and hit the stage. Dita Von Teese is someone I always dreamed of being when I was little. I watched a lot of old movies with my mother. I looked at these 1940s women in Technicolor with the red lips and the rosy cheeks and high heels and these incredible shapes. It was really mysterious and fabulous. And I noticed that they were all painted – it wasn’t the real thing. I realised I could make that. I loved this artificial, contrived beauty.And I never felt very special or interesting. So I thought I’d turn myself into what those Hollywood studios turned those women into. Heather Renée Sweet – my real name – was a very quiet, painfully shy person. I was living in a small town in Michigan with my two sisters, my mother and father. They tried to send me to speech classes ‘cause I never liked to talk. I was really afraid of speaking. I was terrified if I was called on in class. When I was in high school my father threw me out of the house. I had started collecting lingerie and spending all my pay cheques on that. And there I am, handwashing my delicate lingerie and hanging it up to dry. And my father, he was like a lot of people – he couldn’t understand that it wasn’t because I was seducing boys. It was because I loved it.

About what happened in the past, and what that might tell us about today? According to one recent conference at Stanford University in California, it’s still only a certain group who have the right to tell us. Nicknamed the #StanfordSausageFest, this conference featured a programme of 30 white, male speakers. That’s it. No people of colour, and no women. The episode has raised important questions about the diversity of history as a discipline, and who is listened to in public debates. Higher education generally is still too white and too male, and this problem is exacerbated when it comes to which historians are given a platform in the media and on the national and international stage. This matters because history has a real role to play today. Historical knowledge shows the positive impact of migration, while knowledge about the impact of slave ownership can help to fight continuing structural inequalities. Examples from the past demonstrate unequivocally the value of the NHS, while histories of intellectual disabilities can be used to understand concepts such as capacity and consent, and reduce stigmas around learning difficulties. Historians of activism have worked with campaign groups to identify successful campaigning tactics. Workshops using historical objects have instigated conversations about sex and relationships, and so improved teenage sexual wellbeing and health. Using medieval recipes, historians are even working with museums and councils to promote healthy eating and knowledge about nutrition, in reaction to obesity. Long-term, high-profile projects involve historians conducting research for government inquiries, such as the independent inquiry into child sexual abuse, for which historians detailed the specific context that allowed abuse to occur. These examples all show how history can help us to challenge the very context that allows high-profile, all-white, all-male conferences to still take place. While public history generally is strong and healthy, who is given a platform remains problematic. We are starting to see more women and historians of colour on television, but still too narrow a range of historians gets heard. Instead, a few “big names” dominate – often white, male voices. As well as needing to hear from a wider range of voices, we need more diversity in the kinds of history that feature in public debate. The emphasis is usually on grand narratives of long-term change and continuity, yet often the detailed, rigorous research of a particular event or time period or analysis of ordinary people’s experiences can have the most impact. Hearing from a more diverse range of historians would help introduce a wider range of methods and perspectives to the public. To do this, we need to acknowledge that history has a complex role to play, beyond merely looking for parallels between past and present. It can help to lobby for redress for historical wrongs; challenge long-term structures of power – patriarchal, imperial or economic; and offer a critique of the present, as a source of alternative ideas and reminder that we shouldn’t take for granted what we see as “normal”. History can also help us understand how things have come to be as they are, from government structures to how medical conditions are defined. It can improve understanding of how social change might be achieved, by examining how change happened in the past. It can be a tool to instigate that change in and of itself, as examples of what happened in the past can be used to explore controversial subjects such as euthanasia or abortion today. It can offer an examination of why the same failures keep happening. Perhaps most of all, a longer-term historical perspective can be a huge resource in social justice and tackling inequality and discrimination – showing the long-term roots of a population, a movement, a type of behaviour or whatever else is so powerful. But for these messages to be most effective, we need to start giving a more diverse range of historians and historical viewpoints a platform.

US and China in dispute over tariffs but trade war looks remote","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Will two tribes go to war? Even as the world’s largest economies, the US and China, send conflicting signals over whether they’re heading for an all-out trade war – spooking stock markets – experts doubted either side will risk escalating a dispute over trade imbalances. China’s economic tsar and vice-premier Liu He told US treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin on Saturday that Beijing is ready to defend its interests after Donald Trump announced plans to slap tariffs on nearly $50bn in Chinese imports. But Liu’s comments were cooler than the Chinese leadership’s initial reaction to Trump’s announcement. The Chinese ambassador to the US, Cui Tiankai, announced on state television: “If somebody imposes a trade war on China, we’ll fight to the end.” In reality, China’s response has been muted, rolling out just $3bn in additional tariffs on US goods ranging from fresh fruit, nuts, wine and pork to recycled aluminum and steel pipes. It followed US tariffs on aluminum and steel imports. US pork producers squealed. The American pork industry last year sent $1.1bn in products to China, making it the No 3 market for US pork. Overall, the nation’s farmers shipped nearly $20bn of goods to China in 2017, Reuters reported. “We sell a lot of pork to China, so higher tariffs on our exports going there will harm our producers and undermine the rural economy,” said Jim Heimerl, president of the National Pork Producers Council. But missing from China’s list of tariffs published on Friday were key US export items to the US including soybeans, sorghum and Boeing aircraft. “China is reacting mildly to a set of tariffs that have largely been rolled back for almost everyone except China,” said Joe Brusuelas, chief economist with the financial advisory company RSM. “Trade friction is a natural state of affairs in the international economy and we’re engaged in a spat.” On Tuesday, the Trump administration is scheduled to detail additional tariffs. US trade representative Robert Lighthizer has said the goal is to pressure China to change practices, and plans to target 1,300 product categories, while limiting harm to US consumers and companies. But the damage to China may account for only 0.1% of its GDP. In an advisory note to investors, Capital Economics wrote that existing tariffs will have “a barely perceptible impact” on China’s wider economy. Targeting $60bn of products by the US adds up to only 0.25% to China’s GDP last year. The existing measures are unlikely to come close to reducing the annual US-China trade imbalance by $100bn as the administration has demanded. And China, holding more than $1tn of US treasury bonds, is playing with a strong hand. “The key uncertainty now is whether Trump sees the tariffs as an end in themselves, or whether they are followed by further escalation,” according to the advisory note. But like many Trump administration proposals, the bluster is often more impressive than the follow-through. Even when a formal list of tariffs is published, US businesses will have 30 days to comment and China will be able to make concessions. Geoffrey Gertz of the Brookings Institution says a joint US, European and Japan effort to limit technology transfer could be more effective. He said: “There is certainly scope to pursue China through the WTO and there is a lot the US could be doing that we haven’t done. But the business community remains very nervous about wide-ranging tariffs.” The markets signaled their anxiety with a 730-point drop on Thursday and a further dive on Friday, the worst week for major indices in more than two years. RSM’s Brusuelas said: “It’s a vote of no confidence in what are clearly a set of incoherent and inconsistent trade policies.” “They’re missing a big opportunity because there’s a broad, bipartisan consensus in Washington that something needs to be done on trade, and there is a rare unanimity amongst the major trading nations that China is going to have to adjust.” Other trading nations, including Canada, the EU and South Korea, are willing to confront China through multilateral actions via the WTO. “There’s ample opportunity to re-task the economic relationship with China, but one could surmise that our administration’s unilateral actions that demonstrate economic weakness are not the way to go,” he added. A China policy veteran from the George W Bush administration, Dennis Wilder, told the Guardian he also believed the US had missed an opportunity by taking unilateral action. He said: “There was an open door with the EU, South Korea and Japan until the aluminum and steel tariffs action. But it was a mistake for the US to base that on our national security concerns and then to make our allies the primary targets. After that, it became very difficult for these countries to consider taking joint action.” Wilder said he believed the Chinese leadership understood the administration’s trade actions were largely related to American domestic political concerns. Beijing, he said, did not want “to anger the US into more actions”. The stock market is certainly hoping it’s a game of paper tigers."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"money/2018/mar/23/wegeneration-work-rest-and-play-together-in-adam-neumanns-empire","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-23T17:22:43Z","webTitle":"WeGeneration work, rest and play together in Adam Neumann's empire","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2018/mar/23/wegeneration-work-rest-and-play-together-in-adam-neumanns-empire","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2018/mar/23/wegeneration-work-rest-and-play-together-in-adam-neumanns-empire","fields":{"headline":"WeGeneration work, rest and play together in Adam Neumann's empire","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Adam Neumann is not satisfied with changing the way 210,000 people work and turning himself into a paper multi-billionaire in the process. Neumann, the 38-year-old co-founder and chief executive of shared office provider WeWork, wants to house, teach, train and party with the “WeGeneration”. In less than eight years, Neumann, a dyslexic who could not read until he was seven, has turned an idea for a single “eco-friendly co-working space” in Brooklyn into a $20bn (£14bn) company which runs 230 shared office spaces in 71 cities . The company, which is marketed with the tagline “Do What You Love” and offers its “members” free artisan coffee, grapefruit-infused water and a choice of craft beers, has risen to become London’s biggest office occupier. WeWork has taken space in 21 office buildings in the capital, including eight floors of a block in Moorgate with space for more than 3,000 workers, two buildings in the heart of Soho and an outpost in London Fields which it describes as the “epicentre of east London’s creative hotbed”. The company, which was founded by Neumann and his friend Miguel McKelvey in 2010, occupies more than 2.5m sq ft of space in London according to research by Savills, the property consultant. It has opened an office in Manchester and has plans for another in the city, and it is also scouting for locations in Birmingham, Edinburgh and other UK cities. WeWork owns a small fraction of its estate, instead renting space from traditional landlords which it breaks into smaller offices and communal shared desks. In spite of having very few physical assets, WeWork has attracted investment from Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan and Japan’s SoftBank, which invested $4.4bn last year, valuing WeWork at $20bn. Masayoshi Son, the chief executive of SoftBank and Japan’s richest man, said his investment would be “cheap” if WeWork continued its exponential growth, adding the firm could be “worth a few hundred billion dollars”. The investment valued Neumann’s remaining stake in the privately held company at about $2.5bn. WeWork will open another 13 locations in London by the end of 2018, including the whole of an office block opposite the Bank of England. For £650 a month, WeWork tenants will be granted access to their desks in One Poultry via the building’s grand staircase which is inspired by the Scala Regia steps entrance to the Vatican. Providing a fun and inspiring place to work is just the first step for Neumann, who told a conference of city mayors recently that the influx of people into cities and the rising cost of living meant they “have to reinvent how people live”. “As mayors, as leaders, as CEOs it is our responsibility to set the trend of the future,” he said.Neumann, an Israeli who grew up partly on a kibbutz, claims that each new WeWork office will create 1,000 jobs a year. “And we won’t just bring you jobs, we’ll bring a place to live, we’ll bring education and this is important we’ll bring corporate America,” he said. WeWork began as a place for the “cool kids” tech and creative entrepreneurs to bat about ideas over the communal foosball table and pints from the free beer kegs, but now big businesses, including HSBC, Microsoft and InBev, the brewing company, occupy more than 25% of its space. It is not just about work. WeWork is poised to launch its communal living concept WeLive in London. The company opened the first of its “dorm for adults” concept in a 200-apartment building in Manhattan’s financial district in 2016 and expanded to the concept to Crystal City, a suburb of Washington DC. WeWork executives, who are ditching the “Work” from the company’s name and increasingly refer to the firm as just “We”, say the WeLive concept is built upon “a fundamental belief that we are only as good as the people we surround ourselves with”. WeWork also takes care of its members’ fitness and relaxation. The company opened its first gym and spa in New York last year and expects to rollout the Rise By We concept to other locations. The company has bought a stake in Wavegarden, which makes indoor wavepools, sparking speculation that the next WeWork perk might be lunchtime surfing lessons. There are also parties and events, which are organised by WeWork’s community managers. The company says it works with tenants to put on bespoke activities. WeWork’s members in Paddington, west London, were this week offered the opportunity to take part in guided meditation, a “boxbiz” boxing workshop or a candlelight yoga class. If none of that appealed, there was also a “jar and fern terrarium workshop” on Thursday lunchtime. The biggest party of the year is WeWork Summer Camp, which the company says “is just what it sounds like: a chance for grown-ups of all ages to sleep in tents, share meals in a dining hall, and take part in events from archery to zip lining”. At the first camp, Neumann hosted 300 employees and customers in upstate New York. Last summer, the company flew 2,000 staff to the UK for a party held at Eridge Park, a country estate in East Sussex which was once a deer hunting ground favoured by Henry VIII. Florence + the Machine headlined the show, which cost WeWork members £395 each to attend. Next on the WeWork agenda is education. This month, the company opened a London arm of its coding academy Flatiron School and pledged £1m in scholarships for women and other groups underrepresented in technology jobs. Neumann’s wife, Rebekah Paltrow Neumann, a cousin of Gwyneth Paltrow, reckons the company has got to start teaching much earlier and is opening a $36,000-a-year kindergarten called WeGrow. Rebekah, WeWork’s chief brand officer and a mother of five with no training in education, says on her website that her “superpower” is “intuition”. “Rebekah is committed to creating a conscious, educational community that fosters growth in children’s minds, bodies, and souls, unleashing endless happiness, global citizenship, and every child’s superpowers,” her profile says. Adam, who runs or skateboards to the company’s headquarters in Chelsea, Manhattan, said moving into education was a natural extension of the company’s mission to help people Do What You Love. “If you really want to change the world, change kids when they’re two,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"stage/2018/mar/23/maria-bamford-review-leicester-square-theatre-london","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-23T12:50:40Z","webTitle":"Maria Bamford review – hard-won hilarity redefines quirky","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/mar/23/maria-bamford-review-leicester-square-theatre-london","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2018/mar/23/maria-bamford-review-leicester-square-theatre-london","fields":{"headline":"Maria Bamford review – hard-won hilarity redefines quirky","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"football/2018/mar/23/reading-appoint-paul-clement-manager-jaap-stam","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-23T11:30:59Z","webTitle":"Reading appoint Paul Clement as manager after sacking Jaap Stam","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/mar/23/reading-appoint-paul-clement-manager-jaap-stam","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/mar/23/reading-appoint-paul-clement-manager-jaap-stam","fields":{"headline":"Reading appoint Paul Clement as manager after sacking Jaap Stam","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Paul Clement has been appointed as manager of Reading, three months after he was sacked by Swansea City. He takes over from Jaap Stam, who was dismissed this week with the club three points above the Championship relegation zone after one win in 18 league matches. “The immediate aim is to secure the club in the Championship – eight games to go,” Clement said. “But then beyond that I think there is a lot of ambition to take the club further forward. They were very close obviously last season, just penalty kicks away from the Premier League, and that is where the club want to be and that is the ambition I have to coach at that level again.” Clement lasted just under a year in the top flight at Swansea and was previously in charge of Derby County, where he also had a relatively short spell, of eight months. He has assisted Carlo Ancelotti at Chelsea, Paris St-Germain, Real Madrid and Bayern Munich. “I am delighted to have secured the services of a hugely experienced forward-thinking manager like Paul, who I have personally worked alongside during our time spent at Chelsea,” Reading’s chief executive, Ron Gourlay, told the club’s website. “Not only has he coached at some of the greatest clubs in Europe, winning trophies, league titles and European honours and working with some of the greatest players in the world, fundamentally he also has a rich understanding of English football having managed in both the Championship and the Premier League in recent years.” Reading said Clement had been studying football and other sport in the United States in a series of study visits since he left Swansea."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"music/2018/mar/23/madison-beer-abc2-glasgow-review","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-23T12:32:37Z","webTitle":"Madison Beer review – Bieber protege comes of age credibly","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/mar/23/madison-beer-abc2-glasgow-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/mar/23/madison-beer-abc2-glasgow-review","fields":{"headline":"Madison Beer review – Bieber protege comes of age credibly","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"In 2012, aspiring pop star Madison Beer got a vertiginous career bump from Justin Bieber after he gushingly shared a clip of her covering Etta James’s At Last with his millions of Instagram followers. In the years since, Beer has relocated from New York to LA, released the odd single and maintained an impressive social media presence. It was only in February this year – just before her 19th birthday – that she finally released her proper debut, As She Pleases, a seven-track EP of retro-futuristic R&amp;B. If the early days of Bieber’s career were characterised by cheesy teen-pop, Beer seems determined to skip straight to the credible reinvention. In Glasgow, her teenage fans have turned out in force, and while Beer carries herself with a regal poise, she still seems impressed that the school disco crowd already know her songs back to front. They loudly echo the doo-wop vamping of Teenager in Love, a swaying throwback to the days of the drive-in, and pre-empt the sweet chorus to Fools, a glittering, Gorillaz-style groove that foregrounds Beer’s smoky vocals. This brief 45-minute set is boosted by some incongruous cover choices. Beer delivers a pin-drop performance of Labrinth’s piano ballad outlier Jealous and finds an unexpected Hawaiian sway within Radiohead’s Creep. These are good showcases for her somersaulting voice but her own songs are arguably more fun. On the dancehall throb of Home With You, she shoos away a sleazy suitor while on the waspish Dead – her biggest hit and a rousing encore – she forensically eviscerates a shiftless lover. In full you-go-girl flight, Beer is impossible to resist. At Academy, Manchester, 24 March.

But new businesses like Eve Sleep, Simba and Casper, which look and act like tech firms, are using massive marketing budgets to make the rather dull business of buying a new mattress seem like fun and promote the idea of a “bed in a box” that is delivered to your front door like a pizza. While several traditional bed firms, including Feather &amp; Black and Warren Evans, have gone bust in recent months the new sellers have waded into the bed business and stolen a 5% slice of the annual market, up from zero four years ago. There are predictions that could reach 20% in the next three years. Another major player, Bensons for Beds, is struggling for survival amid financial difficulties at its parent company Steinhoff. “We believe it is a game changing shift,” says Jas Bagniewski, co-founder and chief executive of British startup Eve, where sales are rising by more than 100% a year in the UK. “We have a better priced and more engaging aspirational brand, a much better customer offer and you can get it delivered next day. If you look at the more traditional brands you can see they are struggling.” The three new firms all boast about the science behind their products, but they are basically just foam and/or springs like any other. The key innovation is that they squash their mattresses flat, roll them, pop them in a box and deliver them within a week or even next day – all at a price often lower than available for a similar mattress on the high street. It is a very long way from the more traditional trip to a bed specialist or department store and the embarrassing business of trying them out in public and then waiting weeks for manufacture and delivery. The new mattress firms offer a three month sale or return if they prove too hard or too soft for a good night’s sleep. About 12% of Eve’s mattresses are returned, down from 17% a year ago. Anyone worried that they may be buying a new mattress that someone else has previously slept on for weeks before deciding it was not for them can rest easy: those sent back are re-covered and then sold as secondhand through third-party sites such as eBay. All three of the firms started in 2014. Casper is a privately owned US firm which has already expanded to countries including the UK, Austria and Switzerland. It shares investors with tech firms like Twitter and Snapchat. Simba and Eve are UK firms, with Simba being backed by Richard Reed, an entrepreneur who has already made one fortune as a co-founder of Innocent drinks, and Richard Goldstein of the family that founded Superdrug. Eve’s investors include Channel 4 and star City investor Neil Woodford. The company floated on the London AIM market last year and the company, though loss-making, is now valued at around £150m. Eve sold 32,000 mattresses last year. Patrick O’Brien, an analyst at City research group GlobalData, says the new way of buying mattresses means online will account for 20% of sales by 2021. He reckons Bensons for Beds is particularly vulnerable to the new competition, because deliveries take too long, are too expensive and the store chain has failed to develop its own online alternative. But most of the traditional players are not taking the new competition lying down. John Lewis is now selling Simba on its website, while at the cheaper end of the market Argos is offering a same day delivery service and market leader Ikea’s shoppers can carry their new mattress away the same day. The bed specialist Dreams has created its own bed in a box under a the brand Hyde &amp; Sleep and the company’s chief executive, Mike Logue, says sales soared 256% last year. “We need to be in that space and to have that offer,” he said. He reckons all the money piling into marketing mattresses will persuade Britons to replace their sleeping set-up more often than the current 12 years and could increase the market overall. He also thinks the new mattress sellers will struggle to make a profit. “When [online specialists] “spend that amount of marketing money, they are going to sell some products. The job is to try and make some money out of selling them. We are break even at best – and we are making it ourselves,” he says. Eve, for instance, revealed a £19m loss last year, up from £11m the year before – mainly because it spent nearly half the value of its £28m in sales on marketing. That would be enough to give many investors sleepless nights – but so far they are not sending their mattresses back."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2018/mar/22/best-way-to-keep-microsoft-windows-programs-up-to-date-secunia-personal-software-inspector-discontinued","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-22T11:01:36Z","webTitle":"What's the best way to keep Windows programs up to date?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/mar/22/best-way-to-keep-microsoft-windows-programs-up-to-date-secunia-personal-software-inspector-discontinued","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2018/mar/22/best-way-to-keep-microsoft-windows-programs-up-to-date-secunia-personal-software-inspector-discontinued","fields":{"headline":"What's the best way to keep Windows programs up to date?","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Now that Flexera has announced end-of-life on Secunia Personal Software Inspector, do you have any recommendations for a replacement?

Microsoft also made “SDL’s tools, processes and guidance available free of charge to any organisation that wanted to adapt it to their own business”. It got more than 1m downloads by 2008, so many others benefited, too. As Windows became harder to exploit, attackers shifted their attention to weaker programs that were commonly found on Windows PCs. These included Sun’s (now Oracle’s) Java JRE, Macromedia’s (now Adobe’s) Reader and Flash Player, and Apple’s iTunes and QuickTime. This created a problem. You could keep Windows up to date by installing the security patches that Microsoft released on the second Tuesday of each month, but how could you keep non-Microsoft software up to date? If you used software from 50 different sources, did you really want to run 50 background processes to check for updates? If not, did you want to visit 50 websites to check for new versions? Secunia’s Personal Software Inspector (PSI) and similar programs solved that problem. They scanned the software on your PC, checked it against a database of the latest versions, and either installed the updates or gave you a link to do it manually. PSI was by far the best of the bunch, partly because it covered a wider range of software, and partly because it also checked major Microsoft software components as well. (Not all Microsoft updates install correctly.) I’ve been using Secunia since 2007. However, the Danish company was taken over by Flexera in 2015, and Flexera has now decided to drop PSI. The program is telling users: “On April 20, 2018, Flexera will be ending support life for PSI. On that day, PSI will no longer be functioning and should be uninstalled.” SUMo leads the way There are more than a dozen alternatives to Secunia’s PSI. I’ve looked at many of them, and I installed the half-dozen that looked most promising. A proper review would involve running them for weeks rather than a few days, but two stand out: KC Softwares’ SUMo (Software Updates Monitor) and Patch My PC Home Updater. KC Softwares is a French company that offers a lot of small utilities, while Patch My PC targets enterprises that use Microsoft’s System Center Configuration Manager. (Until 2017, the founder, Justin Chalfant, worked with SCCM at Microsoft.) SUMo was one of the best at finding programs where later versions are available. It found programs that were bundled with my Dell PC, such as Dell Digital Delivery, and the odd utility I didn’t know I had, such as GraphStudioNext. (It’s bundled with the K-Lite Codec Pack.) It found 36 programs in all, which is a long way short of PSI, which found 96, including Windows, Office and tiddlers such as LeakTest and SpaceMonger. SUMo takes “latest version” literally. For example, it told me that WinAmp had been updated from version 5.6.6.3507 to version 5.6.6.3516 and Everything from 1.4.1.877 to 1.4.1.895. Do I care? Not a lot. To be fair, it did class these as “minor updates”, but it’s not worth showing them unless a security fix is involved. The major drawback becomes apparent when you select a program and click Get Update. This takes you to KC Softwares’ website, which tries to sell you SUMo Pro. If you don’t want to pay, you can follow a link to download the new version from the supplier’s website. The price is reasonable. KC Softwares charges €14.99/£14.41 for one year of SUMo Pro for four PCs (same user) or €29.99/£28.82 for lifetime use. Patch My PC does the job The main alternative is Patch My PC, which reminds me of Ninite. In other words, it supports a limited number of programs – 302 at the current count – that it can install and update automatically. The result is a faster and nicer experience. (Ninite only supports 84 programs, or 120 in Ninite Pro, which includes multiple versions of some programs.) Patch My PC only found 15 programs out of the 100 or so on my PC. This included four of my six browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Opera and Vivaldi), Microsoft’s .NET Framework, OneDrive and, amusingly enough, SUMo. It didn’t include, for example, FreeFileSync or Nvidia’s GeForce Experience. Patch My PC suggested I needed to update CrystalDiskInfo from version 7.5.1 to 7.5.2, and one click did it silently and effectively. There is an option to make “silent installs” visible, if you like to see what’s going on. Patch My PC also includes a Scheduler and an Uninstaller. The Scheduler lets you set a time to scan your PC, with nine options from daily to monthly. The Uninstaller looks quite useful. On my PC, it found dozens of things it could remove, including 30 different programs from Nvidia. Patch My PC obviously has a more limited range than SUMo, and its usefulness will depend on the software you have installed. If you are running the Adobe utilities (Air, Flash, Reader) and Java JRE then it will be more useful to you than it is to me. (I never install them.) If you only have a handful of the 302 programs installed, then it’s probably not much use … though it might encourage you to try a few of them. The real question is whether it leaves you at risk. If it doesn’t update most of your software then technically, perhaps, it does. However, malware writers usually target the low-hanging fruit. They are only really interested in programs that are relatively easy to exploit and widely installed. As well as the usual suspects, that includes Windows and Microsoft Office, because a lot of people – and some major organisations – don’t install all the security updates. Programs that are not in Patch My PC’s top 300 seem unlikely to be targeted, though do let me know if you think of any exceptions. Either way, failing to update Audiograbber, DoubleKiller, Pixresizer, SpaceMonger etc doesn’t seem like much of a security risk to me. Also ran I’m planning to run both SUMo and Patch My PC until April 20 to see how they fare against PSI. The ones I’m uninstalling include FileHippo App Manager, Glary’s Software Update, Kaspersky’s Free Software Updater and Heimdal Free, though you could still give them a try. FileHippo’s App Manager, previously known as Update Checker, isn’t bad. It could update 40 programs on my PC, and it installed updates quickly and painlessly. However, it found beta programs, which is silly for a security program, and it doesn’t scan your whole PC, just “the default locations for applications”. You have to add other locations separately. If you don’t fancy my choices, it’s the best of the rest. I was disappointed with Glary’s Software Update, which tried to include Malware Hunter with its download. Like Patch My PC, it installs and updates a range of programs, but it only supports 133. Also, you have to install updates manually unless you buy the Pro version. Kaspersky’s Updater didn’t provide a list of the programs it scanned and it found nothing to update. At this point, I’d rather pay for PSI … Have you got a question?

There is just one obstacle: he is a quarter of the way through serving a 20-year jail sentence for murder. “My dreams are bigger than my mistakes,” says Da Silva, a slightly built man with a broad smile. “I am doing everything to get out of here as soon as I can.” Da Silva, 28, an inmate at the men’s prison in Itaúna, a town in Minas Gerais, south-east Brazil, is chipping away at his sentence and has already reduced it by two years through work and study at the Association for Protection and Assistance to Convicts (Apac) prison. Here, inmates wear their own clothes, prepare their own food and are even in charge of security. At an Apac jail, there are no guards or weapons, and inmates literally hold the keys. A visit to the Apac men’s and women’s prisons in Itaúna subverts all expectations about the penal system in Brazil, where overcrowding, squalor and gang rivalry regularly cause deadly riots. These widely reported outbreaks are one reason Brazil’s penitentiaries are often regarded as a ticking timebomb where inmates languish in inhumane conditions with little chance of rehabilitation. Brazil has the world’s fourth largest prison population. In Itaúna, the main door of the men’s jail is opened by David Rodrigues de Oliveira, a recuperando or “recovering person”, as inmates are known in the Apac system. This word is displayed alongside his name on a lanyard that also states his category of regime: closed, semi-open or open. In contrast with mainstream prisons, Apac inmates are addressed by name rather than number. “I have no thought of escaping. I’m near the end and have almost paid for my crime. They put their trust in me and it’s my responsibility to guard the door,” says Da Oliveira, 32. “My next step is conditional release, where I can go out once a week. I have my family to think of. I wouldn’t jeopardise that.” Another reason inmates uphold the strict routine of work and study required by Apac – under which no one is permitted to stay in their cells unless they are sick or being punished – is that an escape attempt would return them to the mainstream system, which all inmates have experienced before. No detail of the contrasting regimes escapes the inmates. “Here we eat with metal knives and forks, while there we are given plastic, as if we are not human beings,” says recuperando Luiz Fernando Estevez Da Silva. “It’s not only the criminal who goes to jail, it’s his family. There, relatives who visit are strip-searched.” Twenty or more people crammed in a cell, filthy mattresses and inedible food are common complaints in mainstream prisons. Apac prisons, coordinated and supported by the Italian AVSI Foundation and the Brazilian Fraternity of Assistance to Convicts (FBA), impose a limit of 200 inmates to prevent overcrowding. New arrivals come with shoulders bowed and hands behind their backs, says Da Silva, and they first have to learn not to stare at the floor. Founded in 1972 by a group of Catholics to provide a humanising alternative to mainstream prisons, the system has now reached 49 jails in Brazil, and has branches in Costa Rica, Chile and Ecuador. They seek to rehabilitate inmates, who must show remorse. They are cheaper to run, have lower rates of recidivism, and are designed to benefit the wider community. Ana Paula Pellegrino, of the Igarape Institute thinktank in Rio de Janeiro, says: “By committing a crime, prisoners break the social pact. An Apac prison restores this by allowing inmates to work for the community. Some prisoners might go out to sweep the streets, for example, which gives them a sense of responsibility and belonging.” In the semi-open section of the prison, Rodrigo de Oliveiro Pinto, 35, enjoys the quiet job of running the storeroom, where a poetry book is open on his desk. De Pinto has 12 years to serve for murder. He wants to work in an Apac after release. “My head was messed up and I got into trouble. Coming here changed me. I want to come back to help others.” In the closed area, the Apac philosophy is written on the wall, with slogans including: “The man enters, the crime stays outside.” Prisoners convicted of the most heinous crimes are here, yet it feels calm and safe. In the woodwork room, the mood feels darker. “This area is for the new arrivals,” says Jacopo Sabatiello, vice-president of AVSI Brazil. “They have broken something with their hands so now they must make something good with their hands. When they go to the semi-open area they will do work that gets outside, past the door.” In the garden behind the building, Renato Diego Da Souza, 31, is sticking labels on bottles for soap, to be sold outside. Prisoners also bake bread for local schools and produce plastic car parts. Da Souza says his problems began with drugs, which led him into armed robbery. But there is light at the end of the tunnel after his recent transfer to the semi-open regime. The chance of moving between regimes is a constant topic for the recuperandos. In mainstream prisons, tens of thousands are detained, sometimes for years, before their cases even go to trial. Apacs are an effective way to respect human rights within Brazil’s penitential system, says Judge Paulo Antônio de Carvalho. “I’m in no doubt that prisoners’ individuality and fundamental rights as guaranteed by the constitution are respected … a prisoner should only lose his liberty, but keep his fundamental rights.” It is a sad reflection on the mainstream system that Apacs are praised for upholding the law in a judicial system that unfairly dishes out tougher sentences to certain sections of society, mainly poor, black people, De Carvalho says. With such a successful track record, why aren’t there more Apacs? “Every time there is another prison riot in Brazil, someone gets the phone to say they want to open an Apac in that area,” says Sabatiello. “But opening an Apac requires several things, including involvement of the state [where it is located] and political will.” Financial problems, overcrowding and corruption have bedevilled efforts to open an Apac in Rio. These are typical hurdles. Across town, in the open section of at the Apac women’s prison, inmate Aguimara Campos, 30, explains her role as president of the eight-member council of sincerity and solidarity, which organises some aspects of prison life and is a bridge with the administration. Sitting at a table in a sunny patio where women are making handicrafts, she describes how different her prison life used to be. She was convicted of trafficking and association after 26g of crack cocaine was found in her house. “I knew nothing about the criminal life and was thrown in a cell with 29 other women, sleeping on mattresses on the floor. The woman next to me had decapitated her neighbour and had carried the head around in a bag.” Tatiane Correia de Lima, a 26-year-old mother of two who holds the keys to the closed section, says moving to an Apac has restored her femininity. “The other prisons take away your womanhood. We weren’t allowed proper mirrors. When I saw my reflection here, at first I didn’t know who I was.” Reporting for this article was made possible by a residency at Casa Pública provided by Agência Pública"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/mar/22/catalan-secessionist-parties-propose-third-potential-leader-jordi-turull-courts","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-22T09:51:35Z","webTitle":"Catalan parties propose third potential leader in race against courts","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/22/catalan-secessionist-parties-propose-third-potential-leader-jordi-turull-courts","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/mar/22/catalan-secessionist-parties-propose-third-potential-leader-jordi-turull-courts","fields":{"headline":"Catalan parties propose third potential leader in race against courts","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Catalan pro-independence parties are launching a third bid to elect a regional president hours before their latest candidate appears before a judge over his part in the push for secession. MPs will meet at 5pm on Thursday for a hastily convened investiture debate that could result in the election of Jordi Turull, former chief of staff to Carles Puigdemont, the deposed Catalan president. On Friday morning, Turull is due to attend the supreme court where he and five other separatist leaders will learn what exact charges they face over last year’s unilateral referendum and subsequent declaration of independence. Turull and the others, who face rebellion charges that carry a maximum 30-year sentence, could be remanded in custody. If charged, Puigdemont’s former aide could be barred from holding office. Catalonia has been under direct rule from Madrid since the end of October, when Spain’s prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, responded to the unilateral independence declaration by sacking Puigdemont and his government and calling snap elections that where held in December. The three Catalan pro-independence parties retained their majority but have struggled to elect a president. Puigdemont, who fled to Belgium five months ago and faces immediate arrest should he return to Spain, had hoped to reassume office but abandoned his campaign after a court ruled he would have to attend an investiture debate in person. Puigdemont anointed Jordi Sànchez, a prominent independence leader and MP from his Together for Catalonia party, as the new candidate. But Spain’s supreme court ruled that Sànchez, who has been in custody since October, could not leave prison to be invested. On Wednesday, Sànchez withdrew his candidacy and gave up his seat in parliament, saying it was “the best service I can now do for my country”. Turull described his nomination as “an immense honour”, adding: “If parliament gives me its confidence, I will work ceaselessly for the progress and protection of 7.5 million Catalans, their rights, their freedom and their democratic mandates.” However, to be elected, he will need the support of the small, anti-capitalist Popular Unity candidacy (CUP), which is pushing for the swift resumption of the independence process. After the 2015 elections, the CUP refused to support Puigdemont’s predecessor, Artur Mas, arguing he was too mired in corruption allegations. Mas stepped aside, clearing the way for Puigdemont’s presidency. CUP MPs will meet two hours before the investiture debate to decide whether to back Turull, who was fiercely loyal to Mas. Roger Torrent, the pro-independence speaker of the Catalan parliament, said he had moved to call the debate so quickly because of the Spanish authorities’ “meddling in our parliament in recent days and weeks”. The Spanish government, which has repeatedly warned Catalan MPs to choose a “clean candidate”, accused Torrent of damaging the dignity of the regional parliament. It has also warned it could maintain control of Catalonia’s institutions until there is a new government that “abides by the law”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2018/mar/22/john-oliver-gay-rabbit-book-parody-outsells-mike-pence-original-amazon","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-22T05:58:00Z","webTitle":"John Oliver's gay rabbit book parody outsells Mike Pence's original on Amazon","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/mar/22/john-oliver-gay-rabbit-book-parody-outsells-mike-pence-original-amazon","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/mar/22/john-oliver-gay-rabbit-book-parody-outsells-mike-pence-original-amazon","fields":{"headline":"John Oliver's gay rabbit book parody outsells Mike Pence's original on Amazon","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"A children’s picture book released by comedian John Oliver about a gay bunny has hit the top spot on Amazon, outselling a vanilla version featuring US vice-president’s Mike Pence’s pet rabbit. The satirical doppelganger titled Last Week Tonight with John Oliver Presents A Day in the Life of Marlon Bundo was strategically released by the British late-night TV host a day before Marlon Bundo’s A Day in the Life of the Vice President, which was written by Pence’s daughter Charlotte and illustrated by his wife, Karen. Within two days of its release, Oliver’s Marlon Bundo had sold 180,000 copies on Amazon and become the bestselling book on the site, outstripping the Pence version which at the time of writing languished in fourth place. The Pence book tells the tale of Marlon Bundo trailing his master for a day, but Oliver’s version, written by comedian and staff writer Jill Twiss, is about “a lonely bunny who lives with his grampa, the vice-president of the United States” who one day “falls in love with another boy bunny”. Oliver’s book explores the rabbit’s struggle to marry a handsome bunny called Wesley, and is a tale “of tolerance and advocacy ... [exploring] issues of same-sex marriage and democracy”. Proceeds from Oliver’s book, which is “dedicated to every bunny who has ever felt different”, go to Aids United and the LGBTQ charity the Trevor Project. Pence is staunchly opposed to gay marriage, warning in 2006 it would lead to the “deterioration of the family” and “societal collapse”. On Sunday Oliver encouraged his viewers to purchase his book, saying: “Selling more books than Pence will probably really piss him off.” The two books’ release sparked a buying and review war between the vice-president’s fans and his detractors. Haters left one-star reviews beneath Pence’s book, while his fans fought back with five-star reviews. One outraged reviewer wrote they bought the Pence book “in response to Mr Oliver’s hate-filled diatribe”. One reviewer wrote beneath Oliver’s book: “After successfully completing my conversion (shock) therapy sessions with Focus on the Family, I found this book sitting on the bus stop corner. After reading three times over, I never knew the struggles of Mr Marlon Bundo could be so pertinent to our nation’s struggles but also our own internal ones. From here on out, only male bunnies for me.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/mar/23/i-need-pressure-clock-starts-ticking-for-bert-van-marwijk","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-23T01:23:50Z","webTitle":"'I need pressure': clock starts ticking for Bert van Marwijk | John Davidson","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/mar/23/i-need-pressure-clock-starts-ticking-for-bert-van-marwijk","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/mar/23/i-need-pressure-clock-starts-ticking-for-bert-van-marwijk","fields":{"headline":"'I need pressure': clock starts ticking for Bert van Marwijk","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"“Time is on my side”, crooned Mick Jagger back in 1964. It’s a luxury the Rolling Stones frontman may have once enjoyed, but not one that currently applies to Bert van Marwijk and his rescue mission for the 2018 World Cup. Parachuted into role at the end of January after Ange Postecoglou’s sudden exit, the clock is already ticking on the Dutchman’s limited time with Australia. At the end of the tournament in Russia he is out and Graham Arnold is in, a sequence already set motion regardless of the 65-year-old’s success at the tournament, and somewhat of an oddity. Time is certainly not in Van Marwijk’s favour. He will just have four competitive matches – against Norway, Colombia, the Czech Republic and Hungary – and no more than 30 days to work with his players and mould them into exactly what he wants before the World Cup campaign kicks off against France. It’s an unenviable task, but one the former Netherlands manager is comfortable with after getting Football Federation Australia to agree to a 19-day camp in Turkey and no farewell game on Australian soil. He has joined the green and gold with his eyes open to the challenge ahead. After battling intensive administrative interference in his last job with Saudi Arabia, with the Socceroos he is clearly calling the shots. “I am not a magician, I cannot in two days learn a team to play exactly the way I like them to do,” he says in Oslo, where the Socceroos take on Norway in his first game in charge. “That costs you a lot of time. That’s why it’s so important that we can start on 19 and 20 May with a training camp for four weeks. We can train every day, that’s very important, and to play two friendly games is enough. “For me working with a team, let them believe in something and play in several ways you need really time on the pitch every day, and as a coach of a national team, in general, you don’t have a lot of time. Now it’s even less. That’s also the challenge.” Van Marwijk is both a pragmatist and a self-described realist, as his past clearly shows. Born and raised in the Dutch town of Deventer, he spent almost his whole playing career in his homeland in the Eredivisie. The midfielder was part of a glorious era of Dutch football in the 1970s and then the late 1980s, the days of Total Football, Rinus Michels and Johan Cryuff, and then the emergence of Marco van Basten, Ruud Gullit and Frank Rijkaard. But Van Marwijk’s playing career was curtailed by injury and a series of serious knee problems. The midfielder earned just a single international cap for Oranje, coming in a friendly in 1975 against Yugoslavia. Van Marwijk had a 20-year career that only eventually ended in 1988 with Belgian club FC Assent. He was determined and driven to battle on. While he might not have hit the highest of highs on the field, he has thrown everything into coaching off it. He led an unfancied Feyenoord side to European and Cup success before taking Holland all the way to the 2010 World Cup final. His time with the Green Falcons more recently was short and sharp – just 20 games – but he guided the Asian nation back to the World Cup. But principled and strong-willed, Van Marwijk walked out when the Saudi Arabian Football Federation started compromising his control of the team. “At the moment we qualified, I had a feeling everybody wanted to get it involved,” he says. “My way of working is that I do it my way and when they don’t like that I go home. I like to work with people I like to work with. at the end there were a few people out of my staff, and they put them out. And I didn’t agree with them. I said, ‘You can say what you want, but if you don’t get those people back I will not stay’.” Frank Sinatra’s My Way, then, might be a better fit than the Stones’ cover for the silver-haired Dutchman. His mantra of team first, individuals second, collective-focused and fast, interchangeable football is aimed at taking a hard-working team out of a dangerous Group C containing France, Denmark and Peru and into the round of 16, which would equal the feat achieved by his fellow Dutchman Guus Hiddink in 2006. Uncompromising and disciplined, but unafraid to lighten the Socceroo camp with humour when required, Van Marwijk is a seasoned professional who is all about results. Getting the job done and moving forward is the only importance, not aesthetics or lofty ideals or media messaging. This vastly different approach to his predecessor, who was part philosopher and part trailblazer, may just bear fruit in the Russian pressure-cooker. “My goal is to survive the first round...then I will be very happy,” he says. “If I thought we could not do that, I would not sign. I am a realist, with a little bit of optimism. You have to have pressure, you need pressure to perform. It must not be too high, but without pressure you will not perform. I need it myself too. I think its a realistic goal, it will be very difficult to go for the survival.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"society/2018/apr/03/the-closure-of-the-riverside-centre-in-orange-a-photo-essay","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-02T18:00:17Z","webTitle":"The closure of the Riverside Centre in Orange – a photo essay","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/apr/03/the-closure-of-the-riverside-centre-in-orange-a-photo-essay","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/apr/03/the-closure-of-the-riverside-centre-in-orange-a-photo-essay","fields":{"headline":"The closure of the Riverside Centre in Orange – a photo essay","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"While I was studying photography I worked for many years as a support worker for people with intellectual disabilities. Their often untold stories have always fascinated me. When I heard that one of the last remaining institutions for people with disabilities, in Orange, New South Wales, was closing, I had to go and see for myself. The few remaining residents were about to embark on their transition to living in the community, and were having a ball to celebrate the decades there. Severn Oaks was the main recreation centre and was the epicentre of daily activities and events. The juxtaposition of Riverside’s beautifully kept grounds with the decaying, ominous buildings is arresting. The centre was built in 1925 as part of the Bloomfield hospital. Over its 92-year history the centre underwent many transformations, especially in the attitudes towards the residents. Kenny Taylor Stuart Parr John Le Strange When Riverside opened it was deemed more appropriate to keep people with disabilities out of society’s view, and there was no real distinction between people with mental health issues and those with an intellectual disability. They lived together when the centre opened. It wasn’t until the 1970s that attitudes began to change. By 1985 the Riverside Centre was established as a specialised service area for people with disabilities. John Le Strange with support worker Giovanni Londero, who has worked with him since 1977 As I wandered through the grounds there were reminders of the people who once occupied the space. I wandered past the old vegetable gardens and chook pens and into the old lolly shop and activities halls, through the restrictive wards where there were bars on windows, from a time when it was thought better to lock residents up, for their own safety. Above and right: John, Stuart and Kenny inside their bedrooms at Riverside. Below: Mark Jachi, Ray Williamson and Aaron Machiri. I ran into a former employee, Ray Williamson, who was now working with Orange North Rotary to ensure the old equipment was sent to Zimbabwe, where it could still be used. He and other former employees expressed sadness at the loss of what they felt was a close, self-sustained community, where many of the residents and staff lived together for decades. In 1998 the government announced a 10-year plan to close large centres and move residents into the community, in line with international trends. One by one each of the buildings at the Riverside Centre was decommissioned. As part of the national disability insurance scheme (NDIS), all residents from Riverside were to be rehomed in the community. In April 2017, there were only eight residents remaining, including Stuart, John and Kenny, who would be moving to their new house in a matter of weeks, after the much-anticipated farewell ball. John Le Strange getting ready for the ball with help from the support workers. I met John in the admin offices, where he would wander in and hassle staff for their watches. His fascination with watches and clocks was closely matched by his love of sharp dressing. The staff had a stash of watches and clocks they would rotate with John, to keep his busy hands idle. I accompanied John with Giovanni Londero on their afternoon walks through the grounds, John with his favourite stroller and doll, which gave him purpose and helped him walk. Londero has worked with John since 1977 and moved with him to his new house. Kenny Taylor (left), Stuart Parr and John Le Strange. Kenny, who has a fascination with cars, thought it was hilarious that I arrived in my old Toyota, and took great pleasure in letting me know what a bomb it was. He showed me his room at the centre and took great pride in telling me about all the cars on his posters. Kenny arrived at the Riverside in 1991. His other love, shoes, was expressed in a picture book which he enjoyed talking about with Giovanni. Stuart is an instantly likeable, happy-go-lucky fellow who was most excited about the upcoming ball. Stuart arrived at the Riverside Centre in 1985 and would be moving with Kenny and John. Stuart Parr dancing with one of the local residents at the Riverside ball. On the day of the ball, a staff member arranged for her father’s vintage car to go from house to house so that every one of the former residents could get a photo with it. The party’s theme was 1920s, in recognition of the centre’s origins. At the ball, there was a lot of loud catching up to do among former residents and staff. It didn’t take long for everyone to hit the dancefloor. Halfway through the night an Elvis impersonator emerged, to the delight of everyone. Stuart, Kenny and John moved into their new house a few weeks later. I heard that some had struggled at first, before settling in. At Christmas I went to visit them in their purpose-built house on the outskirts of town, on a property large enough to include a gym and veggie garden.

The company, which is more than 200 years old, describes itself as the world’s largest commercial producer of currency and passports and claims to supply products to two-thirds of all countries. Domestically, the company has contracts with the Bank of England, Bank of Scotland, Clydesdale Bank and Royal Bank of Scotland to produce the newer polymer bank notes. It has been introducing the technology around the world, with Botswana and the Maldives other countries to have made the switch. De La Rue also prints money for Qatar, Kuwait, the Bahamas and the Seychelles, among others. The biggest concern over the loss of the UK passport contract centres on the company’s printing plant in Gateshead where it employs 600 people, of whom about 100 are thought to work in the passport division. The company has not said these jobs have been put at risk. The chief executive, Martin Sutherland, said: “We have a very skilled, proud workforce in Gateshead and I am going to have face those workers, look at them in the whites of the eyes and try to explain to them why the British government thinks it’s a sensible decision to buy French passports not British passports. “I would like to invite Theresa May or Amber Rudd to come to my factory and explain to my dedicated workforce why they think this is a sensible decision to offshore the manufacture of a British icon.” As well as UK passports, the company manufactures identity documents and e-passports for countries as far apart as Trinidad and Tobago, Qatar and Afghanistan. On occasion it also uses its printing presses to make special-edition bank notes. A Star Wars note issued in support of the Together For Short Lives charity raised more than £185,000 in an eBay auction in November. De La Rue printers have a long history, going back to 1813 when Thomas de la Rue published the first edition of the Guernsey newspaper Le Miroir Politique. Within eight years, De la Rue had established himself in London as a printer and stationer. By 1855 the company was printing postage stamps, and in 1860 it began printing money, at first for Mauritius. Over the years it has also manufactured playing cards, board games and fountain pens. De La Rue was part of the Camelot consortium that bid for the first UK national lottery contracts in the 1990s. It sold its interest in Camelot in 2010. The company will post its latest financial results next month, and has said profits are expected to be at the lower end of previous estimates."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/mar/22/minister-forced-to-change-his-own-app-after-data-mining-complaints","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-22T09:24:54Z","webTitle":"Minister forced to change his own app after data-mining complaints","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/22/minister-forced-to-change-his-own-app-after-data-mining-complaints","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/mar/22/minister-forced-to-change-his-own-app-after-data-mining-complaints","fields":{"headline":"Minister forced to change his own app after data-mining complaints","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The culture secretary, Matt Hancock, has been forced to change the settings on his own app after complaints that it was harvesting the data and photos of users. Speaking to ITV’s Good Morning Britain after criticising Facebook for breaching the privacy of millions of its users, Hancock admitted he received complaints about the way his app accessed users’ data. Hancock became the first MP to launch an app last month as a way of engaging constituents, but it was immediately criticised for mining data about users including their personal photos. The culture secretary said the complaints had given him personal experience of some of the issues currently confronting Facebook. He said: “We updated the privacy settings on that app after getting the feedback that came with the launch. We significantly strengthened the privacy settings because of this sort of feedback.” Hancock said the row about the data breach at Facebook highlighted the need for the public to have more control over their data. He added: “The things this really shows is the need for more transparency in the big tech companies, so we know what they are doing with our data and that in itself can bring more accountability. “So instead of this going on for ages and then an apology only when it comes out in a newspaper, the big tech companies treat data with the respect that it needs right from the start.” Speaking later to BBC Radio 4’s Today programme he said: “Mark Zuckerberg [the chief executive of Facebook] has apologised and said they are going to make some changes but frankly I don’t think those changes go far enough. “And anyway it should not be for a company to decide what is the appropriate balance between privacy and innovation.” Those rules should be set by society, he added. On ITV he was asked whether he was doing something comparable to Facebook by launching an app that accessed users’ photos. He said: “It didn’t gain the access but it did ask for the access, because we actually asked for more consent than was actually needed. That absolutely has been fixed. It demonstrates just how important it is to get this right.” He added: “Mine is for engaging with my constituents it is not actually about making money, as Facebook is.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2018/mar/23/labor-attacks-greens-marine-park-plan","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-23T03:36:38Z","webTitle":"Labor attacks Greens for dithering over marine park plan","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/mar/23/labor-attacks-greens-marine-park-plan","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/mar/23/labor-attacks-greens-marine-park-plan","fields":{"headline":"Labor attacks Greens for dithering over marine park plan","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Labor has blasted the Greens for not lining up immediately behind their commitment to disallow controversial new marine park management plans proposed by the Turnbull government this week. The shadow environment minister, Tony Burke, told Guardian Australia the government had been intent for four years “on the largest removal of area from conservation in history”. “This will be the first time the parliament has had a chance to object and Labor will be standing firm against this decision,” Burke said. The Greens on Thursday reserved their position on the disallowance. The party’s healthy oceans spokesman, Peter Whish-Wilson, said if the plans were disallowed, “then we move from some protections to no protections, and the protections of our oceans have to rely on Labor winning government and the conservative major and minor parties not having the numbers to disallow whatever plans Labor put in place”. Whish-Wilson accused Burke of “being disingenuous by saying these plans are a step backwards from what is there now. He never got the protections in place before Tony Abbott won office and right now these areas have no protections … Until there is a plan of management, these are marine parks on paper only.” But Burke said: “The management plans were made law in 2012 when I was environment minister”. He said Whish-Wilson “should know this as he was a senator at the time when the Greens supported and voted to establish the marine parks”. “Back then the Greens supported Labor in backing the marine parks,” Burke said. “If they want to backflip and start voting with the Liberals on marine parks that’s a matter for them, but Labor will not help the government lock in the largest removal of area from conservation in history”. The government’s new marine park management plans were uploaded by officials onto the federal register of legislation on Tuesday, cutting across a public announcement the government had planned to make on Wednesday. The environment minister, Josh Frydenberg, rejected Burke’s characterisation of his deliberations. He described the new regime as “a world-leading management regime”. Frydenberg said the plans would mean Australia had 36% of its waters included in marine parks, and would benefit recreational fishers. He said under the revised arrangements, 97% of commonwealth waters within 100km of the coast would be open for recreational fishing, and 80% of marine parks. Frydenberg said the government’s proposal would mean an increase of 200,000 square kilometres in the area with seafloor protection. Frydenberg warned if the plans were not supported by parliament, protections for marine parks would revert to the status quo. Frydenberg said it would “take years to go through the necessary statutory processes and bring forward new plans”. Whish-Wilson said on Thursday he needed more time to consult scientific experts and conservation groups about the impact of the government proposal before the Greens decided how to vote. “What the Liberals have before the Senate is woefully inadequate and doesn’t deserve the name of a marine reserve,” Whish-Wilson said. “But the dilemma facing the environment movement and communities who have campaigned for decades to get marine protections in place is whether a disallowance might mean no protections at all for the next decade.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/mar/22/football-transfer-rumours-napoli-jorginho-to-replace-emre-can-at-liverpool","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-22T08:40:58Z","webTitle":"Football transfer rumours: Jorginho to replace Emre Can at Liverpool?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/mar/22/football-transfer-rumours-napoli-jorginho-to-replace-emre-can-at-liverpool","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/mar/22/football-transfer-rumours-napoli-jorginho-to-replace-emre-can-at-liverpool","fields":{"headline":"Football transfer rumours: Jorginho to replace Emre Can at Liverpool?","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Everton have plundered many a player from Manchester United over the years: Morgan Schneiderlin, Darron Gibson, Jesper Blomqvist, John O’Kane. Well, you’ve got to keep trying, haven’t you. And to be fair Phil Neville worked out quite well, so they’re now in for Luke Shaw and Phil Jones. Perhaps they should also make a cheeky bid for Alexis Sánchez, who is reportedly having second thoughts about moving to Old Trafford right now, not that you could take a wild guess. United are thinking Gareth Bale might be a better bet, and his signing from Real Madrid would stop David de Gea walking off in a what’s-the-point-of-it-all huff. They’ll also offer £50m for Raphaël Varane. Those deals may see Anthony Martial on his way to Valencia, along with Marouane Fellani and Matteo Darmian, while Real would compensate for their losses by making off with Harry Kane. That’s quite the transfer merry-go-round, though this was supposed to be about Everton. So they want Jack Wilshere, though if that falls through they’ll make do with Oguzhan Ozyakup of Besiktas instead. There. Over the park, Liverpool midfielder Emre Can wants to take his gentle, easy-does-it, no-point-rushing-things, now-let-me-think style to “a very big club” next season. Yes, that quote will go down well, won’t it. Juventus are usually cited here, though Real Madrid have apparently thrown their hat into the ring, according to his corn-earning agent the Mill presumes. Napoli midfielder Jorginho could take Can’s place, providing the Reds make the top four. More bad news for Spurs, if you take that Kane-to-Madrid rumour seriously: Chelsea are the latest club in for Toby Alderweireld. They join a queue headed by Manchester United, followed by stragglers Liverpool and Arsenal. The Gunners are also looking to bolster their defence with Rúben Dias from Benfica. Reading will replace Jaap Stam with Paul Clement; Burnley want West Brom’s Craig Dawson; and Mark Hughes wants his old Stoke City mucker Xherdan Shaqiri at Southampton next season. That last one depends on who manages to stay up, of course. Not sure what happens if they both go down.

The 57-year-old woman was arrested on Wednesday on suspicion of causing intentional harm or distress following a complaint from a member of the public, and she received a court summons, South Yorkshire police said. A video posted online shows the woman telling a police officer she brought a rape alarm “because they are raping the trees”. Scarcely audible among the sound of chainsaws, the woman can be heard asking a police officer which law she is breaking by playing her red plastic trumpet. As the officer walks away, the woman can be seen apparently playing a quick toot on the instrument, before she is taken away by officers to cries of “shame” from onlookers. She can then be seen arguing with officers about why it is a criminal act to “play my musical instrument”, before the high-pitched sound of a rape alarm cries out. Officers then confiscate her trumpet and put her in the back of a police van. The dispute over the felling of trees has become so toxic that this weekend the Sunday Times cited it as the reason Sheffield no longer made its list of the best places to live. The woman with the rape alarm was one of a number of protesters accused of breaking the law while trying to protect trees on Wednesday. A 49-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of a public order offence and accepted a fixed penalty notice, police said. A 65-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of obstructing work under section 303 of the Highways Act 1980. A number of other people at the site were also reported on summons under section 303, South Yorkshire police said. A 61-year-old woman was taken to hospital after being injured in the protest. Police called the Yorkshire ambulance service and she was taken to casualty “as a precaution”, the force said. It said in a statement on Wednesday: “Earlier today, due to the peaceful nature of the protests, police resources were withdrawn from the site. However, only a short time later a breach of the designated safety zone temporarily stopped work, and a number of people were observed gathering on the road. “Due to the breach, and safety concerns associated with people standing on a live highway, a number of officers were sent back to the site until the tree work had completed.” Thousands of street trees in the city are being felled and replaced with saplings as part of a PFI highways maintenance contract. Campaigners object to what they say is the unnecessary removal of healthy trees."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/live/2018/mar/22/bank-of-england-interest-rates-decision-fed-brexit-inflation-business-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-22T17:53:33Z","webTitle":"Global markets hit as Trump unveils China tariffs;  Bank leaves rates on hold - as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2018/mar/22/bank-of-england-interest-rates-decision-fed-brexit-inflation-business-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/live/2018/mar/22/bank-of-england-interest-rates-decision-fed-brexit-inflation-business-live","fields":{"headline":"Global markets hit as Trump unveils China tariffs;  Bank leaves rates on hold - as it happened","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"European markets have closed sharply lower, although off their worst levels, as a combination of factors unnerved investors once more. In an echo of the early February slump, share prices around the globe came under pressure. The chief reason was the growing fear of a trade war as President Trump slapped tariffs on China - although more details about the exact targets will come later - in retaliation for supposedly stealing US technology. With the Federal Reserve raising interest rates on Wednesday and the Bank of England signalling a UK increase in May, investors were also rattled by the prospect of the cheap money which has supported markets for years now being more quickly withdrawn. On top of all that, the controversy over Facebook and Cambridge Analytica prompted talk of increased regulation of technology companies. So the final scores showed: The FTSE 100 fell 1.23% or 86.38 points to 6952.59, a new 15 month low Germany’s Dax dropped 1.7% to 12,100.08 France’s Cac closed down 1.38% at 5167.21 Italy’s FTSE MIB finished down 1.85% at 22,397.84 Spain’s Ibex ended 1.49% lower at 9487.4 In Greece, the Athens market lost 1.57% to 787.50 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 272 points or 1.11%, having lost more than 500 points earlier. On that note, it’s time to close for the day. Thanks for your comments, and we’ll be back tomorrow. Here’s more on the exemptions to the US steel and aluminium tariff move: The US move to impose sanctions on China is a high risk strategy, says Mike Jakeman, global analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit: This has been clearly signposted by the Trump administration and is actually likely to prove broadly popular with US businesses and in Congress. The Democratic minority leader in the Senate, Chuck Schumer, welcomed it as a sign of the US standing up to China. But there is a lot riding on China’s response. The US is gambling that any response will be proportionate. China could hit the US hard in return, by making access to the local market harder for US farmers, for example. Were farmers faced with falling prices for the exports and higher prices at home because of the import tariffs, the popularity of the tariffs would diminish quickly. This is a high-risk strategy for the US administration and one that is likely to weaken, rather than strengthen, the global economy. And here’s Trump’s signed tariff sanctions against China: President Trump is signing the order to impose tariffs on China, which he says could be up to $60bn. He says he has been talking to senior Chinese representatives and asked them to cut the deficit by $100bn immediately. He says he wants reciprical deals. “If they charge us, we charge them the same thing.” He says China charges 25% for a US car go in,”but we charge 2% for their cars to come into the US - that’s not good.” He says he has been talking to China, Japan, Europe, and every single one of them wants to negotiate. “In meantime we are sending a section 301 action which I will sign here.” The proposed tariffs on China are expected shortly. AP sums up the situation: The Trump administration is readying restrictions on Chinese investment and tariffs on nearly $50 billion worth of Chinese imports to punish Beijing for stealing American technology and pressuring U.S. companies to hand it over. China is already warning that it will take “all necessary measures” to defend itself, raising the prospect of a trade war between the world’s two biggest economies. The White House says President Donald Trump will direct the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative to publish a list of proposed tariffs for public comment within 15 days. USTR has already identified potential targets: 1,300 product lines worth about $48 billion. The president is also asking Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to come up with a list of restrictions on Chinese investment. A number of countries look like they will be exempt from the proposed US tariffs on steel and aluminium, including the European Union, Mexico, Canada, Australia, Argentina, Brazil and South Korea. China of course is clearly in the frame. Here is the European side, from Daniel Boffey in Brussels: The EU believes it has won a temporary reprieve from president Donald Trump’s tariffs on steel and aluminium after appealing to Washington to take a step back from a potential trade war. Following intensive talks in the US, the EU’s commissioner for trade, Cecilia Malmstrom, said she believed the omens were good, although she indicated concern that the situation could unravel. The US is set to impose 25% tariffs on steel and 10% tariffs on aluminium on Friday. The EU has argued that it should be exempt and has threatened to impose a series of retaliatory measures including import duties on US products. On returning to Brussels after a two-day trip, Malmstrom said she was confident the US commerce secretary, Wilbur Ross, would suggest a temporary exemption for the EU but conceded that the decision remained in Trumps’ hands. “We expect that we are on that list, we don’t know for sure,” she told the European parliament. “It is ultimately the president who decides this. But we expect that secretary Ross will recommend that the EU is excluded as a whole.” The proposed tariffs’ main target is China, which has been flooding the world with cheap steel and aluminium. However, Trump has had few kind words to say about the EU, claiming that it had made life difficult for US exporters. The full story is here: With markets tumbling it is no surprise the measure of volatility is on the way up again: Back with the Bank of England, and is a May rate rise a done deal? Our economics editor Larry Elliott says it would be a suprise if there is no increase but the Bank has been careful to give itself some wriggle room: A rate rise will depend on the economic data that is published over the next month and a half, but judging by the minutes of the MPC’s March meeting that data would have to be quite poor for Threadneedle Street to sit tight. His full analysis is here: And here’s our news story on the Bank’s announcement: The weakness in the FTSE 100 could mean UK-listed companies being targets for potential predators, says Richard Hunter, head of markets at Interactive Investor,: At current levels, the FTSE100 is just a few points from being down 10% in the year to date, knocking on the door of what is often described as correction territory. UK equities on the whole have fallen out of favour with international investors with the spectre of Brexit looming, whilst the recent relative strength of sterling has meant additional pressure on the premier index, where the majority of earnings come from overseas. Meanwhile, the possibility of trade disputes particularly between China and the US is denting sentiment, and the move towards tighter monetary policy is another brick in the wall of worry which investors are currently climbing. This is despite the global, synchronised economic recovery where corporate earnings have so far continued to justify some slightly rich valuations, especially in the US. The UK economy has remained resilient despite any impending Brexit fallout, with the result that some of the top quality FTSE100 companies are moving towards bargain territory – and could even, as a consequence of this index weakness, find foreign groups running the slide rule over some of them as potential bid targets. Markets continue under pressure, ahead of the announcement by President Trump of trade tariffs. Apart from fears of a trade war, investors are also concerned about the fallout from the current Facebook controversy, and the prospect of increased regulation for technology companies. Facebook itself has lost another 3% so far today. So on Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 370 points or 1.5%. In Europe, Germany’s Dax is down 2% and France’s Cac 2.16%. With the prospect of a UK interest rate rise in May, the FTSE 100 has fallen 1.6% to a new 15 month low. The pound’s surge in the immediate wake of the Bank of England announcement has proved short lived, as investors decided that an interest rate rise in May had really already been priced into the market. Sterling has slipped 0.02% to €1.1455 against the euro and is down 0.16% against the dollar at $1.4116. Ken Odeluga, market analyst at City Index, said: Sterling traded against the dollar was able to spike to a fresh seven-week high though it soon settled around 100 pips lower. It remained elevated relative to earlier in the month. Against the euro the pound made a similarly short-lived move to the highest levels since January but then retreated by 60 pips. In short, a May rate rise remains all but certain, but the market had largely priced it before Thursday. More signs of a fairly robust US economy, with the latest snapshots of the manufacturing and service sectors. The preliminary IHS Markit manufacturing PMI for March has come in at 55.7, up from 55.3 last month and the highest level since March 2015. The manufacturing figure was better than analysts had been expecting, but the services PMI - although strong - came in below forecasts. It fell from 55.9 in February to 54.1, a two month low. Overall the composite PMI dipped from 55.8 to 54.3 in March, but the index has been above the 50 mark (which signals expansion) for two years now. Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit said: The flash PMI surveys indicate that the economy likely continued to expand at a robust pace in March, rounding off a solid opening quarter of the year. The surveys are running at a level consistent with annualised first quarter GDP growth approaching 2.5% (though we note that official GDP estimates may once again understate growth in the opening quarter of the year). The survey’s employment index is meanwhile at its highest for nearly three years and indicative of another strong payroll rise in the order of 240,000 in March. The improved hiring trend reflects buoyant optimism regarding future growth. Companies’ expectations for output in the year ahead remained elevated, dipping slightly in services but surging to a three-year high in manufacturing. Inflationary pressures meanwhile remain a key theme of the surveys, especially in manufacturing, reflecting increased raw material prices, notably for metals. The survey found average prices charged for goods and services are rising at one of the strongest rates seen since 2014. Furthermore, with factory costs showing the largest jump for seven years amid growing shortages of key inputs, inflationary pressures appear to be on the rise. Back with UK interest rates, and there could be four over the next two years, reckons Kallum Pickering, senior UK economist at Berenberg: The Bank of England seems to be re-opening the playbook it used ahead of the November 2017 rate hike. Step one, signal to markets that a hike could come soon. Step two, let a couple of known hawks dissent in a policy vote shortly thereafter. Step three, hike rates. After signalling at the February 2018 Inflation Report that a rate hike could come soon, the minutes of the March Monetary Policy Committee meeting published today showed two members of the nine member Monetary Policy Committee – Saunders and McCafferty, both known hawks – voted in favour of raising the Bank Rate by 25bp to 0.75%. These are the same members that dissented ahead of the November hike. The March minutes strengthen the bank’s February guidance that a hike could come soon. The real question is, when will it happen? ...We expect the BoE to hike its Bank Rate by 25bp four times over the next two years, with two hikes in 2018 and two in 2019. This would take the Bank Rate to 1.5% by the end of 2019. We look for the next 25bp hike in May 2018. Ouch! Britain’s FTSE 100 has fallen to a fresh 15-month low. London’s index of leading shares has lost 101 points, or nearly 1.5%, to 6937. That’s its lowest point since December 2016. And over on Wall Street, shares are sliding too. The Dow Jones industrial average has lost 310 points, or 1.2%, to 24,371 points. Traders are citing fears of trade wars, with Donald Trump expected to announce new tariffs on Chinese imports on Thursday. Those are likely to target China’s high-technology sector and could also include restrictions on Chinese investments in the United States. Peter Dixon, Economist at Commerzbank, thinks there are two good reasons for the Bank of England to raise interest rates away from their near-record lows. nominal GDP growth in excess of 3% is not consistent with Bank Rate of 0.5% and the global monetary cycle, led by the Fed, would suggest that there is scope for a modest tightening in UK rates.” A rate rise would be good news for savers. And Craig Inches, head of rates &amp; cash at Royal London Asset Management, suggests the Bank of England should have taken the plunge today. He argues: “Today’s decision not to raise rates was a missed opportunity in our opinion. With real wage growth moving into positive territory for the first time in over two years, strong retail sales (despite the adverse weather conditions) and some welcome progress on the Brexit negotiations, the uncertainty that has concerned the Bank in recent months is beginning to be demystified. “The markets were warned in February that rates would rise “faster and sooner”, the question we’d ask is why the Bank thought it necessary to wait until May. The probability of a rate rise now stands at over 75% following the vote today, sterling has risen in recent weeks from £1.37 to £1.42 and gilt short gilt yields have risen to the highs of the year. Given these moves and in light of the recent slew of positive data, the economy is clearly ready for a rate hike in May, but it would have been just as ready today! Inches is also concerned that the Bank hasn’t begun unwinding its quantitative easing stimulus programme, which holds £435bn of government bonds. “In the meantime the Bank continues to buy gilts via the APF facility and is massively distorting the shape of the yield curve, which is detrimental for pension funds and an accident waiting to happen further down the line.” Economist James Smith of Dutch bank ING says the Bank of England could potentially raise interest rates twice this year - perhaps once in May, and once in the autumn. But that could be undone if Brexit negotiations hit problems, Smith adds: By alluding to the need for “ongoing tightening”, policymakers have kept the door open to a second rate hike later this year. We certainly wouldn’t rule it out, and markets are increasingly coming around to this view – there’s now not far off two hikes priced in for this year. But if Brexit talks – which are due to be wrapped up in October to allow time for ratification – get particularly noisy, then this could get in the way of a second rate rise in the autumn. The City was surprised that two MPC policymakers wanted to raise interest rates today, says Ben Brettell, senior economist at Hargreaves Lansdown. He suspects that Brexit angst is helping to split the monetary policy committee: Ian McCafferty and Michael Saunders are worried that inaction now will mean rates will need to rise faster and further in future. Sterling jumped on the news, hitting a seven-week high against the dollar. The Bank faces a delicate balancing act. Inflation seems to be falling back towards the target of 2%, as the effect of the weaker pound starts to filter out of the calculation. But a pick-up in wage growth points to an erosion of slack in the labour market. This raises the prospect that a wage-price spiral could push inflation back up in future. Throw in a hefty dose of Brexit-related uncertainty and it’s easy to see why the committee is divided at present. The Institute of Director’s senior economist, Tej Parikh, reckons the Bank made the right decision this month. “Business leaders will welcome the Bank of England’s decision not to spring any surprises this month, but firms and households will be on tenterhooks for what comes in May. “The Bank has been paving the way for a rate rise, but must tread lightly until there is richer evidence of growing inflationary pressures, to avoid unnecessarily placing a speed bump in the way of economic activity. UK savers and borrowers should prepare for interest rates to rise in May, warns Ed Monk, associate director for Personal Investing at Fidelity International: Monk says the recent pick-up in UK wage growth (to 2.8%, if you include bonuses) means the Bank is worried that the economy could overheat. “The message from the Bank of England to borrowers couldn’t really be clearer: get ready for higher rates now. Two members voted for a rate rise this month and the Bank said nothing to dispel expectations that rates will rise in May. “The rate rise made in November felt like a straightforward reversal of the emergency post-Brexit cut, but this now feels more like we’re entering a genuine tightening phase at the Bank. The minutes of this week’s meeting show that the Bank of England expects to raise interest rates over the coming months, having left them at 0.5% today. It says: Given the prospect of excess demand over the forecast period, an ongoing tightening of monetary policy over the forecast period would be appropriate to return inflation sustainably to its target at a more conventional horizon. All members agreed that any future increases in Bank Rate were likely to be at a gradual pace and to a limited extent. However, there was a split among the Monetary Policy Committee over when to take the plunge and hike borrowing costs. Ian McCafferty and Michael Saunders pushed for a rise today, arguing hawkishly that it would be reckless to wait: The minutes say: These members noted the widespread evidence that slack was largely used up and that pay growth was picking up, presenting upside risks to inflation in the medium term. A modest tightening of monetary policy at this meeting could mitigate the risks from a more sustained period of above-target inflation that might ultimately necessitate a more abrupt change in policy and hence a greater adjustment in growth and employment. But governor Mark Carney, deputies Ben Broadbent, Dave Ramsden and Jon Cunliffe, chief economist Andy Haldane, and external members Silvana Tenreyro and Gertjan Vlieghe weren’t convinced. They argued that it would be better to wait until they have new economic forecasts in May. There had been few surprises in recent economic data and the February Inflation Report projections, conditioned on a gently rising path of Bank Rate, had appeared broadly on track. The May forecast round would enable the Committee to undertake a fuller assessment of the underlying momentum in the economy, the degree of slack remaining and the extent of domestic inflationary pressures. The pound has jumped, following the news that two policymakers - Ian McCafferty and Michael Saunders - voted to raise UK interest rates today. Sterling has hit €1.151 against the euro, the highest level since June 2017. It’s also up against the US dollar at $1.420, a new seven-week high. That means traders are anticipating that the next rate hike will come soon - quite possibly at May’s meeting. NEWSFLASH: The Bank of England has left UK interest rates unchanged at 0.5%. Two members of the MPC voted to hike rates, but were outvoted by the other seven policymakers. More to follow.... Five minutes to go, until we learn whether the Bank of England has voted to leave rates on hold.... Britain’s FTSE 100 shares index has fallen below the 7,000 point mark for the first time in 15 months. Worries over trade wars, plus the strength of the pound, have combined to pull the index of blue-chip companies down to 6,983, a drop of 55 points. The team at Deutsche Bank believe the Bank of England will raise rates in two months time... Here’s an explanation of how the Bank of England sets interest rates: The pound is pushing higher as traders get ready for the Bank of England decision, in under 50 minutes. Sterling has risen to €1.1489 against the euro, its highest levels since January 25th. The City may be preparing for a hawkish announcement from the BoE, paving the way for a rate rise in May (a hike today would be a real shock...) Craig Erlam of trading firm OANDA says: While a rate hike is not expected today, it is heavily priced in for May when the central bank will also release its inflation report containing new macro-economic projections. The Monetary Policy Committee has become notably more hawkish recently and the reference to rate hikes needing to come “somewhat earlier and by a somewhat greater extent” than it expected in November, last month was a clear reference to an upcoming meeting. If the MPC is still planning to raise in May, I would expect another clear hint from the central bank today. Over in the City, shares in printing group De La Rue have slumped by 5% after it missed out on the contract for Britain’s new blue-coloured passport. De La Rue is fuming over the snub, especially as the contract has been awarded to Gemalto, a Franco-Dutch security firm. Somewhat ironic, as these new passports have been hailed by Brexiteers as a benefit of leaving the EU. De La Rue’s CEO, Martin Sutherland, has warned that jobs could be lost. He wants Theresa May to: “come to my factory and explain my dedicated workforce why they think this is a sensible decision to offshore the manufacture of a British icon”. Unions are urging the government to reverse the decision. Unite national officer Louisa Bull says: “Theresa May and Amber Rudd need to explain to De La Rue workers why ‘taking back control’ means their jobs could be put at risk while the production of Britain’s new iconic passport is shipped overseas to France. “It wouldn’t happen in France because of national security and it shouldn’t happen in the UK. De La Rue is the UK’s leading security printer making bank notes as well as passports sustaining thousands of decent jobs in the UK. “Ministers need to reverse this decision and start supporting British business and UK workers through public procurement and an industrial strategy which is more than just sound bites.” The contract was awarded under EU procurement rules, though, so a u-turn wouldn’t be easy. One could even argue that this is what free trade is all about..... The BBC’s Rob Watson reckons the government will be worried: Optimism is building that Europe could win an exemption from America’s new US tariffs on steel and aluminium. EU trade commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom has just held high-level talks with US officials, in an effort to prevent European metal-producers from being hit by Donald Trump’s import duties, which kick in tomorrow. There’s nothing official yet, but EU officials are hopeful that Malmstrom’s efforts will pay off - and mean Europe needn’t enforce its threat of retaliatory tariffs on US imports. European Commission vice-president Jyrki Katainen told Bloomberg TV that the visit went well. “Cecilia Malmstrom had a good, very fruitful visit to Washington,. We have good opportunities now to solve the issue and stabilize, or calm down, the problem.” Last night, Malmstrom tweeted that the meetings had been productive: Newsflash: UK retail sales rose last month, but the broader picture is still downbeat. Retail sales volumes (the amount of stuff people bought) rose by 0.8% in February, compared to forecasts of just 0.4%. But after sharp falls earlier this winter, retail sales volumes are down 0.4% over the last quarter. On an annual basis, retail sales were up 1.5% - again, much weaker than last year, as households are stretched by the cost of living squeeze. This might make the Bank of England reluctant to raise borrowing costs.... The report also shows that consumers continued to spend more online. Internet shopping made up 17.2% of all retail spending, up from 15.6% a year ago. That helps explain why various high street chains have been struggling, or gone bust, in recent months. Rhian Murphy, ONS senior statistician, says: “Retail sales did grow in February, with increases seen in food, non-store and fuel, but this followed two months of decline in these sectors. “However, the underlying three-month picture is one of falling sales, mainly due to strong declines across all main sectors in December. “Store prices continue to rise across all store types, but at a lower rate than the previous month due to a slowdown in price growth, though clothing and household goods stores continued to see stronger price rises. Just in: The eurozone’s recent economic surge seems to be levelling off. Data firm Markit has reported that growth across eurozone service sector firms and manufacturers has slowed to its slowest since January 2017. Companies reported that growth had slowed after a very strong performance last year, with new order and exports both rising at a slower rate. Markit’s ‘composite output PMI’, which tracks activity across the eurozone’s private sector, dropped to 55.3 in March from 57.1 last month. At a country level, output growth slowed to a seven-month low in France and an eight-month low in Germany. It’s not a reason to panic -- the PMIs had been remarkably strong last year, so this is a return to more normal growth levels. Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, says recent bad weather is one factor, plus ‘growing pains’ as European supply chains struggle to keep pace with recent growth. But political issues - such as Brexit, and trade tariffs - are another factor. Williamson says: The fact that export order book growth has more than halved since the end of last year suggests the stronger euro is taking an increasing toll on export performance. Survey responses also highlighted how political uncertainty also appears to have intensified, dampening demand. The data therefore suggest that eurozone growth peaked around the turn of the year and the region is settling into a slower, but still robust pace of expansion. European stock markets have dropped this morning, as investors fret about the risks of a trade war. The FTSE 100 is down 13 points, or 0.2%, at 7021 after falling through 7,000 points at the start of trading. Germany’s DAX has lost 0.4%. Exporters are suffering from the strength of the pound and the euro against the US dollar today. The markets are also being pulled down by signs that Wall Street will fall, especially if Donald Trump does to hit China with new sanctions. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx says: The state of the Dow futures, alongside the re-emergence of trade war chatter ahead of Trump’s China tariff announcement later this Thursday, left the European indices in a sorry state after the bell. Alan Clarke of Scotia Bank is confident the Bank of England will leave rates on hold today: We expect policy to be left unchanged at this meeting. The focus of attention will be on whether there are any clues that support the case for a rate hike at the May MPC meeting. Given fairly mixed data since February, we would not be too surprised if the vote was 9-0 for unchanged rates and that should not be seen as an obstruction to a hike in May. But analysts at Mitsubishi UFG warn that a shock hike can’t be ruled out.... The US dollar has fallen against other major currencies overnight, as traders digested Jerome Powell’s debut press conference since becoming Fed chief. I thought Powell handled the occasion pretty well (rattling through the questions within 45 minutes, not the full hour available). He was upbeat about the US economy, avoided any bear traps, and reassured listeners that the Fed would take the ‘middle ground’ as it seeks to normalise monetary policy without slowing growth. So why has the dollar fallen? Firstly, the Fed stuck to its forecast of three rate hikes in 2018, rather than slipping in a fourth. Investors can take that as a dovish signal (although the Fed is now forecasting an extra hike in 2019). Secondly, Powell revealed that business leaders have told Fed officials they’re worried about a trade war breaking out. That’s a timely warning, as president Trump is expected to announce new tariffs and investment restrictions on China later today. That’s enough to drive the pound up to a six-week high against the dollar, at $1.417. China’s central bank has responded to last night’s move in US interest rates, by hiking its own borrowing costs. The People’s Bank of China increased the cost of short-term loans to commercial lenders, hours after the Fed announced it was tightening policy in America. Bloomberg has the details: The People’s Bank of China raised the interest rates it charges on 7-day reverse-repurchase agreements by five basis points, the central bank said in a statement. The move is “in line with market expectations and a normal reaction to the Fed’s rate hike”, the PBOC said in a statement on the website. The Bank of England could send the pound shooting higher at lunchtime, if it hints at a rate hike in the next few months (or even raises rates today, of course). Konstantinos Anthis, head of research at ADS Securities, explains: The focus today will be on the Bank of England rate decision which will have a significant effect on the medium-term outlook of the British pound. The UK currency has seen good demand over the past few days being supported by expectations for a positive labour market report - which indeed printed in a bullish fashion yesterday - but also hopes for a hawkish tone from the BoE today. The key drivers for this upbeat bias? Inflation rebounded higher last month, we noted good wage growth in yesterday’s employment report and there has even been progress in the Brexit negotiations. All these factors paint a positive outlook for the pound and shape expectations for a bullish BoE message which will underpin investors’ hopes for a rate hike soon. There’s some speculation that the BoE might even go ahead and raise rates today but we believe that this is too optimistic - our base scenario suggests an interest rate increase in the summer, either in May or June. Today though a positive message and a consistent bullish bias from the British central bank will keep the pound in demand: we’re looking to the pound/ dollar to extend gains towards 1.42 and euro/ pound to break below the 0.87 mark. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It’s the Bank of England’s turn under the spotlight today, as policymakers on the Monetary Policy Committee will set UK interest rates at noon today , We’re not expecting a rate hike today, just four months after the first one in a decade. But the MPC could decide to steer the markets towards a move in May, as it tries to balance inflation pressures against Brexit uncertainty. The MPC have some interesting economic data to digest, which may encourage policymakers to reach for the ‘rate hike’ button soon. Tuesday’s drop in inflation to 2.7% took some pressure off the Bank, although prices are still rising faster than its 2% target. That was followed by yesterday’s strong labour market report, showing that wages are rising at their fastest pace since 2015, and catching up with inflation. Policymakers may conclude that this strengthens the case for a rate hike soon, rather than risk waiting too long. This chart, from Berenberg bank, suggests the labour market is recovering from the Brexit shock of 2016, which drove real wages down. Kallum Pickering of Berenberg explains: Thanks to the drop in headline inflation to 2.7% in February (3.0% in January), and the uptick in nominal weekly earnings to 2.8% in January (up from 1.9% in May 2017), the real wage squeeze is probably over. Tight labour markets should push nominal wage growth higher over the medium term as inflation gradually trends towards a rate of about 2-2.5%. Real weekly earnings growth can rise towards 1.0% by the end of the 2018. Helped by continued jobs growth, this should allow real consumption to grow at close to 1.5% over the medium term. The minutes of the meeting, released at noon, will give an insight into the MPC’s thinking. Last night, the US Federal Reserve raised its benchmark rate to 1.75%, and lifted its growth forecast. It also predicted two more rate hikes this year, and three in 2019, as the process of normalising monetary policy continues under new Fed chair Jerome Powell. Powell sounded upbeat about the US economy, but also warned that fears of a trade war are building. We also get a new healthcheck on eurozone service sector firms and factories, fresh UK retail sales figures, and the weekly US jobless claims numbers. Here’s the agenda 9am GMT: Eurozone ‘flash’ PMI surveys showing how companies are faring this month 9.30am GMT: UK retail sales figures for February Noon GMT: Bank of England decision on interest rates 12.30pm GMT: US initial jobless claims for last week"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"media/2018/mar/23/a-splash-an-op-ed-and-a-full-page-ad-news-corp-tabloid-gives-property-lobby-a-megaphone","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-22T22:00:18Z","webTitle":"A splash, an op-ed and a full-page ad: News Corp tabloid gives property lobby a megaphone | Weekly Beast","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/mar/23/a-splash-an-op-ed-and-a-full-page-ad-news-corp-tabloid-gives-property-lobby-a-megaphone","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2018/mar/23/a-splash-an-op-ed-and-a-full-page-ad-news-corp-tabloid-gives-property-lobby-a-megaphone","fields":{"headline":"A splash, an op-ed and a full-page ad: News Corp tabloid gives property lobby a megaphone","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"On Wednesday the Courier-Mail’s front-page story, “A tax on all your houses”, trumpeted the Property Council’s campaign to reverse the Queensland Labor government’s imposition of a waste levy on properties worth more than $10m from 1 July. Annastacia Palaszczuk says the levy – which has been described as a Robin Hood tax – will affect only “around 850 people who own property worth more than $10m”. But the Property Council doesn’t agree. Its Queensland executive director, Chris Mountford, had more than the just front page with which to gain readers’ attention. Inside the paper, the editor, Sam Weir, gave him space for an opinion piece in which he was able to further argue the case for his members. “While the government has pitched the increases as a ‘Robin Hood tax’ on the big-end-of-town, the true cost of these increases will be paid by all of us,” Mountford wrote. “Increases to land tax will see higher rents and occupancy costs passed through to Queensland businesses who lease space in affected buildings. This increased cost of doing business comes at a time when many are already struggling with the rising costs for utilities and other businesses inputs, such as local government rates.” But the Property Council domination of the paper doesn’t end there. On page four the council took out a full-page colour ad, worth upwards of $20,000, which claimed the tax would wipe Queensland off the investment map. We asked Weir if the placement of the full-page ad played any role in the decision to splash with the council campaign and to run the matching opinion piece on the same day. We wanted to know if News Corp readers might be concerned by a perception that advertising and editorial mmight be working together. Weir said the story had news value and would have run on page one whether the Property Council had placed an ad with the Courier Mail or not. “But clearly if you are launching a major public awareness campaign you would book an ad in the Courier Mail, given it’s the biggest media brand in Queensland,” Weir said. Uhlmann sentence Channel Nine’s political editor, Chris Uhlmann, will be suspended from parliament from Sunday 25 March until midnight Thursday 29 March as punishment for an “egregious breach” of press gallery rules. Uhlmann’s sin was to reveal on television and on Twitter the contents of a text conversation on Michaelia Cash’s mobile phone. Filmed by a Nine camera operator, the screen showed the minister texting staffers about how to avoid media scrutiny as she entered an estimates committee. Uhlmann told Weekly Beast he would be unable to enter the building for the final sitting of both houses before Easter as his pass had been suspended. “I accept that I broke the rules and accept the umpire’s decision,” the former ABC journalist said. A Donald of our own Fresh from the triumph of a rightwing panel discussion on how to win Twitter, the Menzies Research Centre is promoting another fun event for conservatives, this one to ask whether Australia needs a Donald Trump-style politician. Considering “the pros and cons of an Aussie Donald” will be the Daily Telegraph columnist Miranda Devine and her paper’s opinion editor, James Morrow, the consultant Parnell McGuinness and the Centre for Independent Studies executive director and ABC broadcaster Tom Switzer. Can’t wait to hear the panel coming up with the positives of a Donald Trump clone down under. Syrian odyssey From Heba Kassoua, a presenter on SBS radio Arabic24, comes a personal journey back to Syria which gives a very different view from the one we’re used to seeing on SBS World News at night. Kassoua left her homeland in 2005 to settle in Australia with her family. Last year she returned to the city of Sweida for her sister’s wedding. “The city was alive 24/7 and the nightlife has boomed,” Kassoua says. “Hundreds of new cafes and restaurants, as well as plenty of nightclubs have been opened in the last seven years. “People were out drinking and smoking late at night and the kids – who one worries about the most during war times – were out at the theme parks enjoying the school break as if they lived in a country different to the one we see and report on in the news.” The broadcaster’s personal travel diary, “My sister’s wedding in war-torn Syria”, is being aired on SBS on Saturday 24 March at 4.05pm. Drivel time With the departures of moderate voices Kristina Keneally, Patricia Karvelas and Peter van Onselen from Sky News Australia in recent months we despaired that the pay TV channel would become a mere echo chamber of rightwing voices. The RN Drive host Karvelas has a new Sunday-night ABC TV show called the National Wrap and Van Onselen, an academic and columnist, has popped up as a guest on Insiders and on Radio National Breakfast. Since departing Sky Van Onselen has been a little cheeky when discussing his old employer, mocking the lack of a budget and the excessive airtime given to Coalition announcements. On Insiders he said: “Spare a thought for me – I used to have to sit and take that drivel and then try to take it at least moderately seriously.” But there is still someone at Sky News, apart from the excellent David Speers of course, who is practising journalism rather than spouting partisan views. The former News Corp political reporter Samantha Maiden was ruthless in her smackdown of the Australian’s associate editor Chris Kenny on Twitter on Thursday. Kenny’s regular TV gig came to an end when he was dumped by Sky News at the end of last year. When Kenny slammed Sky – for daring to interview the “hateful, divisive, idioitic” Greens senator for Tasmania Nick McKim – Maiden let fly. Plastic? Oh no Rising up the ladder at Sky is Rita Panahi, another recruit from Rupert Murdoch’s Australian newsroom. Panahi has graduated from guest on Paul Murray Live, The Bolt Report and Credlin to front her own weekly gig, imaginatively called The Friday Show. In a fascinating profile by Margaret Simons Panahi revealed she is no cookie cutter News columnist. “I’m not your plastic conservative,” Panahi says. “I’m someone who’s ethnic, a migrant to this country, an atheist. I’m a single mum, I’m not some privileged, middle-aged white man who would normally have character traits ascribed to conservatives. “But I do have an issue with people who haven’t got my life experience patronising me with their opinions. You know, privileged, middle-aged, middle-income white people, who were born and bred here, telling me my views on racism and a cohesive Australian society are wrong.” Full stop ABC management was pretty unhappy when the results from the employee engagement survey came and staff satisfaction had gone down. “ABC wide, our engagement has fallen from 52% in 2015 to 46%,” said the managing director, Michelle Guthrie. So followed more meetings and chats with “teams”, as they call them at Aunty, to work out how to improve morale. Now the chief technology officer, Helen Clifton, has come up with a way of tackling one of the employees’ biggest beefs: red tape. “Bureaucracy Stop” was born: Hi Team Bureaucracy Stop is an initiative kicking off today. You told us in the Employee Engagement Survey that bureaucratic systems and processes are frustrating. While some improvements have already been made to reduce red tape, we acknowledge there’s still more work to be done. That’s where Bureaucracy Stop can help. It’s your opportunity to tell us what processes make it hard for you to do your job, so that something can be done to improve it. Of course, being the ABC, there is a process to follow to stop the bureaucracy and it involves visiting a special website and filling out a form. All comments will be investigated by a “champion”, the email says, who will then report back on progress. We can hardly wait."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2018/mar/24/going-plastics-free-is-as-easy-as-calico-bags-and-reusable-coffee-cups","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-23T21:51:03Z","webTitle":"Going plastics-free is as easy as calico bags and reusable coffee cups","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/mar/24/going-plastics-free-is-as-easy-as-calico-bags-and-reusable-coffee-cups","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/mar/24/going-plastics-free-is-as-easy-as-calico-bags-and-reusable-coffee-cups","fields":{"headline":"Going plastics-free is as easy as calico bags and reusable coffee cups","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"It’s almost everywhere you look – and it’s undeniably destroying our planet. Over the past half a century, plastic has infiltrated modern life to such an extent that our oceans may have more of the stuff than fish by 2050. Once hailed as an innovation, it’s now clear that plastic is very bad news. Non-renewable fossil fuels are needed for production, belching out greenhouse gases in the process. Once tossed – often after mere minutes of use – plastic then takes hundreds of years to break down, emitting toxic methane gas as it gradually breaks into smaller and smaller pieces. The end point is too often our waterways and an estimated one million seabirds and 100,000 mammals are killed every year by marine rubbish, much of it plastics. Recycling helps, but a far more powerful solution is reducing and even eliminating single-use plastics altogether. That’s actually easier than one might think – read on for a life with less plastic. Say no to single-use plastics Refuse to use plastic bags, for a start. Australians go through 13 million new bags each day and around 50m of them end up in landfill each year – enough to cover Melbourne’s CBD, according to Clean Up Australia. Be cautious with so-called “green bags” though; those commonly sold at Coles and Woolworths are made of polypropylene, a type of plastic. Instead, opt for calico, canvas, jute or hessian. Or join the Boomerang Bags movement, from Queensland’s Burleigh Heads, which encourages volunteers to make fabric bags from recycled materials. Skip other single-use plastics too, such as coffee cups, takeaway containers, water bottles and straws – even the Queen last month banned the latter two across her royal estates. A little pre-purchase prep makes saying no easier. Online stores including Brisbane’s Biome and Sydney’s Onya stock reusable alternatives, such as stainless steel water bottles, reusable coffee cups, bamboo toothbrushes, mesh produce bags and material food covers. Consider buying in bulk – The Source Bulk Foods has stores around the country and is Australia’s biggest bulk food retailer. “A reusable coffee cup only needs to be used 15 times to break even on its life cycle, including cleaning. Every use after that is a bonus for the planet,” says Biome founder Tracey Bailey. “The cumulative use of reusable products makes it easy for individuals to have a long-term environmental impact. Within 12 months, the Biome community saved the waste of over 6m single-use plastic items.” If plastics can’t be avoided, look to recycle as much as possible. Soft, scrunchable plastics, for example, are too often turfed, but can actually be collected at home then dropped at REDcycle bins in major supermarkets. Avoid microplastics and reduce microfibre shedding Some of the most environmentally damaging plastics can barely be seen by the human eye, yet are used daily. Microbeads are tiny plastic pellets used in cosmetics and household products, such as exfoliating face scrubs, whitening toothpastes and deep-cleaning washing powders. Flushed down the drain, microbeads are too small to be captured by wastewater treatment plant filters and end up in our waterways. According to the Australian Marine Conservation Society, marine wildlife that mistake microbeads for fish eggs often end up starving to death. The Australian government has ordered a voluntary phase-out of microbeads by mid-2018, but many believe an outright ban is needed. Consumers can sign a Surfrider Foundation petition calling for a ban, and consult the Australian Good Scrub Guide or Beat the Microbead app for help to choose microbead-free products. Microfibres shed by synthetic clothing during washing is a growing concern. Synthetic fabrics such as polyester and nylon shed thousands of these tiny plastic particles with each wash, which end up polluting our rivers and oceans. Guppy Friend filter bags, developed in Berlin, are an emerging solution. Washing less, using front-loading machines and opting for natural fabrics and fibres wherever possible also helps. Help reduce the impact of plastics already littering our environment A whopping 269,000 tonnes of rubbish is now estimated to be floating in our oceans – weighing more than 1,300 blue whales combined – and about 80% of it comes from land, according to the Australian Marine Conservation Society. The Pacific ocean is already besieged by more plastic than plankton. To turn that around, humans can’t just reduce our current consumption; we must also clean up the mess already created. Sydney-based non-profit Take 3 has inspired thousands to pick up three pieces of rubbish each when leaving the beach or waterways. Clean Up Australia Day, held annually each March, last year attracted 590,350 volunteers, who collected an estimated 15,500 ute loads of rubbish. Perth surfers Andrew Turton and Pete Ceglinski have created the floating Seabin rubbish bin for marinas and ports, which moves with the tide, collecting about 1.5kg of floating rubbish each day. Dutch inventor Boyan Slat went further, inventing The Ocean Cleanup passive drifting systems – due to launch this year – which he believes will clean up half the Great Pacific Garbage Patch within just five years. Consider a world free of plastic altogether Despite how thoroughly plastic permeates modern life, it is possible to largely avoid it – with some effort. In Melbourne, Erin Rhoads has lived a “zero waste” existence since June 2014; her entire trash output since fits inside one old coffee jar. (Other notables on similar paths include Gippsland’s Tammy Logan, Adelaide’s Niki Wallace and Perth-based Lindsay Miles.) “We have the power to dictate how things are packaged and presented to us by participating in everyday activism through our purchases,” Rhoads says. “The more businesses see and hear us saying no to plastics, the more likely we will see changes that will lay the foundation to a cleaner, safer and healthier planet.” While going fully plastic-free remains a pipe dream for most, Rhoads advocates small shifts that build into big lifestyle changes. On her blog, The Rogue Ginger, Rhoads outlines five easy first steps, and encourages consumers to embrace Plastic-Free Tuesday or Plastic-Free July (which began in Perth). “Going plastic-free helps us take responsibility for our actions, while reminding us that most of the plastic we use today is not necessary at all,” Rhoads says. “We should focus on preserving our earth’s resources for something other than a single-use plastic fork.” Additional research and reporting by Nicole Lutze"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/mar/21/rory-mcilroy-dustin-johnson-shock-defeats-wgc-match-play","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-21T23:29:16Z","webTitle":"Rory McIlroy and Dustin Johnson suffer shock defeats at WGC Match Play","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/mar/21/rory-mcilroy-dustin-johnson-shock-defeats-wgc-match-play","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/mar/21/rory-mcilroy-dustin-johnson-shock-defeats-wgc-match-play","fields":{"headline":"Rory McIlroy and Dustin Johnson suffer shock defeats at WGC Match Play","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"This was a day to prove why sponsors and broadcasters prefer the WGC Match Play in group rather than straight knockout format. Had the latter rules applied, Dustin Johnson and Rory McIlroy would have exited Austin Country Club after 18 holes. Johnson, the defending champion and world No 1, was the biggest casualty of day one as he slipped to a 3&amp;1 defeat by Bernd Wiesberger. McIlroy’s defeat by Peter Uihlein, 2&amp;1, also raised eyebrows given the Northern Irishman’s heroics when winning the Arnold Palmer Invitational on Sunday. In both cases it would be remiss not to recognise the performances of the winners. Wiesberger, a European Ryder Cup hopeful, and Uihlein both displayed nerveless touch in illustrious company. “I still didn’t play great but somehow managed to get it done and I’m just happy with that,” said Wiesberger. “I thought it was the easiest game I could have; I’m the underdog playing with the defending champion.” McIlroy admitted to being “a little flat”. While he remains part of the tournament equation, he must beat Brian Harman and Jhonattan Vegas if his Masters build-up is to be extended beyond three rounds. McIlroy also needs Uihlein to be halted elsewhere. Perhaps, quietly, he would not mind a less arduous scenario with Augusta looming. “I didn’t really necessarily play badly,” McIlroy said. “He played pretty well. He was a few under through nine and he didn’t make a bogey all day. So it was hard to claw my way back. “It was gusty out there; the conditions were a little tricky. I made a run at him at the end but it was a little too late.” It was, therefore, a case of the highs of Bay Hill to the lows of Austin for McIlroy. Perhaps the exertions associated with Sunday’s stunning success had a strong impact. Uihlein, the world No 63, delivered three birdies when reaching the turn 4 up, an advantage that proved insurmountable to McIlroy. The four-times major champion, however, battled back admirably. Having been five down after 13 holes, McIlroy won three in succession. A half in par at the penultimate hole proved sufficient for Uihlein to claim the point. Ian Poulter emerged victorious by 3&amp;2 from the all-English battle against Tommy Fleetwood. Poulter insisted he has “never been more motivated” as he seeks to earn a Masters berth. “Winning match play is always really pleasing,” said Poulter, who excels in this format. “Tommy is a great player. I don’t think either of us really holed any putts. I probably played just a little better than he did and obviously got it done. “The simplicity of match play is win your match. It sounds really easy and it’s not. So it’s about a level of focus and level of concentration this week. Be super aggressive, try not to hand too many holes away. “It’s a tricky golf course. It’s easy to get out of position and it’s easy to hand holes to your guy with not really doing too much wrong. I’m happy with the win.” Jason Day, a former winner in Austin, enjoyed a 4&amp;2 triumph over James Hahn but Jordan Spieth was only partly content with a scrappy 2&amp;1 victory over Charl Schwartzel. “I think I shot 12 under when this tournament was at Harding Park and didn’t make it out of the group stage,” Spieth recalled. “I probably shot five under against Lee Westwood and lost. There’s probably numerous times that has happened. “Today I was leading and over par for the day at one point. Sometimes that happens too. That’s why this tournament, to an extent you can say it has a bit of luck to it. “But, at the same time, look at the recent winners. They are the guys playing the best going in and they were the best in the world at the time and they won. So you can look at it both ways.” Alex Norén’s star continues to rise on this side of the Atlantic, the Swede securing a 4&amp;2 success over Kevin Na. The Englishman Tyrrell Hatton saw off Alex Levy 3&amp;2 while Justin Thomas defeated Luke List 2 up."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/mar/22/cardinal-george-pell-court-told-archbishop-robes-could-not-be-easily-removed","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-22T05:15:17Z","webTitle":"Cardinal George Pell: court told archbishop robes could not be easily removed","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/mar/22/cardinal-george-pell-court-told-archbishop-robes-could-not-be-easily-removed","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/mar/22/cardinal-george-pell-court-told-archbishop-robes-could-not-be-easily-removed","fields":{"headline":"Cardinal George Pell: court told archbishop robes could not be easily removed","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"A pastoral associate who worked at St Patrick’s Cathedral in Melbourne when Cardinal George Pell was archbishop has told a court that the archbishop’s robes were heavy and could not be easily lifted or moved while being worn to expose oneself. Rodney Dearing was cross-examined by Pell’s defence team on Thursday as part of the committal hearing into historical sexual offence charges against Pell. Dearing told the court that he was responsible for hanging up Pell’s robes and he was therefore familiar with the weight and manoeuvrability of them. Pell’s barrister Ruth Shann put it to Dearing that the robes were “not able to be parted in the middle to reveal ones genitals or indeed parted to the side to reveal ones genitals”. “No,” Dearing responded. The court heard that two of the choir boys had said they had “snuck back inside” the cathedral building as the procession exited the building. But Shann told Dearing that there was a general awareness at the time Pell was archbishop of Melbourne, from 1996, “of allegations coming out generally about clergy and kids”, which would have “motivated you personally and fellow adult chorists to keep a particularly close eye on the kids”. Dearing agreed. The defence has been cross-examining former choir boys and staff at the cathedral at the time Pell was archbishop, and suggesting to them that two missing boys would have been noticed due to the strict expectation that choirboys were to follow the rules, the close eye staff kept on the choir and the layout of the building and grounds. On Thursday morning Peter Finnigan, who used to manage the choir, told the defence team that while he did not recall two boys going missing at any stage, “it would certainly be possible”. “But they would certainly be very naughty boys if they did,” he said. Pell is the highest-ranking Vatican official to be charged in the Catholic church’s long-running sexual abuse scandal. He has taken leave from the Vatican in Rome to attend court. He has strenuously denied all allegations. When the hearing adjourns magistrate Belinda Wallington will need to decide if there is enough evidence to order Pell to stand trial accused of historical sexual offences. Further description of the charges cannot be given for legal reasons. The committal hearing continues."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2018/mar/22/post-brexit-passports-set-to-be-made-by-franco-dutch-firm","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-22T00:01:20Z","webTitle":"Post-Brexit passports set to be made by Franco-Dutch firm","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/mar/22/post-brexit-passports-set-to-be-made-by-franco-dutch-firm","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/mar/22/post-brexit-passports-set-to-be-made-by-franco-dutch-firm","fields":{"headline":"Post-Brexit passports set to be made by Franco-Dutch firm","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The post-Brexit blue passport will not be produced by the British firm that makes the current burgundy version, with sources suggesting the contract will be awarded to a Franco-Dutch firm instead. Changing the colour is regarded by some Brexiters as a powerful symbol of Britain’s restored sovereignty. But the British firm De La Rue has lost out on the contract to make them, its chief executive confirmed on Thursday morning. It is understood that Gemalto, which is listed on the French and Dutch stock exchanges, won the race for the £490m printing job. Speaking to BBC Radio 4’s Today programme on Thursday morning, the chief executive of De La Rue, Martin Sutherland, challenged the prime minister or the home secretary to “come to my factory and explain my dedicated workforce why they think this is a sensible decision to offshore the manufacture of a British icon”. He said he would appeal against the decision, and he refused to guarantee that no jobs would be lost at the Gateshead plant the firm uses to produce the burgundy version. Sutherland acknowledged that his firm had been beaten on price in an open competition, but he said that was unfair. He said that in France, as a foreign-based firm, De La Rue would be barred from bidding to produce the French passport. The Labour MP John Spellar said “no other EU country behaves like this”, claiming others “support their industry”. Such decisions had driven the Brexit vote, he said. The Home Office said on Wednesday night that no final decision had been made on where the new passports would be printed. A spokeswoman said: “We are running a fair and open competition to ensure that the new contract delivers a high quality and secure product and offers the best value for money for customers. “We do not require passports to be manufactured in the UK. A proportion of blank passport books are currently manufactured overseas, and there are no security or operational reasons why this would not continue.” Theresa May told the House of Commons in February: “It is right that from autumn 2019 we will issue new blue and gold passports, which have always been the UK’s colours of choice for our passports. It is absolutely right that after we leave the European Union we return to deciding the colour of passports that we want, not that the EU wants.” De La Rue issued a profit warning on Tuesday, telling investors its profits for the coming year are likely to be “at the lower end of the current consensus range”, without giving further details. The pro-Brexit former cabinet minister Priti Patel described the decision on the contract as perverse. The Liberal Democrats’ Brexit spokesman, Tom Brake, said: “The blue passport saga is turning into a farce. First it was established that we did not have to leave the EU to have blue passports. Now we learn that the passports will be printed by a foreign company. And to add insult to injury, we will pay over the odds for them because the value of the pound has fallen since Brexit and they will have to be imported.” Eloise Todd, of the pro-remain pressure group Best for Britain, said: “The new pro-Brexit blue passports were supposed to be a statement of intent and now we find out they are to be made by the French or the Dutch. The irony is unreal.” Gemalto offers what its website calls an “end to end ePassport solution”, and is involved in the production of 30 countries’ passports. Under EU competition rules, large public procurement contracts must be offered to companies across the the bloc. It is unclear how the government’s approach may change after Brexit, but countries seeking to strike new trade deals with the UK are likely to seek enhanced access to public contracts."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/mar/25/tracey-spicer-launches-now-australia-campaign-as-tina-arena-joins-accusers","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-25T01:01:38Z","webTitle":"Tracey Spicer launches Now Australia campaign as Tina Arena joins accusers","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/25/tracey-spicer-launches-now-australia-campaign-as-tina-arena-joins-accusers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/mar/25/tracey-spicer-launches-now-australia-campaign-as-tina-arena-joins-accusers","fields":{"headline":"Tracey Spicer launches Now Australia campaign as Tina Arena joins accusers","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"More than 30 high-profile women from the Australian media and entertainment industries – including Tina Arena, Deborah Mailman, Sarah Blasko and Danielle Cormack – are spearheading a new national organisation, led by Tracey Spicer, to tackle sexual harassment, abuse and assault in workplaces across Australia. Inspired by the Time’s Up initiative in the US, Now Australia launched a crowdfunding campaign on Sunday, aiming to raise $250,000 to fund a staffed centre that will connect people from every industry with counselling and legal support. The organisation also hopes to conduct research, education and lobbying to effect real change in Australian workplace practices and regulations. Spicer says more than 1,500 people shared their #MeToo stories of workplace harassment and assault following her public call-out on Twitter in October 2017. These stories identified more than 100 men who had not been held accountable for sexual harassment, bullying, and physical assault and rape in Australian workplaces. Spicer has spent the interim period connecting media organisations with some of the victims, to investigate some of the stories – a process that has been slowed down by understaffed newsrooms and Australia’s tough defamation laws. But publicising the issue and naming the names, she said, is only half the battle. “Storytelling is incredibly important – probably the most important [part of the #MeToo movement] – but it’s got to the stage in this movement where we need more than the hashtag,” Spicer told Guardian Australia. “We need practical solutions for an endemic problem.” In News Corp publications on Sunday morning, Tina Arena wrote that she had been subject to inappropriate behaviour through her career. “Of course I have been compromised, of course there have been games, of course there has been inappropriate behaviour, and of course there have been times when I had no idea what it actually was,” she wrote. “I am very grateful to never have been in a dangerous position.” The screen actor Abby Earl has spoken of one incident on set when a director “turned me around, bent me over and pretended to have sex with me” in front of the cast and crew. The country music singer Melinda Schneider also revealed an incident involving a successful songwriter in Nashville, who she says pinned her against a wall in the middle of a songwriting session and told her explicitly what he planned to do to her. She was able to get away but has released a song tied to the campaign titled My Voice. The ambassadors, which also include Missy Higgins, Mahalia Barnes, Kate Miller-Heidke and Isabella Manfredi, are aiming to use their profiles to raise awareness and funds, with Ann Sherry announced as the inaugural patron. “We’re using the power and profile of women in our sector to help women and men who are victims of sexual harassment in some of the lowest-paying industries in the country,” Spicer said. Led by a steering committee of women from diverse backgrounds and professions, Now hopes to fund a two-tiered approach, comprising support and solutions for victims of workplace harassment and assault. The organisation’s first aim is to launch a frontline support service that will connect people who contact them with the help they need: public or private counsellors who work with sexual harassment victims; public or private lawyers, some of which are offering their service pro-bono or low-bono; and media support – not necessarily to investigate each story, but to offer victims advice. “A lot of women who come forward of their own volition are trolled really badly,” Spicer said. Spicer herself received death threats after instigating investigations of harassment and assault by the ABC and Fairfax, which have so far revealed accusations against Don Burke and Craig McLachlan, who have denied the allegations. “We want a service where we can give strategic advice and support, and just offer an ear if they’re going through that.” The second tier of the organisation is focused on long-term solutions, comprising research into workplace harassment, education resources for schools and workplaces, and lobbying of government and statutory authorities. Spicer sees it as a “one-stop-shop” or triage service, which will work with existing services in the community and legal sectors. “We’re not duplicating anything – we are aiming to identify the gaps in the system and fill them. We don’t want to take funding from other organisations.” One in two women experience sexual harassment in their life, with young women, disabled women and women of culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds particularly at risk. “We need this to be inclusive, and men are victims too,” Spicer said. “We know we’ve got to bring men into this conversation. This is not just a woman’s issue.” The investigations Spicer has spearheaded are ongoing but it is taking time for many of the stories to come to light. “We have a very cash-strapped media sector in Australia at the moment, and investigative reporting is expensive. We also have the toughest defamation laws here than almost anywhere in the world and we don’t have first amendment protection like in America. This is why the stories are rolling out so slowly but it does mean that when they come out they are robust and solid.” She said those who were initially emboldened by the #metoo movement to come forward have been scared off after watching how stories like theirs have played out in the press. Craig McLachlan is suing ABC, Fairfax Media and accuser Christie Whelan Browne after allegations made against him in January, and News Corp’s truth defence was thrown out this week in Geoffrey Rush’s defamation case. “The defamation action that’s happening at the moment has frightened a lot of women from coming forward – and has made some media organisations more reticent about reporting it,” Spicer said.

United are rare among the established forces of the domestic men’s game in not having a women’s side. Chelsea, Arsenal, Manchester City and Liverpool all have teams with United until now resisting calls for it to join them. In January Phil Neville, the England women national team coach and former United defender, stated he would be “urging them” to do so. Ed Woodward, United’s executive vice-chairman, said: “We are pleased to announce that the club intends to establish its first ever professional women’s team and has submitted an application to enter WSL2. The FA has provided excellent support through the process and we believe that launching a team in WSL2 would give many more of our graduates from the regional talent club the chance to establish themselves as first team players. “The Manchester United women’s team must be built in the same image and with the same principles as the men’s first team and offer academy players a clear route to top-level football within the club.” A statement from United added: “If successful, the move would provide a career pathway for players who graduate from the long-established and highly successful girls’ regional talent club which has seen some 15 of its graduates playing international football this season alone. The squad would be based at the club’s historic training centre at The Cliff [formerly the senior mens’ venue].” The girls’ regional talent club is run via the United foundation. In January Neville said: “They [United] have a fantastic community programme for female players and coaches. When they do set out their women’s team it will be one to challenge City, Chelsea, Arsenal, Liverpool. A club of the size of United should be the leaders, the pioneers. I am sure they are working to do that.” United’s decision to form a professional team should provide a sizeable boost for the domestic women’s game. With the application expected to be a formality, United’s presence will make the second tier of particular interest when they start competing."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/mar/22/listening-and-empathy-are-the-two-oldest-and-most-powerful-tools-of-medicine","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-22T03:46:12Z","webTitle":"Patients in pain: it's a big problem | Ranjana Srivasta","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/22/listening-and-empathy-are-the-two-oldest-and-most-powerful-tools-of-medicine","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/22/listening-and-empathy-are-the-two-oldest-and-most-powerful-tools-of-medicine","fields":{"headline":"Patients in pain: it's a big problem","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"A door opens behind me, causing my shifting heel to land on a socked foot just as the resident warns me to watch out. “Hey!” an irate voice protests. “First you keep me in pain and now you are trying to kill me.” I whip around with a sincere apology, but a veteran nurse grabs me by the arm and drags me away. “Listen, he is really unhappy with you.” My heart skips a beat. “Why?” “All I know is he’s been in pain all night.” He was admitted to hospital recently with advanced cancer and frailty. One of the idiosyncrasies of working as a doctor in the public health system is finding yourself having some of life’s most difficult conversations with complete strangers. You didn’t see them at diagnosis, or at any of the points where one treatment failed and another commenced. You haven’t a clue about their journey, their hopes or desires. But now, they are too sick to go to their oncologist; their oncologist can’t come to see them; and your job is to pull up a chair, introduce yourself and build enough rapport fast enough to learn the answers to some pressing questions that will determine the direction of care at the end of life. Before doing this, you piece together correspondence to decipher who said what. You study serial scans to understand what was happening inside the body when those conversations were had. Then, with this piecemeal knowledge about the disease and no knowledge about the person, you approach your task, praying it will go well. It can be a recipe for disaster but this time, it isn’t. The patient is accepting of his impending death – he just wants a quiet place to contemplate his final days and to be kept out of pain. The simplicity of his request moves me. I reassure him that a first-world hospital has many options for pain relief. “Why did you lie to me?” he now demands, fighting back tears. “I was in pain all night and they wouldn’t give me an injection.” “Can I get you something before we talk?” “The nurse just did.” “But that’s the morphine that has been on your chart all along”, I exclaim, showing him the order I wrote. Just then his nurse walks in. Sympathetically, she says, “You wrote two sorts but he only got oral morphine overnight.” “It didn’t work, and I kept asking for an injection but they said I had to wait for you to come.” I feel sick thinking of the 24-hour interval between my rounds. How much pain had he endured in that time? What had he made of my promise? How much trust had been eroded? My remorse is too little and too late for him. As he finally drifts into a tired sleep, I realise how little I can do to erase his memory of a night of pain and terror in a place he put his faith in. Later, I talk to his nurse. “His night nurse wasn’t sure about an injection, so she asked the resident who said no.” Next, I track down the junior doctor, who says she was worried about causing respiratory depression. A dying man needed relief from pain. Surely, that’s what injectable morphine was for, I gently observe. “I didn’t get the full story on the phone”, she says contritely, before adding, “I guess I could have seen him.” I withhold these bleak explanations from my patient, but they play on my mind. Unfortunately, my patient’s story is hardly unique. Every day in every hospital, there is a patient with uncontrolled and poorly managed pain, not necessarily associated with the end of life. As the recent harrowing account of a patient (who happens to be a professional medical advocate with an anaesthetist for a husband) shows, delayed, inadequate or inappropriate relief of pain transcends boundaries of disease, socioeconomic status, language, level of education and insurance status. Recalling her experience, the patient advocate says, “It is a terrifying thing to be in extreme pain, know your condition is deteriorating, be confined to bed, diminished by narcotics and then be mismanaged by the people who have a duty of care to you.” Her words singe me. My patient would agree that the final step to disempowering already vulnerable patients is to neglect their pain. Why does this happen? After all, every medical student rote learns the “pain questions”: Where is the pain? Does it go anywhere? What does it feel like? What makes it better? What makes it worse? Neither these important questions nor the answers have shed their clinical utility. While pain specialists would contend that the subject isn’t taught well enough, medical education and training covers pain management as much (or as little) as it covers many other important areas of patient care including communication, confidentiality and consent. These days, there is no excuse for inadequate pain management. It seems ridiculous but conceivable that good pain management is somehow perceived as a “soft skill” when it ought to be a tenet of good medicine. But here is something else we might wish to dwell on. When faced with shortcomings in healthcare delivery, it is common for healthcare professionals to lament “the system”. True enough, the system is burdened. Doctors face a continuous onslaught of complex and sick patients, and there is a growing tendency to own responsibility for an organ rather than a person. Nurses can find themselves justly overwhelmed by the needs of just one or two such patients, and the demands of bureaucracy and meaningless checklists hijack everyone’s time. For each omission in patient care, it’s tempting to summon some such aspect of our working environment as an explanation. But much as I hate to admit it, I think that the failure to manage the pain of our patients speaks to something more elemental: our failure to listen. When a patient is in pain, nothing beats taking a history and conducting a thorough examination. Merely skimming the notes or getting second-hand information is no substitute for the laying of hands and should not buy reassurance for doctor or patient. My patient found his quiet place in hospice. After the first mishap, he thankfully didn’t have further reason for distress. He died exhibiting the same calm and grace that I came to appreciate. While it hardly seems so on some days, the task of medicine is to be accountable, above all, to our patients. To practice good medicine is to harness the power of listening and pair it with a capacity for empathy, two of the oldest tools of medicine. Without them, even the most modern and sophisticated advances will come to naught. The ability to sit quietly and listen attentively to the patient’s story seems like a quaint detail from a bygone era but as the physician Thomas McCrae observed to his students a hundred years ago, “More is missed by not looking than not knowing”. I think my patient would agree. • Ranjana Srivastava is a Guardian Australia columnist and oncologist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"us-news/2018/mar/23/donald-trump-transgender-military-ban-white-house-memo","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-24T12:41:34Z","webTitle":"White House announces ban on transgender people serving in military","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/mar/23/donald-trump-transgender-military-ban-white-house-memo","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/mar/23/donald-trump-transgender-military-ban-white-house-memo","fields":{"headline":"White House announces ban on transgender people serving in military","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The White House has announced orders to formally ban transgender people from serving in the military, following up on Donald Trump’s controversial policy pledge that sparked widespread backlash last year from civil rights groups and US defense chiefs. Despite opposition from top military officials and previous rulings against the ban, which LGBT rights groups have challenged in court, a memo from the secretary of defense released late on Friday night said trans people are “disqualified from military service except under certain limited circumstances”. The memo did not elaborate on possible exceptions, but said the secretary of defense and secretary of homeland security “may exercise their authority to implement any appropriate policies concerning military service by transgender individuals”. The announcement claimed that the policy was “developed through extensive study by senior uniformed and civilian leaders” and said that based on the advice of “experts”, the administration has concluded that the “accession or retention” of trans people “presents considerable risk to military effectiveness and lethality”. When Trump originally announced the ban on Twitter, he claimed that the military “cannot be burdened with the tremendous medical costs and disruption” of trans service members, despite the fact that studies have found that the ban would have negative impacts on the military. Critics have argued that the discriminatory policy will cause significant disruptions in the military, force trans members to hide their identities, deprive the military of talented people and reinforce harmful and inaccurate stereotypes about trans people. The president’s orders have reversed Barack Obama’s policy in 2016, which ended a longstanding rule barring trans people from serving openly in the military. “What the White House has released tonight is transphobia masquerading as policy. This policy is not based on an evaluation of new evidence,” Joshua Block, a senior staff attorney at the American Civil Liberties Union’s LGBT and HIV Project, said in a statement on Friday night. “It is reverse-engineered for the sole purpose of carrying out President Trump’s reckless and unconstitutional ban, undermining the ability of transgender service members to serve openly and military readiness as a whole.” Trump’s directive was already blocked by federal courts in four separate cases, including an ACLU lawsuit, the group noted. “The policy effectively coerces transgender people who wish to serve into choosing between their humanity and their country,” Block said. “Transgender people in our military deserve more from their government than a myth-driven proclamation about their unfitness for full civic inclusion.” Sarah McBride, the national press secretary with the Human Rights Campaign, the largest LGBT rights group in the US, also condemned the policy in a statement, saying: “Releasing this news under cover of darkness late on a Friday night means thousands of transgender troops will wake up tomorrow with their lives turned upside down. This couldn’t be more cowardly or wrong.” Numerous Republican senators, including John McCain, Susan Collins and Orrin Hatch, have criticized the policy, and more than 50 retired generals and admirals signed a letter saying the ban would degrade military readiness. The House Democratic leader, Nancy Pelosi, denounced the new announcement in a statement, saying: “This latest memorandum is the same cowardly, disgusting ban the president announced last summer. No one with the strength and bravery to serve in the US military should be turned away because of who they are.” Trump has also rescinded Obama-era protections for trans students, and vice-president Mike Pence has a long history of backing anti-LGBT policies."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/mar/24/chelsea-racism-claims-tip-of-iceberg","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-24T20:05:00Z","webTitle":"Chelsea racism claims could be just the tip of the iceberg","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/24/chelsea-racism-claims-tip-of-iceberg","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/mar/24/chelsea-racism-claims-tip-of-iceberg","fields":{"headline":"Chelsea racism claims could be just the tip of the iceberg","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"After all the alleged failures, all the specific allegations that boys in their care were stripped of self-confidence in a hard-faced world inhabited by some deeply unpleasant characters, what do Chelsea do next? Not just Chelsea either, if the latest former player to begin legal action against the club – a man, now 51, who says he cannot bear to pass Stamford Bridge or even watch them on television because of the psychological scars more than 30 years on – is correct in his assertion that there will be hundreds of others throughout the sport who have experienced the same kind of deplorable racism that he is alleging. This man was talented enough to earn a professional contract and share a dressing room with Kerry Dixon, Pat Nevin and David Speedie but quit the sport in 1985, he says, because the alleged racial abuse from his own coach, Gwyn Williams, had left him feeling physically sick about going into the club. He contacted solicitors after finding out, via the Guardian’s story in January, that three other former youth-team players, this time from the 1990s, had lodged legal claims against Chelsea, citing Williams again in what one claimant has described as a “feral environment” where black boys were treated like a “race of fucking dogs”. Lawyers working on the relevant cases tell me they have been contacted by other players from the same era. And don’t imagine it is just Chelsea who might be feeling twitchy about where all this leads. These stories can quickly gather legs. Who can be sure, across the sport as a whole, that a trickle of complaints will not soon turn into a tidal wave? Or that other clubs will not be affected in the same way? To make it very clear, Williams is flatly denying that he has ever racially abused anyone. He has issued a statement through his solicitor, Eddie Johns, to that effect and I did ring him when the first allegations surfaced. His response on that occasion was to say he did not know me and ask me to list the other football journalists on this newspaper before ringing off when it turned out they also were not familiar to him. Since then he has turned down a number of invitations to give his version of events and explain, presumably, why he thinks these players would make this up. He is not saying anything more. And that is fine, entirely his prerogative – though I would want to defend myself if I was being accused of what he is. Graham Rix, who is named extensively in the 1990s claims, is also represented by the same solicitor. Rix, formerly Chelsea’s youth-team coach, has been accused of, among other things, throwing a cup of coffee in the face of a black player. Johns says his clients “deny all and any allegations of racial or other abuse”, that they cooperated with a police investigation that did not lead to charges being pressed and have helped the Football Association. As for Chelsea, the encouraging part is that their response goes much further than the statement they released to me earlier this week, saying: “We take allegations of this nature extremely seriously. We are absolutely determined to do the right thing, to fully support those affected, assist the authorities and support their investigations.” When I started thinking about writing this column the idea was to suggest Chelsea gave serious thought to commissioning an independent investigation. As it turns out, they had already done so, bringing in external legal counsel so there can be no accusations of a whitewash. Chelsea have passed on what they have to the FA, the Premier League and, in some cases, the police, as well as offering in-house counselling to at least one former player. It cannot be easy for the current regime to deal with the fallout of something that allegedly happened under a different set of owners, yet the modern Chelsea have at least shown they want to establish the full facts – and that, for now, is all that can be asked of them. Equally I get the feeling they will be as horrified as any right-minded person by what is being alleged. The description, for example, from one of the youth-team players in the 1990s about the dressing-room environment at Harlington, at the age of 13, when Rix was coach. “He’d walk in and go: ‘Hey, look at the fucking blackies here then. Fucking rubber lips. Look at their fucking big noses. You black bastard. Been fucking robbing cars, have you?’ Let me tell you something – that is the most demoralising feeling you could ever have. I’m telling you that now. It’s so demoralising. You’re sat there with these other little kids from all parts of Europe and different parts of the world. I remember a little boy called Javier said to me: ‘Why? Why?’ I remember this boy, Javier. I’ve never seen him since. He couldn’t understand it. He was like: ‘Why? Porque? I remember.” Apologies, by the way, if the language jars. This newspaper’s policy is not to pebbledash its pages with asterisks and we would rather tell the story in grown-up form, rather than a censored version. Or, at least, a shortened version of the story. The above quote was a single paragraph from the transcript of the player’s interview with two FA safeguarding officials last October. Other allegations include that Rix or Williams called him a “darkie”, a “nignog”, a “black bastard”, a “wog”, “midnight”, “jigaboo” and various other insults. The player alleges he was told by Williams to “fuck off back to Africa” and “sell drugs or rob old grannies”. Williams, he says, used to tell him to “go and clean my office, Richard Pryor – shine my shoes like a good wog” or “pick up your lip, it’s dragging on the floor”. In total there are 49 pages of it – all along the same lines. It’s a grim and disturbing read. And, if possible, the independent lawyers need to track down Javier, and everyone else who was there at the same time. As for the former pro who alleges he was subjected to sometimes daily abuse from Williams, from 1979 to 1985, I can also disclose some examples from his evidence for the first time. His claim alleges that he turned up in a new jumper once and Williams asked him: “Have you been out on the rob with the other darkies on your estate?” When the player put wet-look gel on his curly hair, Williams allegedly shouted on the bus: “What are you wearing that stupid nig-nog hairstyle for?” On another occasion the team went on a pre-season trip to Switzerland. “I got into an altercation with one of my team-mates who hit me around the head with a glass bottle,” the former player says. “It didn’t smash but it was a serious assault so I went to him [Williams]. The only response was: ‘Stop being a little coon snitch.’” Pretty shocking, isn’t it? As is the claim of Renu Daly, of Hudgell Solicitors, which is representing the player, that across the sport as a whole there might be “potentially hundreds, if not thousands, of young people” who experienced racial abuse in the relevant decades. Her client says the same – “I am 100% certain it happened to many young black kids” – and if those numbers are anywhere near correct it is not just Chelsea who need to take this very seriously. Snubbing Anfield for Costa Rica game is a Kop out After the game against Italy on Tuesday England have two more friendlies to prepare for the World Cup, with Nigeria also due to visit Wembley but, first, a match against Costa Rica in Leeds. But why Elland Road? And why did the Football Association decide not to go through with its original plans to stage the match at Anfield? Various reasons – one being that Gareth Southgate and his coaching staff had misgivings about the lack of privacy at Melwood, Liverpool’s training ground. Yet I’m also reliably informed that one of the reasons why Liverpool’s name was crossed off was because the people making these decisions suspected the FA would not be welcomed by everyone on Merseyside because of everything surrounding Hillsborough and the possibility, at the time, that the game might clash with the forthcoming criminal trial. Another issue was potentially letting the Sun into Anfield when the club have banned the newspaper and, again, the bad feeling that might cause. England’s last game at Anfield was 12 years ago, and who can say how long it will be before they return to Merseyside? Friday night in Amsterdam – what did FA expect? Yes, England’s finest have done the nation proud again judging by those videos of bikes being hurled in canals and beer thrown over sightseers (I mean, why drink it if it can be chucked over three middle-aged women?). It is cringeworthy and wearisome in equal measures. More than anything, though, it is entirely predictable. Did the FA, after complaining about the stag-do mentality of England’s fans, really think it wise to arrange a Friday night game in Amsterdam?"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"environment/2018/mar/25/london-water-drinking-fountain-locations-revealed","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-25T00:05:39Z","webTitle":"First of London’s new drinking fountain locations revealed","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/mar/25/london-water-drinking-fountain-locations-revealed","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/mar/25/london-water-drinking-fountain-locations-revealed","fields":{"headline":"First of London’s new drinking fountain locations revealed","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, has revealed the locations of the first four drinking fountains to be installed in the capital under a new pilot scheme in an effort to combat single-use plastic. The first fountain was installed last week in Carnaby Street in the West End, while in the coming weeks two will be set up in Liverpool Street station and another in Flat Iron Square in Southwark. “We want to make sure that it becomes the norm that people can not use single-use plastic bottles,” said Shirley Rodrigues, deputy mayor for environment and energy. Last year the Guardian discovered that a million plastic bottles are sold worldwide every minute, a large proportion ending up in landfill or in the oceans. The latest move is part of Khan’s plan to tackle plastic waste in the capital, with a further 16 drinking fountains set to be installed by the end of the year. “To get a grip on needless plastic waste, we need to provide simple ways of refilling and accessing free water, and water fountains are the much-needed solution,” said Khan. But quite where these fountains will appear is up for grabs: landowners, community groups, boroughs and others have until 24 April to apply for a fountain, with £50,000 from the mayor and £25,000 from the provider of the fountains, MIW, set aside for successful applicants to help fund installation. “One of the key things is that [the site] is accessible, [and] obviously areas with higher footfall are very helpful,” said Dr Heather Koldewey, who will be involved in judging the bids and is co-director of the#OneLess campaign against single-use plastic, a partner in the scheme. Koldeway said the 20 pilot fountains will include flow meters so that their use can be monitored, while street surveys will be carried out to explore whether the fountains are changing public behaviour. The city hall funds are part of a £750,000 pot of money earmarked by the mayor to fund a three-year plan to reduce London’s plastic waste. However, Khan has pledged another £6m for environmental improvements in London that includes installing more water fountains, informed by the results from the pilot. While drinking fountains were once abundant in the capital, an exclusive Guardian investigation last year found the provision of drinking fountains currently varies dramatically between London boroughs. While Lambeth reported 25, other councils, including Kingston and Sutton, reported having none. Rodrigues said programmes such as Sir David Attenborough’s Blue Planet II had helped propel the problem of single-use plastic into public consciousness. “What the mayor is saying is we can do something now, we don’t want to wait while [the] government dithers about putting out yet another consultation on what to do. We can see it with our own eyes what is happening in the oceans,” she said. Koldeway, who is also head of marine and freshwater conservation at the Zoological Society of London, said the impact of plastic was all too apparent on a recent research expedition to the remote Chagos Archipelago in the Indian Ocean.“In just 20 minutes [we] accumulated 334 plastic water bottles from 10 different countries, just through a quick beach clean and count,” she said. Earlier this month Khan announced the start of a free tap water refill pilot, working with partners including the charity City to Sea, which set up Bristol’s tap water refill scheme. Paul O’Connell, a trustee of the Drinking Fountain Association that is also working to increase the number of drinking fountains, welcomed Khan’s latest announcement and said he hoped other cities will follow suit. “When you are outside your home and you are thirsty, if there is no drinking fountain, pretty much your only option is to buy plastic bottled water,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/mar/23/bel-trew-egypt-british-journalist-expelled-the-times","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-24T01:58:07Z","webTitle":"Egypt expels British journalist, raising fears for press ahead of election","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/23/bel-trew-egypt-british-journalist-expelled-the-times","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/mar/23/bel-trew-egypt-british-journalist-expelled-the-times","fields":{"headline":"Egypt expels British journalist, raising fears for press ahead of election","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Egyptian authorities threatened a British journalist with a military trial and expelled her from the country with no stated cause, in advance of the country’s upcoming presidential election. Bel Trew, a journalist with the Times, was arrested on 20 February while reporting in Shubra, a working-class neighbourhood of Cairo, and taken to a police station. Hours later, she was driven to Cairo international airport and forced to board a flight for London. In an account published on Saturday by the Times, Trew wrote: “The charges were never revealed to me. [But] after seven hours of detention, I was threatened with a military trial, a legal process often used against terrorism suspects or dissidents.” “Less than 24 hours after I was first detained, I was marched on to a plane with nothing but the clothes I was standing up in. The choice before me – stay for a military trial or leave – was no kind of choice,” she wrote. The arrest and deportation of a foreign journalist is the latest incident in an already unprecedented crackdown on press freedom in Egypt. Foreign media workers have been subject to imprisonment or arrest in the past, but Trew’s expulsion has raised concerns about whether journalists are safe to report in Egypt ahead of the country’s upcoming presidential election on 26 March. In a statement, the Times said that it had withheld news of Trew’s deportation while investigating if she could return to the country. “The circumstances of her detention and the threats made against her were sufficiently outlandish to suggest that a mistake had been made, based on a misunderstanding. We have since been trying to ensure her safe return to Cairo, in time to cover the presidential election. It is now clear that the authorities have no intention of allowing her to return,” the newspaper said. “As far as the Cairo authorities are concerned, I am on a list of ‘undesirable people’ and if I attempt to return I will be re-arrested,” wrote Trew. A spokeswoman for the British embassy in Cairo said that the motivation for Trew’s expulsion was still unknown. “We have provided support and raised our concerns at the highest levels. The foreign secretary has raised it directly with the Egyptian foreign minister. The Egyptian authorities have not shared any evidence of wrongdoing. We will continue to press them on this case,” she said. The Egyptian government did not respond to requests for comment. Trew, 33, moved to Cairo shortly before the 2011 uprising that toppled Hosni Mubarak. Since the current president, Abdel Fatah al-Sisi, came to power in a 2013 military coup, the climate for Egyptian and foreign media has grown increasingly repressive. According to the Committee to Protect Journalists, 20 Egyptian journalists were behind bars as of December last year. Egypt is described as one of “the world’s biggest prisons for journalists”, by the press freedom group Reporters Without Borders, ranking 161 out of a total of 180 countries on their annual World Press Freedom Index."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/mar/23/netherlands-england-friendly-international-match-report","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-23T21:52:20Z","webTitle":"Jesse Lingard strikes as experimental England defeat Netherlands","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/mar/23/netherlands-england-friendly-international-match-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/mar/23/netherlands-england-friendly-international-match-report","fields":{"headline":"Jesse Lingard strikes as experimental England defeat Netherlands","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"It is 49 years since England last won in Amsterdam, with Alf Ramsey as manager, Colin Bell scoring an 84th-minute winner and Emlyn Hughes winning his first cap, so Gareth Southgate and his players are entitled to feel pleased with themselves now they have recorded their first victory here against the Oranje since the year man set foot on the moon. After that kind of wait, perhaps it might be slightly impertinent to point out that we saw here why this is regarded as the worst Dutch side for a long time. England certainly chose obliging opponents and on this evidence, with the stadium barely half-full by the final whistle, it is very clear that a win against this lot cannot be considered the prize it once was. Equally, England can still reflect on a satisfying evening after Jesse Lingard’s winning goal, a clean sheet for Jordan Pickford and – if we are to be grateful for small mercies – nothing too horrendous from the end decorated with St George’s flags. Well, apart from the usual brainless attempt to drown out another country’s national anthem. Over two days, more than 100 England fans have been arrested but at least when it comes to the actual football it was the other country who should be the more embarrassed. Not that anyone in the England set-up should get too carried away just yet. The game against Italy at Wembley on Tuesday should provide a more realistic gauge of England’s World Cup preparations and, even in victory, there are still legitimate questions to be asked of Southgate when his team selections show so little in the way of pattern or structure. He started here with three players who usually operate as right-backs for their clubs, but without one actually playing as a right-back. Danny Rose’s selection in the left wing-back role shows Southgate must have abandoned his policy of not picking players who are out of favour at their clubs and it would be intriguing to know what Harry Maguire, James Tarkowski and Alfie Mawson made of Kyle Walker being asked to experiment as a centre-half. As it happened, Maguire came on in the 10th minute because of an early injury for Joe Gomez, who plays right-back for Liverpool but started here on the left of England’s back three. Confused? England should be glad this was such a poor Dutch side because the lack of clear strategy can seem bizarre, particularly when there are only three games now – or 270 minutes – to finalise their plans. On that front, Southgate will at least have a better idea now why Rose has fallen out of favour with Mauricio Pochettino at Tottenham. Rose was involved in the goal but his overall performance was poor and, on the other side, Kieran Trippier did not do enough to disprove the theory that Walker is better equipped for the role. On a brighter note, England did show at times that they have a good mix of movement and speed in attack and, having offered very little during the first half, they are also entitled to think they should have been awarded a penalty six minutes after the restart. Marcus Rashford’s speed caught out Matthijs de Ligt and the goalkeeper, Jeroen Zoet, should not have come haring off his line. Rashford was ahead of them both but the Spanish referee, Jesús Gil Manzano, was some way back and gave De Ligt the benefit of the doubt for the sliding tackle that brought down England’s striker. England’s only noteworthy chance of the first half had come just after the half-hour mark when Jordan Henderson, probably England’s best player on the night, headed Trippier’s free-kick wide. After the interval, however, they started to pass the ball with greater purpose and it became even clearer why this Dutch side have not qualified for the World Cup. Ronald Koeman, their new manager, spoke afterwards about the slow tempo and lack of momentum when his team had the ball, plus a lack of creativity in attacking positions. England hardly set the world alight on that front either, but they did have the pace of Rashford, Lingard and Raheem Sterling and when they took the lead, in the 59th minute, it was in the midst of their most productive spell of the match. Lingard was involved in the move, spreading the ball to Rose on the left and then hung back to see if the ball might come back his way on the edge of the penalty area. Stefan de Vrij’s attempt to clear the danger succeeded only in presenting the ball to his opponent and Lingard, 20 yards out, had the time and space to pick his spot. His low shot was aimed to Zoet’s right and, though the goalkeeper did get his hand to the ball, he could not prevent it ending up in the bottom corner. After that, Southgate brought on Dele Alli, Jamie Vardy and Danny Welbeck in one go, with Ashley Young later replacing Rose. England’s manager had said before the match that he wanted the newcomers in his squad to play with confidence and make the most of their opportunity. Pickford did just that and, as Southgate pointed out, the team’s new first-choice goalkeeper was also involved at the start of the move that led to the goal. Yet Mawson, Tarkowski and Lewis Cook will have to hope they make their debuts on Tuesday."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/2018/mar/24/cameron-bancroft-ball-tampering-claims-mar-south-africa-v-australia","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-24T20:17:02Z","webTitle":"Steve Smith admits to Australia ball-tampering plan against South Africa","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/mar/24/cameron-bancroft-ball-tampering-claims-mar-south-africa-v-australia","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/mar/24/cameron-bancroft-ball-tampering-claims-mar-south-africa-v-australia","fields":{"headline":"Steve Smith admits to Australia ball-tampering plan against South Africa","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Distraught. Disgraced. Devastated. Call it what they will, the leadership of the Australia team have dropped themselves into a ball-tampering debacle with the most junior player in the side, Cameron Bancroft, the man left standing in the dock. During a stunning press conference after day three of the third Test against South Africa here in Cape Town, Steve Smith freely stated that he had brought the game into disrepute with his direction in the matter but was adamant that he should keep the captaincy. In a dramatic middle session Bancroft was seen pulling a yellow object from his pocket and rubbing it on the ball in an effort to scuff it to help achieve reverse swing. Upon realising that the move was spotted by the TV cameras, he was then seen hiding the object in his underwear. Questioned by the umpires, Nigel Llong and Richard Illingworth, he maintained it was only a cleaning cloth being applied to the ball. The 25-year-old, in his eighth Test, later described that blatant lie as a product of panic at realising he had been caught. “I have been charged with attempting to change the condition of the ball,” the opener said before admitting his guilt and detailing what he had been up to. “We had a discussion during the break and I saw an opportunity to use some tape, get some granules from rough patches on the wicket to change the ball condition. It didn’t work.” Too right it didn’t. For Smith’s part, he said the “leadership group” of the team hatched the foolish plan at the lunch interval. He refused to name names but when Glenn Maxwell was fined internally by a similar collective in 2016 it included Smith’s deputy, David Warner, and the fast bowlers Mitchell Starc and Josh Hazlewood. Smith made clear that the head coach, Darren Lehmann, was not involved. “Bangers was around at the time and we spoke about it and thought it was a possible way to get an advantage,” he said. “I’m not proud of what’s happened [and] it’s not within the spirit of the game. My integrity, the team’s integrity, the leadership group’s integrity has come into question and rightfully so. It’s certainly not on and it won’t happen again, I can promise you that, under my leadership.” His captaincy now becomes a topic of interest but Smith rejected outright any consideration of resignation. “I still think I’m the right person for the job,” he said. “I take responsibility as the captain, I need to take control of the ship, but this is certainly something I’m not proud of and something that I can hopefully learn from and come back strong from. I am embarrassed to be sitting here talking about this.” Smith also rebuffed the charge that ball tampering in the team was systematic, instead citing the high-stakes nature of this Test as the motivation: the series is 1-1, with South Africa well on top in the third game of the four-Test rubber. Aiden Markram’s 84 helped South Africa increase their lead to 294 at the close of play, as the hosts ended on 238 for five. Earlier, Kagiso Rabada wrapped up Australia’s first innings for 255 by dismissing Josh Hazlewood to finish with four wickets. “I can promise you this is the first time it’s happened,” he said. “We saw this game as such an important game. Not that other games aren’t important as well but as an opportunity. We’ve seen the ball reversing quite a lot throughout this series and our ball just didn’t look like it was going to.” Bancroft insisted this was also the first time something like this had been suggested to him in the national team, recalling the anxiety he felt as he was getting involved. “I was in the vicinity of the area when the leadership group were discussing it,” he said. “I’ll be honest with you, I was nervous about it because with hundreds of cameras around that’s always the risk, isn’t it? I sit before you today and I’m not proud of what’s happened.” When asked whether his contrition for the episode was for getting caught rather than the act, Smith maintained that either way it would have felt wrong, “deep down”: “If we weren’t caught I’d still feel incredibly bad about it. I’m incredibly sorry for trying to bring the game into disrepute the way we did.” Bancroft will pay the price in the short term. It is now a formality that he will be banned for the final match once the match referee, Andy Pycroft, lays the level-two charge that the offence carries. He understands the repercussions will be broader than that. “I was in the wrong place at the wrong time and I want to be here because I’m accountable for my actions,” he said. “I’m not proud of what’s happened and I have to live with the consequences and the damage to my own reputation.” Smith said he felt for Bancroft, as he should. Cricket Australia’s leadership had not responded as the country was asleep as the scandal broke. But it will do soon enough and there is no guarantee Smith will still be in charge once they have had their say. What a mess."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/2018/mar/24/virat-kohli-may-join-surrey-england-india-test-series","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-24T12:08:16Z","webTitle":"Virat Kohli may join Surrey to tune up for India’s Test series in England","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/mar/24/virat-kohli-may-join-surrey-england-india-test-series","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/mar/24/virat-kohli-may-join-surrey-england-india-test-series","fields":{"headline":"Virat Kohli may join Surrey to tune up for India’s Test series in England","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Surrey have confirmed their interest in signing Virat Kohli on a possible short-term deal before India’s Test series in England this summer. Reports on Saturday suggested a deal has already been struck, with the India captain expected to miss the one-off Test with Afghanistan in Bangalore on 20 June and a Twenty20 series with Ireland in order to tune up for English conditions. Alec Stewart, Surrey’s director of cricket, insists this is not the case but should the timings work and the Board of Control for Cricket in India give it the all-clear then the draw of signing the sport’s biggest name is undeniable. “I did inquire a while back about Kohli when it appeared to be a possible option for him to play county cricket but was told by the BCCI that India were playing Ireland in T20s and an inaugural Test v Afghanistan in June,” said Stewart. “If he does now become available we would look at it again to see if it could potentially work around our current overseas arrangements.” Surrey already have Mitchell Marsh as their overseas player for this season but Australia’s five-match one-day series against England, starting on 13 June, would open up a three-week gap for a replacement. It would in theory give Kohli three First Division fixtures – against Hampshire at the Ageas Bowl, Somerset at Guildford and Yorkshire at Scarborough – before India’s tour begins with the first of three Twenty20s, at Old Trafford, on 3 July. The five-Test series that starts at Edgbaston on 1 August is what sits firmly in Kohli’s sights with success against the red Dukes ball in England the one glaring gap in his otherwise stellar cricketing CV. The 29-year-old’s previous Test tour of England, in 2014, brought a return of 134 runs from 10 innings as India succumbed to a 3-1 defeat. Kohli has said that he was “thankful” for the effect this had on his career. Speaking about the chance to play county cricket in future during India’s 4-0 home victory over England in 2016 – a series dominated by his batting – Kohli said: “I would love a month to get used to playing in the conditions and understand what the wickets play like in that phase of the year.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/mar/24/brexit-whistleblower-shahmir-sanni-interview-vote-leave-cambridge-analytica","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-24T20:01:14Z","webTitle":"The Brexit whistleblower: ‘Did Vote Leave use me?

Was I naive?'","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"When I first met Shahmir Sanni last August, he was nervy, anxious, uncertain. “I’ve just started piecing it together,” he said, in what was our first off-the-record conversation. “All this stuff I didn’t realise at the time.” Stuff that a series of investigations and news articles had forced him to start thinking about. “Was I just really naive?” he asked. Then later: “Do you think they just used me?” It’s been a painful question for Sanni, one that he’s struggled with over a period of months. Now, though, he thinks that, yes, he was used; that he and his friend, Darren Grimes, were taken advantage of by people they respected and trusted, and that the consequences of it are profound, far reaching, and go well beyond his own personal feelings of hurt and betrayal. In early 2016, Sanni was a 22-year-old recent graduate, volunteering with Vote Leave, the official campaign to leave the European Union led by Boris Johnson and Michael Gove. It was one of his first pieces of work experience after graduating from the University of East Anglia with a degree in economics, and for someone who describes himself as a “natural Eurosceptic” it was a plum role. “It was like a startup. Everyone was throwing ideas around and saying different things. You’re given a lot of creative freedom.” He was still living at home in Solihull, but was travelling in by train, a few days each week, to work in Vote Leave’s headquarters at Millbank Tower in London, overlooking the Thames. Vote Leave’s senior directors were quick to realise how useful he would be for the campaign. “A huge part of campaigns is to make sure you diversify,” says Sanni. “And we discussed how crucial it was that Vote Leave didn’t appear racist.” So, it was: “Here’s the brown guy”? “Exactly,” he says. It was a role he was happy to play, though, helping with their black and ethnic minority outreach efforts. “At university all my friends were ‘Remain, Remain, Remain’, but when I started doing research into it, I realised I’m a nerdy Eurosceptic. And even after all this, I would still vote Leave.” “All this” is why Sanni is talking today. Because it’s what happened next that’s the issue – a sequence of events that began in March 2016, when one of Vote Leave’s senior directors, Stephen Parkinson, who is now Theresa May’s political secretary, asked Sanni if he would be interested in helping with one of Vote Leave’s official youth groups, BeLeave. “BeLeave was very progressive; it was aimed at young, liberal Leavers. They were talking about African farmers being discriminated against… it totally aligned with my values.” BeLeave had been set up and was being run from within Vote Leave’s HQ by another volunteer, 23-year-old fashion student Darren Grimes, whose main role was creating ads and messaging to share on social media. “His content was just really, really good. They were just cool, simple graphics that people would share. His creative side shone through. Everyone recognised that.” Sanni continued to campaign for Vote Leave, but he was also now helping BeLeave. Then about a month before the referendum, “Cleo tells us someone, a sponsor, wants to give money to BeLeave”. This was Cleo Watson, another senior director at Vote Leave – its head of outreach. Now, like Parkinson, Watson works at No 10 Downing Street, as political adviser to Theresa May. When Watson said a donor had expressed interest in giving money to BeLeave so it could expand its work, Sanni and Grimes wrote a proposal. They could treble the impact of their Facebook content, they reckoned, if they could get a few thousand pounds to spend on ads. “We were like: ‘If we had £10,000, this is what we could do: we could have X number of paid adverts and reach so many people.’” Watson told them they needed to speak to Vote Leave’s internal lawyer and head of compliance. “And he said the only way to get money was to set [BeLeave] up as a separate organisation. So, we were like: ‘OK, cool. How do we do that?’ And so he wrote up the constitution for us. And Darren put his own name on it. Because that’s what he was told to do.” The lawyer helped Sanni and Grimes to draw up the documents, which they signed on 18 May, and he told them to open a bank account. But no donor ever materialised. Later, in the crucial final fortnight before the referendum, the talk in the Vote Leave office was about how the campaign was both running out of money and about to hit its spending limit of £7m. And then, 10 days before the referendum, Vote Leave learned that they had received a donation of £1m. Because of their spending limits, they suggested this could be given as a donation to BeLeave. Not the few thousand pounds they had asked for, though. The proposed sum was initially £400,000 but ended up close to £700,000. What was your reaction? “We were ecstatic. It was amazing. Can you imagine… you’re 22 and you’re given nearly a million pounds? I think I added that to my LinkedIn profile that same day.” Today, though, for Sanni, that campaign, the money, the creative work, and everything associated with it is tainted. What he has spent months coming to terms with is that this donation may not have had anything to do with BeLeave’s creativity and flair. “Vote Leave didn’t really give us that money,” he says. “They just pretended to. We had no control over it. We were 22-year-old students. You’re not going to just give nearly a million pounds to a pair of students and let them do whatever.” To Sanni’s mind, what this means is: “They cheated.” The question is whether this was a strategy to get around the strict electoral spending limits enforced by law. If election campaigns coordinate, they have to declare their spending together. Spending limits are the bedrock of our parliamentary democracy: our electoral laws control the amount of money that can be spent in elections – which for the official designated campaign group is £7m. But a perfectly legal loophole exists: separate campaigns can spend up to £700,000 in excess of that. Just as long as they don’t co-ordinate – or, in the Electoral Commission’s words, “work together”. So was BeLeave a separate campaign? Vote Leave insist it was and the Electoral Commission agreed back in April 2017. But Sanni – and he has a wealth of documents – now thinks it wasn’t. He believes BeLeave “worked together” with Vote Leave. “It’s a lie. The whole thing. It was never separate.” And he has a whole dossier of emails, text messages and other files. What’s more: “They told us to set up the bank account, but no money ever went into it. I was the treasurer and secretary of BeLeave and I never saw the money. I had no control over it. It was Vote Leave who decided everything.” The money went straight to Vote Leave’s Canadian data analytics firm – AggregateIQ (AIQ). It’s an extraordinary revelation. The Observer has been one of a number of publications and campaign groups that have picked away at the story behind this donation. Because one thing is clear: something smelled bad. It’s been the subject of two Electoral Commission investigations, an inquiry by the Information Commissioner’s Office, numerous Freedom of Information requests, multiple articles and a judicial review. The latest investigation is still live. And nobody has yet been able to answer the question posed in the very first article by BuzzFeed on 2 August 2016: “Why did Vote Leave donate £625,000 to a 23-year-old fashion student during the referendum?” Until now. Because Sanni knows exactly why. “We were two broke college students. Darren’s working-class as well. And it’s his name all over this. He’s the one being investigated. It’s his name on the form. And he just did what Vote Leave told him.” Sanni is quite profoundly anti-Europe. He doesn’t believe in what he calls EU “passport discrimination”. And having moved here from Pakistan, he loves this country with the passion that, he says, maybe only an immigrant can feel. “Britain saved my family,” he says. “I voted Leave. And if there was a second referendum, I would vote Leave again. But I now know my vote was based on cheating. And that’s what I cannot stand.” To say it’s a brave decision to come forward is a huge understatement. Sanni is still only 24. The CEO of Vote Leave, Matthew Elliott, is the co-founder of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, where Sanni works as digital campaign manager. And a lot of his friends are still in that same pro-Brexit world, including Darren Grimes, who now works for the website BrexitCentral where Matthew Elliott is editor at large. Sanni lives in BrexitLand. His career has been built on Brexit. And his decision to come forward has been far from straightforward. Back in August, we discussed him going on the record anonymously, but even that felt too risky. He was worried about his mother – a teacher who came to Britain as a single mother from Pakistan less than a decade ago – and his two sisters. But it’s also part of what has prompted his decision. “I’m from Pakistan. And for someone that came here seeking a new life, a better life, one where my mum and my sisters could live freely, in a country where my decision as a voter actually matters and is truthful… this is a huge deal.” The first inkling that something wasn’t right came when journalists from BuzzFeed and Private Eye got sight of BeLeave’s audit to the Electoral Commission and found what BuzzFeed noted was “a highly unusual transfer of funds”. Namely that Darren Grimes was recorded as having received a total of £675,315 in four donations spread over eight days shortly before polling day – on 13, 16, 20 and 21 June. Sanni shrugged it off. “I just thought: ‘Oh, this is how politics is. It’s remoaners trying to smear us and our hard work.’” But Grimes was less sanguine. Sanni still has his Facebook messages, which show his confusion and panic. “I’ve had three journalists this morning,” one says. “I don’t know if I should go back to GP and be like I’m dying or just fight through it.” (A reference, Sanni says, to the state of his health.) Grimes then forwarded an email he’d received from a Vote Leave director: “So as discussed we think you should refuse to speak to hacks about it and just email them something like this: ‘We received donations in a standard legal way and have reported them according to the rules.’” In the BuzzFeed article, Grimes says: “We received donations in a standard legal way and have reported them according to the rules.” What Sanni believes, and says is reflected in the multiple pages of evidence that he has gathered, is that Vote Leave directed BeLeave’s actions before it became a separate campaign, after it became a separate campaign, and throughout the referendum. What’s also clear, in the pages of messages from Grimes, is how the donation – which has put him front and centre of the media coverage – has affected him. His messages to Sanni make distressing reading. As a teenager, Grimes was bullied. He grew up in a working-class community in County Durham, and Sanni describes him as sensitive and vulnerable to criticism. When the letter arrived from the Electoral Commission, announcing it needed to make an “assessment”, he really started to panic. “He rang me up and told me to delete my emails. I didn’t understand it. I said: ‘We’ve done nothing wrong. Don’t worry about it.’ But he was panicking. So I just did it.” Sanni still had no inkling that there was anything seriously amiss. “We were advised every step of the way by Vote Leave’s lawyers. They literally told us what to do and where to sign. I couldn’t understand how we had done anything wrong.” And then he found the drive: a shared Google drive that Vote Leave had set up and that has every appearance of being a smoking gun. It’s here that Grimes and Sanni shared content with key Vote Leave directors, including campaign director Dominic Cummings, and Vote Leave’s data analytics firm, AIQ. “I looked at it and I thought ‘Oh, my God.’ That’s when I realised things were serious. I was, ‘OK, this is really fucked up.’” What Sanni realised was that on 17 March 2017, someone using an administrator’s account in the name of Victoria Woodcock, the chief operating officer of Vote Leave, went through the drive and deleted Woodcock, Cummings and Vote Leave’s digital director, Henry de Zoete, from more than 100 files. However the system logged a record of this activity. This was 17 days after the Electoral Commission had written to Vote Leave and Darren Grimes, telling them that it was opening an investigation into the donation. And 13 days after the Observer had announced the Information Commissioner’s Office was launching an inquiry into the use of data in the referendum. Woodcock told the Observer that any suggestion that she was involved in: “knowingly and deliberately” deleting evidence “which would be relevant to an investigation” was “untrue and completely unsupported by the evidence.” Woodcock added in June 2018, three months after she was originally contacted for comment, that she had nothing to do with the deletions. She explained that the administrator account which made the deletions bore her name because she had originally set up the shared drive. She clarified, however, that she had handed over control of the account to Vote Leave on 17 March 2017, and lost access to the drive, before the deletions took place. Vote Leave said in a statement to the electoral commission in April 2018 that it restricted access to the documents as part of a routine data protection exercise. To Sanni it was obvious that something was seriously amiss – that this was evidence that had been deleted. Someone had painstakingly gone through the files one by one, and removed these names from them. Not one or two files, but 140 of them. On a blog post published on Friday, Cummings says this is “factually wrong and libellous”. Vote Leave say staff acted “ethically, responsibly and legally in deleting any data”. “What did you do when you saw that on the drive?” I ask Sanni. “I told Chris,” he says. I’ve spent countless hours this year talking to Christopher Wylie, and it was through him that I first heard about Shahmir Sanni’s role in the EU referendum. Wylie is the whistleblower whose revelations in the Observer last weekend about Cambridge Analytica and Facebook precipitated such an astonishing global fallout. Cambridge Analytica’s CEO, Alexander Nix, has been suspended, while at one stage Facebook saw around $60bn wiped off its share price. On Wednesday, Mark Zuckerberg apologised. Christopher Wylie is not just at the heart of the Cambridge Analytica-Facebook scandal. He’s at the heart of Brexit too. It was Wylie who introduced both Sanni and Grimes to Vote Leave. Politics is a small world, and Wylie’s work with the Lib Dems in the coalition government had brought him into contact with both Lib Dems and Tories. Grimes and Sanni were both friends of Wylie, and it was he who introduced them to Stephen Parkinson of Vote Leave. In a statement released this week, Stephen Parkinson said: “I was not introduced to Shahmir Sanni or Darren Grimes by Chris Wylie as he is claiming, but by a mutual friend from university.” It is Wylie’s role elsewhere that is pivotal. Because he didn’t just play a founding role in setting up Cambridge Analytica: he also helped in the setting up of AIQ, the Canadian data services and “digital advertising” firm to which Vote Leave allocated 40% of its £6.8m spend. In February last year, I wrote my first report about Cambridge Analytica, interrogating what work it had done for Nigel Farage’s Leave.EU campaign. It kicked off two investigations into Cambridge Analytica’s role in Brexit: one by the Electoral Commission into its work for Leave.EU; the other by the ICO into how it used data. Since then, both organisations have denied that Cambridge Analytica did any paid or unpaid work for Leave.EU. However, on Friday, a former director of the data firm, Brittany Kaiser, said she was told to deny any work had been done. “In my opinion, I was lying,” she said. ”I felt like we should say ‘this is exactly what we did’.” This is consistent with what I have been reporting for more than a year. In March, after the first article was published, I got a tip-off. Vote Leave – the official leave campaign group in the referendum – was entirely separate from Leave.EU, but the data analytics firm Vote Leave used, AIQ, was linked to SCL Elections, the parent company that set up Cambridge Analytica with Robert Mercer’s funds. AIQ was until last year listed on its website as “SCL Canada”. It was my attempt to prove this, to figure out the link, that first led me to Wylie. “If you want to understand where Canada fits into this,” an ex-employee of Cambridge Analytica told me, “you need to find Christopher Wylie.” So I did. Wylie was the key to understanding how Cambridge Analytica had harvested upwards of 50m Facebook profiles. And he was the key to understanding the link between Cambridge Analytica and AIQ. “I helped set up AIQ in 2013,” he told me in our first conversation. “They’re my friends. We needed someone to build Cambridge Analytica’s technology platform and manage their databases, and I asked my friend Jeff.” Jeff Silvester was Wylie’s first employer, a man he had known since he was 16 and who went on to co-found AIQ. Last May, Wylie showed me a document that proved the link: an intellectual property agreement that showed SCL Elections owned AIQ’s IP “in perpetuity”. This document shows the link between Cambridge Analytica and AIQ. Between Robert Mercer, Steve Bannon and Brexit. What’s more, says Wylie, AIQ deployed the algorithms that Cambridge Analytica built. “AIQ managed Ripon, Cambridge Analytica’s platform, and built a lot of the tech to connect the algorithms to social and online advertising networks.” In response to our questions, AggregateIQ said: “AggregateIQ has always been 100 per cent Canadian owned and operated. AggregateIQ never worked or even communicated in anyway with Cambridge Analytica, or any other parties related to Cambridge Analytica, with respect to the Brexit campaign.” In 2015 and 2016, almost all of AIQ’s work came via Cambridge Analytica. They worked closely with Cambridge Analytica’s vice-president, Steve Bannon, on multiple political campaigns in the US. “Bannon was always interested in Brexit,” says Wylie. “He saw Britain as a cultural leader. And where Britain led, America would follow.” In total, £3.9m of leave campaign funds were spent with AIQ. Four different groups used the firm, even though all these campaigns were supposedly separate and could only “work together” if they shared their spending limits. Vote Leave spent £2,697,000. There was the £675,000 via BeLeave. A sum of £100,000 that Vote Leave donated to Veterans for Britain, which Veterans for Britain then paid to AIQ. AIQ also received £32,750 from the Democratic Unionist party. Whichever way one looks at it, AIQ would seem to be fundamental to the data-driven targeting of “persuadables” in the final days of the campaign. These four campaign groups mysteriously and independently found the same tiny data analytics firm, located in a sleepy town on an island off the west coast of Canada, 5,000 miles away. In April 2017, Dominic Cummings told me by email that Vote Leave had found the firm “on the internet”. Darren Grimes told the Electoral Commission the same thing. The only problem? Online archives show that AIQ’s website didn’t show up in Google searches until after the referendum. “I looked at the time,” says Sanni. “I was, like, ‘Who is AIQ?’ And there was nothing. No website. Nothing.” It’s Cummings who is widely acknowledged to be the mastermind of Vote Leave. A close friend of Michael Gove, he had worked as his special adviser when Gove was minister of education, alongside another senior Vote Leave director, its head of digital, Henry de Zoete. Nobody is in any doubt about Cummings’s brilliance: he’s advertised it widely, and written thousands of words about his strategy on his blog – about how he spent 98% of his budget online; how Vote Leave’s ads received nearly a billion impressions; and how, in the end, it came down to just 600,000 people, or just over 1% of registered votes. “A small enough margin,” he notes, that “a few specific events and decisions” made all the difference. He’s also been very specific about the pivotal role played by AIQ. The firm’s website featured a quote from Cummings about Brexit: “We couldn’t have done it without them.” This was removed from the site this week. AIQ told the Observer that “the services it provided to Vote Leave were in accordance with instructions given by Vote Leave”, and “the services provided to BeLeave were in accordance given by BeLeave”. The final weeks of the Brexit campaign were the most crucial. On his blog, Cummings says they code-named the period “Waterloo” and ramped up its spending, bombarding the small sliver of people it had identified as “persuadable” with every kind of ad. And it worked. Cummings’s campaign was a triumph. It had overcome all the odds. There’s no doubt that he won the war of the internet. But the question about this donation, the £675,000 that went to Darren Grimes (to him personally because BeLeave was not a limited company), the four campaigns that all used AIQ, and AIQ’s links to Cambridge Analytica… all this has dogged the result for 18 months now. Last autumn, Cummings took himself off Twitter. A freedom of information effort by Peter Geoghegan and Adam Ramsay of Open Democracy became the basis for a judicial review by the Good Law Project’s Jolyon Maugham QC, and in November, in what was front-page news, the Electoral Commission reopened its investigation into Darren Grimes and the donation. It had “reasonable grounds”, it said, “to suspect an offence may have been committed.” Cummings masterminded Vote Leave’s strategy. And CEO Matthew Elliott signed it all off. But neither has been named by the Electoral Commission or the Information Commissioner’s Office in any of the multiple subsequent investigations. As Sanni points out, “It’s Darren’s name all over everything. He’s the one in the frame.” And he’s the one, according to Sanni, who has borne the brunt of the stress and anxiety that’s followed. This is the heart of the story, and it’s what has ultimately prompted Shahmir Sanni to go on the record. “Darren is totally loyal,” he says. “And they knew that.” And it was witnessing the toll the investigation was taking on Grimes that finally made Sanni realise the seriousness of the charges. “It’s the impact on Darren’s health that made me go: ‘Something’s fucked up. Something’s wrong.’” In evidence that Sanni has submitted to the Electoral Commission, he includes Facebook messages that Grimes sent him at the time senior Vote Leave staff were trying to arrange the donation; text messages that make poignant reading in the light of what happened next.” Grimes: “I was a bit worried about things going wrong tbh […] Especially with the prying eyes because of the expenses scandal.” Sanni: “What are you worried about?” Grimes: “Managing accounts/handling that sum of money and making sure everything is properly accounted for I guess. I have a lot to manage pretty much alone because people are flakey [sic]. And the last thing I need is to end up fucking up. Haha.” Sanni: “I don’t think you’ve got anything to worry about honestlyyt [sic]. And you’re worried because you care – which is good thing… And the fact that people are wiling to donate to BeLeave instead of Vote Leave is something you should be very, very proud of.” What’s more, in an email sent on 16 May to Vote Leave’s lawyer, Cleo Watson wrote: “… Darren and the rest of the group (all between 18 &amp; 22) don’t feel comfortable handling the money side of things, having no experience beyond their student loans.” It’s a stunning acknowledgment, one which raises more questions. This was Vote Leave’s senior director and Vote Leave’s head of compliance acknowledging that this was a group of young people without the experience or wherewithal to handle such a large sum of money. Watson told the Observer: “I absolutely deny the claims being levelled against me.” She said she was supportive as a friend but did not have “any kind of control” over them. There’s a heartbreaking contrast in the documents that Sanni has – between the cynicism that informed the funding scheme and the idealism that underpinned BeLeave’s messages and beliefs (“BeLeave is a movement of young people working to build a bright future for Britain outside the European Union,” read the funding proposal document they submitted). And Grimes’s fear that somehow he would mess up and jeopardise the cause is unmistakable: that it was too much responsibility; that he didn’t feel up to it. Sanni repeatedly tells him, “you should be proud”, and Grimes replies: “I guess it is just worrying soemthing [sic] is gonna fuck up and it’ll be me having to pay thousands back and end up homeless.” We sent Darren Grimes a summary of the evidence we had found. He said any allegations he had done anything wrong were “damaging” and “untrue”. What has amazed me through all this is Sanni. When I met him in August, I didn’t think he’d come forward. I thought there was an outside chance he might leak me emails or documents, but I couldn’t see him going on record. He’s a Leaver: these are his friends and colleagues, they are people he looked up to. “Everyone associated with the campaign knew who Darren was,” he says. “Everybody congratulated us and knew what role we’d played. Michael Gove knew exactly how important we’d been. He’s a close friend of Dom Cummings. Of course he knew. Boris Johnson knew. Everybody knew.” And part of me worried about what would happen if he did go on the record. I worried that Christopher Wylie’s decision to come forward last week might over-influence Sanni. That he’d expose himself to risks he hadn’t properly thought through. That at just 24, he couldn’t really understand the possible consequences. But what I’ve learned about Sanni in the past few months is how tough-minded he is. Coming to terms with the idea that he had been gulled and compromised by the people he respected, for the cause that he loved, has been painful and difficult. It was a process of months. But since he decided to come forward, he’s been determined to do what he has no doubt is the right thing. His messages reveal how protective and supportive he’s been of Darren Grimes. They’re at the heart of his decision. But he has a sense of higher purpose too. “I think I respect British laws more than most British people do,” he says. “I feel I respect this country and love this country more than some people who have been born and bred here. Because I know and I’ve seen… the safety that it’s brought me and my family, my sisters and my mother as a woman, as women that have potential and are now living their best lives.” Sanni doesn’t go into detail about what they went through in Pakistan, but at one point he tells me that he has “had a lot of trauma in my life”. Nobody is making him come forward. And when he talks about his mother and sisters and the freedom they now enjoy, the hairs rise on the back of my neck. And then he tells me about queueing. It starts as a riff, but then it becomes a speech. A mission statement. “This is the one country where no matter what is happening, people will stand in a line. People here, there is a core ethos of what it means to be British: to do it right. To wait your turn. To never cheat or lie your way to get to the front. It’s what it means to be British.” Sanni would still vote Leave. He just wants to do it properly. “We don’t cheat,” he says. “We’re British.” What will you do on Monday, I ask him. He still works for the TaxPayers’ Alliance, co-founded by Matthew Elliott, Vote Leave’s CEO. He has no other form of income. He shrugs. “Go to work, I suppose. Wait and see what happens.” Like us all. • 13 July 2018: After we received notification from Victoria Woodcock, we clarified this article to make clear what Ms Woodcock had told us, namely that although her name appeared as the administrator for a shared Google drive, her permissions had been removed and she was not the individual responsible for the removal of permissions for herself and others from the shared Google drive.

Yet only a few of these mighty residential developments near the British Museum still show traces of the luxuriant, leafy gardens once at their centres. Wartime bombing and the pressures of commerce have taken their toll. Chief among the survivors is the garden of Russell Square, a large public space with circular walkways and criss-crossing, meandering paths that was restored to its original shape in 2002. It stands as the crowning urban legacy of the Suffolk-born designer now widely regarded as a visionary: the 18th-century landscape gardener Humphry Repton, who died 200 years ago this weekend and is being celebrated in a new exhibition at Woburn Abbey, Bedfordshire. “Russell Square is my favourite London square, as it’s the most generous in size and scale,” said Matthew Hirst, who curated the exhibition at Woburn which examines Repton’s aesthetic and puts several of his most innovative designs on display for the first time. “It is a sensitive piece of landscaping, with the statue of the Duke of Bedford on the edge of the square in a little apse, where it can be seen. He also cleverly creates a line of sight down to the statue at the top of Bedford Place.” Fans of the country houses and stately homes of England will associate Repton’s name with rolling acreage and endless vistas. And it is true many of the 400 commissions he took during a 30-year career were to design the land around aristocratic family seats, including grounds at Betchworth House in Surrey, Longleat, Brighton’s Royal Pavilion, Tatton Park and at Woburn Abbey. But Repton also brought green flashes into the heart of the city. In fact his influence is behind the ordered lawns and flower beds now emblematic of the capital around the world. “Repton brought nature into the city. He wanted order in a layout, but he wanted variety within that sense of order, or he felt it would be boring. He wanted to allow people to spend time as they moved through a square,” said Hirst. Lord John Russell first employed Repton to work on the grounds of his house in Bedfordshire, Hirst explained, before his brother continued development of the Bloomsbury estate, bringing in the same designer. “That area was ripe for development because it was close to the City yet looked straight out on open fields to the north, with views up to the hills of Highgate and Hampstead,” said Hirst. “Repton’s square gardens had areas to sit, with wandering, gravel pathways and areas where children could play. He wanted them to be places for relaxed play. They were tamed versions of the natural world.” Pushing against a romantic trend for faux wilderness, Repton brought back terraces, gravel walks and flower beds with ornamental or themed planting around the house and gave birth to the modern suburban garden. In London a new elite fashion for walking and entertaining in squares was mocked by the press, as Edward Walford noted in 1878 in his book Old And New London, writing: “It is said that the Duchess of Bedford sent out cards to her guests, inviting them to ‘take tea and walk in the fields’; and sarcastic persons remarked, that it was expected that syllabubs would soon be milked in Berkeley Square, around the statue of his Majesty.” Repton was born in 1752, the son of a wealthy Bury St Edmunds tax collector, and was sent to the Netherlands to learn Dutch and prepare for a commercial career. By 1773 he was married and in business in Norwich. But it did not suit him. He travelled to Ireland to work as private secretary to William Windham, Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, and made contacts he could call upon as an “improver of the landscape”. In 1788 the 36-year-old put his skills on the market, aiming to fill the gap left by the death of Lancelot “Capability” Brown five years earlier. Repton became renowned for his “red books”, folios of his drawings. Packed with maps and descriptions, they included a low-tech equivalent of the PowerPoint presentation: watercolours with overlays showing “before” and “after” views. “At Woburn we have the most elaborate of his red books, the biggest and the best, and it is on show for the first time in our exhibition, Humphry Repton: Art &amp; Nature for the Duke of Bedford,” said Hirst. Repton outlined four key principles for good design in his book, Observations on the Theory and Practice of Landscape Gardening. “First, it must display the natural beauties and hide the defects of every situation,” he wrote. “Secondly, it should give the appearance of extent and freedom by carefully disguising or hiding the boundary. Thirdly, it must studiously conceal every interference of art. However expensive by which the natural scenery is improved; making the whole appear the production of nature only; and fourthly, all objects of mere convenience or comfort, if incapable of being made ornamental, or of becoming proper parts of the general scenery, must be removed or concealed.” For Hirst, the distinction with Capability Brown is evident in the way Repton introduced a decorative railing between the house and deer and sheep to “reassure” the aristocracy, where Brown used a sunken barrier, the ha-ha. Towards the end of his life Repton feared his profession would “become extinct”. He died on 24 March 1818, and was buried at Aylsham, Norfolk. Two hundred years later Alan Titchmarsh paid tribute to Repton at the opening of the Woburn exhibition. Repton, he said, had brought back the garden and was one of those in the “beautification business” who saw the potential for improvement. Repton would not disagree. “In every place I was consulted I found that I was gifted with a peculiar facility for seeing almost immediately the way in which it might be improved,” he wrote in his memoir."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"sport/2018/mar/25/bulldogs-walking-on-aflw-sunshine-despite-rain-sodden-ikon-park","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-24T17:00:28Z","webTitle":"Bulldogs walking on AFLW sunshine despite rain-sodden Ikon Park","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/mar/25/bulldogs-walking-on-aflw-sunshine-despite-rain-sodden-ikon-park","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/mar/25/bulldogs-walking-on-aflw-sunshine-despite-rain-sodden-ikon-park","fields":{"headline":"Bulldogs walking on AFLW sunshine despite rain-sodden Ikon Park","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"“I think it’s in our blood,” said Ellie Blackburn, as she stood on the grand final podium, premiership medal draped around her neck. “I can’t hold that cup up alone. KB, get up here.” And so, not for the first time in Bulldogs history, the crestfallen captain obliged, joining her deputy on stage to dually hoist the cup. Katie Brennan, clearly no stranger to Bulldogs folklore, then threw in the now-iconic Bob Murphy gesture, tearing away her polo shirt to reveal red, white and blue guernsey underneath. The parallels with Murphy, however, were superficial alone (no matter the Bulldogs’ ill-fated first appeal, in which their lawyer inexpertly argued that it would be cruel for two Bulldogs captains to miss their teams’ premierships). Brennan, the victim of gendered inequity in the AFL and AFLW’s disciplinary systems, had as recently as Friday looked as though she could lead her side onto the ground given talk of a last-minute supreme court injunction. In the end, however, the captain did as leaders often do: Brennan chose the selfless route, giving up the opportunity to lead her team into the decider, but pursuing justice for women through the Human Rights Commission. “The fight for gender equality is as every bit as important to me as the grand final,” Brennan said in a club statement on Friday. “And the decisions I have made reflect both of those priorities.” After the game, the players insisted Brennan’s case had galvanised the group, who saw her suspension as “yet another challenge”. “We’ve had so many obstacles to overcome this season, and so many injuries,” said ruck Tiarna Ernst. “It felt like just one of those extra things. [But] we had trust in the whole 30, the whole playing group. We knew someone would fill her position. There wasn’t a worry that we couldn’t get the job done.” Bonnie Toogood agreed, but was more effusive when talking of her leader. She pointed to her game-day boots, inscribed with Brennan’s No3. “I put it [No3] on there for when she got injured, but also this week especially,” she said. She [Katie] deserves it just as much as us, and she was playing with us in spirit. I know I was thinking of her playing. She has done so much for women’s footy, this club, and the girls we have. I can say wholeheartedly I played for her. Amongst her jubilant teammates, and eskies filled with beer, Brennan eschewed the polo for a grand final day playing guernsey, graciously greeting those who had come to mingle with the team. Clad in red, white and blue, a fan embraced her, stating solemnly: “You deserved to be there.” “I am here,” was her defiant reply. One by one, fans and media alike cried as Brennan held back tears, respectfully subdued. In the end, the win was as much about Brennan as it wasn’t. No matter her fellow captain and coach’s fitting gesture post-game, the AFL’s crude dismissal of the clear case for gendered discrimination evident in her suspension put a significant dampener on the occasion. For fans of the women’s game – often those most well-versed in feminism – it spoke of a collective fear that the league is being mismanaged in its second season by an organisation that lacks the same passion for AFLW regularly on display from its ardent supporters. In that sense, the fact the final was played at a ground with limited cover – in a rather unfortunate downpour – only added fuel to fire. Many AFLW fans had called for the game to be hosted at Etihad given the superior facilities on offer including, most pertinently, a roof. However, with the game held at amateur Princes Park, thousands queued in torrential rain with forecast thunderstorms and lightning, and rumours the game could be called off. In response, many thousands more stayed away altogether. The end result, a crowd of just 7,083 was a disappointing, if predictable, outcome in the conditions. Ikon Park was clearly ill-equipped for the occasion, the ground floor – including several blocks of women’s toilets – flooding, while Missy Higgins’ pre-game entertainment routine was cancelled without warning, purportedly due to fears the stage would damage the sodden ground. In her place, 17 girls danced in ponchos to a PA system that failed in those areas under cover (where most fans were). Thanks to dark clouds looming overhead, meanwhile, Ikon’s much-maligned floodlights were also called into action. In the media centre, Champion Data statistics went down, while Channel Seven’s graphics also failed. No doubt, with Carlton’s requested injection of cash, the ground has the capacity to become a worthy home of women’s football. As it stands, however, the use of its facilities for a grand final only reinforces AFLW’s second-class citizen status. None of that, nor their beloved captain’s suspension, however, could dampen the victorious Bulldogs’ spirits. After a vigorous rendition of Daughters of the West the team retreated into the locker room, with shouts of “players only!” There, with the door slightly ajar, the players belted out Katrina and the Waves classic Walking on Sunshine as lagers were poured into the newly-minted Western Bulldogs 2018 Cup. By the time they were done, sunshine had poured onto Ikon Park, not a grey cloud in the sky."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/mar/24/tropical-cyclone-nora-queensland-on-alert-for-destructive-winds","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-24T05:00:31Z","webTitle":"Tropical Cyclone Nora: Queensland on alert for destructive winds","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/mar/24/tropical-cyclone-nora-queensland-on-alert-for-destructive-winds","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/mar/24/tropical-cyclone-nora-queensland-on-alert-for-destructive-winds","fields":{"headline":"Tropical Cyclone Nora: Queensland on alert for destructive winds","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Cape York communities are on high alert ahead of Tropical Cyclone Nora, which developed into a category three on Friday night, but weakened slightly on Saturday afternoon. Warnings were in place for all Queensland areas from Karumba to Mapoon, including Weipa and Mornington Island, as it moved southeast at close to 18km/h. On Saturday afternoon the cyclone was affected by dry air coming off the Cape York peninsula as it moved east. It remained a category three but was no longer predicted to intensify to a four. Earlier warnings for the Northern Territory side of the gulf had been cancelled. The storm was already producing winds of 140km/h near its centre and gusts up to 195km/h. However authorities warned winds could pick up and become very destructive – at speeds up to 180km/h – if the core of the cyclone neared the coast. “Coastal residents between Mapoon and the Gilbert River Mouth are specifically warned of the dangerous storm tide as the cyclone approaches or crosses the coast,” the bureau of meteorology said on Saturday afternoon. “The sea is likely to rise steadily up to a level well above the normal tide, with damaging waves and flooding of some low-lying areas close to the shoreline. People living in areas likely to be affected by this flooding should take measures to protect their property as much as possible and be prepared to follow instructions regarding evacuation of the area if advised to do so by the authorities.” Gulf cyclones were more unpredictable, and a coastal crossing of the Cape York Peninsula was possible anywhere south of Weipa on Saturday afternoon or Sunday, the Bureau of Meteorology said. It was expected to move slowly over land from Sunday afternoon. Queensland’s emergency services commissioner, Katarina Carroll, said rapid response teams were being assembled in preparation, including swift-water rescue specialists stationed along the Gulf and up the western coast of the cape. “These crews will have the ability to fly into any area requiring assistance within four hours of being notified and will be self-sustaining for 48 hours,” she said on Friday. An initital flood watch was in place for coastal catchments between Townsville and Cape Tribulation and for the Gulf rivers and Cape York Peninsula. The bureau said recent monsoon activity had “primed” catchment areas for river level rises, and some communities could find themselves cut off. The forecast winds were strong enough to cause roof and structural damage if Nora hit a populated area. No cyclone has crossed the coast in the forecast area since 2001, but the Queensland premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, said she was happy with the preparations. State Emergency Services personnel and extra police had been deployed to remote communities, and Palaszczuk said regional mayors would be updated every three hours. Schools could be closed next week, she said, after a meeting with the disaster management committee on Friday afternoon. This year’s cyclone season has been particularly active. On Saturday, another cyclone, named Iris, formed near the Solomon Islands. Iris was a category one, but was predicted to increase to a category two. Last week, the category two cyclone Marcus hit the city of Darwin, bringing down hundreds of trees and power lines, damaging homes and buildings , and cutting off electricity and water, in the most damaging event in 30 years. Marcus moved across the top of Australia and out to the Indian Ocean where it intensified to an enormous category five storm, with wind gusts up to 325km/h. It was the strongest storm to form in Australian waters in more than a decade. It has since diminished to a category three and is expected to weaken as it approaches the WA coast."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2018/mar/24/philip-kerr-author-of-bernie-gunther-novels-dies-aged-62","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-24T00:24:29Z","webTitle":"Philip Kerr, author of Bernie Gunther novels, dies aged 62","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/mar/24/philip-kerr-author-of-bernie-gunther-novels-dies-aged-62","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/mar/24/philip-kerr-author-of-bernie-gunther-novels-dies-aged-62","fields":{"headline":"Philip Kerr, author of Bernie Gunther novels, dies aged 62","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The Scottish crime writer Philip Kerr, best known as the creator of the fictional detective Bernie Gunther, has died at the age of 62. His death on Friday was confirmed by his publisher. Tributes poured in on social media for the award-winning author who penned a series of historical thrillers set in Germany during the second world war and cold war. The author Ian Rankin tweeted: “Numbed by the news that Philip Kerr has died. His Bernie Gunther novels are extraordinary, a mix of great storytelling and brilliant research, with a believable (a)moral hero.” Kerr, who wrote more than 30 books, including 12 Bernie Gunther novels as well as standalone thrillers and non-fiction, was married to fellow novelist Jane Thynne, with whom he had three children. His wife wrote on Twitter: “RIP beloved Philip Kerr. Creator of the wonderful #BernieGunther. Genius writer and adored father and husband. 1956-2018.” Kerr’s publisher Quercus Books said: “We are very sad to have lost Philip Kerr today, a wonderful man and a great author. We are thinking of @janethynne and all his family, friends and colleagues at this difficult time.” Edinburgh-born Kerr studied law at university before working as a copywriter at a number of advertising agencies including Saatchi &amp; Saatchi. He is said to have spent much of his time in the job researching an idea for a book about a Berlin-based policeman. Following several trips to Germany his first novel, March Violets, was published in 1989 and Bernie Gunther was born. . Kerr went on to trace the career of the tough-talking detective from 1930s Berlin through the horrors of the Third Reich, into the post-war era and to the cold war. He also wrote the Scott Mason novels and a number children’s books under the name P B Kerr including the Children of the Lamp series."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"sport/2018/mar/23/leeds-castleford-super-league-match-report","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-23T22:37:15Z","webTitle":"Castleford resist incredible Leeds comeback to win by single point","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/mar/23/leeds-castleford-super-league-match-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/mar/23/leeds-castleford-super-league-match-report","fields":{"headline":"Castleford resist incredible Leeds comeback to win by single point","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Castleford held on to rebuff a remarkable comeback from the Super League champions, Leeds Rhinos, for their fourth successive victory – with Luke Gale’s 40th-minute drop goal ultimately the difference as the Tigers won the first meeting between the sides since last October’s Grand Final. The most anticipated match of the season to date did not disappoint. Leeds had set an ambitious target of breaking the all-time crowd figure for a regular-season Super League game here, set in 2005 when 24,005 watched Wigan play St Helens at the DW Stadium. While the final figure fell just short of that total, Leeds were able to register their own highest attendance in Super League history, with 23,246 watching the best game of the campaign thus far. Castleford began superbly, scoring 24 unanswered points in a blistering 20-minute spell. They started the scoring when Gale kicked on for his half-back partner, Jamie Ellis, to touch down, and then doubled the lead in incredible fashion when a width-of-the-field play was finished by James Clare – before further tries from Alex Foster and Junior Moors made it 24-0. But how Leeds responded. Their revival was inspired by two players at the opposite ends of their careers: in the pack, the outstanding Jamie Jones-Buchanan produced another all-action 80-minute display, and at full-back off the bench, Jack Walker further enhanced his reputation. The fact that Leeds did not concede another try once Walker had emerged on to the field epitomised the impact he had on their fortunes. The comeback began when the captain, Kallum Watkins, finished magnificently from a towering Richie Myler kick, before a try from Ash Handley further reduced the deficit. Leeds were suddenly on top, but Gale’s drop goal on the hooter, the only point Castleford scored in the final 55 minutes, stretched the lead back out to 15. The Leeds’ cause was not helped when the forward, Brad Singleton, was sent to the sin bin. But even without him the Rhinos clawed back the deficit further when Handley scored his second. Watkins soon followed suit with 10 minutes left, before Ryan Hall reduced the gap to a solitary point with a wonderful finish. Agonisingly, though, Watkins pushed the decisive conversion wide and, somehow, Castleford held on. Elsewhere, a hat-trick from the wing, Tom Lineham, helped Warrington beat Wakefield 32-34, their second consecutive victory in Super League. The Wolves trailed at half-time against a Wakefield side looking for their fifth win in six games, before tries from Mike Cooper and Ben Murdoch-Masila secured victory. Catalans remain bottom of Super League heading into the Easter period following their sixth defeat in seven games. The Dragons were beaten 42-16 at Hull, the Black and Whites scoring seven tries to Catalans’ two as they ran out comfortable winners ahead of the first Hull derby of the season next Friday. St Helens continue to set the pace at the top of the table heading into Easter, following a comfortable 30-6 victory over Hull KR. Wigan remain in second after a comprehensive victory over Huddersfield, who remain in the bottom four."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/mar/24/dont-mock-hapless-brexiters-try-to-change-their-minds","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-24T18:30:09Z","webTitle":"Don’t mock the ‘hapless’ Brexiters – they are still pulling all the strings | Nick Cohen","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/24/dont-mock-hapless-brexiters-try-to-change-their-minds","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/24/dont-mock-hapless-brexiters-try-to-change-their-minds","fields":{"headline":"Don’t mock the ‘hapless’ Brexiters – they are still pulling all the strings","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"It’s easy to laugh at Britain’s unpopular populists. Ukip is dead. Farage has been reduced to being a minor radio personality in Britain and a down-the-bill warm-up act in Trump country. As for the supposedly serious Brexiters, the Observer’s revelations will surely discredit the Vote Leave crew, assuming they have any credit left to diss, that is. Look at them. They can’t even organise a mindless publicity stunt. They were to throw fish in the Thames – haddock, if you must know – to protest about EU fishing quotas remaining until 2021. Alas, the trawler could not moor. Jacob Rees-Mogg was left stranded on the bank, not by Brussels bureaucrats but good old British red, white and blue tape, which mandates that you must have a Transport for London permit to pull in at Westminster pier. As futile was the Tory right’s follow-up threat to crash the economy by scuppering the transition deal if Britain does not get control of its territorial waters in 2019. Because of the Brexit referendum, and for the first time in British history, we have a prime minister, chancellor of the exchequer, home secretary, half of the government benches and nearly all the opposition benches following a policy they believe is against the national interest. They will not make further concessions to the Tory right that has forced them to betray their conscience and country. As I said, it’s easy to laugh. A little too easy. Nigel Farage remains the most significant politician since Margaret Thatcher. If it wasn’t for him, we would still be in the EU. As for Ukip and the Tory right, they only seem insignificant because they have forced the PM to give them virtually everything they want. Their sidelining may turn out to be a clever strategic move. They will be able to cry “stab in the back” and “Brexit betrayed” because Theresa May will be responsible for the decline they brought to Britain. If only, the right will say, the perfidious establishment had not compromised we would have had a Brexit filled with hope and glory. Matthew Goodwin and Rob Ford, who pioneered the research into the new right, tell me they are not writing its obituary yet. Trump and Orbán control the US and Hungary. So weak are liberal forces, it is counted a victory when the National Front wins only 33.9% of the vote in the French presidential election. There’s no reason to believe in British exceptionalism. Given a charismatic leader either inside or outside the Tory party, the right will clamber out of its shallow grave to blame everyone else for the consequences of its dogmatism. For even the most blinkered must be realising that Brexit is looking absurd. Until 2021 there will still be free movement with the EU, Britain will have to accept the judgments of the European court and implement EU laws, the only difference being we will have no say in the laws’ content. Even after the transition period is over, exporters will still meet EU standards because they will want to trade with the continent, and farmers and the protesting fishermen will have to cut a deal if they want to sell their produce. As for immigration, business and the public sector will tell the government that every enterprise from care homes to restaurant chains will collapse if it closes the borders. I don’t want to lay the flattery on with a trowel but Jacob Rees-Mogg isn’t always the drivel-spouting dullard he appears. When he says Britain risks becoming a “vassal state” of the EU after 2019 he’s right, but he cannot draw the obvious conclusion that we shouldn’t leave. Nor can millions of others because of a failure by progressive opinion to argue respectfully with them. For some, the failure is an act of policy. A faction among Labour MPs and commentators announces they are respecting the voters’ wishes, even though they realise leaving the single market will harm the poorest parts of Britain. (They then stand back as if expecting a round of applause for their bravery.) The rightwing press makes too much of them, but there are undoubtedly also liberals who think supporters of Brexit are just stupid racists, and there is no point arguing with them. In any political battle, you should always ask how far you can compromise without selling your soul. The right cannot be stopped now or in future unless a portion of its supporters are offered reasons to change their minds. Few are forthcoming from the liberal-left. The dominant leftish explanation for working-class support for leave is it was a protest by the people left behind by Thatcherism. As leftists hated Thatcher, this is the worst type of self-indulgent reasoning: the argument that proves you have been right all along. The liberal-left does not try to understand harder reasons behind Brexit and grapple with working-class patriotism, fears about immigration and political correctness, and the yearning for strong government and national security. Perhaps progressives can never assuage these passions without becoming reactionaries themselves, but they could try. If not, there should at least be a campaign to explain to leave voters how they have been deceived. Here we run into an under-discussed problem. Without the support of the official opposition, efforts to hold the right to account will be puny. That Jeremy Corbyn and the British far left are anti-EU has been of the utmost importance. They have not pounded away at the lies the left-behind were fed, and tried to provoke a class that is hugely suspicious of politicians to turn on Farage and Johnson for taking them for fools. Silence can be the most effective form of complicity. Because the Labour leadership stays silent, the Brexit right can revive, regain the trust of the men and women it shamefully misled and win the next battle. •Nick Cohen is an Observer columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/2018/mar/24/canada-arrests-trans-mountain-pipeline-oil","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-24T10:00:21Z","webTitle":"Canada: how a pipeline engineer got arrested in anti-pipeline protests","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/24/canada-arrests-trans-mountain-pipeline-oil","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/mar/24/canada-arrests-trans-mountain-pipeline-oil","fields":{"headline":"Canada: how a pipeline engineer got arrested in anti-pipeline protests","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"One of Romilly Cavanaugh’s first jobs was an environmental engineering position at the Trans Mountain Pipeline, which carries crude and refined oil across western Canada. Two decades later, Cavanaugh was arrested for blocking the entrance of a facility belonging to her former employer, as part of a wider protest against plans to expand a pipeline snaking from Alberta’s oil sands to the Pacific coast. She was one of more than 115 people detained this week in the Canadian province of British Columbia as an indigenous-led protest against the Trans Mountain Expansion project heated up. On Friday two federal MPs – Green party leader Elizabeth May and Kennedy Stewart of the New Democratic party – were arrested after they joined protesters attempting to block construction work related to the expansion. Elsewhere, more than 60 actions unfolded across Canada in a show of solidarity with the protests. Spearheaded by Texas-based Kinder Morgan, the C$7.4bn ($5.7bn) project proposes expanding an existing pipeline to lay nearly 1,000km of new pipeline from Alberta to Vancouver’s coastline. The project, which still needs to obtain numerous local permits and approvals, would nearly triple the flow of Alberta’s landlocked bitumen to the west coast and dramatically increase oil tanker traffic in the Pacific. After Kinder Morgan launched preparatory work this month in Burnaby, near Vancouver, indigenous leaders called on people to raise their voices. “Bold action is needed now,” said Will George, a member of Tsleil-Waututh Nation. “This is the moment to either stand with Indigenous Nations in the fight for a safe climate and clean water, or else watch as Kinder Morgan continues business as usual and destroys any chance for a safe and livable planet.” An estimated 10,000 people heeded the call, marching through the streets of Burnaby two weeks ago. The protests have continued ever since, attracting between 50 and a few hundred protesters each day, from toddlers to octogenarians. Others across Canada have spoken out in support of the project, which would allow Canadian oil to access new global markets. After his government approved the plans in late 2016, Justin Trudeau, Canada’s prime minister, described it as the right decision for Canadians. “Our duty is to permit infrastructure so Canada’s resources get to market in a more environmentally responsible way, creating jobs and a thriving economy,” he said. Cavanaugh – who worked at Trans Mountain from 1991 to 1996 – was surprised to find herself in the spotlight. She said that concerns over climate change, the risk of an oil spill and the several First Nations that have legally challenged federal approval of the project prompted her to turn up at the site on Tuesday and volunteer to join activists blocking the gates of the Kinder Morgan facility. “I lived in fear when I worked for Trans Mountain, because the reality is that no amount of equipment or people is going to change the fact that in the event of a spill, they will be able to recover very little,” she said. “It’s not that the company doesn’t care. They do care. But the reality is, if there’s a spill into a river or the ocean, there’s very little they can do about it.” She acknowledged that things may have changed in the more than two decades since she left. “And I’m sure they have gotten better,” she said. Pointing to concerns about oil spills, particularly those involving diluted bitumen, she added: “But the laws of nature and physics have not changed since the 90s.” She stressed that she was not anti-industry. “But what I’m opposed to is building more fossil fuel infrastructure in the midst of a climate crisis. We need to be scaling back, not moving in this direction,” she said. “It’s like Justin Trudeau is trying to promote Blockbuster video in a time of Netflix. What is he doing?” The belief is what pushed her – at the age of 55 – to be arrested for the first time in her life. “It’s a scary thought,” she said. “I can go to jail, I can have a very stiff fine, I can be sued by Kinder Morgan for what they say is damages to their business.” After vowing to appear in court in June and not block the facility again, she was discharged. On Friday, Cavanaugh returned to the site to protest but stayed away from the gates of her former employer’s facility. “For me it was just important to get out there and take a stand against something that I think is a huge mistake.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"fashion/2018/mar/25/fashion-world-50th-anniversary-paris-student-uprising","type":"article","sectionId":"fashion","sectionName":"Fashion","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-25T00:05:16Z","webTitle":"The social fabric of 1968 … reimagined for the age of the pussyhat","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2018/mar/25/fashion-world-50th-anniversary-paris-student-uprising","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/fashion/2018/mar/25/fashion-world-50th-anniversary-paris-student-uprising","fields":{"headline":"The social fabric of 1968 … reimagined for the age of the pussyhat","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"This May marks half a century since the student protests in Paris, and while those taking to the streets in 1968 might have been more concerned with overthrowing the system, their look is enjoying a moment on the 2018 catwalk. For her autumn/winter show this February, Maria Grazia Chiuri, the creative director of Christian Dior, sent out a collection that was inspired by images of the 1968 protests. It included kilts, slouchy sweaters, patchwork jackets, flat boots and baker-boy hats. Models walked down a catwalk papered with words and phrases including “protest” and “women’s rights are human rights”. Thus the student look made an appearance in the rarified environs of the Musée Rodin. Chiuri is not alone in referencing 1968. Gucci’s advertising campaign Gucci dans les rues – Gucci on the street – released last month, reimagined the protests at the Sorbonne. One image showed well-dressed models scaling the building with banners, another recreated a sit-in. An accompanying video staged a march, complete with signs and chanting, and one model wrote the words “liberté” and “egalité” on the walls of a public bathroom. Of course, these designers are not just referencing the 1968 protesters because their uniform of polo-necks, miniskirts, knee-high boots and cross-body bags play out well in the retro-tinged world of Instagram – political statements are just one way to reach a younger consumer. Those marching in the 60s have counterparts these days in a generation who are increasingly interested in politics and know how to use images to make their point. In Vogue’s February issue, fashion critic Sarah Mower wrote: “In little over a year since Trump’s election, the subversive possibilities of visual communication in clothing have unleashed an astonishing, uplifting, do-it-yourselves level of creativity. The like hasn’t been seen since the marches and protests of the youth uprisings of 1968.” The mismatch between a global luxury brand and the ragtag uniform of students has, of course, also been noticed. “There is no little irony in a company like Dior embracing the accoutrements of the counterculture and the uniform of protest,” said one review of the Dior show, while Adweek concluded that “Gucci’s 60s-inspired student protest ad misses the point about why we’re all mad”. In 2015 Chanel’s catwalk feminist protest was criticised by Natasha Walter, who said Karl Lagerfeld was using the energy of feminism to “flog expensive clothes”. But there is no denying that marches and protests are a part of the cultural conversation again. Celebrities including Rihanna, Amy Schumer and model Adwoa Aboah attended the women’s marches in 2017 and 2018 – and posted about it on Instagram – while Stormzy used the Brits in February to rap about the Grenfell Tower disaster. Slogan T-shirts for sale at Topshop and Forever 21, which were once in-jokes, are now more likely to display the wearer’s political allegiances. Dennis Nothdruft, curator of the T-shirt: Cult-Culture-Subversion exhibition at the Fashion and Textile Museum, looked closely at the history of protest in fashion. He thinks designers are “more interested in making statements, about taking a point of view than they [have been] in years past”, perhaps as a way to appeal to a politically engaged generation. “The current situation in the world has galvanised a whole group,” he says. “The T-shirt remains a great vehicle for making a point. Though, as Katharine Hamnett says, you can wear the T-shirt but you need to take action as well.” But are politically-associated images reworked for fashion just a cynical cash-in? Women’s rights is the issue that has had the most traction in fashion, and it’s an established part of the industry. For spring/summer 2018, Miuccia Prada said the collection was about “suggesting militant women in a very practical way, through clothes”. One of the most notorious protest T-shirts of recent times reads, “We should all be feminists” – a quote from the writer Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie. It was first seen in Chiuri’s collection in 2016. It is also down to Chiuri that the beret – an item associated with radicals ranging from Che Guevara to Angela Davis – is fashionable again. She put it on her catwalk in 2017. Krista Suh is arguably an activist in the lineage of those on the Paris streets in 1968 – though, as a digital native raised in the age of social media, she also knows about the power of fashion as a visual statement. Suh created the Pussyhat Project in late 2016, providing a knitting pattern for the pink knitted hats with cat-like ears on her website. The hats became the accessory of the women’s march in January 2017, worn by millions. “The pussyhat is an example of using our bodies as a form of protest,” she says. Hats like this were then worn by models on the Missoni catwalk the following February, and Suh is positive about the look of protests moving on to the catwalk. “Big fashion houses get criticised for using symbols created by youth movements, but I think these symbols are meant to be used,” she says. “If they choose to use their platform [for] women’s rights, I support that.” Suh’s latest project is “evil-eye gloves”, knitted with eyes on the front or back and designed to be worn on a march organised by the students of the Florida school shooting. “I’m calling on you to help make the sea of eyes a reality,” writes Suh on her website. “To make a statement that enough is enough and gun violence has to stop.” Seeing these tropes on the catwalk rather than high fashion could only help the cause, she says. “High fashion tends to be exclusive but movements need to be inclusive … I don’t think evil-eye gloves or pussyhats on the runway exclude people from [knitting them] themselves,” she says. “If anything, it helps spread the word.” Politics on the catwalk 1971 Yves Saint Laurent showed camo fabric at the height of the Vietnam war. In the same year he underlined his controversial reputation with his 40s collection, harking back to the second world war. 1984 Katharine Hamnett, attending an event at Downing Street, met Margaret Thatcher and opened her coat. Her T-shirt read “58% Don’t Want Pershing”. The PM reportedly squawked like a chicken. 1994 Five naked models, including Naomi Campbell, pledged allegiance to the animal rights organisation Peta with the advert “I’d rather go naked than wear fur”. Anti-fur campaigns are back on today’s agenda. . 2005 The New York brand, Imitation of Christ, 2005, began a show with images of the Iraq war and models wearing military garb. A George W Bush impersonator sat on the front row. 2016 Ashish Gupta, the Delhi-born designer, wore a T-shirt with the word “immigrant” for his bow on the catwalk at London Fashion Week."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/mar/24/guns-teenager-oakland-violence-weapons","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-24T14:09:07Z","webTitle":"I used to be a gun-toting teenager.

It’s a never-ending nightmare. This gun violence is swept under the rug by people afraid of a world without guns. They forget what it was like before they had access to one. If the answer to violence were more violence, things would be better by now. But they’re not. As a teenager, I watched people fall victim to firearms. Sometimes these gun deaths were self-inflicted. Other times they were caused by someone else. The common denominator was the ready access to these weapons of mass destruction they call guns. This year we saw something happen in the world that hasn’t happened in a very long time: the youth fought back. They stood up and said: “Enough is enough.” Nobody has the desire to be another face on a T-shirt. Nobody has the desire to be another RIP. Nobody has the desire to leave behind family, memories, significant others, and their futures. Yet because of gun violence we have that fear going to school, work, airports, vacations, and being on the road. Gun violence isn’t only in schools, or street corners, or even the mall. It’s on the freeway when you change a lane, RIP Bianca Roberson. It’s in the neighborhood when you wear the wrong hoodie on the way home from the store, RIP Trayvon Martin. Its standing in your grandma’s backyard at night, RIP Stephon Clark. You can be anywhere and at any time someone could walk in, unannounced, and take your life. Even the police. I wasn’t always opposed to guns. In fact, I was raised to think that the only way I could protect myself was to have one. I remember how easy it was in my neighborhood to obtain one. I remember holding the steel in my hand and tucking it in my pants. I remember how my attitude changed, how easy it was to just think about pulling it out and just shooting. Having a gun did something to me. Lucky for me there were programs at my school that took me from being a fear-induced, gun-toting, trigger-happy teenager to a passionate peer educator with a mission to help kids like me with a rough upbringing. I want to make sure they aren’t swallowed by society’s expectations of what to expect from someone from my neighborhood. I learned from that program that violence comes and goes in a full circle. The only way to end that circle is to step out of it and teach others the same. Gun policy, like technology, needs to advance with the times. It needs revising every year to keep up with current life situations. As a country, a state, as human beings we need to realize that just because something is written doesn’t mean it won’t need changing. The only way to fix anything is to first realize it’s broken, and then accept that and change it. That starts with the youth, the adults and the lawmakers.

The 30-year-old forward, whose international career looked to have tapered off last year when he was left out of a largely reserve squad for the summer Tests against Tonga and Samoa, excelled in the opening rounds of the championship but after sitting out the penultimate match against Italy, when Wales made 10 changes, he made only the bench six days later. As befits a former opening bowler – he took the new ball for England at Under-19 level – used to sending down bouncers, he asked the Wales head coach, Warren Gatland, why he had been dropped. “I felt I had done enough to keep the shirt and I was very disappointed not to start against France,” says Shingler, who came off the bench in the second half. “I had a word with Warren: you have to ask him what is going on. He said I was unlucky. I have to keep putting him under pressure to pick me and fulfil my goal of playing in a World Cup.” Shingler will not fade into relative obscurity now the Six Nations is over, as regional players have often done this decade with European campaigns tending to end at the group stage: it is nine years since Wales supplied a semi-finalist in the European Cup and the Scarlets have not reached that stage since 2007, when Shingler was still trying to make it with Glamorgan. “It is the first time in my career that I have been involved in two competitions at this stage of the season,” says Shingler, who helped the Scarlets win what was the Pro 12 last season, routing Munster in the final at the Aviva Stadium after defeating Leinster with a flourish in the semi-final in Dublin. “It will not be easy, starting with La Rochelle, who are a massive side that likes to move the ball, but we are a difficult team to beat and it is not often in your career that you have the chance of a double.” The Scarlets finished last season playing like rugby’s version of the Harlem Globetrotters: not even Leinster could live with their perpetual motion, all offloads, angles and support play, but at the beginning of the campaign they struggled to adapt to the new system brought in by their coaches, the New Zealander Wayne Pivac and the former Wales outside-half Stephen Jones. “We lost the first five matches,” says Shingler. “The pattern was totally different from anything I had experienced before. A lot of hard work went into the detail of what we wanted to do. The basic message was to play like the All Blacks, running from anywhere, counter-attacking and offloading. We had the players to do it and with the way defences are these days, you have to take a few risks. We constantly work on skills so that they are a habit under pressure and come naturally.” Wales, missing a host of their Lions, started with 10 Scarlets against Scotland in the Six Nations and were rewarded with their first try bonus point in the tournament after missing out in 2017. “It takes longer for a new style to evolve with a national side because the players are not together for as long but we showed in the last couple of months that it is coming out,” says Shingler. “We are building towards the World Cup and it is about peaking at the right time.” A year ago the World Cup was a distant dream for Shingler, who was first capped in 2011. Wales played a power game then, which did not suit the athletic, running and handling back-row, but the progression to a style similar to the Scarlets helped resurrect his international career. “Twelve months ago I was nowhere to be seen. Now I am asking questions when I am not starting,” he says. “I think I showed what I was about in the Six Nations. What struck me about the tournament was how matches sway on one-off moments: towards the end of the England game I made a break and then kicked ahead because I did not see anyone around me. Owen Farrell got back and just held on to the ball. I wish I had kicked it a bit harder because I felt I had the pace on him. Games are so tight, coming down to a pass here or a disallowed try there. Other than in Rome, there are not many away victories.” Shingler still wonders how his career would have turned out had he remained a cricketer. “It is a tough sport mentally,” he says. “If you are not playing well in rugby, you can get physical and play simply, running and tackling hard. Cricket is more technical and a harder sport to make it in. Looking back, I tried too hard, practising every day of the year and trying to model myself on other bowlers. Knowing what I know now, I would be smarter with my training and be my own bowler. “Rugby was the right decision for me as this week shows. The Six Nations is followed by a big European game. It is hard to put into words what making the semi-final would mean for me. You do not know when you will get the opportunity again. It is about getting the detail right and nailing it on the day. We lost our first two matches in the group and needed two tries in the last three minutes of the third. I thought we had had it, but as well as being able to play when it is on, this side has character. Physically and mentally, we are where we need to be.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/mar/23/former-cambridge-analytica-executive-brittany-kaiser-wants-to-stop-lies","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-23T16:32:55Z","webTitle":"Former Cambridge Analytica exec says she wants lies to stop","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/mar/23/former-cambridge-analytica-executive-brittany-kaiser-wants-to-stop-lies","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/mar/23/former-cambridge-analytica-executive-brittany-kaiser-wants-to-stop-lies","fields":{"headline":"Former Cambridge Analytica exec says she wants lies to stop","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"It was the summer of 2007. Brittany Kaiser was not yet 21, but she was one of a handful of full-time workers in the small digital team for Barack Obama’s presidential campaign, uploading photos of the Illinois senator to something called a Facebook page. At the next desk was another activist who knew a bit about the social media startup. Chris Hughes, 24, had worked with his Harvard roommate Mark Zuckerberg to create Facebook as a tool for students a few years earlier. A decade later, the picture has darkened, as Hughes recently lamented when he complained about the “negative role” Facebook is playing in politics. And Kaiser, who until two weeks ago was a senior employee at Cambridge Analytica, has worked for a company involved in two of the most negative and controversial campaigns in history. Now she wants to make those secrets public, becoming the second former Cambridge Analytica employee to come forward in less than a week. Her motive for doing so is likely to come under scrutiny: this has been a catastrophic week for the firm – and Kaiser was a senior executive. She claims, however, that it is because she wants to stop telling lies. It seems remarkable that an Obama volunteer who studied human rights and voted for Bernie Sanders ended up working for a controversial data analytics company at the centre of a global story about the use of data and dirty tricks. The company’s work on Donald Trump’s election campaign left her feeling “incredibly internally conflicted”, but she insists she was only doing her job; her political views have nothing to do with her decision to reveal secrets about Cambridge Analytica. Asked why she has decided to speak out, Kaiser flares: “Why should we make excuses for these people? Why? I’m so tired of making excuses for old white men. Fucking hell.” She says she believes that Silicon Valley has much to answer for. “There’s a much wider story that I think needs to be told about how people can protect themselves, and their own data.” Her disclosures come almost a week after the Observer revealed new information on how data was acquired from more than 50 million Facebook friends without their consent. Kaiser has less to say on the harvesting of this data in 2014 than she does on other issues, which is corroborated by emails, correspondence and other documents reviewed by the Guardian. Her own journey – from Obama’s campaign to trying to secure business with political parties and corporate interests in Ethiopia, Lithuania, Romania, Nigeria and Zambia; and from Occupy to Trump’s presidential victory party – says much about the bizarre state of politics in the digital era. ********** Facebook was not all Kaiser and Hughes had in common when they met at Obama’s Chicago HQ; they had attended the same prestigious private school in Massachusetts. Now they were among fewer than a dozen Obama activists and volunteers on the “new media” team. Hughes, though, stood apart. He was apparently still able to pull strings at Facebook, which had relocated to California. When the campaign noticed problematic things about the social media site, such as the deluge of racist and abusive material being posted on the senator’s “wall”, Hughes, it seems, could find a solution. On that occasion, Kaiser says, the platform was changed so that campaign workers could pre-approve messages before they appeared. Another leap forward for Obama 2008’s Facebook experiment was their response to the avalanche of “friend” requests tying up campaign resources, with volunteers having to check photos. “We didn’t want a media controversy around Barack Obama being friends with somebody that was naked with an assault rifle,” she says. The solution was a change that meant fans could “follow” Obama’s campaign rather than request a “friend connection”. For the next few years, Kaiser says, her career diverged from US politics: she was a marketing officer for London’s air ambulance, volunteered for human rights groups, lived in Asia and started an inward-investment company in Libya – primarily, she claims, to gain access to the country for human rights work. These opaque foreign adventures appear to have caught the eye of the SCL Group, a British psy-ops company, and its ambitious chief executive, Alexander Nix. Kaiser said she first met Nix at a sushi restaurant with some Mongolian clients. He drilled her as a spy might a source, apparently telling her: “Let me get you drunk and steal your secrets.” That was 2012, the year Obama was re-elected, this time on a much more sophisticated campaign whose backbone was “big data” and Facebook friend networks, using techniques that foreshadowed much of what was to come. Kaiser recalls Nix getting excited when she told him she’d worked for Obama. Kaiser worked for SCL until Cambridge Analytica was formally incorporated. Nix, she says, saw the gap in the market. The Republicans were losing the data race; that was where the opportunities were. The kind of personality questionnaires conducted by the Cambridge psychologist Aleksandr Kogan on Facebook were particularly important, she adds, as they allowed the company’s data scientists to build models connecting data to behavioral traits and build “a very in-depth picture on those individuals”. Kogan paid about 270,000 people to take his personality test. But, Kaiser says, Cambridge Analytica did many similar quizzes – not always on Facebook – and had personality data for more than 2 million Americans. “The bigger a data set that you have, the more polls, the more surveys that you have that people undertake, the more accurate your models are going to be,” she says. “That’s just a fact of data science.” Around mid-2015, Kaiser says, the company knew Facebook was changing its API rules to restrict the data that could be harvested through questionnaires like Kogan’s. This appears to have prompted a last-minute grab for data. In one internal email seen by the Guardian, employees are asked to identify which issues on a list of 500 Facebook “like” items would be most “useful for political modeling or commercial sales”. It is unclear from the email where the data was coming from, but the list is curiously revealing. Cambridge Analytica didn’t want to know who “liked” Eminem, Family Guy, YouTube, The Walking Dead or Mountain Dew. It was, however, interested in Facebook users who “liked” Mitt Romney, Walt Disney World, the US Marine Corps and Coca-Cola. ******** Nigeria was one of Kaiser’s first assignments. Three days ago, in one of a series of extraordinary scoops, the Observer journalist Carole Cadwalladr revealed details about this project, aimed at securing the re-election of the then president, Goodluck Jonathan. He was unaware of Cambridge Analytica’s involvement. Cadwalladr revealed details of a murky operation by suspected Israeli hackers to discredit Johnson’s rival, Muhammadu Buhari, by finding “kompromat” on the Nigerian politician. Asked about this, Kaiser confirms she knew the Israeli contractors. “They were working for the same client that we were working for.” Who was that? “Oil billionaires,” she replies. Kaiser’s story of how the Israelis got their information, however, was worse than computer hacking. “They went to Nigeria, became friends with the people in Buhari’s campaign, and started sitting in meetings in the campaign headquarters,” she says. “They got information by being in there, however you do that. Making friends with people, sitting in high-level meetings, working on their computers.” This, she claims, was being done independently of Cambridge Analytica. Earlier this week there was another scoop, based on undercover footage from C4 News which captured Nix boasting about using “honey traps”, fake news campaigns and operations with ex-spies to swing election campaigns around the world. Kaiser claims she had never heard him make such claims before. “Alexander is known to oversell everything to close the deal.” By 2015, Nix and Kaiser were pitching to increase their market share in the most lucrative market of all: the US presidential campaign. Cambridge Analytica had already worked for several 2014 midterm candidates, Super Pacs and foundations. Consultants usually limit themselves to one presidential campaign, but Cambridge Analytica ended up working for two Republican primary candidates: Ted Cruz and Ben Carson. Prior to that, Kaiser says, the company also made unsuccessful bids for business with Carly Fiorina, Scott Walker, Marco Rubio and Chris Christie. That same year, a former Florida governor with a famous name who many suspected would secure the nomination also visited Cambridge Analytica’s London office. Kaiser says she never met Jeb Bush, but that according to Nix, the Republican political scion wanted the firm to join his future campaign for the White House. She claims Nix always saw political campaigning as a springboard to a bigger mission. “To become a famous advertising company in the US market; that’s what he planned from the beginning,” she says. “Alexander Nix has no interest in the Republicans or Democrats winning or losing.” That does not seem to tally with the ideological zeal driving Cambridge Analytica’s patrons, the Republican billionaire Robert Mercer and his daughter Rebekah, who later bankrolled Trump’s campaign. They worked closely with Steve Bannon, whose townhouse on Capitol Hill – an office for Breitbart, and a nerve-centre for his political operations – has become something of a legend in Washington. “Yes, ‘The Embassy’,” Kaiser recalls, adding: “I used to actually share a key with Alexander to that house.” It was not until mid-2016 that Cambridge Analytica finally got the biggest ticket in Beltway politics: a contract with the presidential campaign. It immediately sent a team of data scientists and political strategists to San Antonio, Texas, where the digital campaign was being run. Others went to the headquarters in Trump Towers, New York. Questions have been asked about the legality of a London-based company, with a largely British staff, working on the campaign. Kaiser cannot answer them definitively. What she does know is where Nix was on the night Trump was elected, because she was there too: at the Republicans’ victory party in New York, standing next to the Mercers. In her pocket, Kaiser says, she also had a ticket to Hillary Clinton’s election night party. But when the TV screens “started going red state, red state, red state” before declaring Trump the victor, she knew she didn’t need it. Kaiser says she turned to the Mercers, who were not watching the screen, and relayed the news. “You could just see them looking at each other, like: ‘Holy shit … we just became the most powerful people in politics’.” According to her account, Nix told her: “We did it.” Kaiser says she felt conflicted about Trump’s victory, and still does. Her testimony, relayed to the Guardian in recent days in a variety of Silicon Valley locations, raises many questions – about what she says now, and what she did for the company. It will not be easy for Kaiser to put her past behind her. “Corporations like Google, Facebook, Amazon, all of these large companies, are making tens or hundreds of billions of dollars off of monetising people’s data,” Kaiser says. “I’ve been telling companies and governments for years that data is probably your most valuable asset. Individuals should be able to monetise their own data – that’s their own human value – not to be exploited.” Asked if she has any regrets, Kaiser says she does. “To be honest, I regret not spending all those years only working for causes I believed in, and instead just learning about how to achieve an end – how to get a result. I really know how to get a result now – and I can do it for anybody.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/mar/24/ten-underrated-premier-league-players","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-24T12:00:01Z","webTitle":"From Luke Shaw to Marc Albrighton: 10 underrated Premier League players | Nick Miller","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/mar/24/ten-underrated-premier-league-players","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/mar/24/ten-underrated-premier-league-players","fields":{"headline":"From Luke Shaw to Marc Albrighton: 10 underrated Premier League players","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Marc Albrighton (Leicester City) At various points during their title-winning season, praise was shared around the Leicester side. Jamie Vardy, N’Golo Kanté and Riyad Mahrez were the obvious ones, Wes Morgan, Danny Drinkwater and Kasper Schmeichel got their plaudits too, but Marc Albrighton went under the radar. And so he still does, despite his game improving further since then. What is particularly impressive about Albrighton, aside from his tireless work rate and fizzing delivery from the flanks, is that his performance levels do not seem to drop whether he is playing on the right or left, wing or wing-back, or wherever he’s asked to play. Ben Davies (Tottenham Hotspur) By now, none of Tottenham’s attacking players can qualify as underrated. At various points they have all been proudly lauded by Mauricio Pochettino as among the best in the world, in most cases quite correctly. Ben Davies is a slightly different matter, not least because most of the discussion around their left-back/wing-back slot concentrates on Danny Rose no longer being in the team. But Pochettino would not keep Rose on the bench just to make a point: he is able to omit Rose because Davies has been so solid this term. He is not the best player in this Spurs side, but he might be the most underrated. Pascal Gross (Brighton) If someone were to sell you a car, a top-of-the-range model that would usually go for £25,000-plus, but they ask for only £3,000, you would gleefully skip away with the vehicular bargain of the year. That is essentially what Brighton did when they bought Pascal Gross from Ingolstadt last summer: while most other clubs were breezily splashing flamboyant fees on players without a second thought, the Seagulls were charged £3m for Gross, the player who had created the most chances in the Bundesliga in the last two seasons. He has been a prolific creator in England too, so do not be surprised if it is Brighton fielding telephone number-length bids next summer. Idrissa Gueye (Everton) After being lauded for his scouting successes at Leicester, things have not gone quite as well for Steve Walsh at Everton. But one of his first signings has turned out nicely: Idrissa Gueye came to England with Aston Villa, not the greatest place to display his talents, but Walsh saw that he was better than he was showing in that spiralling Villa side. Which has proved to be the case at Everton, and he has been a rare consistent constant at the base of their midfield, while all else around him has looked rather less solid. A new four-year contract, signed in February, shows that Everton rate him at least. Ki Sung-yueng (Swansea City) Milan’s interest in a player is no longer quite the stamp of approval it once was, but the suggestion that Gennaro Gattuso’s lot are keen on signing Ki Sung-yueng when his Swansea contract expires in the summer is at least an indication that the South Korean midfielder is handy. Which, of course, is a conclusion you could reach by watching him. An economical passer, Ki is one of those midfielders who keeps the ball moving, is stronger than his skinny frame suggests and was a key man as they escaped relegation last season. If they are to avoid that fate again, he will have to perform in similar fashion. Jamaal Lascelles (Newcastle United) Plenty was made in the last two seasons of Jamaal Lascelles’s maturity, and his willingness to tell senior colleagues some home truths when they needed telling. He was the straight-talker Newcastle needed. But all of that, while clearly admirable, tended to obscure his ability as a defender, and that might be why he is not as highly rated by those beyond Tyneside as he should be. All you really need to do to appreciate his importance to Newcastle is watch them play without him: their usually strong defence (they’ve conceded fewer goals than Arsenal) is greatly reduced without their leader. Ben Mee (Burnley) It was James Tarkowski who got the England call-up, and deservedly so, but those who watch Burnley every week will probably tell you that his central defensive partner has been just as impressive this season. Ben Mee, one of many players discarded by bigger clubs but who have rebuilt their careers under Sean Dyche, probably does not get more attention because he is not an especially attention-grabbing defender. He is the definition of unfussy, the sort of defender who you might not notice is there until he stops an opposition attack by simply being in the right place. Pedro Obiang (West Ham United) This season has been almost exclusively desperate for West Ham, from the owners, manager, most of the players and the stewards asked to stand in the way of marauding protesters. But Pedro Obiang has been one of the few bright spots, sometimes holding the midfield together with his fingertips, particularly standing out in the early days of David Moyes when things were looking a bit more promising. It is probably not a coincidence that West Ham’s form has nosedived since Obiang suffered a knee injury: coping without him for the rest of the season will be a perilous business. Luke Shaw (Manchester United) There are any number of ways to be underrated. Most Premier League players can live with social media indifference, most have to deal with rather more direct feedback during games, and they will struggle on after sniffy media appraisals too. But when your manager does not rate you, and what’s more, seems to take every possible opportunity to publicly show his distaste, that will sting a little. José Mourinho’s problem with Luke Shaw, whatever it is, might be well-founded, but for everyone’s sake it should probably be resolved one way or another soon: this is a player too talented to be lost. Willian (Chelsea) It’s pretty hard to go under the radar in the Premier League, and impossible when you play for Chelsea. Plenty of people rate Willian very highly, not least Antonio Conte who will praise the Brazilian at any given opportunity, while more attention goes to Eden Hazard or N’Golo Kanté. What’s notable about Willian is how he plays when the team around him is underperforming: he was Chelsea’s best player in 2015-16 when they imploded under José Mourinho, and is on his way to being their top man this term as they struggle to grab a Champions League spot."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/2018/mar/23/australian-gp-hamilton-fastest-in-f1-practice-but-rivals-snap-at-his-heels","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-23T11:25:48Z","webTitle":"Australian GP: Hamilton fastest in F1 practice but rivals snap at his heels","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/mar/23/australian-gp-hamilton-fastest-in-f1-practice-but-rivals-snap-at-his-heels","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/mar/23/australian-gp-hamilton-fastest-in-f1-practice-but-rivals-snap-at-his-heels","fields":{"headline":"Australian GP: Hamilton fastest in F1 practice but rivals snap at his heels","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Lewis Hamilton opened his campaign to win a fifth world championship with a strong start in practice for the Australian Grand Prix, offering early confirmation that his Mercedes is once again leading the field. Hamilton was quickest in both sessions on Friday at the Albert Park circuit. In the morning he was more than half a second clear of his team-mate, Valtteri Bottas. The Red Bull of Max Verstappen was third, seven-tenths down on the Briton, with Ferrari’s Sebastian Vettel and Kimi Räikkönen fourth and fifth respectively. In the afternoon, with the teams setting times on the fastest, ultrasoft rubber, the margins were much tighter but Hamilton remained on top. He was just over a tenth quicker than Verstappen, whose form suggests Red Bull’s pre-season testing promise is being borne out. The team’s day was spoiled, however, when a three-place grid penalty was handed to Daniel Ricciardo for driving too quickly under a red flag. Bottas was third with Raikkonen and Vettel fourth and fifth. “It’s been a good day,” said Hamilton. “Coming to the first race you have no idea what it’s going to be like but we started on the right foot here. It closed up in P2 but that is exciting.” He is likely to face a further test with rain predicted for Saturday and Sunday. McLaren suffered some issues and lost time but ultimately put in some solid laps, closing with Fernando Alonso in eighth, however the best of the midfield was the impressive Haas. The Mercedes executive director, Toto Wolff, supported Hamilton’s call for greater diversity in F1, after the Briton posted a video on Instagram on Thursday calling for the sport to encourage a greater range of ethnic backgrounds. “That is one thing that is very important not only for Lewis but for all of us,” Wolff said. “The more diversity we can get into Formula One the better. Whether it is different ethnic backgrounds or girls getting into motor racing, this is what needs to happen.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2018/mar/23/martin-allen-barnet-manager-fifth-spell-league-two","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-23T17:17:00Z","webTitle":"Martin Allen: ‘I’ve been doing pilates.

Now it’s back into the madhouse’","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Martin Allen was enjoying a nice quiet life until last Sunday. “I’ve been playing golf once a week, doing my garden, three classes of pilates, working on radio, being an ambassador at West Ham and helping the Premier League with the referee assessments. “I’ve had such an easy, stress-free, nice quality of life; now all of a sudden it completely changes into a tsunami of telephone calls from agents, reporters, players – it’s non-stop. I have enjoyed it but it’s back into the madhouse.” The madhouse is football management generally but Barnet specifically, where Allen has taken over for a fifth time. Last Sunday the club’s chairman, Tony Kleanthous, called Allen because things were not working out with their third manager of the season, Graham Westley, and they were spiralling towards relegation from the Football League. Rossi Eames and Mark McGhee had also failed to prevent them from slumping into the League Two relegation places, and they are now bottom and seven points shy of safety with eight games remaining. Allen is back to try to rescue the club he has previously managed four times, broadly speaking with success, but usually with the sense he will not be around for long: two of those spells have lasted three games each. The plan is he will not be sticking around this time either: he has agreed an eight-week contract but, after that, who knows? Kleanthous once likened Allen to “the girlfriend you can’t get rid of”, and there is something of the ill-advised marriage about their relationship. The classic case of not being able to live without each other, or indeed with each other: the Liz Taylor and Richard Burton of the Football League, if you like. But while the secret of most successful relationships is clear, honest – honest and frequent communication – the opposite seems to be the case here. “It’s perfect, because I never talk to him,” says Allen, when asked about his bond with Kleanthous. “He just gives me the job and I get on with it. If I ever want anything, I send him a text and nine times out of 10 the answer is no. I know what he is, I know what he’s like, so he doesn’t bother me and I don’t bother him.” This is by Allen’s own admission a “last throw of the dice” by Barnet to try to avoid dropping back into the National League, from where he brought them in 2015. But in December 2016 he unexpectedly left for Eastleigh, who sacked him two months later having won two games in 14. It is safe to say that if any other League Two club approached Allen to be their fourth manager of the season, he would have stuck to radio work and pilates. His motivation for returning is clearly partly emotional. “The only reason I’ve come back is I was the manager when we got promoted – it was such a big thing for the players, supporters and of course the chairman. Now they’re staring at relegation.” But there is also a more prosaic, practical element too: “Because it’s Barnet, I don’t have to move house. I’ve moved all over and disrupted my family life, and unless it was something quite unbelievable I wouldn’t really want to [do that again]. I know a few of the players and I think they’re better than they’re showing now.” Ah yes, the players. One of the first things Allen did was drastically trim the squad, which had somehow ballooned to 43 , once trialists, non-contract players and others were taken into account. “I can’t have that amount in training sessions,” he says. “It was like a scene from Zulu – they were coming from everywhere. It was like: ‘Who are you? Which position do you play?’ I put them all up on the noticeboard and there were about five right-backs, nine centre-backs, five goalkeepers. I thought: ‘I can’t deal with this.’ I had to be pretty ruthless.” Among the myriad concerns Barnet fans may have is Allen’s health: towards the end of his last spell at the club in late 2016, a minor problem with one of the valves in his heart was discovered, and though ultimately he was given the all-clear, it had an impact. “It certainly changed me. Having all the tests and surgeon meetings to see what the hell was up with my heart – that’s scary. I wondered if I wanted to go back in and face up to the challenges as I’m doing now. “Now I’m 110%, got the all-clear. The surgeon said I was in great shape for someone my age – I needed to hear that before coming back to this job. I was chuffed to bits. I went down the street skipping like a schoolboy.” It says something about the addictive nature of management that a man who had recently faced his own mortality and was enjoying a pleasant, quiet life, would return to a side that is bottom of the Football League and, barring an extraordinary turnaround, heading for relegation. But the call came, and Allen could not help himself. That said, it is the classic no-lose situation for Allen: keep them up and he is the hero, if they go down they were going down anyway. His first game is on Saturday, against second-in-the-table Luton. “This is the biggest challenge, there’s no doubt about it,” he says. “This is mission impossible.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"politics/2018/mar/23/labour-condemns-tories-for-racially-charged-attack-on-sadiq-khan","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-23T13:17:02Z","webTitle":"Labour condemns Tories for racially charged attack on Sadiq Khan","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/mar/23/labour-condemns-tories-for-racially-charged-attack-on-sadiq-khan","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/mar/23/labour-condemns-tories-for-racially-charged-attack-on-sadiq-khan","fields":{"headline":"Labour condemns Tories for racially charged attack on Sadiq Khan","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Labour has accused the Conservatives of adopting racially charged “dog-whistle” politics after a local election leaflet warned that the influence of Sadiq Khan, the London mayor, could mean suburbs becoming increasingly “inner city”, with the union flag removed from public buildings. The flyer, produced by Conservatives in Havering, on the eastern edge of Greater London, warns that if Labour win in May’s local polls, it would result in “Havering resembling boroughs like Hackney, Newham, Camden and Barking, rather than traditional parts of Essex”. Other warnings on the leaflet, which features the three local Conservative councillors and Andrew Rosindell, the local Tory MP, include the claim that a Labour win would mean “Havering ruled by Mayor Khan”. This would lead Romford, the main centre in Havering to “become increasingly like an inner-city area” with “our cherished union jack flag being taken down – back to Labour’s political correctness”, it said. David Lammy, the Labour MP for Tottenham, called the leaflet “one long dog whistle about race”, saying it marked a return to the controversial tactics used against Khan when he defeated Zac Goldsmith to become mayor in May 2016. Goldsmith was heavily criticised, including by some Conservatives, for repeatedly raising what he said were Khan’s previous links to extreme Muslim figures and for not being sufficiently tough on Islamist terrorism. Andrew Boff, a senior London Conservative, said Goldsmith’s tactics, which were supported by David Cameron, then the prime minister, and his ministers, had “done real damage” to community relations. Lammy said: “This is a really nasty leaflet from the Tory party in London and a return to the deeply divisive politics that failed so spectacularly during the 2016 mayoral campaign. “You don’t have to be a genius to realise this leaflet is one long dog whistle about race and the diversity that the vast majority of Londoners are so proud of. The Tory party clearly haven’t changed. Theresa May should condemn this leaflet and apologise to all Londoners immediately.” Rosindell has raised culture-based arguments before. Writing in his local newspaper at the end of last year, he described Havering as “a borough that upholds our traditions in celebrating St George’s day, armed forces day and proudly flies the union jack from our town hall 365 days of the year”. He added: “The choice for the people of Havering in next year’s town hall elections is whether we want to keep what we have and retain the special character of Havering or allow ourselves to become just another lump of Sadiq Khan’s inner London.” Rosindell said he rejected the idea of any bias, saying the leaflet did not mention race and was only seeking to raise awareness of high-density building projects that could take place under a Labour-run council. “Havering is a very happy community with almost no racial tensions,” he said. “If Labour are attempting to deliberately misinterpret campaigns against the mayor’s policies on closing police stations and high-density building as a race issue then they should be ashamed in doing so.“Havering is not inner London and his policies should reflect the needs of outer London areas too, but he neglects areas like Havering.” Other Labour MPs have been angered by the approach adopted by some Conservatives towards Khan. Earlier this month, Nadine Dorries, the Conservative MP, quoted a tweet by the mayor calling for action on hate speech, saying: “How about, ‘it’s time to act on sex abusing grooming gangs,’ instead?” adding tags related to the abuse scandals in Telford and Rotherham. This prompted Wes Streeting, the Labour MP for Ilford North, to accuse Dorries of expressing “thinly veiled prejudice”. Late last year, Conservative councillors in another outer London borough, Barnet, discussed a motion describing Khan as “an enemy of the people of Barnet”. Arjun Mittra, a Labour member of the council, condemned the term as “deeply historically loaded” and reminiscent of Goldsmith’s campaign."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/mar/23/rhino-death-rotten-kipper-farage-national-humiliation-brexit","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-23T13:51:45Z","webTitle":"Digested week: a rhino, a rotten kipper and a 'national humiliation'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/mar/23/rhino-death-rotten-kipper-farage-national-humiliation-brexit","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/mar/23/rhino-death-rotten-kipper-farage-national-humiliation-brexit","fields":{"headline":"Digested week: a rhino, a rotten kipper and a 'national humiliation'","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Monday One of the best family holidays we ever had was on a game reserve in South Africa about 10 years ago. Back then it was normally tricky to get the kids out of bed much before 11, but there were no moans about getting up at six every morning to go on an escorted drive to watch the animals. There was something so magical about being in the presence of such natural beauty. The highlight was coming across three rhinos among a clump of trees. Our jeep crept up to within about 20 metres and we all sat in silence for the best part of an hour, overcome with wonder. So the death of Sudan, the last male northern white rhino, felt more personal than it otherwise might have done. The loss of something precious. I asked the zoologist and author of the totally fabulous book The Unexpected Truth about Animals, Lucy Cooke, whether we should try to save the species through IVF. She said no. Humans should take personal and political responsibility for their own destruction and that our efforts would be better spent trying to save existing species rather than encouraging the belief science was so advanced that there need be no consequences to our actions. I think I agree. Tuesday Not so long ago, I almost got knocked over by an electric car. If I had, it would have been entirely my own fault because I hadn’t been paying enough attention as I had started to cross the road without looking properly. Rather I had been using my ears. And having not heard the sound of any traffic, had imagined it was safe. Luckily, the driver of the car was rather more alert than me and honked and braked. This week a woman in Arizona was not so fortunate, becoming the first person to be killed by a driverless car. Which opens up a whole new legal minefield of responsibility. Are we to assume that a driverless car is infallible and that any accidents are invariably the fault of the third party? Or will some computer programmer be held culpable for an error in the car’s software? And what is the protocol if one driverless car happens to hit another driverless car? Not the greenest solution I know, but I’d be inclined to give the benefit of the doubt to whichever car had the loudest engine. Wednesday The protest against the government backtracking on its promise to take Britain out of the common fisheries policy was every bit as chaotic as a sketch writer could have wished. First the 10-metre trawler that had motored up the Thames to meet Jacob Rees-Mogg and a couple of other Tory MPs for some fish-throwing activity was told it couldn’t stop at Embankment Pier for the press conference as no one had thought to apply for a landing permit. So it was left to potter round in circles in the middle of the Thames while Rees-Mogg blessed the occasion from afar. Something he seemed to be quite relieved about. Then the boat headed for Westminster Pier for an illegal stop to pick up Nigel Farage, who was more than happy to hijack the event to get himself some TV coverage by chucking some fish overboard outside parliament to the bemusement of a small crowd of onlookers. And the EU. Farage’s claims to be the champion of the British fishing fleet would have more credibility if he had done more to further their cause in the European parliament. As a member of the EU fisheries committee he only turned up to one out of a possible 42 meetings. Thursday Bill Giles, the weather forecaster who was last seen gesticulating on TV in 2000, complains in the latest edition of the Radio Times that the new look BBC weather forecast – the Met Office has been abandoned in favour of MeteoGroup – is a complete waste of space and that people would be better off watching Channel 5. Bill has numerous gripes. He doesn’t like the fact that cold temperatures are now underlined in blue. He finds it too hard to distinguish between a cloud and the sun. Most criminally of all, the new map shows far too much of mainland Europe, making the UK appear smaller and his home town of Southampton almost impossible to find. I can’t say I share any of Bill’s concerns. The cloudy bits are the bits with clouds and the sunny bits are the bits with sun. And Southampton is where it’s always been: on the north side of the Solent opposite the Isle of Wight. And if Bill is still struggling then he can always tune into the local weather reports that generally precede the national one. Mind you, he would have been in for a surprise if he had watched the forecast for the south-east earlier in the week as the weather map showed Hythe to be under water and Romney Marsh about 20 miles out to sea in the Channel. Put that down to global warming. Friday Brexit shambles, part 173. After getting itself into a tizzy about freeing itself from the yoke of maroon EU passports and replacing them with the more traditional blue UK ones – I’ve always thought my old passports in my desk at home were black – the government has come under fire for awarding the contract to print the new ones to a Franco-Dutch firm rather than to the British company De La Rue. For some, including the former cabinet minister Priti Patel, this was more than a PR disaster. It was a “national humiliation” and UK citizens would never recover from the shame of having to present a passport that wasn’t British through and through at border checks. The whole point of leaving the EU, apparently, was so that Britain could pay £120m over the odds for something it could have got cheaper from mainland Europe. And there was I thinking that Brexit was meant to be about opening up to the world, rather than shutting ourselves off. I will obviously need to re-educate myself. So how about a campaign to send Vermeers and other Dutch masters’ paintings back to Holland? Keep the National Gallery national.

But for his process to pay off, he needs to make a few more groovy signings. The problem is, some of his former clubs, as if fuelled by the bitterness of jilted lovers are out to sabotage him. Internazionale – to whom he gave a Champions League victory, no less – intend to show their gratitude by snapping up Lautaro Martínez, the rising star of Argentinian football whom United have had their eye on for a while. Word is the 20-year-old attacker could leave Racing Club for Italy this summer. And then there is Real Madrid, who are closing in on Lazio’s Sergej Milinkovic-Savic, whom they view as the rightful heir to Luka Modric, even though Mourinho had the Serb pegged for United’s midfield and even fancied that Nemanja Matic might have a word to swing the deal. But it’s not all about knocks and setbacks for Mourinho– because Juventus still want to buy Matteo Darmian, whom they rate above Héctor Bellerín. Mourinho is also considering sending a taxi to bring Jonny Evans back to Old Trafford, as the Northern Irishman has a release cause that enables him to leave the Hawthorns for £3m in the event of West Brom going down. Arsenal want some of that action, too. Mostly though, Arsenal’s sights are focused firmly on the Bundesliga– you’d never guess their new head of recruitment came from Dortmund – and they particularly like the look of the Schalke midfielder Maximilian Meyer, whose contract is close to expiring. Having said that, Arsenal also like the look of Jan Oblak, the Atlético Madrid goalkeeper. He will be available if the Spanish side renew their working relationship with Thibaut Courtois this summer. Lucas Pérez wants to return to Arsenal after a dismal season on loan at Deportivo. Arsenal fans are not believed to be breaking out the bunting in anticipation of that one but hey, at least the lad will have a point to prove. Paris Saint-Germain could be toppled again in France before they ever fulful their Champions League ambitions, if it is true that an Abu Dhabi tycoon is behind a £420m attempt to buy Monaco. Finally, Andrea Pirlo could become Italy’s No 2 if Carlo Ancelotti or Antonio Conte is made the country’s No 1."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"politics/2018/mar/23/we-have-been-hijacked-fishermen-feel-used-over-brexit","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-23T13:31:16Z","webTitle":"'We have been hijacked': fishermen feel used over Brexit","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/mar/23/we-have-been-hijacked-fishermen-feel-used-over-brexit","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/mar/23/we-have-been-hijacked-fishermen-feel-used-over-brexit","fields":{"headline":"'We have been hijacked': fishermen feel used over Brexit","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"On a clear day, the fishermen who dreamed of Brexit can still glimpse their imagined future on the horizon. Just six miles out at sea from ports such as Selsey, in Sussex, they track the progress of larger European vessels whose preferential rights to fish in British waters have long been a source of envy. “It’s sickening to see them from here while we are tied up,” says Tony Delahunty, who finally sold his family boat two weeks ago after 43 years scratching a living along the south coast. His son has gone into landscape gardening, and hopes of keeping others in the industry with the promise of change are receding fast. For Delahunty’s entire career, a lopsided system of quotas has granted up to 84% of the rights to fish some local species, such as English Channel cod, to the French, and left as little as 9% to British boats. Add on a new system that bans fishermen from throwing away unwanted catch and it becomes almost impossible to haul in a net of mixed fish without quickly exhausting more limited quotas of “choke” species such as cod. Leaving the EU was meant to change all that. Slowly recovering fish stocks would still need to be carefully managed, but the British industry became the poster child for those who argued that quotas could be rebalanced and rules drawn up more pragmatically to suit local conditions. The tiny domestic industry was held up as the one unambiguous beneficiary of Brexit, a symbol of everything that “taking back control” would be about. Instead, growing numbers of British fishermen feel they have been part of a bait-and-switch exercise – a shiny lure used to help reel in a gullible public. Despite only recently promising full fisheries independence as soon as Brexit day on 29 March 2019, the UK government this week capitulated to Brussels’ demand for it to remain part of the common fisheries system until at least 2021, when a transition phase is due to end. Industry lobbyists fear that further cave-ins are now inevitable in the long run as the EU insists on continued access to British waters as the price of a wider post-Brexit trade deal. “The perception is we have been hijacked,” says Delahunty. “That’s the anger on the coast. We have been lied to.” With Nigel Farage and Jacob Rees-Mogg already exploiting this sense of betrayal to stage new fish-dumping protests on the Thames, pressure is growing on coastal MPs to vote against the Brexit deal when it goes before parliament in the autumn. Whether this eventually leads to an unholy alliance of leavers and remainers blocking departure entirely is a speculative calculus far beyond the raw emotion prevailing in coastal communities such as Selsey. “If anything, it all just makes people more angry toward the EU,” says Delahunty, who is also local representative of the National Federation of Fishermen’s Organisations (NFFO). “But if your strongest allies are against [the Brexit deal], you have a problem.” For now, the handful of Selsey fishermen out at sea this week are clinging to the belief that things will get better eventually. “Hope has been hard this last week,” says 38-year-old John Reeves, as he hauls in a lunchtime catch of shellfish after a day that started at 4am. “You listen to them but you can’t trust them. You will see guys that do lose faith, and that would be sad.” Michael Harvey, a new dad following his own father into the industry, agrees: “It’s hard work where you can make a good living if you are sensible with your money. But sometimes it’s hard to see a future.” The problem is complicated by the fact that much of what these men catch is exported back to Europe. With fish quota hard to come by, inshore fishermen here have increasingly turned to crab, lobster and whelk to make ends meet and 85% of the total shellfish haul is exported. The majority goes to France and Spain, with cuttlefish going to Italy and a roaring trade in whelks to South Korea. From the 90 lobster pots and 300 whelk pots that Harvey has laboriously hauled to the surface that morning, some of the catch will get to London but the rest is either too expensive or out of step with local taste to find a British market. “I don’t eat them,” admits his brother Chris as they pick over a bucket of whelks, which are said to taste of rubber if you don’t cook them right. With lobsters fetching a tenner each on the quayside and up to £50-£60 by the time they reach London restaurants, Chris says he prefers a steak if he wants to treat the family. This makes walking away from the EU without a deal for ongoing access to its consumer markets another worry for what is left of the British industry. Some would still like to see UK fishing cut loose regardless. A rebalancing of British consumer tastes away from imported white fish and toward shellfish and other locally-caught produce could yet see this cottage industry grow into an artisanal success story. But for now, fisheries leaders are gloomy. An extended spell in Brexit purgatory agreed by political leaders means even less say over EU policy in the short term. After that, the country faces the threat of losing not just its market for fish, but much else besides, if it does not bow to demand for continued access rights. “It’s what we always feared,” says Barrie Deas, NFFO chief executive. “When you get to the endgame in the negotiations it becomes a binary choice and economics prevail over the politics. I think that’s what’s happened and it’s really not good news.” “We are in an asymmetrical and exploitative relationship with the EU,” he adds. “We want out of it and they want it to continue. It’s not difficult to see why. The danger is a very brutal endgame in which the trade deal is made contingent on sacrificing fishing.” For the industry this would be a repeat of history. After the British long-distance fishing fleet lost its access to waters around Iceland during the so-called cod wars, there was little inshore activity to replace it because the nation had grown used to plentiful white fish from the cold seas to the north. This meant that when the government belatedly negotiated European membership in 1973, much of the inshore quota rights in British waters went to French, Dutch, Belgian and Danish fishermen. Today, the Scottish Fisherman’s Association estimates EU vessels still land 10 times more fish from UK waters than the other way around, including 16 times more mackerel, 173 times more herring and 14 times more haddock and cod. In the view of some industry leaders such as Deas, these lopsided access arrangements amount to an exploitation of Britain’s political weakness when it joined the EEC that is still being played out today. “If the UK was in west Africa, it would be considered to be a neocolonial relationship,” he says. But the continuing power imbalance is as much a result of Britain’s co-dependence on the EU for access to its markets – for fish, cars, financial services and much else besides. Back in Selsey, industry representatives such as Delahunty with most experience of EU negotiations point out that shared management of fish stocks will always be necessary because shoals swim across national waters. Away from the anger on the quayside, he quietly admits to having voted remain in the Brexit referendum because he could he see the promise of taking back control was not as simple as it appeared. “It was mis-sold,” he confides."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/live/2018/mar/24/sportwatch-f1-qualifying-nrl-afl-a-league-and-more-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-24T11:06:03Z","webTitle":"Sportwatch: wins for Melbourne City, Rabbitohs, Sydney FC and Hawthorn","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2018/mar/24/sportwatch-f1-qualifying-nrl-afl-a-league-and-more-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/live/2018/mar/24/sportwatch-f1-qualifying-nrl-afl-a-league-and-more-live","fields":{"headline":"Sportwatch: wins for Melbourne City, Rabbitohs, Sydney FC and Hawthorn","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Hawthorn get their season off to a flying start with a strong victory over Collingwood. Hawthorn 15.11 (101) - 9.13 (67) Melbourne City, at least overnight, move ahead of Melbourne Victory to third on the A-League ladder. The loss for the Wanderers means their hold on sixth is now looking precarious, with both Brisbane Roar and Perth Glory just two points behind them and neither side has yet played this round. Roar are away to Wellington Phoenix on Sunday, while Perth host Victory, also on Sunday. The travelling Wanderers are doing their 80th minute backwards bouncing* thing. And well they might continue. Not much for them to enjoy on the pitch, unless they want to marvel at how the seagulls love their football in Melbourne. *Yes, I know it’s called the Poznan. Final score and updates: NRL: Eels 4 - 14 Sharks – final score A-League: Melbourne City 3 - 0 Western Sydney Wanderers – 20 minutes to go AFL: Hawthorn 11.8 (74) - 7.6 (48) Collingwood – third quarter Some score updates: A-League: Melbourne City 2 - 0 Western Sydney Wanderers NRL: Eels 4 - 14 Sharks AFL: Hawthorn 11.8 (74) - 7.5 (47) Collingwood The NRL game between the Eels and the Sharks has just over 20 minutes to go and the Sharks are leading 12-4. And an A-League half-time score: Melbourne City 1-0 Western Sydney Wanderers. Time for a half-time AFL score: Gold Coast 5.6 (36) - 1.6 (12) North Melbourne. And this REM cover might be just how the Brisbane Lions feel tonight. Sleepy. St Kilda’s win over the Lions has put me in mind of my favourite saints – the Saints, from Brisbane, oh the irony. Let’s shoot the professor, alright A half-time score from the NRL: Cronulla 12-4 Parramatta. A match-winning performance from Jack Steven has helped St Kilda to survive a major scare from AFL upstarts Brisbane, downing the Lions by 25 points at Etihad Stadium. The lacklustre Saints went to sleep in the third quarter, giving up three straight goals and the lead before Steven stepped up to secure a 16.11 (107) to 12.10 (82) victory. Brisbane looked to be on the verge of a famous opening-round victory when Tom Bell, No 1 draft pick Cameron Rayner and star recruit Charlie Cameron hit the scoreboard in quick succession. But Steven booted two goals in two minutes on the stroke of three-quarter time to snatch back momentum and the lead for the Saints, who ran away with the game in the final term. Steven finished with 34 disposals, reigning best and fairest Seb Ross was exceptional with his playmaking and Jade Gresham and Josh Bruce each slotted three majors. “I thought the guys showed a lot of character,” coach Alan Richardson said. “The Lions probably got the better of us at the clearances. I thought our outside footy was really positive.” Rookie halfback Adam Doueihi has guided South Sydney to their first win of the NRL season with a 34-6 upset of Manly in the wet at ANZ Stadium. In just his second game of first grade, the 19-year-old played a deft hand in difficult conditions to ignite his side’s season. The Souths wingers led the attack with Robert Jennings getting a hat-trick and Richard Kennar crossing for a double. The Sea Eagles came back to earth with a thud following their 54-0 defeat of Parramatta last Sunday as they failed to adapt to the conditions and continually turned over the ball while on the attack. An added time Matt Simon header has lifted Sydney FC to a 2-1 win over Central Coast and within one point of a second-successive A-League Premiers’ Plate. Sydney went ahead via Milos Ninkovic’s first-half header but were pegged back level by Jake McGing eight minutes from time in Gosford. It looked like Sydney would have to settle for one point, but substitute striker Simon executed a dramatic dive to head home Paulo Retre’s deflected cross in the 93rd minute, ensuring Graham Arnold’s side go eight points clear at the top with three rounds remaining before the finals. Port Adelaide’s high-profile recruits fired on all cylinders in a 50-point victory against Fremantle. New teammates Jack Watts, Steven Motlop and Tom Rockliff all scored early in their Port debut in an emphatic 16.14 (110) to 9.6 (60) win. Power forward Todd Marshall kicked four goals with Watts booting three, and Motlop and Chad Wingard scored two each at Adelaide Oval. The oft-maligned Watts (20 disposals, seven marks) snapped the first goal of the game and was instantly adopted by Port’s 38,324-strong crowd. Three minutes later, ex-Cat Motlop (19 touches) sped away to convert a rousing goal on the run. Five-gamer Riley Bonner (31 touches) and captain Travis Boak were outstanding but Freo rallied with three late goals to sneak within 21-points at half-time. The Dockers never got that close again as Marshall highlighted his fourth AFL game with four second-half goals, ensuring the visitors were left in Port’s dust. Sydney FC have one hand on the premiership! They were not the best team, and they had to win ugly, but win they did. They have beaten the Mariners 2-1. Matt Simon scores again, and this time it’s allowed. The super sub saves Sydney! Matt Simon gets the ball into the net for Sydney, but it’s disallowed as he bundled the Mariners’ keeper Ben Kennedy into the net too. That was never going to stand. Another NRL full-time score: South Sydney 34-6 Manly The Mariners have just equalised with a goal from Jake McGing after Andrew Hoole missed a glorious chance a minute earlier. Sydney’s poor form continues, but, from their perspective, at least Newcastle lost to Adelaide last night. About seven minutes to go. To the A-League now. There are 10 minutes to go on the NSW central coast and the Marines are trailing Sydney FC 0-1. A fine win for Port over the Dockers. Port Adelaide 110-60 Fremantle Dockers Back to the NRL and we are hearing Canberra coach Ricky Stuart is fuming after the Raiders loss today. Stuart has taken aim at Todd Greenberg and says he is awaiting a call from the NRL chief to clarify the obstruction rule. He believes the Raiders have been robbed of two victories this season over a misinterpretation of the ruling. Stuart says he’s “never seen the game in such a state of affairs” after his side lost a third game of the season by a combined total of five points. All this talk of Grand Prix puts me in mind of Teenage Fanclub’s sublime record of the same name. The best song on it, and indeed one of the greatest songs by anyone ever, is Sparky’s Dream. Hamilton claimed pole position with a dominant performance in Melbourne that left his rivals reeling as he and Mercedes proved their car is once again ominously strong over the single lap discipline. Our Formula One correspondent Giles Richard has the full story. What is your earliest sporting memory? Mine is the Liverpool v Newcastle United FA cup final in 1974. I had just turned seven. What a game to introduce me to a lifelong love of football. And, course, the glorious goals from Kevin Keegan and my countryman Steve Heighway are on YouTube. We have an AFL full-time score: St Kilda 16.11 (107) beat Brisbane Lions 12.10 (82). First their women’s team lose to the Western Bulldogs in the AFLW grand final, and now the men lost to St Kilda. It is not the Lions’ day, is it? And this is unlikely to mean much to anyone other than me, but Shelbourne, the team I’ve followed since my students days in Dublin, beat Cobh Ramblers 1-0 last night. They now lie in fifth place in the League of Ireland’s first division (ie the second tier) and all Shels supporters can dare to dream of a run that will take them back to where they belong in the premier division and playing European football. They are in the third quarter now in the Port Adelaide v Fremantle game. It’s Port 8.7 (55) leading the Dockers 5.4 (34). Thank you to reader Tom Martin, who noticed I had incorrectly captioned the main picture. It’s fixed now, but suffice it to say that the Bulldogs did not defeat themselves in the AFLW grand final. Some teams do manage to defeat themselves on such occasions, but not western Melbourne’s finest. The visitors won with a stunning final minute field goal from Shaun Johnson. Down by seven points with four minutes to go, Issac Luke crossed for the Warriors’ third converted try before Johnson’s heroics shattered the Raiders. After being on the losing end of 30-28 scorelines in the first two rounds, the Raiders led for the whole game until Johnson sunk their hopes of a turnaround. The Warriors are now 3-0 for the first time in their history, while Canberra are winless before a trip to Manly a week from now. It was all the Raiders early, with hooker Siliva Havili crossing for the opening try in the seventh minute shortly after Warriors’ Adam Blair was sent to the sin bin. And speaking of AFL, in the men’s competition, here are some progress scores: Port Adelaide 8.5 (55) – Fremantle 5.4 (34), in the second quarter Fremantle 5.4 (34) – Brisbane Lions 9.10 (64), in the fourth quarter Kasey Symons has updated her AFLW grand final report with some lovely words about Katie Brennan, who was suspended for the match. In Super Rugby, the Chiefs have trounced the Sunwolves 61-10. The win was hardly unexpected, but the the extent of it is a touch surprising. In the NRL the New Zealand Warriors have beaten the Canberra Raiders 20-19 at GIO Stadium in Canberra in front of a crowd of 11,963. Bjørge Lillelien was obviously well versed in English history, with his mentions of Lord Nelson, Lord Beaverbrook, Sir Winston Churchill, Sir Anthony Eden, Clement Attlee, Henry Cooper, Lady Diana and Margaret Thatcher. If he was still alive today, and was commentating last night, what Australians might be have invoked? If might have gone something like this. We are the best in the world! We are the best in the world! We have beaten Australia 4-1 in football!! It is completely unbelievable! We have beaten Australia! Australia, birthplace of giants. Ned Kelly, Sir Don Bradman, Dame Nellie Melba, Dame Joan Sutherland, Olivia Newton John, Pat Cash, Nicole Kidman – we have beaten them all. We have beaten them all. Malcolm Turnbull can you hear me? Malcolm Turnbull, I have a message for you one year out from the election campaign. I have a message for you: We have beaten Australia before they play in the football World Cup. The name Bjørge Lillelien may not mean a lot to you, depending on your age an how much you do or don’t love football. If the name is unfamiliar, here’s a quick history. He was the commentator the last time an Anglophone country suffered such a humiliating defeat in Norway: 9 September 1981, Norway 2–1 England in a World Cup qualifier. Lillelien’s reaction for stunning, and his wise words live on long after his death in 1987, aged just 60. We are the best in the world! We are the best in the world! We have beaten England 2-1 in football!! It is completely unbelievable! We have beaten England! England, birthplace of giants. Lord Nelson, Lord Beaverbrook, Sir Winston Churchill, Sir Anthony Eden, Clement Attlee, Henry Cooper, Lady Diana – we have beaten them all. We have beaten them all. Maggie Thatcher can you hear me? Maggie Thatcher, I have a message for you in the middle of the election campaign. I have a message for you: We have knocked England out of the football World Cup. Maggie Thatcher, as they say in your language in the boxing bars around Madison Square Garden in New York: Your boys took a hell of a beating! Your boys took a hell of a beating! Good evening (if you’re on the east coast of Australia), good afternoon (if you’re in Perth), and whatever you’re having yourself if you are elsewhere on the continent or the world. And what a packed day of sport we have coming up. The Western Bulldogs have already won the AFLW grand final and the magnificent mare Winx has broken the world record for group one flat wins. We’ve also got NRL, AFL, A-League and formula one qualifying. And there was also the little manner of a Nordic humiliation in football overnight."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/mar/24/ged-kearney-wants-more-humane-policies-getting-people-off-manus-and-nauru-needs-to-be-a-priority","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-23T22:18:21Z","webTitle":"Ged Kearney wants more 'humane' policies: 'Getting people off Manus and Nauru needs to be a priority'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/mar/24/ged-kearney-wants-more-humane-policies-getting-people-off-manus-and-nauru-needs-to-be-a-priority","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/mar/24/ged-kearney-wants-more-humane-policies-getting-people-off-manus-and-nauru-needs-to-be-a-priority","fields":{"headline":"Ged Kearney wants more 'humane' policies: 'Getting people off Manus and Nauru needs to be a priority'","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Labor’s newest federal MP, Ged Kearney, says she will play a role in Labor’s national conference in the middle of this year arguing for a more “humane” policy on asylum seekers and offshore processing. In an interview with Guardian Australia before her arrival in Canberra on Monday, Kearney acknowledged that some people in her Melbourne electorate of Batman – the seat the former ACTU president held for the ALP in last weekend’s byelection – would be “on watch” as she made the transition from candidate to her new life as a federal parliamentarian. Kearney said her constituents “will want to see me argue and work within the party for some change [on asylum policy], and that is what I have promised them, and that is what I will do”. “I’ve been clear to people that I may or may not be successful with that, but we are going to work through priorities, and some of those can be achieved,” Kearney said. “I think getting people off Manus and Nauru needs to be a priority, and hopefully if Labor is elected that is something we can actually deliver on.” “With respect to the rest of the policy ... it will be an issue for national conference. I’m yet to really find my way in my new role as a Labor candidate at the national conference. I’m working through that at the moment. But I certainly want to support people who are like minded.” Asked to express her position on offshore detention, Kearney said she was now a member of the federal Labor caucus, “but I ask people to look at my activism in the past to see my views”. “I understand I can’t change Labor policy right now, but all I can say really is that I will be arguing for a humane policy at conference,” she said. Kearney prevailed in a hard fought byelection contest against the Greens candidate Alex Bhathal last Saturday, winning a positive two party-preferred swing of over 3%. The Greens pressed Labor on asylum throughout the campaign, particularly in the closing stages. Labor left wingers are positioning again to make asylum policy a significant issue at the party’s national conference mid-year, which presents a vexed management and political challenge for the Labor leader, Bill Shorten. Ending offshore processing would help Labor fend off Greens candidates in the inner cities, but it is less helpful in major-party tussles in marginal seats in the outer suburbs. Kearney said she was aware that for some constituents she was “on notice”. “There is a whole constituency who voted Green for a long time, that, for whatever reason saw in me someone they wanted to vote for,” the new Labor MP said. “They will be on watch I’m sure and it will be up to me to prove that I am worthy. “I think it will be a lot about what I do in the seat and how I bed down what I do in Batman working closely with the people there.” She said while some swinging voters were supporting her provisionally, there were other constituents just pleased to see Labor hold the seat. “There is the group of people who I think were Labor people at heart, and for whatever reason haven’t been able to vote Labor in the last little while, I think they are pleased ... I think they are happy to be voting Labor again. “Some people are going to watch me, and some people are going to support me.”Before the byelection, Kearney told voters at a town hall meeting in the electorate that Labor’s new policy axing cash dividend imputation credits – a putative shift which has sparked a backlash from seniors groups and the self managed super funds industry – was “good policy”, but she told retirees at the event there was still time for the ALP to assess its effects. Asked whether she still held that view, Kearney said Labor would always look after pensioners, and added: “I’m hopeful there will be announcements closer to a federal election for pensioners. I think there will be announcements that support pensioners and retirees.” Asked whether she had any ambition to be on the Labor front bench given her seniority in the trade union movement Kearney said she wouldn’t turn down an offer from Bill Shorten, “but certainly not in the first 12 months”. “There is going to be an election within a year. I have to really bed down my credentials as the member for Batman with the people of Batman. That’s what I’m going to be focussing on. “The way I’m going to tackle Batman is you have to talk to people about things that make a real difference for them. The universal issues were the issues that make a difference in people’s lives. “Yes there was Adani, yes there are issues around asylum seekers and that is very important, but at the end of the day people wanted to know their kids had a decent school, that they’d be able to get a decent job – and if we as mainstream parties don’t start dealing with those issues people won’t vote for us. “Those are the things I’m going to be focusing on.” Kearney said she was “a little bit nervous” of her relocation to Canberra for parliament next week but she was getting support from colleagues across the board. “I’m looking forward to next week. I think I’m going to enjoy it. “I can adapt pretty quickly and I’ll take it as it comes.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/mar/23/leaked-cambridge-analyticas-blueprint-for-trump-victory","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-23T12:53:12Z","webTitle":"Leaked: Cambridge Analytica's blueprint for Trump victory","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/mar/23/leaked-cambridge-analyticas-blueprint-for-trump-victory","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/mar/23/leaked-cambridge-analyticas-blueprint-for-trump-victory","fields":{"headline":"Leaked: Cambridge Analytica's blueprint for Trump victory","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The blueprint for how Cambridge Analytica claimed to have won the White House for Donald Trump by using Google, Snapchat, Twitter, Facebook and YouTube is revealed for the first time in an internal company document obtained by the Guardian. The 27-page presentation was produced by the Cambridge Analytica officials who worked most closely on Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign. A former employee explained to the Guardian how it details the techniques used by the Trump campaign to micro-target US voters with carefully tailored messages about the Republican nominee across digital channels. Intensive survey research, data modelling and performance-optimising algorithms were used to target 10,000 different ads to different audiences in the months leading up to the election. The ads were viewed billions of times, according to the presentation. The document was presented to Cambridge Analytica employees in London, New York and Washington DC weeks after Trump’s victory, providing an insight into how the controversial firm helped pull off one of the most dramatic political upsets in modern history. “This is the debrief of the data-driven digital campaign that was employed for Mr Trump,” said Brittany Kaiser, 30, who was Cambridge Analytica’s business development director until two weeks ago, when she left over a contractual dispute. She is the second former employee to come forward in less than a week, talking exclusively to the Guardian about the inner workings of the firm, including the work she said it conducted on the UK’s EU membership referendum. She said she had access to a copy of the same document now obtained by the Guardian, and had used it to showcase the campaign’s secret methods to potential clients of Cambridge Analytica. “There was a huge demand internally for people to see how we did it,” Kaiser said of the 2016 race. “Everyone wanted to know: past clients, future clients. The whole world wanted to see it. This is what we were allowed to confidentially show people if they signed a non-disclosure agreement.” Kaiser claims to be committed to human rights, but many would argue her career at Cambridge Analytica tells a different story. She has worked extensively for the firm, pitching business to clients in countries that have a history of exploitation by western political mercenaries, including Lithuania, Benin, Ethiopia and Libya. Cambridge Analytica has a reputation among political operatives for exaggerating its role in campaigns. A senior Trump campaign official who said they saw the document about a year ago claimed it took credit for some work that was done by the Republican national committee and Trump’s digital director, Brad Parscale. Kaiser did not work on the campaign but said she gleaned information about how it was orchestrated during discussions with senior staff, including the now suspended chief executive, Alexander Nix. None of the techniques described in the document are illegal. However, the scandal over Cambridge Analytica’s acquisition of data from more than 50 million Facebook users is lifting the lid on an industry that has learned how to closely track the online footprint and daily lives of US voters. Despite the advances made in data-led political campaigning, these were techniques that, according to the presentation, Trump did not have access to when Cambridge Analytica joined his campaign in early June 2016. The Republican nominee, who had just secured sufficient delegates to become the party’s candidate, still had “no speakable data infrastructure” and “no unifying data, digital and tech strategy”, the document states. Kaiser said Cambridge Analytica staff told her they were stunned when they arrived at Trump’s headquarters in Trump Tower, New York. “There was no database of record. There were many disparate data sources that were not connected, matched or hygiened,” she said of the process of ordering, sorting and cleaning enormous data sets. “There was no data science programme, so they weren’t undertaking any modelling. There was no digital marketing team.” One of the first things Cambridge Analytica did, she said, was work with data supplied by the party’s data trust and other data acquired through an initiative called Project Alamo. The document contains very little information about how the campaign used Facebook data. One page, however, suggests Cambridge Analytica was able to constantly monitor the effectiveness of its messaging on different types of voters, giving the company and the campaign constant feedback about levels of engagement on platforms such as Twitter, Facebook and Snapchat. The feedback loop meant the algorithms could be constantly updated and improved to deliver thousands of different messages to voters depending on their profile. The level of information the company could glean about voters – and the apparent appetite among Silicon Valley companies to cash in on the advertising bonanza – is illustrated on another page which shows how the Trump campaign used a prime piece of marketing real estate on election day: YouTube’s entire masthead. Kaiser said Hillary Clinton’s campaign had reserved the space on Google’s video-hosting platform but was so confident of victory that it gave it up. “Google called us and said this ad space is now available, immediately,” Kaiser said. “That’s what I was told.” The Trump campaign seized the opportunity, showing two different ads to different categories of voters according to the detailed geographical information of visitors to the YouTube home page. Voters in areas where people were likely to be Trump supporters were shown a triumphant-looking image of the nominee, and help finding their nearest polling station. Those whose geographical information suggested they were not fervent Trump supporters, such as swing voters, were shown photos of his high-profile supporters, including his daughter Ivanka Trump, a celebrity from the reality TV show Duck Dynasty, and Dana White, the president of the Ultimate Fighting Championship. One of the most effective ads, according to Kaiser, was a piece of native advertising on the political news website Politico, which was also profiled in the presentation. The interactive graphic, which looked like a piece of journalism and purported to list “10 inconvenient truths about the Clinton Foundation”, appeared for several weeks to people from a list of key swing states when they visited the site. It was produced by the in-house Politico team that creates sponsored content. The Cambridge Analytica presentation dedicates an entire slide to the ad, which is described as having achieved “an average engagement time of four minutes”. Kaiser described the ad as “the most successful thing we pushed out”. Politico said editorial journalists were not involved in the campaign, and similar ads were purchased by the Bernie Sanders and Clinton campaigns. Advertisements on Facebook, Twitter, Google and the music-sharing app Pandora were used to help convince 35,000 supporters to install an app used by the most active supporters. According to the presentation, Cambridge Analytica and the Trump campaign also used a new advertising technique offered by Twitter, launched at the start of the election year, which enabled clients to kickstart viral tweets. The “conversational ads” feature was used to encourage Trump’s followers to tweet using a set of pre-determined hashtags. The campaign also took advantage of an ad opportunity provided by Snapchat, enabling users to swipe up and immediately see a preloaded web page. While not useful for securing donors, Cambridge Analytica deemed the tool useful for engaging potential voter “contacts”, according to the presentation. One of the final slides explains how the company used paid-for Google ads to implement “persuasion search advertising”, to push pro-Trump and anti-Clinton search results through the company’s main search facility. One slide showed how the company ensured that voters searching the words “Trump Iraq War” would encounter paid-for search results that were favourable to his campaign. “Control The First Impression,” the slide says, with an arrow pointing to a search result that states: “Hillary Voted for the Iraq War – Donald Trump opposed it.” “That’s a Google manipulation thing,” Kaiser said, adding that while a “general person” probably did not know how easy it was to pay for ads to appear high in Google search results, it was considered “an old-school tactic” in her industry."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/mar/23/jordi-turull-latest-candidate-catalan-presidency-appear-court-spain","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-23T10:50:00Z","webTitle":"Spanish court remands Catalan presidential candidate in custody","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/23/jordi-turull-latest-candidate-catalan-presidency-appear-court-spain","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/mar/23/jordi-turull-latest-candidate-catalan-presidency-appear-court-spain","fields":{"headline":"Spanish court remands Catalan presidential candidate in custody","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"A Spanish supreme court judge has charged Jordi Turull, Catalonia’s presidential candidate, with rebellion and ordered him to remain in custody less than 24 hours before he was due to attend an investiture debate. On Friday morning, Judge Pablo Llarena announced that 13 senior Catalan leaders – including Turull and the deposed regional president, Carles Puigdemont – would be charged with rebellion over their roles in last year’s unilateral referendum and subsequent declaration of independence. The judge later ruled that Turull and four others – among them the former speaker of the Catalan parliament – would be denied bail and remanded in custody. The decision came hours after Marta Rovira, the general secretary of the pro-independence Catalan Republican Left party, failed to appear in court and fled to Switzerland. She was also charged with rebellion. Llarena said the five detainees posed a serious flight risk and could seek to push ahead with their plans for unilateral independence if allowed to remain at liberty. The decision was met with calls for demonstrations on the streets of Catalonia. Puigdemont, who has been in self-imposed exile in Brussels for five months and faces immediate arrest should he return to Spain, said his former colleagues had been jailed for “their ideas and their commitment”, adding: “The anti-democratic Spanish state shames Europe.” Announcing the rebellion charges, which carry a maximum sentence of 30 years’ imprisonment, Llarena said Catalan separatist politicians and grassroots groups had “colluded” for the past six years to draw up a plan for regional independence in defiance of Spain’s legal and constitutional order. Among those also charged with the same offence are the former Catalan vice-president, Oriol Junqueras, and the senior civil society group figures Jordi Cuixart and Jordi Sànchez. The judge ordered a total of 25 Catalan leaders be tried for rebellion, misuse of public funds or disobeying the state. In a 70-page ruling, Llarena noted that, from 2012 onwards, the Catalan government had been “drawing up a route map for Catalonia’s transition process towards becoming an independent country” and co-ordinating the campaign with Cuixart and Sànchez’s influential grassroots groups. “Despite repeated warnings that these parliamentary initiatives were unconstitutional and invalid … and despite the suspension and invalidation of the referendum decrees, the executive organs of the Catalan government pressed on with a permanent and obsessive agenda,” said the judge. Llarena cast doubt on whether the former Catalan government had abandoned its independence drive, saying it appeared to be “latent and awaiting reactivation”. The announcement of the charges followed Thursday night’s investiture debate in the Catalan parliament, in which Turull’s first attempt to be elected was scuppered by the region’s most hardline pro-independence party. Turull, Puigdemont’s former chief of staff and the third candidate to be proposed for the presidency since the elections last December, failed to win the support of the regional parliament after the far-left, anti-capitalist Popular Unity Candidacy (Cup) announced that it would no longer work in coalition with the two larger pro-independence parties. A second investiture debate is due to be held on Saturday morning. The debate on Thursday has started the constitutional and electoral clock ticking. Parties have two months to propose and elect a presidential candidate. If none is successful within that time, fresh Catalan elections will be held in mid-July. Catalonia has been under direct rule from Madrid since the end of October, when Spain’s prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, responded to the unilateral independence declaration by sacking Puigdemont and his government and calling a snap election."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2018/mar/23/in-court-big-oil-rejected-climate-denial","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-23T10:00:51Z","webTitle":"In court, Big Oil rejected climate denial | Dana Nuccitelli","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2018/mar/23/in-court-big-oil-rejected-climate-denial","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2018/mar/23/in-court-big-oil-rejected-climate-denial","fields":{"headline":"In court, Big Oil rejected climate denial","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"In a California court case this week, Judge William Alsup asked the two sides to provide him a climate science tutorial. The plaintiffs are the coastal cities of San Francisco and Oakland. They’re suing five major oil companies (Chevron, ExxonMobil, Shell, ConocoPhillips and BP) to pay for the cities’ costs to cope with the sea level rise caused by global warming. Chevron’s lawyer presented the science for the defense, and most notably, began by explicitly accepting the expert consensus on human-caused global warming, saying: From Chevron’s perspective, there is no debate about the science of climate change Deniers still want to debate the science of climate change Deniers filed briefs in support of the defense, but they contradicted Chevron’s tutorial. For example, one brief filed by a group led by Christopher Monckton and Willie Soon began by stating, “The “consensus” about global warming is 0.3%, not 97%” (this is obviously incorrect). Another brief filed by William Happer, Steve Koonin, and Richard Lindzen argued that “It is not possible to tell how much of the modest recent warming can be ascribed to human influences.” Chevron and the IPCC disagree. While it’s normal for climate deniers to deny the 97% expert consensus that humans are driving global warming, those submitting briefs on behalf of Big Oil were clearly not on the same page as its lawyer. Perhaps the oil companies should have sent the deniers a memo to stay out of this case. Clearly these groups are accustomed to denying climate science on the oil industry’s behalf. Two-faced oil companies The judge mandated that those submitting briefs detail their funding sources, and they listed a litany of oil companies and fossil fuel-funded think tanks. Among those listed by Monckton and Soon’s group were ExxonMobil, the Heartland Institute, and the Charles G. Koch Foundation. Among those listed by Happer, Koonin, and Lindzen were the Heritage Foundation, Peabody Coal, the Cato Institute, and the Texas Public Policy Foundation. It’s a perfect example of the oil industry’s two-faced behavior. For decades their own scientists quietly published peer-reviewed research concluding that humans are causing global warming. That was the face we saw from Chevron’s lawyer. But at the same time, oil companies were funding contrarian scientists and think tanks to spread denial and doubt about that same science. That was the face revealed in the denier briefs. Chevron’s lawyer modified the tobacco playbook Although they accept the expert climate consensus, the oil companies obviously don’t want to be held liable for the costs of the climate damages their products cause. In addition to emphasizing and exaggerating climate science uncertainties, Chevron’s lawyer noted that the IPCC states that climate change is caused “largely by economic and population growth,” not fossil fuel extraction. In other words, the oil industry’s strategy is to argue that individual climate impacts are difficult to pin down, and in any case, the blame lies not with the producers, but with the consumers of their products. It’s eerily similar to an argument made by tobacco industry lawyers: Those who decide to start smoking or continue smoking should assume responsibility for a choice they make -- because no one can say they don’t know about the dangers associated with smoking In short, the industry lawyers argue that the consequences are the fault of smokers and energy consumers, not the companies producing the dangerous products. That argument didn’t work for the tobacco industry in the past, because they knew of the health risks associated with consuming their products, yet engaged in campaign to manufacture doubt to convince people to keep smoking. Ultimately, a federal judge found the tobacco industry guilty of fraud to further a conspiracy to deceive the American public about the dangers of their products. It’s a more difficult case to make against the oil industry because their scientists published climate research in peer-reviewed journals available to the public, and their campaign to manufacture doubt about human-caused climate change was waged through intermediaries. They funded think tanks to do their dirty work, as we saw in the denier briefs. Tobacco industry executives continued publicly denying their own scientists’ findings to the very end, even under oath. The oil industry has modified the tobacco playbook by accepting the scientific consensus. And Chevron’s lawyer argued that as a complex global problem, any climate remedies should be addressed through government policy rather than via the legal system. Since it effectively owns the Republican Party, Big Oil can afford to accept the science to avoid legal ramifications, without fearing any such legislative consequences unless the Democratic Party takes full control of the US government, which won’t happen until 2021 at the earliest. It’s a brilliant strategy, and until Democrats take power and pass a carbon tax or other similar climate legislation (or enough Republican lawmakers stop denying the science and start finding bipartisan policy solutions), it might just work. But even if they lose this lawsuit, at least the cities of San Francisco and Oakland forced the oil companies’ hand. In a high-profile case, they accepted the 97% expert consensus on human-caused global warming. These companies have employed scientists researching climate change for four decades, and as the world’s biggest and most profitable producers of carbon-polluting products, have the strongest motivation to deny climate science. If even Big Oil accepts the reality of human-caused climate change when pressed in court, it’s difficult for anyone else to deny it from here forward."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/grogonomics/2018/mar/25/businesss-kumbaya-promises-show-how-weak-the-need-for-company-tax-cuts-is","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-24T21:04:59Z","webTitle":"Business's 'Kumbaya' promises show how weak the need for company tax cuts is | Greg Jericho","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2018/mar/25/businesss-kumbaya-promises-show-how-weak-the-need-for-company-tax-cuts-is","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/grogonomics/2018/mar/25/businesss-kumbaya-promises-show-how-weak-the-need-for-company-tax-cuts-is","fields":{"headline":"Business's 'Kumbaya' promises show how weak the need for company tax cuts is","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"There is little sadder than watching business groups and companies attempt to lobby in public by promising that they’ll be good. This week the Business Council of Australia delivered a statement to the crossbench senators, signed by 10 CEOs of some of Australia’s largest corporations, effectively begging them to pass the company tax cut legislation. But the statement only served to reinforce just how weak the impact of the company tax cuts will be on the lives of most workers. The statement pledged that “if the Senate passes this important legislation we, as some of the nation’s largest employers, commit to invest more in Australia which will lead to employing more Australians and therefore stronger wage growth as the tax cut takes effect”. Presumably this means if the legislation is not passed they will not commit to investing more in Australia? It should be noted that while companies are crying out for a tax cut in order to employ more Australians, this week saw the government boasting of record level of employment growth. Similarly non-mining investment in the past year grew by 10% – the best result in four years and double the 30-year average annual growth of 5%. That this can be achieved under such a high company tax rate must surely rank as an economic miracle. Of course, none of the CEOs of the 10 companies (five of which paid no tax in 2015-16) outlined any actual investments they are holding off on making unless the company tax cut goes through. Indeed because the tax cut for companies with a turnover of more than $1bn a year is only set to occur in 2022-23, and will only fully be cut to 25% in 2026-27, any suggestion of investment decisions not occurring would be based not on the current company tax rate, but on what they anticipate it will be. That length of time also hurts the companies’ and government’s argument about “stronger wage growth”. There is absolutely no basis for arguing a tax cut will bring about stronger wage growth immediately. The government might hope you will believe that, but none of their reasoning for the cut suggests it will happen. A company tax cut theoretically leads to stronger wage growth because firstly such a cut is supposed to increase (mostly foreign) investment in equipment, machinery and infrastructure that in turn leads to an increase in productivity. Once that productivity increase occurs, then and only then wages growth will increase because the companies are producing more with the same amount of labour. They will thus seek to employ more and will not only raise wages to reward productivity improvements but also to entice workers to either stay or come work for them. But of course that end result is not only predicated on productivity improvements actually leading to increased employment (which is in no way a certain thing) but also that workers will be in a position to bargain for higher wages. And remember as well, even according to the government’s own research the improved wages growth only is to occur “in the long term”. And just how large that theoretical wages rise would be is also up for debate. Treasury estimated a company tax cut would lead to a long-term ongoing real wage increase of 0.4%, but new research by ANU economist Chris Murphy, which takes into account the recent changes in the US company tax rate, suggests it would be just 0.29% if financed by bracket creep. Another new study by University of NSW Business School’sprofessor of finance, Peter Swan, whose work in the 1980s for the Campbell Committee of Inquiry into the Financial System led to the Hawke government introducing the dividend imputation system, suggests the company tax cut won’t even lead to increased foreign investment. He argues that “investment in Australia is already at its globally efficient untaxed level” as foreign investors are already able to take advantage of tax laws that allow them to sell shares before dividend payments are made and then buy them back afterwards. He argues this negates the impact of the tax cut and that “even if the Australian corporate tax rate is reduced from 30% to 25%, there should be no new foreign investment, but more Australians should invest offshore due to the lower tax impost”. He concludes that “consequently, the tax cut plan is redundant with no billions of dollars’ worth of desirable foreign investments left lying on the table”. Senator Derryn Hinch was right to call the BCA’s statement as “very kumbaya”. There will be no way to prove any company has either increased investment or wages due to the tax cut, but there will be – as was the case in the US – lots of claims that this has occurred. But to believe companies will pay higher wages because of this tax cut requires a great deal of naivety. Which bring us to Senator Pauline Hanson who agreed to support the tax cut, despite having previously spoken out against it because, as she told the ABC, she was able to get funding for a “pilot program” for 1,000 apprentices in private business. The ALP quickly noted the government has cut apprenticeships by 140,000 places since 2013. The ALP is however being rather misleading about apprentice levels. A recent study by the Mitchell Institute found most of the drop in apprentices has actually been due to a drop in one-year “traineeships” due to measures brought in by the Julia Gillard government to stop rorting by employers and training providers. But even if we only focus on the more traditional “trade” industries, in 2017 there were 168,000 apprentices – down 41,000 from the 209,000 in 2013. That makes Senator Hanson’s 1,000 apprentices program rather small beer, and must have had the government senators laughing at how cheaply she folded. One wonders if they even bothered to hide their laughter till they left the room."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2018/mar/23/australias-exemption-from-trump-steel-tariff-is-temporary-with-quotas-to-come","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-23T04:55:14Z","webTitle":"Australia's exemption from Trump steel tariff is temporary, with quotas to come","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/mar/23/australias-exemption-from-trump-steel-tariff-is-temporary-with-quotas-to-come","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/mar/23/australias-exemption-from-trump-steel-tariff-is-temporary-with-quotas-to-come","fields":{"headline":"Australia's exemption from Trump steel tariff is temporary, with quotas to come","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Donald Trump could yet impose import quotas on Australian steel and aluminium after it emerged the tariff exemption he granted Malcolm Turnbull would now have a deadline of 1 May. The Australian government has responded by declaring its deal with the US was “unconditional” and claiming the deadline was directed at negotiations with other nations for a more long-term rebalancing of trade. The White House on Friday confirmed Australia, Europe, South Korea, Canada, Mexico, Argentina and Brazil would initially escape America’s 25% steel and 10% aluminium tariffs. However, the exemption would last only until 1 May “pending discussions of satisfactory long-term alternative means to address the threatened impairment to US national security”. “By May 1, 2018, the president will decide whether to continue to exempt these countries from the tariffs, based on the status of the discussions,” the White House said. Trade minister Steven Ciobo said the agreement between Trump and Turnbull to exempt Australian steel “was unconditional”. “As the United States has acknowledged, the US could not have a fairer trade relationship than it does with Australia,” he said. Before the announcement Turnbull said the threatened tariffs against China and others were the “beginning of a negotiation” between the US and the rest of the world. “[Trump’s] contention is that trade should be fair and reciprocal, we understand that, that’s the reason why Australians has been exempted from the steel tariff,” he said. “As Donald Trump said, trade between Australia and the US is fair and reciprocal, there’s zero tariffs on US imports into Australia, a very close security relationship, the Americans actually have a trade surplus with Australia.” US trade representative Robert Lighthizer and Trump’s policy adviser Peter Navarro will closely monitor imports of steel and aluminium from Australia and other exempted countries. Navarro has appeared to harden the White House’s position, telling CNN the exempted nations would be saddled with steel and aluminium quotas to prevent non-exempted nations attempting to find backdoor entry points to America. “This is an important thing,” Navarro said. “Every country that is not facing tariffs that we are going to negotiate with will face quotas so that we protect our aluminum and steel industries. “For all countries there has to be a quota. If you don’t put a quota on then any country that can do whatever they want will become a trans-shipment point for any other country.” He did not specify the size of the quota. Australia’s peak body representing the steel industry said it was too early to tell what the impact would be. “I don’t think, until the details come out, that we really know what the implications [are],” Steel Institute chief executive Tony Dixon said on Friday. The announcement came as Trump heightened fears of a US-China trade war by also announcing plans to hit Chinese goods with $US60bn in tariffs. “The important thing is, no one wins from a trade war,” he said. “We look forward to the US and China being able to negotiate a satisfactory arrangement that suits both sides.” Labor frontbencher Richard Marles said it was “bad news for the global economy”. “It is obviously therefore bad news for us. We have to be doing everything we can to try and advocate to the US not to walk down a path of increasing tariff barriers around this economy,” he told Sky News."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/mar/23/tathra-bushfire-class-action-considered-against-government-owned-utility","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-23T05:21:40Z","webTitle":"Tathra bushfire: class action considered against government-owned utility","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/mar/23/tathra-bushfire-class-action-considered-against-government-owned-utility","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/mar/23/tathra-bushfire-class-action-considered-against-government-owned-utility","fields":{"headline":"Tathra bushfire: class action considered against government-owned utility","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Lawyers are investigating a potential class action over the Tathra bushfires, alleging failings by the government-owned corporation responsible for maintaining and inspecting the state’s power lines. On Thursday, the Rural Fire Service released its early findings into the cause of the fire, which destroyed 65 houses and 35 caravans and cabins, and also damaged 48 houses. The RFS believes the fire was probably caused by electrical infrastructure at Reedy Swamp Road. In less than 24 hours, the law firm Slater and Gordon said it was investigating the possibility of a class action on behalf of Tathra residents. It said it was “looking closely at whether the blaze could have been prevented”. The firm’s practice group leader, Rory Walsh, said the adequacy of power line maintenance would be a key question in any litigation. “The initial investigations are likely to come down to the adequacy of the power pole inspection process, which has been a central issue in many of our other bushfire cases as well as the Victorian bushfire royal commission,” Walsh said. “We will be looking at whether Essential Energy adhered to stringent inspection and ongoing maintenance requirements, and ultimately what could have been done to prevent this bushfire.” Essential Energy has already rejected claims that it failed to properly maintain the lines. Its chief executive officer, John Cleland, said in a statement that inspections and maintenance were up to date and in accordance with standards. He said early investigations suggested “trees fell on to power lines during extreme weather conditions”. The cause of the fire has prompted criticism of the funding and staff cuts at Essential Energy. The Electrical Trades Union said the loss of resources had compromised the company’s ability to properly maintain NSW’s power infrastructure. The fire is now the subject of two inquiries, one conducted by the former police chief Mick Keelty and another by the NSW coroner’s court. Slater and Gordon said it would be watching the outcome of the inquiries. “This type of litigation tends to be fiercely contested by electrical infrastructure providers, but we have extensive experience and are well equipped to take on this legal battle for Tathra,” Walsh said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/mar/23/george-pell-allegedly-exposed-himself-to-choir-boy-court-hears","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-23T05:51:11Z","webTitle":"George Pell allegedly exposed himself to choir boy, court hears","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/mar/23/george-pell-allegedly-exposed-himself-to-choir-boy-court-hears","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/mar/23/george-pell-allegedly-exposed-himself-to-choir-boy-court-hears","fields":{"headline":"George Pell allegedly exposed himself to choir boy, court hears","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"A woman has told Melbourne magistrates court that her brother said a bishop had exposed himself to him while he was a choir boy and that the culprit was “fucking George Pell”. She told the committal hearing into historical sexual offence charges against Cardinal Pell that her brother made the disclosure while they were drunk and in the back seat of a car on their way home from celebrating their grandmother’s eightieth birthday several years ago. “[My brother] said: ‘You don’t know what’s happened to me. He exposed himself to me’,” the woman told the court. “I asked: ‘Who?’. He said: ‘Fucking George Pell’, were his exact words.” Pell’s defence barrister, Robert Richter QC, accused the woman of making up the part about Pell being named by her brother. She denied making it up. Her brother was crying when he made the disclosure, she said. When she raised the conversation with her brother again at a later date to see if he was okay, he refused to talk about it further, she said. Richter pressed her on why she didn’t try to get more details about the allegation from her brother. “Do you care?,” he asked her. “Of course I do,” she replied. “I was very concerned about the allegation but I could see it was very embarrassing and hurtful for [him] ... I didn’t want to continue to probe him.” She said her brother also told her in the car that what had happened to him “has fucked me up, you have no idea how much it has fucked me up”. Her brother went to police in 2015, the court heard. Earlier on Friday, the court heard two men alleged Pell sexually offended against them while playing games with them as children at a swimming at a pool in Ballarat in the 1970s. One of the men also alleged he was sexually offended against in the pool change room. The court also heard that a witness due to give evidence was medically unfit to do so, and therefore charges against Pell relating to him would be withdrawn. Pell, who is 76, is the highest-ranking Vatican official to be charged in the Catholic church’s long-running sexual abuse scandal. He has taken leave from the Vatican in Rome to attend court. He has strenuously denied all allegations. Further description of the charges against Pell cannot be given for legal reasons. When the hearing adjourns next Thursday afternoon, magistrate Belinda Wallington will decide if there is enough evidence to order Pell to stand trial accused of historical sexual offences. Her decision is expected some time in April.

By going public, Karen McDougal disregarded legal risks relating to a $150,000 deal she had signed shortly before the November 2016 election that in effect bought her silence. In an hour-long interview with Anderson Cooper on CNN, she gave intimate details of the alleged affair that involved her having sex with the then New York businessman “many dozens of times”. In details that could prove especially discomforting for Trump and the First Lady, McDougal said that in the course of the relationship he took her into the couple’s Manhattan home in Trump Tower. Trump pointed out a room which he described as “Melania’s room”, saying “she likes to have her alone time” there. The rights to McDougal’s story were bought in August 2016, just three months before the election, by American Media Inc (AMI), owner of the National Enquirer, though no article was ever published. AMI’s chairman David Pecker and Trump are longstanding friends, and McDougal said she thought that the deal had been a “catch and kill” – in other words an attempt to protect the then Republican presidential candidate by burying the tale. Earlier this week AMI contacted CNN denying that there had been any attempt to silence McDougal. “She has been free to respond to press inquiries about her relationship with President Trump since 2016,” the company claimed. Trump has denied the alleged affair. McDougal’s appearance on CNN is something of a test run for what is expected to be a more incendiary broadcast on Sunday when the adult film actor Stormy Daniels – real name Stephanie Clifford – is scheduled to be interviewed, also by Cooper, on CBS’s 60 Minutes. She was paid $130,000 to keep her silence about an alleged affair with Trump by his personal lawyer Michael Cohen, who says he made the payment out of his own funds. Three women – Daniels, McDougal, and Summer Zervos, an Apprentice contestant who says she was sexually harassed by Trump – are all suing the president. In her CNN interview, McDougal said that Trump had conducted the affair in many locations, including at a golf tournament in Lake Tahoe, in his private golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey, as well as in Trump Tower where she was brought in through the back entrance. Their first date in June 2006 was in his bungalow rooms at the Beverly Hills hotel. After they had sex, she alleged, he had offered her money. She said that hurt, and she told him: “I’m not that kind of girl.” “Oh, you’re really special,” Trump replied."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/mar/23/george-pell-two-men-allege-cardinal-sexually-offended-against-them-as-children-at-pool","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-23T04:54:54Z","webTitle":"George Pell: two men allege cardinal sexually offended against them as children at pool","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/mar/23/george-pell-two-men-allege-cardinal-sexually-offended-against-them-as-children-at-pool","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/mar/23/george-pell-two-men-allege-cardinal-sexually-offended-against-them-as-children-at-pool","fields":{"headline":"George Pell: two men allege cardinal sexually offended against them as children at pool","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Two men have alleged Cardinal George Pell sexually offended against them while playing games with them as children at a swimming pool in Ballarat, Melbourne magistrates court has heard. One of the men also alleged he was sexually offended against in the pool change room. Relatives of the men were cross-examined by Pell’s defence team on Friday. Further description of the charges against Pell cannot be given for legal reasons. The mother of one of the complainants, who cannot be named for legal reasons, gave evidence to the court via video link. Pell’s barrister, Robert Richter, asked her about what she recalled while watching her son swimming at the pool. The court heard that after swimming laps Pell would go to the free-play area of the pool where children would play games with him, including being thrown through the air by Pell. Richter told the mother: “You never observed anything untoward happening”. “No,” she replied, “because we trusted priests”. Richter also put it to her that at the time she thought Pell was a “nice man” because he would stay around after swimming laps play in the pool with her children and others. “I don’t remember thinking that,” the mother replied. The woman made a signed statement to police in 2015 after one of her son’s friends from that time accused Pell of a sexual offence. The friend has since died, which led to prosecutors withdrawing a charge against Pell before the committal hearing began. Her son then also made allegations against Pell, which the woman said was the first she heard of them. She said when she tried to ask her son for details about it, all he said was “yeah, it was bad”. Richter put it to her that the comment about the abuse being “bad” was in reference to someone else who allegedly perpetrated a sexual offence against her son. The woman responded he had been talking about what had happened to him at the pool. Pell, who is 76, is the highest-ranking Vatican official to be charged in the Catholic church’s long-running sexual abuse scandal. He has taken leave from a position in the Vatican to attend court.

A rescue operation began on Friday morning in Hamelin Bay, on the state’s south-western tip, to save the remaining 15, with volunteers and vets trying to keep the surviving short-finned pilot whales alive before deciding when to herd them out to sea. One witness described trying to steer one of the animals out to sea, only to watch it beach itself again. Jeremy Chick, who is controlling the rescue attempt near the town of Augusta, said the main priorities were to ensure the welfare of the remaining live whales and the safety of everyone involved in the operation before any rescue attempt was made to herd the whales back out to sea. “The strength of the animals and the windy and possibly wet weather conditions will affect when and where we attempt to move them out to sea,” he said. People were asked to avoid the area because rescuers had enough staff there. Authorities warned the public to take care near the water because the dead and dying animals could bring sharks closer to shore. A three-metre shark was seen in the bay within a few hours. Hamelin beach is closed from Hamelin Caravan Park to North Point including Grace Road and Reserve Road, and a shark alert has been issued for the area. The largest mass stranding of whales in WA happened in 1996 when 320 long-finned pilot whales stranded themselves in Dunsborough. Short-finned pilot whales inhabit tropical and subtropical waters and may be seen in the hundreds but groups usually number fewer than 100. On Friday, the whales were first spotted by a commercial fisherman at 6am on Friday."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2018/mar/23/china-promises-to-hit-us-with-tariffs-as-stocks-plunge-amid-fear-of-trade-war","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-23T10:32:56Z","webTitle":"Global markets plunge as China reacts to Trump’s steel tariffs","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/mar/23/china-promises-to-hit-us-with-tariffs-as-stocks-plunge-amid-fear-of-trade-war","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/mar/23/china-promises-to-hit-us-with-tariffs-as-stocks-plunge-amid-fear-of-trade-war","fields":{"headline":"Global markets plunge as China reacts to Trump’s steel tariffs","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Global markets have dropped sharply after China retaliated against Donald Trump’s decision to impose tariffs on steel and aluminium, fuelling fears of an all-out trade war between the world’s two largest economies. Hours after the US president announced moves to tackle what he believes are unfair trade practices, China signalled it would hit US goods such as pork, apples and steel pipe with higher duties. China’s commerce ministry urged Washington to negotiate a settlement as soon as possible but set no deadline. A ministry statement on Friday said the higher US tariffs “seriously undermine” the global trading system. “China doesn’t hope to be in a trade war, but is not afraid of engaging in one,” the statement said. “China hopes the United States will pull back from the brink, make prudent decisions, and avoid dragging bilateral trade relations to a dangerous place.” The news sent the Dow Jones Industrial Average down 724 points or 2.93% on Thursday, and the rout continued in Asian markets. The Nikkei 225 in Toyko closed 4.51% lower, while shares in Hong Kong fell 2.45%, the CSI300 in Shanghai lost 2.86% and the Kospi in Seoul was down 3.37%. In Australia, which exports more iron ore to China than any other country, the ASX200 benchmark index was off nearly 2%. In Europe, the FTSE 100 was down nearly 1% at 6883 in mid-morning trading, a new 15 month low and pushing the leading index firmly into correction territory, down 10% since its recent peak in late January. Germany’s Dax and France’s Cac have both dropped by about 1.8%. Despite the US move on China, the EU is one of the regions which has been given a temporary exemption from the steel tariffs. At the European summit in Brussels, the UK prime minister, Theresa May, said she welcomed the exemption and was working with other EU leaders to try and make it permanent. She said: “We will be talking about what the next steps might be. I have stayed on to talk about these next steps because the steel industry is hugely important to the UK and the British government and I want to ensure that steel workers and their jobs are properly safeguarded.” In response to the US tariffs on China, the country’s foreign ministry suggested soybeans, airplanes, cars and cotton could be targeted. Goods targeted for possible higher Chinese tariffs include wine, apples and ethanol, which would hit agricultural areas where voters supported Trump in the 2016 presidential election. The Chinese government could also target US technology companies that manufacture products in China, such as Apple, in the hope those firms would pressure Washington to back down, said Victor Shih, a professor of political economy at University of California, San Diego. The ministry said China bought about $1bn (£700m) worth of those goods last year. They would be hit with a 15% tariff increase, mirroring the US duty hike of 15% on aluminum. A second group of products targeted for a possible 25% tariff, mirroring the higher American charge on steel, includes pork and aluminum scrap, according to the ministry. “It’s already a trade war. And this war is started by the US,” Cheng Dawei, a professor of international trade at Renmin University in Beijing. The Chinese government is still consulting with industry leaders on other possible retaliatory measures, she added, while China will also “react on other multilateral platforms, such as World Trade Organisation and the G20”. Further tariffs are likely, with the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, recently delivering a nationalistic speech at the close of a parliamentary session where he secured a removal of term limits on his office. “The US action demonstrates how much damage Xi Jinping has done to the US-China relationship, he completely rejected Obama’s outstretched hand and now there’s broad support in Washington that something had to be done,” said Ely Ratner, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations.

The $670m plan to raise the dam wall by 14 metres was announced by the New South Wales government in 2016 as a strategy to prevent catastrophic flooding in outer-western Sydney. It faces strong opposition from conservationists and Gundungurra traditional owners, who say WaterNSW has made it difficult for them to engage in a consultation process and has underestimated the number of cultural heritage sites that will be lost. Kazan Brown, a Gundungurra woman who has nominated to be part of the Aboriginal consultation group on the project, said she was given four days’ warning of an information session on 20 March. The briefing was held in northern Sydney, more than a three-hour drive in peak-hour traffic from Brown’s home in Warragamba. Infrastructure NSW said the briefing was “not a mandated part of that consultation process” but invitations were issued to “registered Aboriginal parties”. Four groups accepted but due to “personal circumstances” none turned up. A second meeting will be held at Katoomba on 27 March. Brown said raising the dam wall would flood more than 50 Aboriginal heritage sites. A significant number of sites were flooded when the original dam was built. “They [WaterNSW] are saying that it is going to save more sites downstream,” she said. “But they are talking about different cultures. Everything that is behind the dam wall belongs to the Gundungurra and Dharawal people and everything that’s downstream belongs to the Darug.” Among the sites at risk behind the dam wall are rock art sites, burial sites and ochre deposits in a cave on the waterline. Brown said the Gundungurra people could not afford to lose any more heritage sites. “We lost a lot when they first flooded the valley,” she said. Infrastructure NSW said it was still assessing the impact on Aboriginal heritage sites. Ecologist Roger Lembit was involved in environmental assessments of a proposal to raise the wall by 23 metres in 1995. A spillway was built instead. Lembit said he was “very surprised” to see another proposal to raise the dam, especially after the Blue Mountains received world heritage listing in 2000. “You would think that world heritage meant something,” he said. The new inundation area includes Camden white gum (Eucalyptus benthamii), which is nationally is listed as vulnerable, and Kowmung hakea (Hakea Dohertyi) which is listed as endangered. It also contains “highly unusual” mixed ironbark and cypress pine forests, areas of dry rainforest and a substantial number of old growth trees. The proposal would also flood 65km of wild rivers and streams, according to the Colong Foundation for Wilderness, which will launch a campaign to save the wild rivers on Monday. The 142m high dam wall was completed in 1960. It fences in Lake Burragorang, a 2,000 gigalitre lake on the eastern edge of the Blue Mountains that provides 80% of Sydney’s water supply. It guards the Hawkesbury-Nepean valley, which was identified by the Insurance Council of Australia as the most flood-prone area in NSW. According to the Hawkesbury-Nepean valley flood risk management strategy, which recommended the dam wall be raised, up to 134,000 people live and work on the floodplain. That number is growing as Sydney sprawls westward. The strategy said raising the dam wall would create “airspace in the dam to temporarily hold back and slowly release flood waters coming from the Warragamba river catchment”, which would reduce the flood risk by 75%. The proposal was developed in response to the 2011 Brisbane floods, which were triggered by a release from the Wivenhoe dam. It has already received $58m in state funding and is undergoing ecological assessment. If approved, construction will begin in 2020."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/mar/23/friday-briefing-break-this-brexit-cycle-says-labour-frontbencher","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-23T06:30:37Z","webTitle":"Friday briefing: Break this Brexit cycle, says Labour frontbencher","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/23/friday-briefing-break-this-brexit-cycle-says-labour-frontbencher","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/mar/23/friday-briefing-break-this-brexit-cycle-says-labour-frontbencher","fields":{"headline":"Friday briefing: Break this Brexit cycle, says Labour frontbencher","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Top story: ‘We need to go further,’ says Owen Smith Good morning – I’m Warren Murray and here are the main stories. Labour’s shadow Northern Ireland secretary, Owen Smith, has challenged the party to reopen the debate on whether Brexit is “the right choice for the country” and offer the public a vote on the final deal. Smith, who ran against Jeremy Corbyn for the leadership in 2016, writes in the Guardian: “Labour needs to do more than just back a soft Brexit or guarantee a soft border in Ireland.” Underlining the critical importance of peace in Ireland, Smith writes: “If we insist on leaving the EU then there is realistically only one way to honour our obligations under the Good Friday agreement and that is to remain members of both the customs union and the single market. I’m pleased my party has taken a big step in this direction by backing continued customs union membership, but we need to go further.” The intervention is likely to reopen divisions within Labour after fraught internal discussions led to Jeremy Corbyn eventually agreeing to adopt “a customs union” with the EU as party policy. Smith’s remarks will appeal to remainers in the party ranks and embolden backbenchers campaigning for Labour to support single market membership. * * * ‘No other plausible explanation’ – The EU has recalled its ambassador to Russia overnight and several European governments look likely to expel Kremlin diplomats in solidarity with the UK over the Salisbury poisonings. EU leaders have met with Theresa May in Brussels and issued a statement saying it is “highly likely Russia is responsible” for the use of a nerve agent against Sergei and Yulia Skripal. France, Poland, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania are understood to be considering expulsions, while Lithuania’s foreign minister, Linas Linkevičius, appeared to suggest withdrawals from the World Cup: “To make Russia proud at being capital of this world religion football, I don’t believe it’s very productive frankly.” In today’s long read, international relations expert Mark Galeotti chronicles how under Vladimir Putin, gangsterism has moved from the streets of Russia to the heart of the state. * * * China answers Trump tariffs – Beijing has promised to hit back with tariffs against the US and protest to the WTO after Donald Trump announced $60bn in new trade measures targeting China. Global markets have gone into shock at the prospect of a trade war – the Dow Jones industrial average dropped nearly 3%, and Asian markets have followed suit overnight. Trump declared the new tariffs necessary to address a $504bn trade deficit and a “tremendous intellectual property theft situation” costing hundreds of billions more. A new list of proposed tariffs is likely to cover sectors such as robotics, hi-tech trains and aerospace. The Chinese leadership has signalled it will hit back with tariffs on US goods such as pork, apples, steel pipe, soybeans, cars, planes, cotton, apples and ethanol. An editorial in the nationalist Global Times suggested a “people’s war” where ordinary citizens would boycott American goods: “Don’t believe it? Come try us.” * * * McMaster of none – Donald Trump’s increasingly-on-the-outer national security chief has gotten in first by resigning. HR McMaster will be replaced by John Bolton, hawkish former ambassador to the UN who has advocated a tough stance towards Russia and using military force against Iran and North Korea. McMaster’s exit comes after Trump fired Rex Tillerson as US secretary of state – the biggest departure in a lengthening line of exits from the Trump administration. Tillerson has given a farewell speech in which he said Washington can be “a very mean-spirited town”. He didn’t mention Trump once. * * * Controversial school of thought – Going to a selective school does little to improve a pupil’s GCSE results, according to a study. A pleasing idea, perhaps, to Guardian readers, but the basis for the assertion might trouble you: that genetic factors are at play. The lead author, Prof Robert Plomin of King’s College London, argues the influence of genetics on achievement is the “elephant in the classroom”. It might be seen as problematic that one of the co-authors is Toby Young, known for controversial writings about working-class students and “progressive eugenics”. Professor Danny Dorling, of Oxford University, questioned the study, saying it implies “the large majority of children in the UK [those outside selective schooling] … have, on average, a genetic predisposition not to be that able. The idea that private schools do not increase a child’s chance of being awarded more GCSEs and A-levels is not very credible.” Lunchtime read: Charles in charge Spooked by cling film, ranting at prime ministers, obsessed with his public image and disdainful towards “Mama down the road”. An unauthorised biography of Prince Charles portrays the heir who regards his life as “utter hell”. Tom Bower writes in The Rebel Prince that Charles “presides at the centre of a court with no place for democracy or dissenting views … like some feudal lord” and commands an army of 120 staff. Some patrol his lettuce patch at night to pick off the slugs, while four valets help him change his clothes up to five times a day, alleges Bowers, who expresses concern that as king, Charles “will act alone, without any restraining adviser”. Clarence House says it will not comment on the allegations made in the book. Sport Gareth Southgate, the England manager, says he is “not concerned” about his side as the World Cup looms but England face the Netherlands tonight burdened by a host of still unanswered questions. Southgate has also claimed England must address its own problems with racism before it can criticise Russia over the matter after revealing members of the national set-up’s junior sides had endured “disgusting” racial abuse on social media. Despite the time it has taken, the news that Manchester United, one of the game’s superpowers, are launching a professional women’s team is welcome, writes Suzanne Wrack. Golf’s No1, Dustin Johnson, fell by the wayside at the World Match Play, but Rory McIlroy stayed alive with a timely win. And after England’s spectacular collapse yesterday, New Zealand are well on top on a soggy day two of the first Test in Auckland. Business Investors have shown what they think of a possible trade war between the world’s two biggest economies by frantically selling stocks and key industrial commodities in overnight trade. Asian shares have taken a real battering, the worst shellacking being for the Nikkei which is off 4.65%. Iron ore dropped 5%, which didn’t do much for the Australian stock market either.

The papers The Mail makes up for yesterday with belated but plentiful outrage about post-Brexit passports being made across the Channel. It demands that ministers “Stand up for Britain for once!” and fumes that Britain’s “ruling class” seem to “hate our country, its history, culture and the people’s sense of identity”. Don’t hold back! The Times goes with “May’s EU allies prepare to expel Russian diplomats”. In the Guardian’s print edition we lead with how Facebook gave anonymised data on 57bn friendships to Alexsandr Kogan – the Cambridge academic who shared data with Cambridge Analytica. The Telegraph says “May’s task force backs women in business” – something for which the paper claims credit after running a campaign to help female entrepreneurs. The Mirror tells how a transgender woman who won the lottery couldn’t buy her dream home because of objections from neighbours.

I know – I've used the data","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"In 2007, a Facebook application popped up that allowed users to take a quiz that would tell them exactly what kind of person they were: how emotionally stable they were compared with their friends, or how friendly they were. They were invited to tick a little box to share their information – including photographs, likes and political interests from their Facebook pages. The information would go to researchers David Stillwell and Michal Kosinski at the University of Cambridge to help with their research. Users were told this when they agreed to using it. No big deal. Until Aleksandr Kogan, the man now caught up in a string of investigations into private company Cambridge Analytica, came along. Kogan built a similar personality quiz giving access to 50m Facebook profiles to the company now accused of using big data to influence elections. He says he had approached Stillwell and Kosinski back in 2014, wanting to collaborate. It didn’t happen. What was so special about this type of data? As a student in the psychology department at the University of Cambridge in 2011, I was one of the people using it for academic research. I used it to do things such as looking at the correlation between users’ personalities and their political leanings. I went through the data using statistical modelling tools that told me, for instance, what the personality traits of the average liberal or conservative was. I found out new things, like the fact that younger people on Facebook were more conservative than older people. Simple enough – there’s nothing new in using data in this way; people have researched how personality and politics are related for centuries. What was new, however, was the sheer volume of data I had access to. In 2011, the database gave me access to 4.5 million Facebook profiles and personality scores. When the study closed in summer 2012, it claims to have had information from 7.5m profiles. This not only meant that our research could be even more accurate (what psychological study have you looked at that surveyed 4.5 million people?), it also gave us unprecedented access to information on which to base new studies. No need to seek permission to use the data in a different way – people had already agreed to that. This was always intended to be an open data source, shared among many academics. What could possibly go wrong? My second piece of work required looking through people’s Facebook profile pictures to see whether how they portrayed themselves was related to their personality. We learned interesting things, like that having alcohol in your profile picture doesn’t mean you’re any less conscientious, in fact, we found it actually correlated significantly with people being more hard-working. But the potential for harm if used for non-academic purposes was, and still is, scary. The research we did allowed us to predict someone’s personality based on what they liked on Facebook; and to predict people’s personalities better than their own friends could. We knew the personality profile of people who tended to like Smirnoff vodka (quite conscientious, by the way, and similar to people who like BMWs). It logically followed that with this data, you might also be able to accurately predict what political messaging to send out to different people; what ads or memes to circulate on their Facebook page during an election in order to secure a win for your client. Kosinski and I had healthy debates about the threat this sort of data posed, and how it could be used to manipulate people. Kosinski pointed out that such research provides the opportunity to speak to people more effectively, based on their own beliefs and dispositions. As he put it when I interviewed him after Trump’s election: “In the past, if you were not interested in what the message was – say you went to school and you were given novels that you weren’t interested in – you would basically just disengage. The hope behind tailoring is that those who were previously excluded will now stay in. They will read, they will become involved in political processes, and so on.’ That is true. This kind of information isn’t used to make people believe what they don’t already. No algorithm can: Spotify’s algorithm (which makes educated guesses based on user’s information) can suggest you listen to new songs based on what it knows you already like, but it can’t make you like music that you hate. The same is true of elections – data won’t make Democrats vote Trump. But it could possibly be used to suppress African American Democrat voters from going to the ballot box by targeting them with memes that remind them of the Clinton administration’s awful record on race. Cambridge Analytica didn’t win the 2016 election; Trump supporters did. Trump’s campaign boosted his popularity using demographic data to tailor messages to people – a method that has been used for centuries, albeit in a more basic way, by targeting women, for instance, or young people. Sure, they used big data to get this vote out, but so did Obama. The problem occurs when this data is taken without people’s consent, and is used to target them without their knowledge. Millions completed the myPersonality study, with transparency around who would use their information, and what for. They had no idea it might be used by Cambridge Analytica. And this developing story may stop Facebook users from agreeing to give away their data. People may even stop using Facebook full stop. But will they stop Googling, watching TV, or sending emails? These companies have a monopoly over people’s leisure and private time. Until they are adequately challenged on the way they use people’s information for financial gain, and held to account for when they behave in illegal or immoral ways, the rest of us can make little difference. As Kosinski points out: “Many, many companies already do what Cambridge Analytica are doing with peoples’ personal data. They just didn’t boast about it, and weren’t hired by Trump.” Come the next election, we may be asking all the same questions again.

The 65-year-old mathematics teacher already had five students cowering inside her room, and she knew that opening her door was breaking protocol. “But I just got such a deep feeling I was needed,” she said. As she peered out into the hallway she saw fifteen students searching desperately for a place to hide and quietly ushered them inside. As she closed the door for the second time, she looked all of them in the eye and gave a short speech she still finds difficult to retell: “I’m telling you from the bottom of my heart, a shooter has to go through me before they get you.” American teachers now receive routine training about what to do when a gunman attacks their school. They are instructed to keep their classroom doors locked, hide with the students out of sight, and stay bolted in until law enforcement enter the room. The goal is to make classrooms appear empty, so the gunman will pass by. But the chaos during the massacre in Parkland, Florida last month, which left 17 students and teachers dead and more than a dozen injured, threw procedure into disarray. As thousands of students poured into the hallways of school buildings after the fire alarm sounded within seconds of the first shots being fired, many teachers were forced to make split second decisions. How could the school go into code red with so many students out of their classrooms? At what point should they lock their doors? “You’re faced with an impossible choice,” said journalism teacher Melissa Falkowski. “Do I hold the door open, and put the kids that I have in here at risk, or do I close it and leave those kids out in the cold?” Trizzino was one of the teachers lauded for breaking the rules. Her door had been locked for the first five minutes of the code red, but when she opened it again, she spotted a group of 15 students trapped in the corridors searching for somewhere to hide. She ushered them in as they thanked her for saving their lives. About 50 feet away - in the Freshman building next door - the 19 year-old gunman, Nikolas Cruz, was still opening fire. Ashley Kurth, a 34 year-old culinary arts teacher, kept her door open for around a minute and a half after code red was called. She pulled dozens of students inside to safety as they ran unwittingly towards the Freshman building, a few feet away. As the sound of gunfire echoed around her, unsure where the shooter was and hearing from students a second shooter may also be on campus, her heart pulsed as she crouched by the door grabbing pupils as they ran past. “The entire time I was shaking, it was sheer adrenaline that kept me there,” she said. She locked up during a lull in the chaos, bundled the group of around 60 children into a storage room and waited over two hours before the police arrived. “I was able to shut my door. But it got to the point when I was standing there, it was very uncomfortable,” she said. “When you see a lull like that there’s only one of two things that’s going to be happening. Either the shooter is coming towards you or there’s nobody left to run by.” “Opening or closing a door… I feel it should be a personal decision,” she said. Cowering with the children among cups and paper plates, Kurth watched live feeds of the shooting on Snapchat. She says she saw the moment that geography teacher Scott Beigel died in the massacre. The 35-year-old was killed as he kept his door open. Just a month before the shooting, teachers at Stoneman Douglas underwent updated training in active shooter procedure. They were played the 911 call from the 2012 Sandy Hook massacre and reminded that many of the 26 teachers and elementary school pupils who were killed that day died in unlocked classrooms. Teachers were told to keep their doors locked at all times during lessons, and, during an active shooter crisis, to lock the door immediately and not open it. But some teachers who appeared to have followed that procedure to the letter were later attacked by Parkland students and parents for locking students out. Jim Gard, a math teacher at Stoneman Douglas, was accused by one of his pupils, Josh Gallagher, of locking the majority of his students “out in the hallway to be slaughtered” after he closed his door, and labeled a “coward”. Another student, Conor Dietrich, agreed, writing on Twitter. “As one of the kids left in the hallway, I want people to understand how terrifying and defenseless I personally felt. The person I had to rely on left us to die and that’s not okay,” he wrote. Gard, who did not reply to interview requests from the Guardian, told a local newspaper that when he closed his classroom door, “I looked back down the hall and no one was around – no one.” Later, as his students hid in their classroom in the dark, he heard a banging on the door, but by the time he walked over to the door, the noise had stopped. “I told the kids we can’t let anyone in,” he told the Sun-Sentinel. “You have to close the door.” None of his students were hurt in the shooting, he said. Other teachers, including one who was inside the Freshman building who lost a number of her pupils in the shooting, have also been criticised by parents for purportedly not doing enough, according to multiple teachers. “The teachers who are being criticized for not letting hundreds and hundreds of kids in their room, they were following district procedure that had just been told to us three to four weeks prior,” said Sarah Lerner, an English teacher in an adjacent building to the shooting, who was another of those to keep her door locked after closing it with 15 students inside. “I don’t think they did anything wrong, I understand the parents and the kids were upset, but they have to realize that by leaving the door open longer, they’re putting everyone in the room at risk.” Teachers had been instructed to pass down the lockdown rules to pupils at the start of every lesson in the weeks after training. Falkowski, the journalism teacher, put it bluntly to her students: “This is a terrible thing for me to say to you, but if you’re not here, I can’t let you in.” The implications of the instructions left her feeling uncomfortable. “This isn’t even a conversation that a teacher should have to have with a student,” Falkowski said. “I don’t think we should be faced with that decision at all, and yet society can’t seem to come together to solve this problem, to stop it from happening.” Dewey Cornell, an education professor at the University of Virginia and one of the country’s leading experts on school safety argued: “We have to stop putting teachers in these terrible and impossible situations.” The key, he said, should be devoting more resources and attention to preventing violence. “We cannot turn every facility into a fortress or have armed guards at every door,” he said. Ernie Rospierski, a 36-year-old history and geography teacher, was working in the Freshman building where Cruz opened fire. He lost three students from the class he was teaching that afternoon and was grazed twice – once on his cheek and once on his hip – with bullets the gunman had intended to kill him. He and his students had evacuated their room at the sound of the fire alarm, then turned back to their classroom when they heard gunfire, leaving a few of them stranded in the hall as the gunman approached. Some of Rospierski’s students had escaped into other classrooms with doors left open. “If it wasn’t for those people willing to keep the doors open a little bit longer, we could have had more kids [killed],” he said. He instructed his remaining students, hiding with him in an alcove, to run toward a stairwell as the shooter momentarily struggled with his weapon. The teacher then slammed the stairwell door behind him and kept it shut with his foot as the shooter failed to pry it open. After a few seconds, Rospierski himself fled down the stairs. “I’m very happy some people didn’t follow protocol 100%,” Rospierski said. But if he had been inside a classroom, faced with the decision of whether to keep his door open, he said, “I don’t know for sure what I would do. I’d like to think I’d hold the door open a little bit longer, but I don’t know about re-opening the door.” Mary Trizzino, the statistics teacher, said she believed it was her duty to lay her body on the line should Cruz have entered her classroom. Despite her severe arthritis, she had planned to dive for the shooter’s feet while a senior year student, armed with a golf club the teacher kept in the closet, would attack his body. Football coach Aaron Feis, who died throwing himself in front of students as the shooter opened fire, appears to have believed the same thing. But many teachers at Stoneman Douglas, including those who acted with spontaneous selflessness, said that it was unfair America should expect its teachers to be heroes, that this was the wrong way to deal with an epidemic of school shootings. “We’re not soldiers that are trained to lay down our lives for people and to jump in front of bullets,” said Kurth, the culinary arts teacher. Rospierski, who repeatedly took risks to protect his students from gunfire, said that was not a choice he should have been forced to make. “This is going to sound kind of bad, but yeah … the school kids are mine, and I’m very, very protective of them, but I like me, too. And nowhere did it say, when I signed up to be a teacher, that said ‘Oh, yeah, by the way in case of an attacker you’re going to have to shield all your kids with your own body,” he said. Many Parkland teachers – even those who are gun owners and support Donald Trump – have rejected the administration’s proposed solution to school shootings: arming teachers. Rospierski used to teach hunter safety and concealed carry firearms courses, making him an ideal candidate for the additional armed security role Trump had suggested some experienced staff could take on. But he called the president’s proposal to arm teachers “the cheap way out” and “the dumbest thing they could do”. “I’ll never carry a gun and be a teacher,” Rospierski said. If teachers were required to carry guns, “My wife and I are looking for a new occupation.” “I didn’t sign up to be a soldier. I signed up to teach kids. I’m not going to have reading writing and arithmetic and life and death.” “Teachers are to teach, not to kill,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/mar/22/eu-expects-escape-trump-steel-aluminium-tariffs-talks","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-23T00:25:52Z","webTitle":"Trump reveals $60bn of fresh tariffs on China as EU wins reprieve","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/22/eu-expects-escape-trump-steel-aluminium-tariffs-talks","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/mar/22/eu-expects-escape-trump-steel-aluminium-tariffs-talks","fields":{"headline":"Trump reveals $60bn of fresh tariffs on China as EU wins reprieve","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Financial markets have taken fright after Donald Trump fired the latest shots in an escalating trade war between the world’s two biggest economies by announcing $60bn (£42.5bn) of further tariffs on China. Amid relief in Brussels that the EU had won a temporary reprieve from Trump’s already announced action to protect the US from imports of steel and aluminium, Wall Street braced itself for retaliation from China. Beijing announced it would consider higher tariffs on pork, aluminium pipe and other goods from the US, a trade worth about $3bn. Trump told reporters that the US trade deficit with Beijing was out of control at about $504bn. “It is the largest deficit of any country in the history of our world. It’s out of control,” the US president said as he signed a memorandum. “We have a tremendous intellectual property theft situation going on, which likewise is hundreds of billions of dollars.” Just 24 hours before tariffs were to be enforced on the EU, the Trump administration announced it was exempting the bloc, along with Australia, Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Mexico and South Korea, while trade talks with those nations were ongoing. The Austrian chancellor, Sebastian Kurz, welcomed the development in a tweet from a summit of EU leaders in Brussels. “A trade war would have damaged both sides,” he said. About £35bn worth of Chinese imports to the US will be affected by tariffs of 25% on steel and 10% on aluminium. The White House said Trump would direct the office of the US trade representative to publish a new list of proposed tariffs within 15 days. They are likely to cover sectors such as robotics, hi-tech trains and aerospace. There will then be 30 days for responses. In January Trump imposed tariffs on solar panels and washing machines. Peter Navarro, director of the office of trade and manufacturing policy, told reporters the US was “strategically defending itself [from] … economic aggression”. US stock markets reacted negatively, with the Dow Jones dropping more than 300 points on Thursday. Caterpillar, 3M and Boeing – all with significant exposure to China – were among the biggest fallers. Bank and tech stocks also fell. At one point, the index was down 500 points, though by lunchtime in the US it had recovered on news that the tariffs would be subject to a period of consultation to be down 1.1% or 287 points. The FTSE-100 closed down 86 at 6952.59 – the first time the index has closed below 7,000 since December 2016. China has warned it would take “all necessary measures” to defend itself. Hua Chunying, a foreign ministry spokeswoman, referred to imports of US soybeans, aeroplanes, cotton and cars, saying they could be viewed as examples of unequal trade. The US also “refuses to export what China wants”, she said, possibly referring to restrictions on technology and military sales. “We are firmly against unilateralism and protectionism. China will not watch our legal interest being harmed,” Hua added. Dozens of industry groups signed an open letter to the White House last weekend warning that “the imposition of sweeping tariffs would trigger a chain reaction of negative consequences for the US economy, provoking retaliation; stifling US agriculture, goods and services exports, and raising costs for businesses and consumers”. The EU has argued in recent months that as a close ally of the US it should be exempt, and had threatened to impose a series of retaliatory measures including import duties on their products. Speaking before Trump’s comments, the US trade representative, Robert Lighthizer, told a Senate committee that the president had personally decided “to pause the imposition of tariffs with respect to those countries” with which trade talks were ongoing. Trump has had few kind words to say about the EU, claiming it had made life difficult for US exporters. Earlier this month he told reporters: “The European Union has been particularly tough on the United States. They make it almost impossible for us to do business with them.” As the proposed further tariffs on China were unveiled Trump called for the EU to respond to his temporary amnesty with a willingness to cut tariffs on US exports to Europe. The EU’s response is among topics on the agenda at an EU leaders summit dinner on Thursday. Cecilia Malmström, the EU commissioner for trade, held two days of talks with her US counterpart, Wilbur Ross, before the announcement. The reprieve for the EU was only given a cautious welcome by British steel makers. Gareth Stace, the director of UK Steel, warned that US protectionism would still have a heavy impact on European countries unless Brussels took its own measures to stem the flow of aluminium and steel into the EU. “Tariffs are set to divert millions of tonnes of steel away from the US towards other open markets,” he said. “At 40m tonnes a year, the EU is by far the largest import market in the world and will be the obvious target for major steel exporters to the US such as Turkey and Russia.” He added: “The top priority here must be for the [European] commission to swiftly introduce safeguard measures to guard against further expected import surges.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/apr/02/time-to-stockpile-irn-bru-how-sugar-tax-change-nations-favourite-drinks","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-02T10:48:16Z","webTitle":"Time to stockpile Irn-Bru?

How the sugar tax will change our favourite drinks","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Milkybar Wowsomes melt in your mouth like candy floss. They might have a cringe-making name but, washed down with a can of Irn-Bru, they may be the taste of the future. The low-sugar future, that is. Nestlé, one of the most criticised of the handful of companies that dominate processed food across the globe, has put itself on the side of the angels in the great battle for our girths being waged by Public Health England (PHE) on behalf of the UK government. It has found a high-tech way to make its Wowsomes with 30% less sugar than standard Milkybars. Furthermore, the giant company claims to have taken 2.6bn teaspoons of sugar out of its food and drinks over the past three years – an extraordinary claim that might cause some to question what on earth so much sugar was doing in them in the first place. The war on sugar is making ground. On Friday, the sugar tax on soft drinks will come into effect, hitting any that contain more than 5g of sugar per 100ml. The manufacturers will have to pay a levy of 18p a litre to the Treasury, or 24p a litre if the sugar content is over 8g per 100ml. Some drinks prices will rise. Many will not, because the drinks manufacturers have found ways to get the sugar levels down, usually with artificial sweeteners. But that’s not all. Food companies were instructed a year ago by PHE to cut the sugar in their products by 20% by 2020, and 5% in the first 12 months – hence the birth of Milkybar Wowsomes. It is voluntary, but the industry is under no illusion that if it doesn’t co-operate, the government will do something more brutal – probably imposing another sugar tax, this time on what we eat. For years the food and drink industry did little to help with the obesity crisis, holding to the line that it was an individual’s responsibility to keep an eye on their weight and their absolute right to choose the foods they liked, while blaming lack of exercise and the TV culture. Governments let them get away with it, or indulged in a bit of gesture politics. But the days of the responsibility deal – an initiative of the 2010-2015 coalition government – are long gone. Food companies must look back wistfully at the panels convened by Andrew Lansley, then health secretary, where companies would offer to cut a few calories here, do a bit of labelling there and never got called to account. There was no real measurement of what was being done, because different companies made different pledges and comparisons were nigh impossible. This is different. The big stick is finally being wielded. Drinks manufacturers have been scrambling to reformulate their sweet and fizzy drinks to cut the sugar levels and avoid the levy. Tesco has been one of the most successful, bringing 85% of its own-brand soft drinks below the 5g level. Britvic claims to have done even better, with 94% of its drinks, including Robinson’s Refresh’d, Purdey’s and Tango, now low enough in sugar to be exempt. That drops to 72% if you include the PepsiCo portfolio, for which it is the supplier in Great Britain and Ireland. PepsiMax has no sugar, but original Pepsi is unchanged. So is original Coca-Cola, a so-called “heritage brand” that accounts for 14% of UK sugary fizzy drinks retail sales, according to market research provider Euromonitor, with Pepsi trailing some distance behind. Each original Coke can will defiantly continue to contain more than nine teaspoons of sugar. If you want less, choose Coke Zero Sugar, the company says. So the price of Coke original will go up, but not as much as it might have, because the bottles will shrink from 1.75 litres to 1.5 litres. The price increase passed on by the company is just 20p. “People love the taste … and have told us not to change,” a spokesman said. Coca-Cola is a massive global brand, its bottles to be found in every African village and even the odd Mexican church, substituting for communion wine. Tinkering with the sacred formula may have been a step too far for its international executives. But there is also the sobering example of what happened with Irn-Bru. In Scotland, where Irn-Bru is considered a national treasure, an online petition demanded manufacturer AG Barr drop its plans to more than halve the sugar content from 10.3g to 4.7g of sugar per 100ml. “Hands off our Irn-Bru,” it declared. In January, fans were said to be stockpiling cans and bottles of the original in the hope they could ride out the winds of change. Lucozade also hit major problems. Cutting the sugar and adding sweeteners caused a big dip in sales of the energy drink. The Grocer trade magazine reported a decline of 8.4% in a year. The bleak truth is that reformulation isn’t easy or even sometimes satisfactory. Swapping sugar for artificial sweeteners changes the taste of a soft drink. And when it comes to cakes, biscuits and desserts, it gets really complicated, because sugar is not just a sweetener – it helps raise cakes, give texture to pastries and stabilise ice-cream. Leatherhead Food Research has been helping food and drinks companies trying to pick their way through the minefield. It lends not only its scientific and technical expertise on how to make a low-sugar biscuit, but the services of its sensory panel. This is a group of people, not unlike wine tasters, who are selected for the sensitivity of their tastebuds and their ability to describe what is going on when something melts in the mouth. That biscuit can be “crumbly”, “cloying”, “crunchy”, “burnt”, “uncooked”, “sweet” or “salt”. They will assess the “overall aroma intensity” as well as the “hardness on first bite”. Kathy Groves, the head of microscopy, says there is no way she could be on the panel herself. “Someone like me is hopeless. I’m terrible. For me, it’s sweet or maybe a bit bitter. I can’t describe it. But these are people who really can distinguish differences in small flavour notes or different textures and so on.” The ideal way to reduce sugar in food might be what was done with salt – stealth reformulation, a gradual reduction over years, so that nobody noticed. But, as the industry’s Food and Drink Federation (FDF) complains, that’s not a runner because PHE wants results within the first year. “We lost the argument even though [the campaign groups] accept on salt it was a better way to do it,” say Tim Rycroft, the corporate affairs director. There are two types of artificial sweetener, Groves explains: bulk sweeteners, used in large quantities in food, and intense sweeteners, used in small amounts. The latter include aspartame, which is around 200 times as sweet as sucrose (sugar); saccharin, which is 300 to 500 times as sweet, and stevia, newer and plant-based, which is 200 to 300 times as sweet. The record is held by a new sweetener on the block, derived in part from aspartame, called advantame, which is thought to be 37,000 times sweeter than sugar. They all have different flavour profiles – Groves says that some have a hint of liquorice to them, for instance. The sugar hit may be faster with some than others. But it’s tricky to substitute these in drinks and keep the flavour. “I personally prefer diet drinks now,” says Groves, “but there’s no doubt they taste different from the sugary version.” And the other issue is the anxiety that many people feel about artificial sweeteners. According to Cancer Research UK: “Large studies looking at people have now provided strong evidence that artificial sweeteners are safe for humans.” But that doesn’t reassure everybody. As NHS Choices acknowledges, aspartame, for one, has been “extremely controversial” in spite of investigations giving it a clean bill of health, including one of half a million people by the US National Cancer Institute and another by the European Food Safety Authority. The only issue found was for people with a rare genetic disorder called phenylketonuria (PKU), who are unable to metabolise aspartame, leading it to accumulate at harmful levels. The bulk sweeteners are called polyols and they are derivatives of sugar. There are regulations around their use, including the requirement that any product containing more than 10% needs to be labelled “excessive consumption may produce laxative effects” – not an attractive thought. In cakes and biscuits, “the sugar is a physical presence”, says Groves. “It has a huge influence on the colour, the crunchiness, the flavour, the way it breaks down while you are eating it, the texture, the rise in the oven. The whole basis of the product is altered when you reduce the sugar.” Changing the recipe using bulk sweeteners and other ingredients such as more fat means that low-sugar cakes and biscuits may not be low in calories, which somewhat defeats the object. Nestlé appears to be trying to avoid sweeteners. The Wowsomes are made with “restructured sugar”, the company says, made by spraying sugar, milk and water into warm air, which dries it into an amorphous form, full of holes under the microscope. Like candy floss, the sugar is supposed to melt on the tongue, giving a sweeter taste in the mouth. With KitKat, it has changed the recipe to cut sugar but add more milk and cocoa. Other companies have just cut the portion size. Toblerone has been criticised for spacing out its triangular pieces. It is not just about the rising price of ingredients, the reason given by the company in response to complaints.. PHE suggested smaller size portions were also an acceptable way of cutting sugar. The FDF says that companies are willing to cooperate, but they don’t like being under pressure to deliver results in just a year and they are worried about the imminent report from Public Health England. “They are waiting quite anxiously for the sugar reduction report,” says Rycroft. “We know it will be loads and loads of data. But what will be the tone? Clearly it will be a mixed picture and not altogether brilliant. Some may need to go faster.” He hopes PHE will say the voluntary approach is working and they should stick with it. But, “if it is to do with naming and shaming and lack of progress and insufficient engagement, it undermines [the companies’ efforts]”. Cutting 20% of sugar is a challenging goal, he says. “Companies are really trying to do this stuff. By all means judge us at the end of the four years, but don’t start 12 months in saying it is a failure or a success.” But in a way, PHE is just pushing the industry further down a road it needs to travel. There has been so much publicity about the evils of sugar and unhealthy foods that people are already voting with their wallets. Emma Gubisch, the head of insight at Leatherhead, says their recent research shows that 44% of consumers are trying to eat less sugar. Euromonitor supports that. Sales of sugary drinks have been falling rapidly. Coca-Cola’s in the UK “have been declining by double digits over the last five years”, according to research analyst Florence Schmit, “suffering from a general trend in the industry towards lower-sugar variants in carbonates and soft drinks overall”. Add to this the health and wellness trend, “zooming bottled water sales, with myriad functional water launches, which are set to grow by a whopping 50% over the next five years” and the writing seems to be on the wall for sugary drinks, and foods as well. But persuading us we want to buy the new low-sugar versions of our old favourites is going to be a struggle."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/apr/05/i-became-a-killer-fatal-road-accident-forgiveness","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-05T05:00:41Z","webTitle":"'I had become a killer': how I learned to live again, after running a man over","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/apr/05/i-became-a-killer-fatal-road-accident-forgiveness","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/apr/05/i-became-a-killer-fatal-road-accident-forgiveness","fields":{"headline":"'I had become a killer': how I learned to live again, after running a man over","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"‘Why do you think you didn’t see him?” It’s so obvious but it comes like a kick in the belly. The words hang in the air and I stare at him blankly. Why didn’t I see him? That’s the great unanswered and unanswerable question that has haunted me for months. “If I knew the answer to that …” I say. Tears well yet again. They come instantly these days. “Was it because you were dazzled, perhaps? The driver coming towards you flashed his headlights …” Is he leading me on, offering a neat escape? He’s cool and practical, this police officer. The other one speaks less but smiles more. They are doing their job, getting the facts and sifting the evidence before deciding whether to prosecute me. After all, a man has died. Someone must be guilty. “No,” I say. “I don’t think I was dazzled.” It matters hugely to me that everything is rigorous, scrupulously honest. Whatever the findings, there must be no hint of deception, no room for doubt. It’s April 2016, four months after the accident. This limbo will hold me in its grasp for another six months, until the inquest takes place. I had always loved driving. Before I was old enough to learn I would sit on the cracked red leather seat of Dad’s Austin Cambridge, pretending to change gears, negotiate traffic, double-declutching on steep hills. Mum had learned to drive on tractors in the Women’s Land Army during the war. She taught Dad, my brother, my sister and finally me. At 17 I passed the test, bought a Morris Minor for £200 and went on to relish the freedom of the open road for 40 years. For my 60th birthday my treat was to spend three weeks driving from New York to San Francisco with no planned route, making it up each day. On 31 December 2015, I was in Norfolk for a Christmas break, enjoying the big skies and windswept cliffs. I drove a couple of miles to take someone a thank-you gift and decided to head into the town of Holt for a bite to eat. The cafe closed at 5pm and I made sure not to stay to the last minute, aware that the staff would want to clean up and get ready for parties. I was planning a quiet evening with a glass or two of prosecco. Nothing out of the ordinary. That’s how my life looked: predictable and comfortable. By 5pm it was as dark as night. I headed east out of Holt and swung round the righthand bend, preparing to join the A148, the bypass. From a side road a small car nipped in front of me and slipped into a space in the traffic. Someone’s in a hurry, I thought. I turned left on to the main road, and began to move up through the gears. That’s when a car coming towards me flashed its lights. This used to happen to me a lot in the Mini. So much that a couple of years earlier I’d taken it back to BMW to get it checked; yes, my headlights were wrongly adjusted and I had inadvertently been annoying other drivers. So when this driver flashed, I instinctively flashed back: “No, those aren’t my main beams – these are, see?” The time between my flash and the impact was infinitesimal. And yet in that moment I glimpsed a face in the road. It had a look of incredulity, as if saying, “What the hell are you doing?” The moment was so brief. From seeing that shape, a hunched outline against the black of the night, to the sickening smash was instantaneous. No time to react, to respond, to brake. I pulled over, shouting, “No, no, no!” I understood at once that nothing could be the same. Lives had changed in those seconds. There was a figure lying on the road. One or two people were around it. Nobody spoke. Or if they did I couldn’t hear. I spat grit from my mouth; later I understood that it was fragments of glass from the shattered windscreen. “Has someone got a phone? Have you called for an ambulance?” I was shouting. Why didn’t anyone reply? I couldn’t go near the body; I was terrified of what I might see. My legs gave way and I slumped to the kerb. A woman touched me on the arm. It felt the kindest thing ever. But then she said, “Don’t worry. It’ll be all right.” And I knew that was a lie. Police arrived in minutes. I was led to sit in one of their big vehicles and an officer, who introduced himself as Jason, asked me questions. He wrote my words down laboriously and asked me to sign my statement. My hands were shaking so much I couldn’t hold the pen. Eventually I scrawled my name on the paper. I blew into a bag, had a swab taken from my cheek. My phone was examined; had I been texting or making a call? No, the last message was from my friend Marian when I was in the cafe. Something banal, back then, a world away. I was taken to a shop where a kind couple made cups of tea for me and all the police. There seemed to be so many of them now. “The air ambulance has taken him to Addenbrooke’s,” a policeman called Bob said. “But he’s not in a good way.” There had been a helicopter? “Why do you think you didn’t see him?” I don’t know, I don’t know! It was dark, he was wearing dark clothes. “Was I dazzled?” I don’t think so. “Had I been drinking?” I doubted myself. Perhaps I had. No, I’d had a coffee. “Was I distracted, tuning the radio?” No, it was off. My car: were the lights working? Yes, they had been checked. The tyres, the brakes … Everything was as it should be. There was no explanation. Two years on, there is no explanation. No way to make sense of it. “Who can come and collect you?” Bob asked me. “A family member?” Instinct said I wanted my mummy and daddy. Both dead. My boyfriend – well, my ex – was in Canada. My best friend was in France, my sister in Shropshire, my brother in Ireland. I shook my head, lost. “Or a neighbour?” Nuala, next door, was 80, frail and didn’t drive. There was no one who could help me, take this horror away, kiss it better. I had two friends who lived an hour away. A call was made. John and Laura arrived, wrapped me up in a blanket to take me away. On the journey to their house I began to feel nauseous and John stopped the car so I could be sick. It was a visceral heave, my guts wrenching and churning. Again and again the muscles strained and squeezed involuntarily. Then came the yawning. Huge, ridiculous gulping movements beyond my control, the jaw stretching until it was painful. In any other context this would have been comical. I stayed with John and Laura for several days; mostly I lay in bed not sleeping. I was numb with shock and pain. They talked to me; I heard some of the words. One day I put clothes on and stepped five paces outside into the garden. It felt like an achievement. I sat in a wooden chair until I was cold and then retreated inside. I felt so fragile, totally vulnerable. As if I had lost a layer of skin. It was while I was at John and Laura’s that Bob called. The man I hit was in his 70s. He had a name now: Michael Rawson. He was in hospital and was “critical but stable”. I imagined him immobile, tubes and machines keeping him alive. And I allowed myself to picture us meeting, me carrying flowers to his bedside, distraught with apology. Or would we be angry with each other? “What were you doing?” “I could ask the same of you.” “You flashed me. I thought you’d seen me and were letting me cross the road.” “I flashed the other driver.” Whatever the dialogue, the scene assumed that he would live. But six days into the new year the call came: “Michael Rawson didn’t survive.” There is no way to describe the anguish of hearing those words. There was no chance to undo it. I had become a killer. A death is always huge. But others I had witnessed had been after illness – cancer, dementia – and there had been a dying process of months or years, a chance to be involved, say farewell, make adjustments and prepare for the end. The brutality of this was hell. To be responsible for someone’s death is an unimaginable position. There are so many questions. All the what-ifs of leaving the cafe a minute earlier or later, of glimpsing the man in the road in time to avoid him, of his pulling through and recovering. But they are fantasies. “It wasn’t your fault,” I was told so many times. “It could have been any one of us.” I wouldn’t wish this on my worst enemy. “What do I do with this?” I had asked John on the night of the crash. “I don’t know,” he had said. “But you will.” A week or so into January, when I was able to function again, I went shopping for new clothes, all black, as a mark of respect. “Are you in mourning?” someone asked me, thinking they were making a joke. I said, “Yes,” and the conversation ended. I stopped shaving because it seemed an insensitive self-indulgence to pay attention to my appearance. I had therapy; a lot of therapy. In those sessions I cried until I thought I’d never stop. I became terrified of crowds and loud noises, cowering against a wall and blocking my ears if I heard a police siren. I’m still claustrophobic and panicky in enclosed spaces. I can’t cope with any gathering of more than a handful. I wait on kerbs for the green man to show before crossing, even when there is no traffic. No risks must be taken. I chose half a dozen people to tell. Each time I related the facts I dissolved. I gripped one friend’s hand so tightly I damaged her fingers. The shock was identical every day, endlessly repeating. I went to see my doctor. He signed me off work, handing me a slip of paper that referred to post-traumatic stress disorder. Me? Surely not. I’m the strong, resilient one. The weeks passed, the seasons changed. Eventually the date of the inquest was announced: 28 October. My solicitor said that as I hadn’t been called by the coroner to give evidence I shouldn’t attend. But my instinct told me I needed to be there, to hear the summing up, to witness this public reckoning. People talk of closure. But for me, the inquest was the opposite: the feeling of something that had been gripping me tightly around the throat opening up and allowing me to breathe again. “No blame should attach to the driver” were the words I’d waited 10 months to hear. The following day I shaved off my beard and consigned my black garb to the back of the wardrobe. A few weeks later I asked Laura if I could visit her and try to drive again. I wept as I began but the mantra of “I can do this … I’m a good driver” allowed me to sit at the wheel for half an hour and pilot her car around the country roads. Freed from the limbo I knew there was more I needed to do. I contacted the residence where Michael Rawson had lived. He had got off the bus and was crossing the road to go home when the accident happened. I was fearful of animosity; after all I was the driver who had killed one of their friends. But my fear was ungrounded; I was welcomed with kindness and empathy. And laughter – something I had denied myself. I began to learn about Michael the man and his character. “He was a proper rogue!” I was told. “He would take risks. Despite having two strokes he was determined to live his life. Even in the winter, with snow on the ground, he would struggle into town for an Indian or a Chinese meal. He couldn’t bear to sit around with the others watching the telly.” I learned that Michael had studied at the same university as me, but 15 years earlier. His profession of linguistics took him around the world; he had lived in South Africa and Canada. His passions were photography and classical music. He had a vast collection of CDs and would invite friends to listen to his favourite composers for hours at a time, educating them as he shared his excitement. I was shown a photograph of him, with a bemused half-smile on his face. I felt as if I was being introduced to him, meeting the man I had killed. I said, “Hello.” Others imagined my meeting him too. “You’re like him in many ways. You’d have had interesting conversations.” As I heard about him from his friends, Michael came alive to me. Yes, it’s ironic but that’s exactly how it seemed: he came alive. No longer merely a death, a statistic; he became a man who lived a full life. One of his closest friends told me, “I was angry with you when I heard what had happened. But the police said you hadn’t been drinking, weren’t speeding or using your phone, and my anger dissipated. Michael would have been angry with you too. Oh yes, he’d have been very angry. But then … he would have forgiven you.” What a kind but bizarre offering. The idea that Michael would forgive me for killing him. This friend even took me to the woodland burial plot where I was able to spend time saying the things I needed to express. To apologise, of course. And now, two years on? I am aware of Michael every day, aware of his death and my part in that. But also of the existence before my car ended his life. The PTSD continues in unexpected ways. I’m still hypersensitive to noise, anxious in crowds. I cry at the tiniest prompting, often at kindness and evidence of a shared humanity. But I’m angry too. When I see pedestrians texting as they cross the road I shout at them: “Don’t be stupid! That’s so dangerous!” I struggle daily with the riddle of how to go on living as the person I have become. To be The Man Who Killed, or not be defined by that one event? Throughout those almost unbearable days, did I ever consider that taking my own life would be the right thing to do? No. In fact the accident has given me an urgent duty to live a more worthwhile life, and in doing so to honour Michael Rawson. That responsibility I bear willingly; it will be with me always. • Meeting the Man I Killed will be broadcast on BBC Radio 4 at 8pm on 10 April and 5pm on 15 April.

I went to share this with her just before the birth of her daughter, Amy. Each day I brought back snippets of information from the world of publishing acquired through my job as an editor at Penguin Books in Kings Road, which Michele crafted into her “bits” of prose, as she called them. These would then be read to me totally transformed, unrecognisable and brilliantly funny – forerunners of her columns. Her aim at first seemed not so much publication as collaborative pleasure, and her models were centred round the 18th century: Swift’s A Modest Proposal and Gulliver’s Travels; Lord Hervey’s Memoirs, which she would read out with wild gesticulation over dinner; Sterne’s Tristram Shandy; Burton’s Anatomy of Melancholy from the previous century; and Hazlitt from the succeeding one. Gradually, pieces began to appear in Vogue and in the literary magazine Bananas. Michele’s journalistic instincts were unerring. When in 2011 Brent council announced the closure of 50% of the borough’s libraries it was to her I first turned, and in a column she denounced the move in characteristic terms – “What do you want? Libraries all over the bloody place?” Brilliant and fearless, she would “rail at, downright” the things she abhorred, and we her readers and friends revelled in her so doing."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"education/2018/mar/28/uk-university-staff-to-vote-on-latest-pensions-offer","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-28T18:31:42Z","webTitle":"UK university staff to vote on latest pensions offer","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2018/mar/28/uk-university-staff-to-vote-on-latest-pensions-offer","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/education/2018/mar/28/uk-university-staff-to-vote-on-latest-pensions-offer","fields":{"headline":"UK university staff to vote on latest pensions offer","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The bitter dispute between universities and their staff over pensions may soon be resolved, after staff were asked to vote on the latest offer to renegotiate the changes being proposed by employers. The University and College Union (UCU) announced on Friday that it would electronically ballot its members next week over an offer to reconsider the controversial pension proposals, which the union claimed would have cost retired staff thousands of pounds a year in lost benefits. A statement from UCU said the union’s higher education committee had sought clarification, but after a close vote opted to ask its members to decide on the proposal for a joint panel of experts to look at the valuation of the pension scheme that provoked the dispute. The Universities UK (UUK) proposal also pledges to maintain the current contributions and retirement benefits until at least April 2019 while the review by the panel of experts takes place. Sally Hunt, UCU’s general secretary, said: “These latest proposals were won by the solid action of UCU members and now is the time for them to have their say on what happens next.” Lecturers, librarians, researchers and administrators at more than 60 British universities have held 14 days of strikes since February, over the proposals by the UUK group that would have ended defined benefits pensions that give a protected retirement income. The union said that strike action already approved for the week beginning 16 April would still go ahead as planned, affecting 13 universities including Manchester, Cardiff, Oxford, St Andrews, Leeds and Southampton. UCU also warned that if the dispute was not resolved there would be industrial action aimed at disrupting exams and assessments period at 65 universities, starting in April and continuing into July – raising the prospect that end-of-year exams would be cut or cancelled. In a worst-case scenario, students at the end of their courses could find themselves unable to graduate if crucial exams cannot be invigilated, marked or assessed. Already hundreds of external examiners – who provide vital oversight in maintaining academic standards between institutions – have resigned after a call by UCU, creating further difficulties in running this summer’s exams. At the centre of the dispute is changes employers want to make to the Universities Superannuation Scheme (USS), the country’s largest private sector pension scheme with 400,000 members at more than 60 universities and nearly 300 similar institutions, such as the Royal Society and Cancer Research UK. Proposals by UUK would sharply curtail university staff pensions by ending defined benefit. Instead, UUK proposed to use defined contributions instead, that tailor retirement payouts to the state of the pension fund at the time. A desire to keep defined benefits pensions has been behind the industrial action taken across 65 universities and campuses, but the complex nature of pensions schemes and regulations has meant that restructuring the UUK proposals has been fraught with difficulty. The strikers have particularly disputed the USS management’s valuation of the pension scheme, which showed a £6.1bn deficit and provoked the UUK effort to end defined benefits. USS institutional members currently make contributions worth 18% of salaries into the scheme, while staff members each contribute 8% – but the recent valuations suggest that one or both parties would have to raise their contributions substantially to keep post-retirement benefits at the levels currently enjoyed. A spokesperson for UUK said a joint panel of experts “will help to build confidence in the valuation process and assumptions. It will also give time to pause, to reflect and to rebuild the trust that has been damaged over the past few months.” But the employers group also wanted strikes to be put on hold. UUK said: “Suspension of this action would be a huge relief to students ahead of the main exam period.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2018/mar/28/rakesh-kapoor-ceo-reckitt-benckiser-bonus-pay-cut-11m","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-28T16:19:12Z","webTitle":"CEO of firm behind Dettol and Durex has pay cut by £11m","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/mar/28/rakesh-kapoor-ceo-reckitt-benckiser-bonus-pay-cut-11m","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/mar/28/rakesh-kapoor-ceo-reckitt-benckiser-bonus-pay-cut-11m","fields":{"headline":"CEO of firm behind Dettol and Durex has pay cut by £11m","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The boss of the firm behind household brands ranging from Dettol to Durex has had his pay slashed by £11m – but will still pocket £12.5m in salary and bonuses. Rakesh Kapoor, chief executive of Reckitt Benckiser, was entitled to a pay packet worth £23.7m under the terms of his contract but the company said he had volunteered to give some of it back because the company’s recent performance had not been exceptional. The share price has tumbled from £81 to £59 in the last nine months. The FTSE 100 firm’s remuneration committee, which sets the pay of its executives, decided he should hand back half of his long-term incentive pay, a bonus reflecting performance between 2014 and 2017. The decision, which cost Kapoor £11m, followed conversations with Reckitt Benckiser shareholders, some of whom expressed concern that the company’s pay policy permits excessive payouts. The remuneration committee is also thought to have taken public opinion into account, following recent outcry over £110m handed to the boss of housebuilder Persimmon, a deal described as obscene by Liberal Democrat leader Vince Cable. Mary Harris, who has been reviewing Reckitt’s pay policy since becoming remuneration committee chair in November 2017, said: “At RB we pay for performance. “Although shareholders enjoyed £16bn in value creation over the period, which demonstrates our performance culture, we recognised that 2017 was a challenging year. “The CEO volunteered a cut to the vesting outcomes as the committee deemed fit. Based on the committee’s rigorous evaluation of performance in the round and alignment of pay outcomes, we then exercised our discretion to reduce the vesting outcome.” Harris is preparing to overhaul the company’s executive pay structure after sounding out shareholders during a two-day roadshow after taking the position. While next year’s bonus will be calculated under the same terms, the maximum pot available to the company’s executives after that is expected to fall. Reckitt has a history of attracting criticism for high pay deals, with Kapoor’s predecessor Bart Becht coming under fire in 2010 over a pay-and-shares deal worth more than £90m. Stefan Stern, director of the remuneration thinktank High Pay Centre, said: “In a way it’s encouraging if both the board and the chief executive are recognising that the potential payout was far too big. “There’s a glimmer of reality dawning in this otherwise dark world of excessive pay. It does also reveal the fact that the contract he was on, and these elaborate and pseudo-sophisticated pay contracts are hopelessly flawed if, when you tap all the numbers in and hit return, it comes up with a number that’s ridiculous.” Kapoor was entitled to a pay-and-bonus deal worth £23.7m based on growth in the company’s earnings per share of more than 10% over the three years from 2014 to 2017. But the company’s recent poor share price performance is thought to have been a key factor in convincing Kapoor that he could not accept the full sum. Shares in Reckitt, which also makes Nurofen, Clearasil and Veet, have fallen from £68 at the beginning of 2017 to less than £60 on Wednesday, the day the pay figure was released. The decline follows a difficult year for Reckitt when it was hit by sluggish market conditions as well as several factors specific to the company that led to it undershooting profit forecasts. It suffered a boycott of its products in South Korea after a 2016 scandal that saw it pay £300m to the relatives of people who suffered illness and fatal lung injuries linked to humidifier sterilisers sold by the company. That affair saw Kapoor’s pay slashed for 2016 cut from £25.5m to £14.6m, even though he was not in charge of the company when the products were sold. Reckitt also suffered a cyber-attack in 2017, while sales were affected by low demand for expensive footcare products in its Scholl division, including the Velvet Smooth Electronic Foot File."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2018/mar/28/donald-glover-deadpool-script-tweets-industry-racism","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-28T15:59:06Z","webTitle":"Donald Glover tweets mock Deadpool script slamming industry racism","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/mar/28/donald-glover-deadpool-script-tweets-industry-racism","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2018/mar/28/donald-glover-deadpool-script-tweets-industry-racism","fields":{"headline":"Donald Glover tweets mock Deadpool script slamming industry racism","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Just days after it was announced that Donald Glover and his brother and collaborator Stephen Glover would no longer be working with FX and Marvel on the Deadpool animated series, the Emmy-winning Atlanta creator shared a mock 15-page script for the series on Twitter. In a thread that began, “For the record: I wasn’t too busy to work on Deadpool,” Glover included various pages of a script for the series finale in which Deadpool wonders why his animated series was shelved. The plot takes Deadpool to Africa, where he must protect the world’s last male northern white rhino, Sudan, who died in Kenya last week. “You know, I’m not mad about this whole ‘cancelled’ thing,” says Deadpool in the script. “I mean, is it even a good time to have a violent, gun loving white man ranting on TV? Other than the PRESIDENT?” “Do you think they canceled the show because of racism?!” Deadpool continues, in conversation with Sudan. “Yeah, all the writers were black. The references were pretty black, too. I heard they went over lunch budget ordering Jamaican food at least once a week.” The script is full of references to pop culture, including Johnny Depp, the Chainsmokers, Taylor Swift, bitcoin, Jeff Bezos, John Oliver’s Last Week Tonight, Facebook, and even the Beyoncé “biting” fiasco. Moreover, Glover appears to be taking a swipe at Marvel and FX, which cited “creative differences” as the reason for parting ways with Glover on the project. “It just feels like everyone wants something different, but no one wants to do anything different to get it,” Deadpool continues. “Doesn’t Marvel have enough feel-good minority shows everyone supports but doesn’t watch? I mean, I think our show woulda been funny. I just wanted a place to be honest.” After it was announced that the 10-episode Deadpool series was canned, rumors swirled that Glover was too busy for the project. Glover produces, writes for, and stars in his FX series Atlanta, makes music as Grammy-winning Childish Gambino, and is set to appear as Lando Calrissian in the upcoming Han Solo prequel. Some of Glover’s tweets, with photos of the Deadpool script, appear below."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"artanddesign/2018/mar/30/the-week-in-art-kens-show-tate-liverpool-holocaust-rembrandt-durer","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-30T11:00:19Z","webTitle":"Tate insider touches the soul of painting and Freud flees Vienna – the week in art","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/mar/30/the-week-in-art-kens-show-tate-liverpool-holocaust-rembrandt-durer","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2018/mar/30/the-week-in-art-kens-show-tate-liverpool-holocaust-rembrandt-durer","fields":{"headline":"Tate insider touches the soul of painting and Freud flees Vienna – the week in art","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Exhibition of the week Ken’s Show This is a passionate selection of soul-touching art by veteran Tate art handler Ken Simons.

It is one of the paintings he made of the garden of the institution near Arles where he was hospitalised after mutilating his ear. Every bright blade of grass is a stabbing thrust of pain, made all the worse by its emerald beauty. Butterflies that, unlike the walled-in artist, can flutter where they like absorb his acute gaze. To look this closely at a bit of grass is as obsessive as the fairy world the British painter Richard Dadd saw as a patient in Bedlam. Yet Van Gogh looks through the pain to drink in life in all its savage glory. He sees infinity in a blade of grass. • National Gallery, London.

The biggest hostile takeover bid in the UK for nearly a decade has pitted one of Britain’s largest industrial groups, which began as a south Wales ironworks in 1759, against a company set up in 2003 with the aim of buying up and turning around underperforming businesses. Both companies upped the ante in the 24 hours before Thursday’s 1pm deadline for investors to cast their ballots on the controversial deal. Melrose needs 50% plus one share for acceptance and will walk away if it does not get the required support. It will have to make an announcement before 5pm. In a final appeal to investors, Melrose stressed its commitment to improving “not only GKN, but the UK economy”. But GKN’s chairman, Mike Turner, said the comment “smacks of desperation”. The government waded in this week in a last-minute intervention to demand binding commitments from Melrose, citing concerns for national security in light of GKN’s work for the armed forces. In response, Melrose pledged to keep its headquarters and stock market listing in the UK for at least five years, to maintain GKN’s research and development spending, and to keep its aerospace division until April 2023. Turner hit out at this “rushed” commitment, saying Melrose had limited its strategic flexibility for the aerospace business and describing the firm as “virtual novices in aerospace”. The GKN management’s alternative plan is to merge its automotive arm with US firm Dana in a £4.4bn deal, leaving it with its aerospace business. Melrose has accused GKN of conducting a “hasty fire sale”. The bidder’s chairman, Christopher Miller, said on Wednesday: “Since we made our approach, GKN has repeatedly changed its strategy and contradicted itself. We believe this lack of candour and strategic vision indicates more than simply a management team in denial about its own abilities.” It also emerged that Labour MP Jack Dromey and Conservative MP Jeremy Lefroy have written to the chief executive of HM Revenue &amp; Customs, Jon Thompson, to complain that a substantial proportion of shares in GKN are being controlled by short-term investors in such a way that they will not have to pay tax if their shares are acquired by Melrose. The two MPs expressed concerns that a chunk of the engineering group was controlled by arbitrageurs holding shares via derivatives, meaning they were not liable for stamp duty on disposal. Shareholders are divided, with those publicly backing Melrose, including Elliott Advisors and Aviva Investors, accounting for nearly 10% of the shareholder base, compared with 9% for those supporting the GKN board, including Columbia Threadneedle and Jupiter Asset Management. Hedge funds, mostly merger arbitrage funds, are estimated to control 20%-25% of GKN’s shares and could tip the balance. GKN’s troubles began last year when problems at its North American aerospace business prompted a series of profit warnings and led to its chief executive-designate being ousted. The subsequent fall in its share price to 294.3p in early December made the company vulnerable to a takeover bid. GKN’s new chief executive, Anne Stevens, a former senior executive at US carmaker Ford, has spent the past two-and-a-half months fending off Melrose’s hostile bid. The board was quick to reject its initial bid worth £7bn on 12 January and has argued that the company is worth more than £5 a share. But Melrose’s “final” cash-and-shares offer on 12 March valued it at 462.7p, based on its share price at the close of business on Wednesday. GKN and its predecessor firms made cannonballs for the Napoleonic wars, a specialised tank for D-Day and millions of steel helmets for the second world war, as well as tracks for Brunel’s Great Western Railway. Today, its components are used in the Boeing 737 jet and Black Hawk helicopter as well as Volkswagen and Ford cars.

Recycling bottles won’t fix it","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"West Wales, last weekend. The old foam mattress lying waterlogged on an otherwise clean beach might have been at sea for months before it was washed up on the tide. A large bit of it had broken off, and the rest was crumbling. It was a clear threat to wildlife, so we heaved what was left of it above the wave line and promised to come back to dispose of it properly when it was dry. But how do you safely dispose of an old mattress made of billions of tiny plastic particles leaking formaldehyde and other potentially dangerous chemicals? Do you burn it? Bury it? Do you expect the company who made it to come to collect it? Answers to environment secretary Michael Gove, who today pledged to stem the tide of plastic debris by announcing a consultation on a plastic-bottle return scheme for England, which aims to get people to recycle more. Gove’s initiative is welcome, but minimal, and will have zero impact on the vast and growing scale of the plastic problem. The scheme is aimed at people fed up with litter, and to Blue Planet viewers who are shocked by images of birds swallowing plastic straws and turtles being choked by plastic bags. It is no more use than a heavy smoker forgoing a single cigarette. Since we started engineering polymers to make plastic on a mass scale in the 1950s, this byproduct of the petrochemical industry, which uses about 6% of all the oil we extract a year, has spread to myriad manufacturing processes. Plastic is now ubiquitous, insidious and impossible to avoid. It makes up our clothes, containers, bottles, electronics, food trays, cups and paints. Our cars depend on it, so do our computers, roofs and drain pipes. It’s the global packaging material of choice. We sleep on it, wear it, watch it, and are in direct bodily contact with it in one form or other all day and night. It may have profound societal benefits, but this most successful of all manmade materials sticks around for centuries. When exposed to sunlight, oxygen or the action of waves, it doesn’t biodegrade but simply fragments into smaller and smaller bits, until microscopic or nano-sized particles enter the food chain, the air, the soil and the water we drink. The BBC’s hugely popular Blue Planet series and a stream of scientific studies have made us aware of how the oceans are being polluted, but we still have little understanding of how human health is impacted by the many synthetic chemicals and additives that are used to give plastic its qualities. In the past few years, minute microplastics and fibres, measuring the width of a human hair or far less, have been found in an extraordinary range of products, such as honey and sugar, shellfish, bottled and tap water, beer, processed foods, table salt and soft drinks. In one study, 95% of all adults tested in the US had known carcinogenic chemical bisphenol A in their urine. In another, 83% of samples of tap water tested in seven countries were found to contain plastic microfibres. A study published last week revealed plastics contamination in more than 90% of bottled-water samples, which were from 11 different brands. And earlier this year the River Tame in Manchester was found to have 517,000 particles of plastic per cubic metre of sediment – that’s nearly double the highest concentration ever measured across the world. The more researchers look, the more they find in the human body. The same scientists who raised the alarm on air pollution from the deadly particles emitted by diesel vehicles are now finding plastic microparticles raining down on cities, and blown into the air from cars and construction sites, washing lines and food packaging. Indoor plastic pollution may be even worse than outdoors, with a single wash of sports kit or manmade textiles found to release thousands of microfibres into the air. At a recent UK workshop convened by the marine group Common Seas, 30 scientists, doctors and others compared notes, and agreed unanimously that plastic is now in what we eat, drink and breathe, and constitutes a significant and growing threat to human health. If we can breathe in these micro- and nano-sized particles and fibres, the scientists conjecture, they are likely to get into the human bloodstream, lung tissue and breast milk, or become lodged in the gut and respiratory systems. Some microparticles may pass through the body without causing harm, others may lodge there dangerously. Many are suspected to be carcinogenic or to have hormone-disrupting properties. The consensus is that there are great gaps in what we know about how microplastics affect human health, and that we need more robust science. We don’t know the risk when we drink contaminated bottled or tap water every day. We don’t know how much we are ingesting or breathing, or what effect exposure to hazardous plastic particles may have over years. We don’t know the concentrations that are safe for adults, let alone infants. There is mounting concern that under-studied microplastic particles threaten health by presenting a potentially major source of toxic chemicals to the human body. Although we have known for years that some of the additives used to make plastics flexible, transparent or durable are chemically dangerous, few have been tested on humans. Some countries have banned some chemicals – but there is no consistency, and the chemical companies have found it easy to avoid regulation, finding substitutes that are potentially just as dangerous. It is not enough to single out plastic bottles, coffee cups, or the microbeads found in cosmetics. We urgently need the government to form a comprehensive plastic action plan. Banning all plastic bags and single-use packaging would be a good start, but we need to go way beyond that. Plastic production has to be reduced, just as alternatives should be encouraged. Regulators must think about phasing out whole groups of chemicals of concern, rather than slowly restricting individual chemicals one at a time, and consumers must be helped to understand what they are being exposed to, and to navigate the complexity of what can be recycled, composted or burned. In the 1950s the world made about 2m tonnes of plastic a year. Now that figure is 330m tonnes a year – and it is set to treble again by 2050. It’s not enough to return a few plastic bottles, or even to pick up an old mattress on a beach. • John Vidal is a former environment editor of the Guardian"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"business/2018/mar/28/walmart-cosmopolitan-checkout-aisles","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-28T14:46:14Z","webTitle":"Walmart removes Cosmopolitan from checkouts as conservative lobbyists celebrate","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/mar/28/walmart-cosmopolitan-checkout-aisles","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/mar/28/walmart-cosmopolitan-checkout-aisles","fields":{"headline":"Walmart removes Cosmopolitan from checkouts as conservative lobbyists celebrate","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Walmart has removed Cosmopolitan magazine from its checkout aisles, although it will still be available in stores.

Cosmopolitan’s parent company, Hearst, did not immediately comment. Victoria Hearst, a member of the media family, has worked with the NCSE in campaigning against Cosmopolitan.

Nails had also been placed along the caravan’s route, piercing the tyres of one bus, the party said. Lula has been traveling around southern Brazil to rally support for another presidential run in October. But the former president has been convicted of corruption, and it looks increasingly likely that he will be jailed and barred from contesting the election. In a sign of how divisive the once spectacularly popular leader has become, his caravan has been the target of protests, and his buses have previously been pelted with eggs and stones. “If they think that that they can do away with my will to fight, they are wrong,” Lula said at a rally Tuesday night. “The day I cannot shout anymore, I will shout through your throats! The day my mind stops thinking, I will think through your minds!” Gleisi Hoffmann, the Workers’ party president, complained in a statement that authorities had not provided enough security for the caravan and later called the attack an attempted homicide. Officials noted that Paraná state is the only one the caravan has passed through that has not provided a police escort. “It’s not normal in a democracy that people fire on a democratic caravan,” Hoffmann told supporters on Tuesday night.

In the early 19th century, Mrs Percy Knowles, who also performed Hamlet, was one of several female actors to do so. In 2015, Smooth Faced Gentlemen staged the play with an all-female cast. But in those versions, the women were playing male roles. Rosheuvel’s Othello, in Gemma Bodinetz’s production, will almost certainly create waves because her general is an out lesbian. Before she went to see Bodinetz about joining the Everyman’s ensemble to play the role, Rosheuvel knew that – if she got the job – her Othello would not be gender neutral but female. Rosheuvel, who was the best Paulina I’ve ever seen in Simon Godwin’s 2009 production of The Winter’s Tale, already has form in this department. Last year she played a female Mercutio in the Globe’s Romeo and Juliet, winning praise for her performance and the subtle undertones it brought to the character’s relationships with Romeo and Benvolio in Daniel Kramer’s much-derided staging. Bodinetz, who began running Liverpool’s Everyman and Playhouse theatres 15 years ago, when very few women were heading up major British theatres, was also certain that she wanted to put a female Othello centre stage. Playing Othello is “important to me as a black, gay, female actor,” says Rosheuvel who moved to the UK from Guyana when she was five. She adds wryly: “just look at how many boxes I can be put in.” She and Bodinetz reckon that part of Iago’s gripe is that he thinks a black lesbian in charge of the army is “box-ticking at its most ridiculous”. Rosheuval points out that Othello is a play in which women and their sexuality are a source of fear for many of the male characters, and this ups the stakes considerably. “Some men have a terrible fear of women, particularly powerful women,” says Rosheuvel. “They would prefer not to see change, and this Othello is part of change. She is a woman who has power over all these men, all that testosterone. How does she negotiate that? Then she goes further and brings her lover – Desdemona – into that arena. It’s a scary thing to do.” “I wanted to make a modern audience sit up and feel something of what a Jacobean audience must have felt at seeing a black man commanding an army,” explains Bodinetz. “I wanted to make the play feel electric again.” But by making Othello female and gay she is not setting out to shock for the sake of it. “We’re not doing this despite the text, but with the text,” she says. “We are just trying to rub it in our own times, and make it shine for the beautiful dare of it, and in the process come up against some of our own prejudices and our assumptions about what leadership is and who can hold power.” Questions of race, class and gender are currently being much debated in the industry. Why aren’t there more women and people of colour running our theatres? Why might it be that the widely admired Rosheuvel is, at the age of 47, only now taking a lead role? “Look, I’ve had some great roles and worked with fantastic directors in great venues, but this is the first time I’ve played the lead. Why is that? I don’t know. I could jump on a bandwagon and say it’s because I’m black, I’m a woman and gay. But maybe it’s also because my career has always been very eclectic. And I love that. I’m always looking for things that interest me, that are different. You don’t employ me if you want beige, I’m all about bright colours.” Nonetheless she believes that “there’s a problem in British theatre and we wouldn’t have Act for Change and Time’s Up if there wasn’t. What I can’t ever know for sure is how much it has affected my own career. But I do wonder why it took until last year for me – someone who was raised on Agatha Christie dramas – to be cast in a period drama.” It was, she says, a dream come true to be cast in Lady Macbeth, written by Alice Birch. “There are plenty of black actors, writers and directors out there. There are plenty of women. We just need to be given the opportunities, and the money. That’s how real change happens, that’s how you crack it open.” A woman playing a female Othello is part of that. Bodinetz, as a female artistic director in what has been a male domain, is particularly interested in the dynamics of power and the stresses faced by women as they climb the ladder of success. “What can be harder than being a black, gay woman commander in the army? This is a woman who has fought to get where she is, and made sacrifices to do it. It means she has a lot to lose and so what happens and how does she behave when everything is taken from her? All women who rise to power have to navigate the land mines … We have to deal with the male game-playing and negotiate the structures that men have set in place. It can be exhausting and stressful, and often it means giving up things.” What have Bodinetz and Rosheuvel given up to get to where they are? “Time with my family,” says Bodinetz quietly. “My ego,” says Rosheuvel. “You have to keep it in check or as an actor you are constantly saying ‘why not me?’. I’ve learned to say: ‘Just relax, your time will come.’” Now, at last, it has. Othello is at Liverpool Everyman from 28 April.

Most of us would recognise these as bigoted and hateful, an attack on a community that has for centuries experienced prejudice across the world. In the days that have followed Jeremy Corbyn’s offensive Facebook post coming to public attention, there has been outrage from what appear to be two distinct camps. Some Labour members are deeply troubled by the situation, while others argue ignorantly that the Labour leader has done nothing wrong. What has become obvious in the past few days, however, is that many simply do not understand the content of this mural and why it is so deeply offensive – this is a more subtle antisemitic sentiment, which takes contextualising to understand. Considering the Jewish community makes up just 0.5% of the UK’s population, and that for many of us the closest we will have to an education in the history of discrimination faced by Jewish people amounts to a few months of GCSE history and Inglourious Basterds, it’s possible a simple explanation could rectify the confusion once and for all. First, make sure to actually look at the mural. Don’t take a fleeting glance as you prepare to tweet your outrage, but pause for a moment and take it all in. Sitting around a table is a group of rotund men: one has a full beard, and is counting money. That, in and of itself, is an antisemitic symbol. It’s not just the big, hookednoses and evil expressions that make this iconography offensive and troubling, these depictions mirror antisemitic propaganda used by Hitler and the Nazis to whip up hatred that led to the massacre of millions of Jews. This extends to the table these figures are sat at, resting on human bodies, as the Nazis also depicted. Context here is also important. If you haven’t yet, then research The Protocols of the Elders of Zion. An entirely fabricated text printed first in Russia during the early 1900s, it purports to document a meeting of Jewish leaders setting out plans to take over the world by controlling the media and press, and fostering religious conflict to subjugate non-Jews across the globe. During the 1920s and 1930s the Protocols were a key element of the Nazi propaganda programme – at least 23 editions were published by the party in the two decades that preceded the outbreak of the second world war in 1939. The domination of the world by hooknosed men wielding power and money? There is more than a visual connection in this mural to antisemitism – the messaging is full-blown Nazi too. In other contexts Illuminati conspiracies are light-hearted and funny: it’s not antisemitic to joke that Kanye West and Taylor Swift are part of a secret, triangle-based plot to conquer the world. But the employment of an Eye of Providence symbol (often associated with the Illuminati and Freemasonry) in the offending mural is clearly antisemitic. Racist conspiracy theorists also long claimed that Jews are in control of the Freemason network – think the Rothschilds and George Soros. That is antisemitism too. If you’re left in any doubt, just read the words of Mear One, the street artist who painted the mural: “Some of the older white Jewish folk in the local community had an issue with me portraying their beloved #Rothschild or #Warburg etc as the demons they are,” he has written. Of course there are some people – within Labour and outside of it – who are pleased to have any excuse to attack Corbyn. Their motivation might be unpleasant, but the “weaponisation” of antisemitism is somewhat less troubling if it can perceived to be there in the first place. A small handful of people in Labour’s ranks know only too well the connotations in this mural, yet continue to defend it. There is no space in the Labour party for you. Progressive organisations are better off without you inside. Labour can’t just pledge to kick the antisemites it finds out of the party: it needs to make a plan for combating bigotry in opposition and for entering government too. The Chakrabarti report from 2016 into antisemitism in Labour must be implemented fully. A party bureaucracy that has slowed the process down cannot be allowed to do so any longer. Labour must pledge to improve the national curriculum – better political education is needed in schools across the country to ensure murals like this are understood for what they are. There must also, starting now, be better investment in educating Labour’s 550,000-strong party membership. A party that prides itself on its commitment to equality can and must do better. It’s somewhat understandable that some people jumping to Corbyn’s defence now do so as a kneejerk reaction, as years of smears have made members defensive. This, however, is no such nonsense. Corbyn is no antisemite, but he displayed a lack of judgment and awareness that he – and it appears some members – need to address. Time must be taken for reflection and education, or it will prove impossible to ensure the left is never blind to this issue again. • Michael Segalov is the news editor of Huck magazine"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/mar/28/parole-board-chair-scapegoated-as-john-worboys-release-is-overturned","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-28T17:58:53Z","webTitle":"Parole Board chair 'scapegoated' as John Worboys' release overturned","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/mar/28/parole-board-chair-scapegoated-as-john-worboys-release-is-overturned","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/mar/28/parole-board-chair-scapegoated-as-john-worboys-release-is-overturned","fields":{"headline":"Parole Board chair 'scapegoated' as John Worboys' release overturned","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The serial sex attacker John Worboys is to face a fresh Parole Board hearing after a decision to recommend his release was quashed in an unprecedented high court ruling that prompted the sacking of the board’s chairman. Nick Hardwick, chairman of the Parole Board, was forced to resign after David Gauke, the justice secretary, told him his position was untenable. His removal was announced moments before Sir Brian Leveson, Mr Justice Jay and Mr Justice Garnham ruled in favour of two of Worboys’ victims who brought the challenge. The Parole Board should have undertaken “further inquiry into the circumstances of his offending”, the judges said. Many of Worboys’ victims expressed relief at the decision to overturn his release. Phillippa Kaufmann QC, who represented the two women who brought the case, said Hardwick had been “scapegoated” and that Gauke bore some responsibility for systematic failures. Worboys, 60, now goes by the name John Radford. He was jailed indefinitely in 2009 with a minimum term of eight years after being found guilty of 19 offences, including rape, sexual assault and drugging late-night passengers, committed against 12 victims. He has spent 10 years in jail. In the ruling, Leveson said that the Parole Board should have looked at “the extent to which the limited way in which he has described his offending may undermine his overall credibility”. He said that Worboys’ “apparent deftness in impression management” should have raised doubts about how genuine was his belated admission of guilt. The board, he said, should have been aware that it did not have material from the police or Crown Prosecution Service to challenge his version of events. A key issue in assessing the risk posed by releasing Worboys, Leveson pointed out, was “whether he was being open and honest”. The judgment also concluded that rule 25 of the Parole Board rules, which prevents publication of any of the reasoning behind decision-making, was illegal. The board makes 25,000 decisions on whether or not to release inmates every year. “There are no obvious reasons why the open justice principle should not apply to the Parole Board in the context of providing information on matters of public concern,” Leveson added. The judgment will have significant implications for the way the Parole Board conducts its hearings in future, requiring it to take into account far more material. Precisely how wide that research will have to be is not yet clear. One possible consequence of the changes is that fewer inmates may be released. Some key evidence that could have been gathered in Worboys’ case was not sent on in the dossier gathered by lawyers acting for the Ministry of Justice, the Parole Board pointedly said. The departure of Hardwick raises awkward questions about the supposed independence of the Parole Board. The chair of the justice select committee, Bob Neill MP, said there should be a fundamental review of the way the board operates. Richard Burgon MP, the shadow justice secretary, called for an “end-to-end review into the whole handling of the Worboys case ... to re-establish public confidence in our justice system”. Hardwick defended the decision to release Worboys, saying the three-member panel that considered the case was chaired by “one of our most experienced women members”, considered a dossier of 363 pages and heard evidence from four psychologists, and from prison and probation staff responsible for Worboys. In his resignation letter to the justice secretary, Hardwick made it clear he was forced to resign. “You told me that you thought my position was untenable,” he wrote. “I had no role in the decision of the panel in the case and believe I am capable of leading the Parole Board through the changes, many of which I have advocated, that will now be necessary. “I am sorry for the mistakes that were made in this case but I have always made it clear that I will support the members and staff of the board in the very difficult individual decisions they make and I will accept accountability for the work of the board.” Gauke decided in January against launching a judicial review of the decision to release Worboys. The justice secretary announced his intention to “conduct further work to examine the Parole Board rules in their entirety”. On Hardwick’s resignation, he said: “I ... believe this is the correct decision in light of the serious failings outlined in today’s judgment.” Lawyers for the two women who brought the case said Gauke “bears some responsibility” for the failings made in the case. Speaking after the ruling, Kaufman said it was the Ministry of Justice that was responsible for putting the dossier of evidence before the Parole Board for it to make its decision regarding his release. Harriet Wistrich, the solicitor who represented the two unnamed victims, said afterwards: “It was immediately clear that all those who had encountered [Worboys] previously were convinced he was a danger to women and would offend again.” One of the two victims, known only as NBV, said: “Since 4 January [when the decision to free Worboys was revealed] I have felt frozen in shock, disgusted and traumatised by the thought that Worboys could be on the streets so soon … News that we have won this case finally brought huge relief.” Lawyers for Worboys can, technically, appeal against the judgment but are not expected to do so."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2018/mar/30/dec-without-ant-saturday-night-takeaway","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-30T10:00:18Z","webTitle":"Ant & Dec’s Saturday Night Takeaway: is it time for Dec to fly solo?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/mar/30/dec-without-ant-saturday-night-takeaway","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2018/mar/30/dec-without-ant-saturday-night-takeaway","fields":{"headline":"Ant & Dec’s Saturday Night Takeaway: is it time for Dec to fly solo?","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Dec. Dec. Roll it around your mouth a little, try to say it without the tart-sour taste on your tongue: Dec. Just: Dec. “Dec.” Ladies and gentlemen … Dec! Something is wrong. You can feel it, deep in your soul. You can feel the spiritual rift. Something is misaligned in the universe and everything now feels cosmically altered. Tonight, while Ant recuperates away from the limelight following his drink-drive arrest, it’s on Dec to host Ant &amp; Dec’s Saturday Night Takeaway entirely Ant-less. There is something sinister about this, and I hate it. We have to admit now that Ant and Dec are the bedrock on which British culture is made, and pay them dues accordingly. For blockbuster Saturday night TV everyhosts who leaped fully formed from a harrowing drama scene in which one of them had their eyes shot out, they have between them an astonishingly delicate touch: funny, original, soft with the civilian guests and perfectly hard with the VIPs. They can do everything from T-shirt-and-jacket-clad-giggling presenting (I’m a Celeb, Britain’s Got Talent) to black-tux-and-a-clean-link pedigree stuff (the Brits, The X Factor). They are the best at what they do, but they are very crucially just that: a “they”, a collective. Dec without Ant is the sun without the moon, and this Saturday we will have to stare unblinkingly into it, waiting for our irises to turn white. Arguably, this show-must-go-on decision is the correct one. As Ant’s private battles are made public, it feels like a complete absence of Ant and Dec would be conspicuous somehow; that half an Ant and Dec is better than no Ant and Dec at all. And the reality of the situation is this: Dec, an absolutely consummate professional, will perform flawlessly on his own, to the point that – after about 20 minutes and some scripted banter with Scarlett Moffatt – you will hardly notice Ant is gone. Not so much that you can ever envision a full life without Ant, but enough to keep moving along with. Still, Dec without Ant is a 99 cone without any sauce or sprinkles: you can choke it down, sure, and you can even enjoy it, but it’s not right. It hasn’t got the necessary final smooth layer of gloss, the pizazz, the Flake. What we are secretly hoping for, of course – we, the ghoulish viewers – is that Dec will slowly unravel into some performance of phantom limb syndrome, incrementally more lost and insane with every minute under the studio lights alone. That is why I will be watching, anyway. I want to see Dec cheerfully turn his head 90 degrees to the empty void Ant normally occupies, making small geordie nudging noises to try to push his vacant co-host into a chuckle. I want to see him stumble, to miss his mark on the stage, suddenly thrown by a single “X” mapped out for him in tape. What I want, truly, is Dec to fold up a comedy leaning elbow and push it out on to the air to the right of him, and collapse into the space Ant occupied. If Saturday Night Takeaway doesn’t end with Dec, delirious and crying, begging for someone, anyone, to stand next to him – “Even Stephen Mulhern! I’d even endure Mulhern at this point!” – then, for me, the show will have been a failure. Good luck, though, Dec. May your temporary Ant-less life flow smoothly.

To be fair, the Danish pop star has a head start since her new single bears more than a passing resemblance to Drake’s recent behemoths. That cosy dancehall vibe is made even more emotional by sounding as if it was partially recorded through the wall of a house party. But better still, she trades his slightly whiny lyrics for sweet, empathetic verses about first loves, and the pain of losing them. Trouble – Bring It Back (feat Drake) After pinging around the little leagues of Atlantan rap for the best part of a decade, 30-year-old Trouble has been taken under the wing of Mike WiLL Made-It, who has produced the entirety of his excellent debut studio album, Edgewood, just as he did for rap scamps Rae Sremmurd. These longform projects allow Mike WiLL to go beyond the bass-driven backings of his hits (Formation, Bugatti et al) and explore some brilliantly weird territory. On Bring It Back, the beat is underpinned by a Norma Desmond of a melody: once pretty, perhaps, but now roughened, mad and lurching. The lyrics from Trouble and his imperial guest star, Drake, cleave to basic stuff of paper and hoes, but the medium is the message here. Jon Hopkins – Emerald Rush (edit) Coffee tables across the land are strewn with a tasteful and poisonous kind of electronic music, full of plangent chords and sad-sack ambience to make your comedown seem deeper than it is – think Nils Frahm and the Erased Tapes roster. Jon Hopkins has wandered around and sometimes into this territory, so it’s a relief that his comeback track, Emerald Rush, really bounces. The confidence of the swinging beat is undercut by stuttering uncertainty and frayed edging, and the “drop” – such as it is – prompts a tangible chill to sweep across the track. Louisa – Yes (feat 2 Chainz) The nostalgia cycle dictates that the turn of the millennium is experiencing a revival, with most current pop stars in thrall to that era, leaning towards the productions of Timbaland, Max Martin and Denniz Pop. It’s smart, then, that Louisa Johnson has veered the other way on Yes: “I want to be a Christina, not a Britney,” she told songwriter Camille Purcell. The result is the 2015 X Factor winner’s first distinctive single after generic trop-house bangers: she nails Stripped-era Xtina’s snarled delivery, also channelling the Sugababes at their most watch-out-or-I’ll-cut-you (“If you a freak like me, lemme hear you say yes”), and Ariana Grande 2.0’s I’m-grown-now breathlessness. Blink and you’ll miss 2 Chainz’s verse, but as a feature, at least he’s an upgrade from Olly Murs. Virginia Wing – The Second Shift The first single from the Manchester duo’s forthcoming third album, Ecstatic Arrow, is a revelation made for spring’s sleepy awakening. Featuring one of the loveliest saxophone parts since Destroyer’s Kaputt, The Second Shift exudes calm and, in its watery, shivering synths, reflects the Alpine surroundings of its recording in Switzerland. The curious gracefulness of the arrangement brings to mind Julia Holter’s latter-day albums, while Alice Merida Richards’ assured, unshowy voice feels spiritually connected to Laurie Anderson and Stereolab’s Laetitia Sadier before her. Genuinely transcendent. (This track isn’t available on the Apple Music playlist unfortunately). Hot Snakes – I Need a Doctor When the history of punk is written in marker pen on a toilet wall, you hope there will be space for Rick Froberg and John Reis. The San Diegans first formed Pitchfork in 1989 (the moody but quite sweet-natured emo-punk band rather than the hipster website), before segueing into Drive Like Jehu, who blended chop-change time signatures with pure punk energy to spectacular effect. Reis ended up on Top of the Pops with Rocket from the Crypt before the pair reconvened for Hot Snakes, who are back after 14 years with great new LP Jericho Sirens. I Need a Doctor leads it off in style: the kind of song that kicks in the swing doors of a saloon in a truck-stop town. Leon Bridges – Bet Ain’t Worth the Hand Beginning with the kind of xylophone and harp that summons birds to the shoulders of Disney heroines, this swoon of a soul song leaves no wheels reinvented but is totally spellbinding. The tale of Bridges being unable to take a relationship beyond its first flush, thanks to being a rather busy rising music star, is rendered in affectingly heartfelt, Maxwell-esque tones. Rui Ho – Supernova Underground dance artists playing with trance isn’t a new trend – witness DJs such as Total Freedom or Kamixlo playing rushing Euphoria compilation classics, or the likes of Lorenzo Senni and even Bicep tapping into its mouth-agape beauty (elsewhere on this month’s playlist, Gabber Eleganza flirts with it too). Rui Ho, a non-binary Chinese producer, does it smarter than most – on Supernova, taken from their new EP Becoming Is an Eventual Situation, the bassline might be straight from a Dutch meat-market club, but the effects above it are ectoplasmic and eerie. Eric Chenaux – Wild Moon One of the best and most under-appreciated singer-songwriters on the planet has returned with a new album, Slowly Paradise, following the utterly essential Skullsplitter (2015) and Guitar &amp; Voice (2012). Eric Chenaux, from Toronto, essays a kind of experimental jazz balladry – there is something truly gorgeous in the way his voice, with its quadruple-ply softness and Chet Baker romance, chafes against his improvisatory guitar. Wild Moon has a buzzing melody that moves with butterfly impetuousness around Chenaux’s surefooted vocal refrain. Tint – Miniature Moment Tint is outsider New York composer Zane Morris, who uses “vacant industrial buildings, lunchroom cafeterias and bedroom studios” to make his pieces. Miniature Moment, taken from his 300-copy album Ricochet Screen, sounds like it was made in the former: a metallic ringing phased into a juddering rhythm, it’s like a slice of high New York minimalism by Laurie Spiegel or La Monte Young drawn from the chaos of a metro interchange. After 12 minutes, you feel positively exfoliated. What have you been enjoying this month?

The documents, filed late on Tuesday night by the special prosecutor Robert Mueller, also state that Gates had admitted knowing that the associate was a former officer with Russian military intelligence, the GRU. The description of the associate, referred to as Person A in the court papers, closely matches the Russian manager of the Ukraine offices of Manafort’s former lobbying business, Konstantin Kilimnik. Previous court documents filed by Mueller’s team have described Person A as “a longtime Russian colleague … who is currently based in Russia and assessed to have ties to a Russian intelligence service”. These court papers go further, explicitly naming the GRU, and stating closely that the ties remained active during the 2016 US presidential campaign. Kilimnik has denied ties with Russian intelligence, but served in the army and attended a military foreign language university which is widely viewed as a training ground for GRU officers. Manafort was in touch with Kilimnik during the 2016 campaign, offering to provide briefings to Oleg Deripaska, a Kremlin-backed Russian oligarch. Manafort has pleaded not guilty to money-laundering and fraud charges related to work his business did for Moscow-backed politicians. Gates, who was Manafort’s right-hand man in the Trump campaign and in the lobbying business, has struck a plea deal, admitting conspiracy and lying to the FBI, and agreeing to cooperate with Mueller’s investigation into Trump campaign links with the Kremlin. The court documents are a sentencing memorandum in the case against Alex van der Zwaan, a London-based lawyer who carried out work on behalf of Manafort’s lobbying efforts in Ukraine. He has pleaded guilty to lying about his contacts in 2016 with Gates and Person A. The Mueller memorandum states: “That Gates and Person A were directly communicating in September and October 2016 was pertinent to the investigation. Federal Bureau of Investigation special agents assisting the special counsel’s office assess that Person A has ties to Russian intelligence service and had such ties in 2016.” The document adds: “During his first interview with the special counsel’s office, Van der Zwaan admitted that he knew of that connection, stating that Gates told him Person A was a former Russian intelligence officer with GRU.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"travel/2018/apr/03/bangalore-bengaluru-india-city-guide-bars-restaurants-gallery-wine","type":"article","sectionId":"travel","sectionName":"Travel","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-03T05:30:07Z","webTitle":"Bengaluru, India: a local’s top 10 tips","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2018/apr/03/bangalore-bengaluru-india-city-guide-bars-restaurants-gallery-wine","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/travel/2018/apr/03/bangalore-bengaluru-india-city-guide-bars-restaurants-gallery-wine","fields":{"headline":"Bengaluru, India: a local’s top 10 tips","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Think Bengaluru, and you think IT hub, call centres, silicon capital of India. It’s all of those things, but it’s also a very livable city. Over the past decade, it has attracted India’s sparkiest minds to code, brainstorm and play in its pulsing startup tech scene. This fast-growing and young population has added a big dose of fun: Bengaluru has become India’s most playful city, with an explosion of bars, restaurants, coffee joints and co-working spaces. Bengaluru’s fun factor also owes something to its topography. At 900 metres above sea level on southern India’s Deccan plateau, it’s the highest of India’s megacities, which means a more moderate climate and a sky washed deep blue most days. Even during the monsoon (June-September), it’s usually sunny in the mornings and early afternoon, and there are plenty of green spaces in which to enjoy the weather – this is the “Garden City of India”. Bengaluru also has impressive landmarks including regal Bangalore Fort and Bangalore Palace, modelled on Windsor Castle, and everyday wonders such as KR Market, worth a morning visit to eye the colourful flower stalls. Sly Granny The Indiranagar neighbourhood, where I live, has a string of rooftop bars on 12th Main Road that are constantly packed but my favourite is Sly Granny. The cocktail menu is playful (the peach popsicle cocktail comes with an ice lolly in it) and small plates of sliders and skewers make this a good spot for a snack while watching the sun go down. The roof attracts a fun, smart crowd, while the upscale restaurant downstairs often lays on Sly Granny house parties, with DJs spinning house, techno and Bollywood tunes. • Cocktails from 400 rupees (£4.30), 618 12th Main Road, on Facebook Bombay Brasserie Also on Indiranagar’s 12th Main is this light, lively, Mumbai-inspired eatery. Locals hang out on the blue-and-yellow wooden deck, with a glass of “half-half” lime soda (half sweet, half sour) in one hand and a smartphone in the other. If you’re here at lunchtime, try the home veg curry in banana leaf (around £3.25) and relax afterwards in the shady garden to people watch. • 2989/B 12th Main Road, bombaybrasserie.in Toit It’s practically a law that every hip city requires a craft beer joint. Bengaluru’s is Toit, a microbrewery off a busy Indiranagar junction, where bar stools sit next to gargantuan tanks brewing beers that include Basmati Blond and Tintin Toit (£2.40). If you crave British-style pub food, you’ll find it here in huge pies, fish and chips and burgers; and if you miss British humour you’ll find it in the amusing monthly newspaper and cardboard coasters with slogans like “beer tales and truths”. • 298, 100 Foot Road, toit.in Church Street Social Pedestrianised Church Street, just off Mahatma Gandhi Road, is home to myriad shops (bookshop Bluefrog is a favourite), bars (it’s a popular New Year’s Eve spot) and restaurants (like Funjabi, with its moustache logo). Keep walking to the end to industrial-cool Church Street Social, the Bengaluru outpost of the online/offline spaces already making a splash in Delhi and Mumbai. Come for coffee in the daytime and cocktails when the sun goes down. • Cobalt Building, Church Street, socialoffline.in Cubbon Park The proof of Bengaluru’s garden city vision is the 120-hectare Cubbon Park, protected by law since 1979.

National Gallery of Modern Art Bengaluru’s coders get their cultural kicks at this century-old colonial mansion, which opened in 2009 as one of India’s three national modern art galleries and houses more than 500 pieces of modern Indian art, photography, sculpture and prints. Alongside Indian miniatures and works by colonial artists, the Bengal School and post-independence artists, there’s a programme of screenings, gallery walks and workshops. • Tickets £5.40, closed Mon, 49 Palace Rd, Manikyavelu Mansion, ngmaindia.gov.in Mavalli Tiffin Rooms The last (and first) word in South Indian food is Mavalli Tiffin Rooms, MTR for short, the 1920 brainchild of three brothers.

The “garden eyebrow” seems to have sprung from the verdant and very funny mind of Taylor R, a Canadian beauty vlogger and Instagram star living in Hong Kong, who treated her 822,349 subscribers to a little tutorial this month on how to bring a touch of longed-for greenery to your face. (Basically, wax or gel your brows, colour them with liquid lipstick, then add flowers.) There followed a poll: “#GardenEyebrows (butterfly emoji, flower emoji) Yes or no? (chin stroking emoji)”. With 36,190 likes, the results seem to be inarguably in favour. Taylor R is also credited as the inventor of #ChristmasTreeEyebrows (think tweaked hairs decorated with tiny gems and golden stars) and – a personal favourite – nostril hair extensions, by which, with just a few sprigs of false eyelashes, young women across the globe can achieve the nasal luxury of the late Denis Healey. Of course, the fashion for adorning your brows with a little of nature’s finest is not new. High society ladies in the 1700s are said to have attached pieces of mouse fur above their plucked-bald brows to give them that all-too-desirable look of aristocratic surprise. While Taylor R may have swapped rodent offcuts for green colouring and the buds of real flowers, the desire is the same: to beguile and delight. As Andrew Marvell might have put it way back in 1681: “How vainly women themselves amaze,/ To pluck the palm, the oak, or bays,/ And their uncessant labours see,/ Faces crown’d with several trees.” There are, at time of writing, just 129 #gardeneyebrows blossoming on Instagram, but it is surely only a matter of time (and a sprinkling of Baby Bio) before the look is seen upon the face of every waitress, bus driver and financial ombudsman from Hong Kong to Harlesden. Viva la vida and power to your brows."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"money/2018/apr/04/virgin-active-gym-over-55-membership","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-04T06:00:16Z","webTitle":"My husband has been overpaying Virgin Active for five years","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2018/apr/04/virgin-active-gym-over-55-membership","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2018/apr/04/virgin-active-gym-over-55-membership","fields":{"headline":"My husband has been overpaying Virgin Active for five years","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"My husband and I are longstanding members of Virgin Active gym.

It’s a barbed, witty page-turner about being young and fragile in the new Ireland, set in a perilously privileged milieu of performance poetry and small magazines. Narrator Frances is out of her depth, negotiating love, sex, friendship and ambition while trying to maintain a brittle sense of self. Rooney has a ruthlessly beady eye and an effortless comic style. Her second novel, a love story across the class divide called Normal People, will be published in September. Guy Gunaratne Gunaratne worked as a video journalist reporting on post-conflict zones before writing his blazing polyphonic debut In Our Mad and Furious City, out next month. Set over 48 hours in a north London estate, where the killing of a “soldier-boy” by a “homegrown bredda” and the torching of a mosque spark a riot, it reveals London as a conflict zone for its five narrators. These include a would-be grime artist and a teenager resisting Islamic radicalisation, as well as older immigrants from Belfast and the West Indies. David Chariandy The Canadian writer’s masterly second novel, Brother, was published in the UK this month. It interrogates family, community and masculinity as it tells the story of Michael and Francis, the sons of a Trinidadian single mother, coming of age in the 1980s in a poor immigrant neighbourhood. “We were the children of the help, without futures.” In understated, classically beautiful prose it moves towards disaster with the terrible inevitability of a Greek tragedy. Jessie Greengrass Greengrass published her unusual and wide-ranging short story collection An Account of the Decline of the Great Auk, According to One Who Saw It last year; this February she followed it with her first novel Sight , now longlisted for the Women’s prize for fiction. Her narrator is agonising over whether to commit to parenthood, looking back on the trauma of her own mother’s death and remembering childhood holidays with her analyst grandmother. There are echoes of WG Sebald and Rachel Cusk in this thoughtful, digressive style that swirls together the historical and the personal, but Greengrass’s questing intellect and elegant prose are all her own. Eley Williams Small presses are making a big noise at the moment, and that’s down to such brilliant books as Attrib. and Other Stories, which took the Republic of Consciousness Prize for Small Presses this month. Williams had been publishing her playful stories in magazines for years, and it’s no surprise to learn that her PhD was on dictionaries: her stories focus on words and meanings, riddling away at the gaps between thought and speech, sound and silence, lovers and strangers. They Politics and ideas Mark O’Connell O’Connell’s captivating book about transhumanism and “solving the problem of death”, To Be a Machine, which saw him navigate some of the stranger byways of Silicon Valley, was shortlisted for the Baillie Gifford prize, the Royal Society science book prize and recently the Wellcome prize. Having taken on immortality, the Dublin-based writer is set to tackle the end of the world, in what promises to be a companionable and quick-witted exploration of apocalyptic anxieties. William Davies One of the most interesting commentators on political ideas, Davies teaches political economy and sociology at Goldsmiths, University of London, and is the author of two books, The Happiness Industry and The Limits of Neoliberalism. He is as lively discussing Brexit and the culture of the Home Office as he is the current crisis in capitalism. His next study, due later this year, will be Nervous States: How Feeling Took Over the World. Suzy Hansen The author of the elegant and persuasive Notes on a Foreign Country: An American Abroad in a Post-American World, Hansen is based in Istanbul, where she moved from the US following 9/11. Hisham Matar hailed her debut as “remarkably revealing … a deeply honest and brave portrait of an individual sensibility reckoning with her country’s violent role in the world”. Reni Eddo-Lodge Eddo-Lodge’s debut book Why I’m No Longer Talking to White People About Race, published last year, has recently won the Jhalak prize – it was praised by the judges as a “clarion call for action”, which “not only holds up a mirror to contemporary Britain but also serves as a warning”. Marlon James called it “essential”. James Bridle Bridle is an increasingly talked-about artist and writer who considers the relationship between technology, culture and consciousness. Among the subjects of his art are drones and self-driving cars. His ambitious debut book, New Dark Age, which argues that the digital era is radically shifting the boundaries of human experience, is out in July. Poetry Kayo Chingonyi Kumukanda, Zambian-born Chingonyi’s much feted debut, presented a fresh take on contemporary urban life shot through with an appreciation of traditional modes of living and storytelling. He reflects on identity and race, culture and masculinity with a thoughtfulness and lyrical elegance that conveys anger as well as a tender melancholy. Ocean Vuong Night Sky With Exit Wounds picked up a rare double when it was awarded the TS Eliot prize and the Forward best first collection award. Vietnamese-American Vuong’s work nods to both New York-school poets such as Frank O’Hara – close observations of street life, frankness about sex – and the historical myth-making of Homer. The Eliot judges hailed “the definitive arrival of a significant voice”. Richard Osmond Osmond’s job as a wild-food forager makes it unsurprising that his debut collection, Useful Verses, should be such a treasure trove of information. But what gives his poems energy is not just that they exhibit a deft authority on plants and poisons, remedies and roadkill, but that they are equally attuned to human and digital environments. The result is a work that reveals much about the world, both ancient and modern. Tara Bergin This Irish poet’s 2015 collection, This Is Yarrow, is a wryly unpredictable set of poems that challenges our familiarity with the world around us. Last year’s equally intense and funny The Tragic Death of Eleanor Marx explores the life and eventual suicide of Karl Marx’s daughter, the first translator of Madame Bovary. A rare originality of voice and vision. Hannah Sullivan The long poems that make up Sullivan’s debut, Three Poems, are wise and witty, and spaciously unfold an account of a young woman’s love, disappointment and resilience in New York City, with Heraclitean philosophical musings and autobiographical reflections on birth and bereavement. Memoir and biography Paul Ferris Football memoirs rarely produce great literature but Ferris’s The Boy on the Shed is a glistering exception, which sets a short career with Newcastle United against the background of a Catholic childhood in a Protestant stronghold of Northern Ireland. He’s witty, emotional and painfully self-revealing. If, as Alan Shearer intimates in the foreword, a second book is on the way, he may turn out to be the new Frank McCourt. Edmund Gordon How do you tell the life story of a woman who was, by her own admission, “a born fabulist”? Debut biographer Gordon disentangles myth from truth in The Making of Angela Carter, an elegant and well-judged life of the author. Kapka Kassabova The Bulgarian-born writer takes a journey through the mysterious region where her home country, Greece and Turkey meet. Border is a hybrid work that mixes memoir with travelogue as she putters across the land in an old Renault, recording the oral histories of the people she meets and crunching them with what she knows of the deeper past in an attempt to exorcise her own ghosts. Patricia Lockwood Already beloved for her silly, often filthy verse, Lockwood burst into the almost mainstream with her memoir Priestdaddy, centring on her father: a Catholic priest with five children and a penchant for guns, prog rock and cream liqueur. While her poetry is brilliantly bizarre, Priestdaddy revealed a dazzling new voice that flourishes in a longer form. Maggie Nelson The compelling topicality and novelty of her subject matter earns Nelson her place. The Argonauts is an uncategorisable book, that animates queer theory through the no-holds-barred story of her own love match with a trans man. Here are pregnancy, birth and family-making as you have never seen them before. Graphic novels Kirsten Radtke Imagine Wanting Only This begins with the death of Radtke’s uncle Dan – from a hereditary heart condition that could kill her – and moves through her young life, taking in love, backpacking, loneliness and visits to ruin after ruin. Her memoir is stuffed with fascinating anecdotes and great drawings that show everything from bus-borne squabbles to tight herds of sheep and abandoned cities. It ends in New York, where the 30-year-old illustrator and editor now lives, and this intelligent and passionate work makes you wonder where she’ll go next. Hamish Steele Steele works as an animator as well as a comic book artist, and humour and energy bubble through his work. His debut, Pantheon, a savage take on Egyptian myth, was self-published after a Kickstarter campaign before being picked up by NoBrow. His new book, DeadEndia: The Watcher’s Test, revolves around three amusement park workers and a genuinely haunted house. Nick Drnaso The Illinois native picked up an LA Times book prize for his excellent 2016 debut, Beverly, a series of sad and lyrical interconnected stories. It sets dysfunctional young Americans against an eerie backdrop of highways, motels and couches, lust and despair pushing up against the clean lines and pastel colours of his artwork. Drnaso’s latest, Sabrina, follows a US airman’s investigation of a missing woman. Emil Ferris My Favourite Thing Is Monsters emerged to wild applause last year. A brick of a book with something to treasure on every page, it takes the form of the journal of Karen Reyes, a 10-year-old obsessed with drawing, monsters and the fate of a woman who dies in her apartment block. Karen fills the diary with vibrant beasts and the details of her detective work. Ferris makes her humans and monsters leap off the page, and Book 2 (due in August) should be another cracker. Riad Sattouf Sattouf spent a decade writing for Charlie Hebdo, but only came to the attention of English-speaking readers in 2015, thanks to The Arab of the Future, which follows his childhood as he moves between France (where his mother was born), Syria (where his father was born) and Libya. The whims of Sattouf’s increasingly authoritarian father drive volumes one and two, which mix darkness, dry humour and sharp observation. Volume 3 is out in August. Crime and thrillers Jane Harper Winner of the Crime Writers’ Association Gold Dagger, Harper’s bestselling first novel, The Dry, is both a riveting detective story and a powerful portrait of a small Australian town in the drought-stricken middle of nowhere, riven by poverty and alcoholism. Her second book, Force of Nature, which features the same investigator and concerns an elemental battle for survival in the unforgiving Australian wilderness, lives up to the promise of her stunning debut. Joseph Knox Sirens, Knox’s debut, is a pungent slice of urban noir featuring disgraced Manchester detective Aidan Waits. Having blotted his copybook by stealing drugs from the evidence room, Waits is forced to go undercover and finds himself deep in a world of ruthless drug barons and corrupt politicians. The start of what promises to be a classic series – as proved by the equally vivid and uncompromising follow-up, The Smiling Man. Joe Ide Set in Long Beach, California, Ide’s novel, IQ, is the start of a projected series featuring Isaiah Quintabe, a modern day African American incarnation of Sherlock Holmes. We learn his back story – derailed in high school when his brother was killed, and turning to crime before realising his true calling – as he finds out who is trying to murder a famous rapper. A second outing, Righteous, was published in February; both books are sharply observed and crackling with energy. Sabri Louatah A bestseller in the author’s native France, Savages: The Wedding is the first novel in the Saint-Etienne Quartet. It’s the eve of the presidential election, and it looks as if Idder Chaouch is about to become the first Algerian premier. To some, the “French Obama” holds the promise of a post-racial society based on liberty, equality and fraternity, but not everyone agrees. Exhilarating, sharp-edged, and complex, this is a compelling hybrid of family saga and socio-political thriller. CJ Tudor In The Chalk Man, 12-year-old narrator Eddie Adams enjoys communicating with his friends using a secret code of chalk figures – until a series of anonymous drawings leads to the discovery of a dismembered girl in the woods. Fast-forward 30 years and Eddie receives a visit from an old friend – and a drawing of a noosed stick-man arrives in the post. This assured debut is very much in the Stephen King vein – creepy with plenty of menace. Children and young adult Bethan Woollvin Little Red, a feminist retelling of Little Red Riding Hood with a grisly, child-empowering edge, won Woollvin the Macmillan Illustration prize in 2014. Her second picture book, a prince-free Rapunzel, features the same mixture of stark black and white and a single colour. Her words share this lack of obfuscatory prettiness, a deadpan, terse narrative voice complementing her sharp illustrative style. Look out for her forthcoming Hansel and Gretel. Joseph Coelho Overheard in a Tower Block, Coelho’s newest poetry collection, was longlisted for the 2018 Carnegie Medal. Arguing parents become electrical forces or duelling knights; the bin-chute mouth of a block is fed the stuff of its residents’ lives. Rich with metaphor and secret meaning, his poetry is deeply welcoming, and his sensibility is both mythic and urban; his freed Prometheus, unearthed from “eons of eagle droppings”, hears “the god-whisper of a city, the electric thrum of buildings, the digital hiss of a new world.” David Solomons The Scottish screenwriter represents the best in contemporary comic writing for children – splendidly zany, full of irresistible trivia,but never scrimping on the emotional undertow that ensures longevity and heart. His first book for children, My Brother Is a Superhero, is subtitled “I could have been one too, except I needed a wee”; the story of comic geek Luke and his older brother Zack, unfairly given superpowers by a visiting alien, it won the Waterstones prize for children’s fiction in 2016, and its two sequels have since been flying off the shelves. Lucy Strange The Secret of Nightingale Wood, Strange’s debut novel for age 8-12, is set just after the first world war, and features Henry, a determined heroine grieving her brother’s death, protecting her younger sister Piglet, and contending with sinister doctors who conspire to commit her mother to an asylum. Strange elegantly blends a sense of period with compelling emotion and excitement. Her new novel, Our Castle by the Sea, is due in November. Tomi Adeyemi The Nigerian American author’s debut, Children of Blood and Bone, has generated considerable excitement, with film rights already sold. The first in a trilogy, this ambitious book is told from three perspectives; central is that of Zélie Adebola, who takes on the monarchy in a bid to restore magic to the world of Orisha. Literature in translation Maylis de Kerangal Winning last year’s Wellcome prize for Mend the Living, her brilliant evocation of a day in the life of a heart as it is rushed from one body to another, should raise the French author’s profile, but as yet only two of her novels have made it into English. In both she makes character subservient to scenario, whether dealing with coronary transplant staff or workers on a six-lane suspension bridge in a fictional US town. Samanta Schweblin Argentinian Schweblin’s brilliant and terrifying debut, Fever Dream, unfolds like a hallucination. A sick woman is confronted with a revenant child in a dialogue that combines the superstitions of a rural society with fears about agricultural abuse by big business, in a novel that was shortlisted for last year’s Man Booker International prize. Olga Tokarczuk This time last year, the Polish novelist was the biggest star you’d never heard of, but Flights put her on the map. This dazzling novel of fragments makes a passionate plea for connectedness through stories that somersault through time and space. Her back catalogue is now being published, with the Blakean Drive Your Plow Over the Bones of the Dead due this year, followed by her historical epic, The Books of Jacob, one of the biggest literary bestsellers in Polish history. Andrés Barba After surviving the car accident that killed her parents, a wounded and traumatised seven-year-old girl is sent to an orphanage with her only surviving “friend”, a doll apparently brought to life by her distress. In Such Small Hands, Barba plays with the conventions of the ghost story to create a powerful fable of the malice and the erotic power play of children too young to put their fears into words. Ahmed Saadawi Absurdist morality fable meets horror fantasy in Frankenstein in Baghdad, as a victim of sectarian violence is brought back to life in the aftermath of the US invasion of Iraq. Saadawi unspools an apparently endless causal chain of folly, corruption and tribalism. Science and nature Eugenia Cheng The mathematician remembers the day her mother first told her about graphs – she felt as if her brain was contorting, and it’s a feeling she still gets when doing research. It’s one her readers can share. Beyond Infinity begins with an energetic exposition of endlessness, before exploring the mathematical territory the concept opens up with the help of iPods, snorkelling and Winnie-the-Pooh. The Art of Logic is due in September. David George Haskell On a cold January hike in 2004, Haskell, a biologist, found himself confronted with a choice. He could carry on writing scientific papers, following his enthusiasm for poetry and meditation on the side, or he could bring these interests together. The result was The Forest Unseen, a lyrical account of the year he spent returning to that very spot. His 2017 book The Songs of Trees explores the interconnectedness of nature through portraits of 12 individual trees. Lindsey Fitzharris Fitzharris’s hugely entertaining debut The Butchering Art told the story of Victorian medicine through the life of Quaker surgeon Joseph Lister. A quiet man who stood out from his showy contemporaries, Lister pioneered antisepsis. Fitzharris’s second book is already in the making: a history of plastic surgery told through the story of surgeon Harold Gillies, an eccentric figure who worked in the aftermath of the first world war. Amy Liptrot After a childhood in Orkney, Amy Liptrot launched herself into the London clubbing scene with perilous consequences. The Outrun is a gorgeously evocative account of the role her home island played in helping to restore her to health. Cordelia Fine A psychologist, Fine puts her interest in the neuroscience of gender down to being a typical academic parent. Delusions of Gender is a witty and elegant account of the dodgy science and persistent biases behind the notion of the gendered brain. Her most recent book, Testosterone Rex, won the Royal Society science book of the year prize in 2017. Science fiction and fantasy Nnedi Okorafor The US author has many awards under her belt, but is only now coming to prominence in the UK. Rooted in her Nigerian heritage, her work melds traditional future narratives with lyrical folkloric fables, African locales with far-future planetary settings. Through strong female characters she explores inequality, gender politics and environmental degradation. Her multi award-winning Bin is a good place to engage with her diverse, complex, character-based science fiction and fantasy. Stefan Mohamed Mohamed won the unpublished writer’s category of the Dylan Thomas prize with Bitter Sixteen in 2015. It was the first volume of a trilogy featuring superheroes, talking dogs, monsters and the apocalypse, refreshingly expressed in a flip, deadpan style. Following the fortunes of Stanly Bird, who finds himself in possession of superpowers – telekinesis and the ability to fly – it wittily delineates youth and pop culture. Mohamed’s fourth novel, Falling Leaves, is out now. Naomi Booth Bradford-born Booth comes to writing from academia: her PhD research on the literary history of swooningfed into the quirky The Lost Art of Sinking, winner of the 2016 Saboteur award for best novella. Booth hit her stride with 2017’s Sealed, which explored themes of paranoia, motherhood and alienation set in an Australian outback gripped by a terrifying plague. She’s known for searing personal narratives written from the perspective of women on the brink of psychological breakdown. Nina Allan Allan’s 2014 debut, The Race, assembled from four linked novellas, featured fractured, vulnerable characters in a near-future England. The Rift (2017), explored themes of loss, alienation and guilt in a narrative shifting between contemporary Britain and the alien world of Tristane. Her literary sensibility fuses the fantastic and the mundane to great effect. Tristan Palmgren The US writer burst on to the SF scene this year with a stunning novel about an extraterrestrial who has arrived in 14th-century Italy to study the black death. The juxtaposition of alien and human cultures at the heart of Quietu allows Palmgren to ask a host of knotty philosophical questions, as well as to tell an emotionally affecting story. The sequel, Terminus, is due out later this year. • To order these books got to guardianbookshop.com or call 0330 333 6846. Free UK p&amp;p over £10, online orders only.

This is probably Albee’s most personal play, a barbed-wire wreath laid at the grave of his adoptive mother, but he has filtered his experience through an absurdist lens. The play’s vision of life aligns with Beckett’s: darkness on one side, darkness on the other, some pain and disappointment in the middle. “That’s it,” one character says. “You start and then you stop. Don’t be so soft.” No one has ever accused Albee of being soft, but in director Joe Mantello’s revival, starring Glenda Jackson, Laurie Metcalf and Alison Pill, there is a grudging sympathy underlying the spite. The women are identified as A, B and C. In the first act, Jackson plays A, an imperious woman who may not understand that all those pillows and coverlets – a symphony of cream with jade and citron accents, designed by Miriam Buether – are adornments on her deathbed. Metcalf is B, her caregiver, and Pill is C, a young lawyer assigned to tidy her legal and financial messes while B deals with the physical ones. There are cool pleasures in the first act, with its disquiet, its comic stings, its insistence on withholding comfort. When A starts to weep, B attempts a truism. “A good cry lets it all out,” she says. “What’s a bad one do?” is A’s acid response. Jackson’s A is nicely appareled in her satin bedrobe, but Albee is offering an unusually naked portrait of old age. The house lights stay up a long time, as if to remind the audience of their own mortality. He shows us A’s physical indignities and her mental wanderings, though she isn’t so weak that she doesn’t enjoy her power and her spite. The meanness of life – its cruelty and insufficiency – is often Albee’s business and this first act is business as usual. The second is the more extraordinary, a psychodrama that reveals A, B and C as the same woman in different stages of life – with C still hopeful, B resigned and A beyond either. This act is a beautiful and terrifying portrait of the ways in which life’s open-ended beginnings gradually close in, how we live when we know that fewer and fewer choices remain. It’s the stronger part of the script, but also perhaps the weaker part of Mantello’s production, because it’s just about impossible to believe that these women are so intimately related. They don’t look alike and they don’t sound alike. That matters less than a refusal to seem or act alike. Jackson – back on Broadway after a break of three decades – is queenly and forbidding, really just extraordinary. Metcalf is comic and forbearing, a variation on her typical antic underdog. Pill is pert and flirtatious, in a performance that’s skilful, but narrower than what her co-stars offer. At the press performance the actors veered off script a couple of times, though they were able to guide each other back. Twenty-six years separate C and B. A few decades more divide B and A. But there ought to be more continuity between the women, some through-line of attack and style. Of course C doesn’t want to age into B, B doesn’t want to decline into A. “I will not become … that!” C says with anger and horror. “Oh, really?” says A. If only we could still see some faint reflection of C within A, some prefiguring of A within C, that would be the twist in Albee’s honed, pearl-handled dagger of a play."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"sport/2018/mar/28/joe-root-new-zealand-england-second-test","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-28T20:59:12Z","webTitle":"Joe Root desperate to avoid full-blown winter of discontent for England | Vic Marks","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/mar/28/joe-root-new-zealand-england-second-test","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/mar/28/joe-root-new-zealand-england-second-test","fields":{"headline":"Joe Root desperate to avoid full-blown winter of discontent for England","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"England embark on their first Test at the picturesque Hagley Oval on Thursday and the last on their interminable winter tour. It is a long time since they pitched up optimistically for the first Test of the winter in Brisbane in November and a fair bit has changed since then on the international scene. In fact, since the last match in Auckland a lot has changed – especially on the other side of the Tasman Sea. While England players piously express their disappointment in public that the game has been stained, there are silver linings. Among them is the fact the Australian ball-tampering saga has deflected attention from England’s horrendous performances overseas. Their barren run without an away victory will stretch to 13 matches unless Joe Root’s team win here, and that would constitute an England record. “We must have the motivation to come back after a poor week when the rain made our performance look better than it was,” Root said. “Here we have the opportunity of a new game, a new venue and different conditions and we must show that we can be far better than we have been.” In these tempestuous times there could not be a more serene venue to contest a Test. The Hagley Oval resides in a 500-acre park in which the leaves on the trees are starting to turn. In that sense it is reminiscent of The Parks at Oxford even though it has a bright new pavilion, inevitably named after the Hadlees. The outfield is a level carpet of green and all around the oval there are grassy banks for the spectators, augmented by a couple of temporary stands. Meanwhile, its predecessor as a Test venue at Lancaster Park a couple of miles away, which was also the rugby ground, remains a deserted shell. All around Christchurch there are reminders of the terrible earthquake of 2011: cranes and scaffolding signal that reconstruction work is under way but the great, grey cathedral in the centre has been untouched for seven years, a grim reminder, especially for those across the water, of what constitutes a real tragedy. When Root appeared following a long meeting with his bowlers after practice at the Hagley Oval he insisted “the events in South Africa shouldn’t affect how we go about things”, though there is no doubt that Root and his England side have monitored the controversy closely. “Every series is different but we know we are always under scrutiny and we know how to conduct ourselves and keep going about it in the right way. Cricket has had a lot of air time, and lot of bad press.” Root seems to recognise his wider responsibilities as captain more readily than Steve Smith ever did, understanding that he should be the final arbiter of what is acceptable behaviour from his team rather than the umpires or the match referee. His problem lies with the more mundane: the inability to win – or even draw – away matches. Before the final Test of the winter no one seems to know what constitutes his best team and if Root had that knowledge on a sunny Wednesday afternoon he was not going to tell us. There is the expectation that Moeen Ali will be dropped, and that is a decision easy to justify. For all his charms, he has not scored many runs nor taken many wickets lately. This winter he averages just under 19 with the bat and his five Test wickets have come at 126 apiece. It becomes a bit of an insult to the others if they keep picking him. Root spoke warmly of Moeen without necessarily intimating that he would remain in the side. “It has been a struggle for Mo. He’s a talented lad and he’s done some great things for us in the not too distant past. He had a fantastic summer last year. If he keeps believing and trusting his game he’ll be all right, hopefully sooner rather than later.” This might mean a first Test for Jack Leach or Root might opt for an all-pace attack, most likely including Mark Wood instead of Craig Overton, augmented by Liam Livingstone, who bowls a bit of off-spin mixed with the odd leg-break, though a fortnight ago the young Lancastrian had the good grace – and sense – to point out that his spinners are far from reliable at this level. For the record Livingstone has 17 first-class wickets at 44 apiece. Those reservations seem justified. In the four Tests at Hagley Oval, spinners have met with little success and the winning side has always batted second. But the forecast is excellent with plenty of sunshine so there is virtue in having a varied attack. Inevitably so much depends on the fitness of Ben Stokes. He bowled in the nets on Wednesday but no one has any idea how he is going to pull up the next day. “There is a big summer coming up,” Root said. “So we have to err on the side of caution and make sure we don’t lose him.” By contrast, the Kiwis have no selection problems but they do have an enforced change. Todd Astle, who grabbed three wickets on the last day at Auckland, has a strained side and has been replaced by fellow leg‑spinner Ish Sodhi."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"books/2018/apr/04/as-time-goes-by-derek-taylor-beatles-review","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-04T09:00:20Z","webTitle":"As Time Goes By by Derek Taylor review – life in the Beatles’ magic circle","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/apr/04/as-time-goes-by-derek-taylor-beatles-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/apr/04/as-time-goes-by-derek-taylor-beatles-review","fields":{"headline":"As Time Goes By by Derek Taylor review – life in the Beatles’ magic circle","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"“Spring is here and Leeds play Chelsea tomorrow and Ringo and George and John and Paul are alive and well and full of hope. The world is still spinning and so are we and so are you. When the spinning stops – that’ll be the time to worry. Not before.” So ran the press release that announced the end of the Beatles on 11 April 1970, some time after they had actually broken up. It was written by Derek Taylor, a loquacious native of the Wirral who had served as their press officer in 1964, and again from 1968 until the end, when he headed the press department of Apple, their record company and doomed experiment in “western communism” . Alongside their manager Brian Epstein and producer George Martin, Taylor – who was born in 1932 and died in 1997 – was one of the group’s inner circle whose comparatively advanced years and very English urbanity added to the sense that, however exotic their outward appearance, the Beatles kept one collective foot in a world of tea, biscuits and impeccable manners. He was working for the Daily Express when he and his wife Joan first saw the band, on a UK tour shared with Roy Orbison in 1963. “Though maybe at the ‘wrong’ end of that generation,” he later wrote, “we were nevertheless open thereafter to the possibilities of being truly young in heart.” John Lennon honoured him with a mention in his pacifist anthem “Give Peace a Chance” (“Everybody’s talking ’bout … Derek Taylor, Norman Mailer, Allen Ginsberg, Hare Krishna”). In Philip Norman’s Beatles biography Shout! he is portrayed as a man in the heart of the storm who nonetheless managed to maintain a plentiful supply of decorum and basic humanity: “He was “amiable, sympathetic, polite to a degree which would ultimately seem miraculous.” Unlike most of the hotshots who were then establishing what we now know as the global PR industry, Taylor had one big advantage: he could write. And in the late 60s and early 70s, he snatched time to record opinions that would not quite cohere into a memoir, but still evoke his dazzling working life and the era in which it happened. In his sparse, lyrical prose style, there are echoes of Joan Didion, another writer born before the so-called Love Generation, but who wrote about its rise and fall with authority. As Time Goes By was first published in 1973, and has now been bolstered by an illuminating introduction written by the pop culture chronicler Jon Savage. Its narrative begins in 1964 and ends six years later. Along the way, Taylor relocates to Los Angeles (where he handled the media for the Byrds and the Beach Boys) before returning to participate in the Apple project. Of the endless procession of people who came to the press office, he writes: “No one left without something having been stuck into their mouth, be it tea, whisky, cigarette, joint or clenched fist.” Some waifs and strays stuck around: “Stocky McMullen was with us for about half a year, he sat mostly on top of a filing cabinet and drew fantasy pictures of penises eating each other.” Inevitably, such fun would not last, and some of the best parts of the book are about the entry into the Beatles’ world of the notorious New York manager Allen Klein, brought in to stop Apple haemorrhaging money, in a move opposed by Paul McCartney but supported by his three colleagues – a schism that hastened the band’s demise. “Klein said he wouldn’t upset anything,” Taylor writes. “He would just rearrange it. So I wasn’t frightened because I thought that if it was going to be a rearrangement then that would leave me unmarked since I was always rearranging myself anyway. What I didn’t want to be was upset. Who needs upset? Then the firings began.” There had already been auguries of these bad vibes, most notably in October 1968, when Lennon and Yoko Ono were busted for possession of marijuana by a gang of police officers overseen by Sgt Norman Pilcher, who was later jailed for corruption. The descriptions of these episodes are grimly fascinating: Lennon telling one of his closest confidants about what had happened with the bracing words “imagine your worst paranoia, because it’s here”; and McCartney cracking “the sort of jokes with which the best uncles seek to soften the horrors of the worst funeral”. Then “The evening papers arrived. ‘Lennon and Yoko’ was the main story. Not John any more. ‘Lennon’.” The straight world was getting its revenge, but somehow Taylor maintained the hopeful, open disposition that defined everything he wrote. He had, after all, been at the heart of something so great that it was beyond imagination. “Did it all happen, all of it, or was it a dream?” he says at one point. “Like, was John once married to a girl from Hoylake, Cheshire? Did George actually sit in the Whisky A Go Go with the other three and Jayne Mansfield … throwing a whisky over Mamie Van Doren, or was it Coca-Cola? You must be joking. None of it ever happened.” • As Time Goes By is published by Faber. To order a copy for £8.49 (RRP £9.99) go to guardianbookshop.com or call 0330 333 6846.

As you know, the final syllable of Watergate has long conferred instant gravitas on any scandal, from major political skulduggery to the suspected theft of a yoghurt from your office fridge. The -gate suffix automatically invests whatever it is with all the epochal, slightly impenetrable drama of a break-in at the Democratic National Committee headquarters, and the ensuing presidential cover-up thereof. Inevitably, then, the business of Australia cheating in the third Test against South Africa in Cape Town was instantly branded Tampergate by many (despite Tampergate itself having had a previous run-out in the storied history of New England Patriots scandals). But perhaps the changes are finally being rung, because I have since read that this is “cricket’s #MeToo moment”. If this means that a load of pundits are going to spout thundering condemnation of the crime, even though many of them have sinned in similar ways, then I guess the comparison is pretty spot‑on. Ditto if it means that a lot of people who must have known are going to say they didn’t. If, however, that wasn’t what was meant … well, I don’t yet know what precise form “cricket’s #MeToo moment” is going to take, but I want to say right now that I will be here for every bathrobed, damage-limiting, mostly hypocritical second of it. I’d like my first “we must rid our industry of this scourge” lecture from Australia’s coach, Darren Lehmann, please. For now, and several days into the affair, it is fair to say that the drama remains simultaneously both high and also never very far from tipping into bathos. On Tuesday, reports that vice-captain David Warner had left the Australia team’s WhatsApp group chat were treated with a straight-faced reverence one might reserve for the final withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan. (And yet, it was still not referred to formally as the “leadership group chat”, which feels a bit of a missed opportunity.) For some, this was the sign that the mushrooming crisis had “turned nuclear” – a reminder that if we are going to allow the unfettered proliferation of WhatsApp accounts, we must expect rogue actors to deploy them. Warner was unironically described as having “gone rogue”, and there were reports that the players were turning on each other in scenes only someone speaking Australian as a second language would dub Reservoir Dags. It’s all good content, in the parlance of our times, but given this is in significant part a tale of the dangers of Australia’s unfettered self-regard, perhaps this sorry tale gives the media reckonings of their own to face. Almost any media outlet’s coverage will reflect the outrage of its readers or viewers – but too often it fans it. Can it really be only three months since Australia’s Channel Nine produced a baseless accusation of ball-tampering against England’s Jimmy Anderson and then spent what felt like an entire Ashes Test covering it? Perhaps a “spirit of cricket coverage” code might be a useful addition to the canon in the wake of this business. If there was a culture of somewhat witless impunity within the Australia set-up, maybe it was partly enabled by what we might call the mind-games-industrial-complex that has absorbed Australian cricket. This is the thing where certain members of the sports media act like they’re playing for Australia, even though they are – and I’m going to get technical here – not. Of course, this has long been the case with the England football team, where the older and unfitter certain hacks and pundits are, the more convinced they are that in some ineffable but very real sense they are playing for their country when it comes to the big tournaments. At least till it goes wrong in the round of 16, at which point they are taking footballers down for their country. I can’t help feeling there is something of this now in the absolute howling outrage of some of the Australian punditocracy, who seem as late to various realisations as Lehmann currently is to writing his resignation letter. Plenty of people who commentated as though Australia were unimpeachable are now at the front of the queue to impeach them. As for the players, if only they had heeded the advice often given to writers of other fictions: show don’t tell. Don’t tell me you’re morally superior; show me. Don’t use media appearances to self-style yourselves; simply allow me to divine it from your deportment on the pitch. Alas, Australia’s failure to show not tell means the world now has an encyclopaedic archive of all their lectures and sermons and homilies on how to play the game of cricket that can be amusingly turned against them in the wake of the cheating in which they indulged in Cape Town. Indeed, most of these interventions are so on-the-nose that they might have been delivered by the Austin Powers character whose name was Basil Exposition. “I just know from an Australian cricket perspective,” ran one on South African ball-tampering in 2016, “we hold our heads high. I’d be very disappointed if one of our team members did that. The rules are in place for a reason, if you’re not going to use them, why bother having them?” Mr David Warner, ladies and gentlemen. Can cricket really still be in the “total shock” phase of its “#MeToo moment”? As one of the greatest characters in the Australian dramatic canon – Home and Away’s Alf Stewart – was fond of saying: don’t come the raw prawn with me."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"environment/2018/apr/07/country-diary-dipper-aquatic-to-its-bones-garsdale-cumbria","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-07T04:30:51Z","webTitle":"Country diary: it looks like a songbird, but the dipper is aquatic to its bones","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/apr/07/country-diary-dipper-aquatic-to-its-bones-garsdale-cumbria","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/apr/07/country-diary-dipper-aquatic-to-its-bones-garsdale-cumbria","fields":{"headline":"Country diary: it looks like a songbird, but the dipper is aquatic to its bones","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"A few days ago I was asked if I was a birder and apparently I pulled an indecisive face. Now I’m proving the point. The air quivers with curlew music, but I am walking head down. In my defence, drizzle is gusting up the valley, and I’m looking for water vole feeding signs, hoping for evidence to match some promising burrows a little way downstream. There are plenty of clumps of rush, the stems trimmed at 45 degree angles, but droppings are elusive – washed away or disintegrated by the rain, I suppose. If I hadn’t been focusing down, I might not have seen the dipper, dead in the rushes. Worse, I might have trodden on it. It’s noticeably heavy and for a moment I think it must be saturated, but then I remember. Dippers are aquanauts as much as aeronauts and, uniquely among songbirds, their bones are solid, for ballast. Even more than me, their habitual focus is down, and in, not up or out. I open the short, triangular wings. No wonder there’s something of the bumblebee in a live dipper’s whirring trajectory from rock to branch, branch to bank, and bank back to rock. In the water, the wings are both oars and hydrofoils, angled to harness the flow and surf the body down. The feet are large, with long, loose-jointed toes that curl around my little finger. They have small dimpled pads, and the grapple-hook points of the claws are slightly blunted from anchoring the bird to the streambed while it probes for mayfly nymphs, caddis larvae and shrimp with a beak like a pair of needle-nosed pliers. The feathers on the head are so fine they merge in what looks like a small serving of whipped chocolate mousse. One underwater-seeing eye is open. It is so nearly alive that I feel complicit – my inability to revive a crass excuse for my urge to possess.

David Whitfield – Cara Mia 10 weeks, 1954 Before rock’n’roll, the British charts hosted music for people who had lived through the second world war and wanted not hot thrills but comfort. Hence this romantic ballad, bafflingly syrupy and excessive to modern ears. Written in 1954, it might as well have hailed from Victorian times: music with the reassuring – if false – message that nothing had changed. 10. Bryan Adams – Everything I Do (I Do It for You) 16 weeks, 1991 Bryan Adams’s passive-aggressive perennial newlyweds’ first dance presided over a chart liberally populated with ultra-modern post-acid house pop and screeching hardcore rave anthems. Perhaps it provided the same function in 1991 as Englebert Humperdink or Ken Dodd had at the height of psychedelia: a comfortingly familiar escape from the shock of the new. 9. Wet Wet Wet – Love Is All Around 15 weeks, 1994 No 1 the week Oasis’s Definitely Maybe was released, perhaps Wet Wet Wet’s Troggs cover – from Richard Curtis’s Four Weddings and a Funeral – offered a nan-friendly counterpart to the parochialism and 60s fetishisation that fuelled Britpop. Far more eccentric than either was Troggs vocalist Reg Presley spending his royalties trying to prove the existence of crop-circle-creating aliens. 8. Frankie Laine – I Believe 18 weeks, 1953 The old shibboleth that Britain doesn’t really “get” country music is belied by the early 50s charts, which were packed with the stuff. Frankie Laine specialised in cowboy themes, although his biggest hit was less exotic: a hymn-like ballad written in 1952, and intended by its authors to offer American listeners comfort in the face of the Korean war. 7. Whitney Houston – I Will Always Love You 10 weeks, 1992 Comparing Dolly Parton’s understated I Will Always Love You to Whitney Houston’s subsequent blockbuster-isation is like comparing a sadly resigned last embrace with a 3am drunk-dialling call from a hysterical ex that leaves you considering a restraining order. Still, there’s a case to be made for the self-possessed power of Houston’s vocal at the start of the song at least. 6. Drake – One Dance 15 weeks, 2017 A little like Drake’s current smash God’s Plan, which may get a 10th week at the top this week, One Dance is an odd candidate for huge success. It’s by some distance the subtlest record in this list. Sparse, restrained and infinitely less hook-laden than, say, Hotline Bling, it’s a song that gradually works its way under your skin rather than slaps you in the face with its self-evident smash-hit quality. 5. Ed Sheeran – Shape of You 14 weeks, 2017 An Ed Sheeran single even his loudest detractor might struggle to dismiss as a symptom of cultural malaise, Shape of You is a fantastic piece of pop songwriting, TLC “homage” and all. If it was by anyone else, it would have been lauded: as it is, he will have to content himself with having the biggest-selling single of 2017 on both sides of the Atlantic. 4. Slim Whitman – Rose Marie 11 weeks, 1955 Not much mainstream pop from the immediately pre-Elvis era stands up today, but the signature tune of Florida-born country singer Slim Whitman remains oddly haunting. It sounds not just sparse but eerie: a wracked vocal swathed in reverb, set to a clanking, vaguely-out-of-tune piano and ghostly wisps of pedal steel. 3. Luis Fonsi – Despacito (feat Daddy Yankee) 11 weeks, 2017 A quintessential summer hit, Despacito proved the vanguard of both a renaissance in Latin-flavoured pop and the smart music industry trick of maximising a track’s global reach by repurposing it for different markets, but at its core was an undeniable pop song. 2. Queen – Bohemian Rhapsody 14 weeks, 1975 and 1991 Nudging into this list on a technicality – its two stays at the top are separated by 16 years – it’s easy to forget what a peculiar No 1 Bohemian Rhapsody is: six-minutes long, preposterously camp, utterly nonsensical, an episodic piece of prog rock released exactly as prog rock faltered. And yet, look at the YouTube video of the crowd singing it at a 2017 Green Day gig in Hyde Park: people adore it, testament to its ineffable, beguiling power. 1. Rihanna – Umbrella 10 weeks, 2007 If this list teaches us anything, it’s that a record-setting stay at No 1 is no guarantee of a single’s quality. But Rihanna’s Umbrella is a genuinely exceptional pop song. Admittedly, it begins unpromisingly, with a rotten guest appearance by Jay-Z – “Rain man is back,” he offers at one point, choosing words that convey something other than what he meant – but after he pushes off, it’s perfect: an arms-aloft power ballad repurposed as ultra-modern R&amp;B, a coolly detached vocal at odds with the soppy You’ve Got a Friend sentiment, a delirious clouds-parting middle eight, an earworm hook. Given its title, it seems a curiously inappropriate summer smash, but that’s to forget the summer of 2007, when, in Britain at least, it tipped it down on a daily basis."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"fashion/2018/apr/13/jordan-rock-stiletto-heels-fashion-trends","type":"article","sectionId":"fashion","sectionName":"Fashion","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-13T11:00:37Z","webTitle":"From Jordan Rock to stiletto heels: this week’s fashion trends","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2018/apr/13/jordan-rock-stiletto-heels-fashion-trends","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/fashion/2018/apr/13/jordan-rock-stiletto-heels-fashion-trends","fields":{"headline":"From Jordan Rock to stiletto heels: this week’s fashion trends","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Going up Jordan Rock Brother of Chris and the best thing about Love.

The corporation has traditionally dominated the UK TV and radio landscape but is having to reinvent the way it connects with media-savvy young audiences who are turning increasingly to digital services – mostly provided by US tech companies such as YouTube, Apple and Netflix – for entertainment and news. The BBC said it had found that 16- to 24-year-olds spend more time with Netflix in a week than with all of BBC TV including the BBC iPlayer, despite the latter’s relative popularity with younger viewers. “As the trend shifts towards on-demand viewing, the BBC risks being overtaken by competitors,” the BBC said in its annual plan published on Wednesday. “Maintaining the reach and time that audiences spend with our output is … difficult when they have so many other choices at their disposal. This challenge is most acute for young audiences.” The rapid generational shift in viewing by younger users is dramatically highlighted when the BBC widens its analysis to include viewers a decade older, in the 16- to 34-year-old range. The corporation said that including this older age group rebalances the survey, bringing overall weekly viewing of BBC1, ITV and Netflix approximately even at about two hours a week. The corporation also said that for the first time it had found in the final quarter of last year that 15- to 34-year-olds spent more time listening to streaming music services than all of BBC radio: five hours versus four hours 30 minutes a week. “The global media landscape is going to be dominated by four, perhaps five, businesses on the west coast of America in the years to come,” said the director general, Tony Hall, in a speech on the BBC’s priorities over the next year. “Companies with extraordinary technical, financial and creative firepower. Does music streaming spell mortal danger to radio? Can iPlayer keep pace with a rapidly growing Netflix?” The BBC said it was the very youngest age groups that the corporation was at most risk of losing touch with. It found that more than 80% of children go to Google-owned YouTube for on-demand content, half to Netflix and only 29% to the BBC iPlayer. Children aged five to 15 spend more time each week online (15 hours and 18 minutes on average) than they do watching TV (14 hours). The average weekly reach of CBBC, once a dominant player in children’s TV, among six- to 12-year-olds has fallen dramatically, from close to 40% in 2011 to less than 25% last year. In addition, the popularity of the traditional TV set is increasingly under threat, with 43% of 12- to 15-year-olds using their mobile phones to watch TV. “This generation of children embody the digital transformation,” said the BBC. “They are the audience group that are changing fastest. Although TV continues to be the main platform for children’s viewing, what they consider to be ‘TV’ and how they access this is rapidly evolving.” BBC News has also been hit by the youth exodus, with the amount of time 16- to 34-year-olds spend watching it down more than 10% in the past three years. For younger members of what is known as the C2DE demographic – the lower socio-economic groups as categorised by researchers – time spent watching is down by a fifth. The corporation said over the next year BBC News was also aiming to redress a major imbalance after finding “significantly more young men than young women” interacting with its online services. Hall also said a key focus would be tackling fake news. “This year, we won’t just talk about the challenges and distortions of fake news: this year we’ll take them on directly,” he said. “We’re going to fight – publicly and globally – for news that people can trust and rely on.” He said fake news ate away at trust in the media – including the BBC – and blurred the lines between reality and so-called “alternative facts”. At a grassroots level, the BBC said it was launching a national training programme in schools to help young people to “identify real news and filter out fake or false information”. “It seems only a few short years ago that the BBC, ITV and Sky were thought of as the titans of British media,” said Hall. “But what about now: where does the BBC fit in to the new media world?”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2018/may/15/ms-marvel-first-muslim-american-superhero-kamala-khan","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-15T10:30:58Z","webTitle":"Marvel 'has plans' for first Muslim American superhero character","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/may/15/ms-marvel-first-muslim-american-superhero-kamala-khan","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/may/15/ms-marvel-first-muslim-american-superhero-kamala-khan","fields":{"headline":"Marvel 'has plans' for first Muslim American superhero character","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Muslim superhero Ms Marvel – AKA Kamala Khan – will become a prominent figure in the Marvel Cinematic Universe after Marvel president Kevin Feige confirmed Marvel “has plans” for the character.

","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"“This is Amanda: she feels nothing. This is Lily: she feels everything.” This is teenhood in a nutshell. And this is the crawl from the trailer of Thoroughbreds, a delightfully nasty new movie in which two privileged Connecticut schoolgirls hatch a plot to kill Lily’s stepdad. They are perfect partners in crime, although the crime, inevitably, does not go perfectly. They are also perfect symbols for the two poles of teenhood and, by extension, teen movies: on the one hand, studied, borderline sociopathic numbness; on the other, an acute sensitivity that makes every experience, like, the most intense thing EVER. Most teen movies veer towards the latter, but Thoroughbreds’ Amanda and Lily extend a fine, parallel tradition of mean, scheming, murderous movie teens. Their club could include Kate Winslet and Melanie Lynskey in Heavenly Creatures; Denise Richards and Neve Campbell in Wild Things, which took teen scheming to delectably twisted extremes; or Sarah Michelle Gellar and Ryan Phillippe in Cruel Intentions. Flipping back through the yearbook, we arrive at Heathers, which is now marking its 30th anniversary. It charted a high-school landscape of savage social hierarchies, ruled by a clique of well-heeled in-girls, brought down by Winona Ryder and the nihilistic Christian Slater. It was a shocking movie at the time, and not just for the width of the shoulder pads. This wasn’t the Rydell High of Grease, where education was something to sing and dance about. The school was a breeding ground for factionalism, elitism, conformity and cut-throat competition; perfect training for the 1980s America outside. It is odd to look back at Heathers now, with its flip treatment of suicide, murder, rape, eating disorders and plotting to blow up the school, plus such beautifully honed lines as: “Dear diary, my teen angst bullshit has a body count.” Those were the days, when you could play fast and loose with such dark themes because they were so removed from reality. Now, US students have active shooter drills, metal detectors at the school gate and a president who is encouraging teachers to fire back. It looks like a victory for Team Nihilism. Except that in response to all this, post-Parkland, we are currently witnessing the biggest display of teen activism in living memory. The #NeverAgain movement’s inspirational leaders are the type of people you rarely see in teen movies. They don’t fit the Breakfast Club archetypes (jock, nerd, princess, rebel, recluse). They are more like the kids that the Heathers girls snark at in the cafeteria for campaigning against famine in Africa; except now they are the coolest kids on campus. They’re feted by celebrities and featured on the covers of Time and Teen Vogue. So where does that leave mean-schemer-teen movies such as Thoroughbreds? In many ways, the #NeverAgain kids are rejecting the film’s school of nihilism: it’s the shooters who feel nothing; they choose to feel everything.

But now Morrissey’s debut – a novel in which people didn’t just say things, they “topspin” them (“‘I have erotic curiosities,’ topspins Ezra”) – has a healthy challenger for the most mocked novel by a sleb. Sean Penn’s Bob Honey Who Just Do Stuff is a book in which people don’t just have vim or vigour, they have “spizzerinctum to spare”. Early and bad reviews of Penn’s debut novel ahead of its April release have prompted a lot of joy online. “Bob Honey is an exercise in ass-showing, a 160-page self-own,” was the Huffington Post’s verdict, while a new game, “Vagina bingo” was coined by one Twitter user to mark Penn’s multitudinous references to vulvas (always “magical” and “glistening”, on often “nymphomaniac” and “whoreish” women). So Penn’s novel is repellent on one level, but stupid on so many others. It follows Bob as he Just Do Stuff, often without much reason: he variously sells septic tanks, rigs explosives and kills American pensioners with a mallet, purportedly to offset their large carbon footprint. He daydreams about a hairless woman called Annie, whose alopecia is no barrier to their sexual escapades. (“Never one for psychosexual infantilism or paedophilic fantasy, after their sex he said, ‘Good vagina. Maybe more Vietnam.’”) At one point he sets fire to a dildo in the desert, due to “an assault of animism”, which makes just as much sense as anything else in the book. Bob is an absurdist character, clearly modelled on A Confederacy of Dunces’ Ignatius J Reilly: slobby, universally disdainful and lacking self-awareness. But where Ignatius’s arrogance is almost perversely charming, Bob is, at best, a cipher for Penn, who has a bewilderingly wide capacity for both strongly liberal and robustly conservative attitudes. Whenever “Bob understands”, or a paragraph starts, “The thing is”, Penn’s rage at advertising, gun owners, Hollywood, #MeToo (“Reducing rape, slut-shaming and suffrage to reckless child’s play?”) or Trump (“a bloated blond high priest and pavonine of branding”) rings all too clear. Bob’s “ultra-violent scepticism towards the messaging and mediocrity of modern times” ends in an ultra-violent killing spree, and the novel finishes with an epilogue in verse (also already scorned online) that simultaneously showcases the sheer range of Penn’s opinions and the complete lack of range in his poetry (“so rattled, addled and saddled / our entitlement is recklessly embattled”). Penn doesn’t just swing and miss with his ambitious vocabulary; he swings and cracks a hole in reality as we know it, leaving us all unsure of the concept of a good sentence, how a novel should be structured and generally what makes sense any more. Words are not just misused, they are misplaced, to the point that Penn’s prose is more reminiscent of bot than man. One can only emerge blearily from sentences such as “Bob hastily exited and breathed the new morning’s Muslim air”, or “Behind decorative gabion walls, an elderly neighbour sits centurion on his porch watching Bob with surreptitious soupçon”, or “She sharted agave shimmering spirits and shifted shit-faced overboard.” It’s like beat poetry, just somehow worse. In the grand, bleak tradition of celebrity novel writing, Penn’s is certainly neither the worst nor the best. His clear ambition shows he is not just a mediocre writer, like Pamela Anderson (whose novel Star includes lines such as, “The hard bump turned out to be one of a pair of unruly and self-willed nipples.”), or Charlie Sheen (whose poem Heretic Proof ends, “Turtle, android, pain. / Endeavor, endless, end. / P.S. Janonis.”). No, Penn’s novel is bad in the same way James Franco’s and Morrissey’s were bad: loudly and precociously, with a tendency to fling about big, empty words, not because it makes the writing better but because it just looks smarter, with an unashamed, almost masturbatory glee. In a very generous blurb, Salman Rushdie suspects that “Thomas Pynchon and Hunter S Thompson would love this book”; one suspects Penn would love that comparison even more. But Pynchon and Thompson are countercultural writers, casting their gaze over the most raw, scabrous parts of American life to convey something much more universal; Hari Kunzru once called Thompson a writer who “makes himself ugly to expose the ugliness he sees around him”. In Bob Honey, Penn just exposes himself."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"education/2018/mar/28/shakira-martin-easily-holds-on-to-leadership-of-students-union","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-28T14:18:22Z","webTitle":"Shakira Martin easily holds on to leadership of students union","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2018/mar/28/shakira-martin-easily-holds-on-to-leadership-of-students-union","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/education/2018/mar/28/shakira-martin-easily-holds-on-to-leadership-of-students-union","fields":{"headline":"Shakira Martin easily holds on to leadership of students union","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Shakira Martin has held on to the leadership of the National Union of Students for a second year after being re-elected president with 50.9% of the vote. Martin, a single mother of two who comes from a further education background, convincingly saw off challenges from two rival candidates, winning in the first round of voting during elections at the NUS annual conference in Glasgow on Wednesday. The left had hoped to gain support on the back of a surge in student activism and a series of occupations in support of striking university staff, but in the end their candidate Sahaya James, a member of Momentum’s national executive, gained just 15% of the vote. James, campaigns officer at the student union of the University of the Arts London, was beaten to second place by Momin Saqib, the president of King’s College London students’ union, who won 24.3% of the vote. Martin, formerly a student at Lewisham Southwark College in south London, has consistently positioned herself as a pragmatic and centrist candidate, which saw her to victory last year when she stood against the incumbent president Malia Bouattia, whose term was mired in allegations of antisemitism. Martin’s presidency has not been without controversy. Earlier this year she was embroiled in allegations of bullying at the NUS headquarters, which she denied. Her manifesto promised to fight student poverty, defend student rights and ensure the NUS was ready for the next general election. Using her own story to appeal to NUS delegates, it read: “When I was struggling I made a choice. I went back to college – a way back to work and independence and away from crime and abusive relationships. I want my daughters to realise the value of education – enabling them to be the leaders and entrepreneurs of the future.” Speaking after winning the vote, Martin said: “From Lewisham College to where I am today, I’m so humbled to have been re-elected as national president of NUS. I’m honestly shocked I ever made it here in the first place, and I’m so thankful to everyone in the student movement who has supported me. “Now it’s time for our movement to get real on student issues, as well as to be honest about ourselves. I’m so excited to work with my next national officer team to create a truly united NUS, fit for tomorrow and fit for the future.” Shortly after Martin’s re-election, conference had to be suspended when a large number of delegates occupied the stage. They were protesting after debate was cut short and a tranche of welfare motions - including abortion rights in Northern Ireland and sex work decriminalisation - were not heard. As Martin and others tried to bring an end to the protest, Lola Olufemi, women’s officer at Cambridge University student union, tweeted: “The occupation of the stage is the most important thing that has happened at this conf. Not only standing with pregnant ppl denied basic healthcare &amp; sex workers - but calling out the way that bureaucracy has stopped us from passing any radical or meaningful policies.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"culture/2018/mar/30/hey-babe-by-juliana-hatfield-roared-as-loud-as-the-riot-grrls","type":"article","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-30T11:59:20Z","webTitle":"Quiet storm: why Juliana Hatfield’s Hey Babe roared as loud as the riot grrrls","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2018/mar/30/hey-babe-by-juliana-hatfield-roared-as-loud-as-the-riot-grrls","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/2018/mar/30/hey-babe-by-juliana-hatfield-roared-as-loud-as-the-riot-grrls","fields":{"headline":"Quiet storm: why Juliana Hatfield’s Hey Babe roared as loud as the riot grrrls","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Nineteen-ninety-two was the inaugural year of the “women in rock” era: a stretch of several years when artists from Courtney Love and PJ Harvey to Meredith Brooks unwittingly formed a cohort of so-called girls with guitars and the phrase “girl power” seeped into the popular lexicon from the underground precincts of the riot grrrl scene. Juliana Hatfield was at the heart of this zeitgeist. In 1992, Hatfield had just broken up her college band Blake Babies and released her solo debut Hey Babe on Mammoth Records. Hey Babe was among the most successful independent releases of the year; 25 years on, it remains a largely forgotten minor masterpiece. But the release of a newly remastered Hey Babe on the American Laundromat label this month will reintroduce listeners to a coming-of-age album for the solitary female misfit. At the time of Hey Babe’s release, the riot grrrl movement was normalising the expression of female rage, offering a crucial framework of empowerment for female listeners. But Hey Babe offers a landscape of emotion – self-disgust, second-guessing, depression, cautious optimism – that has no place in a reception model so narrowly hinged on “empowerment”. The album dwells on muddled feelings, elevating confusion and insecurity over anger. Its 11 songs build entire worlds out of the state of feeling small, delivered in a voice that skids from girlish wail to shattered mumble. The album’s centrepiece is the song Ugly, an acoustic instruction manual on living with low self-esteem. “I’m pretty lost but I don’t want to be found/ My tiny screams don’t make a sound,” sings Hatfield. Hey Babe’s tone of disquiet has made it all too easy to overlook Hatfield’s foundational role in the “women in rock” genealogy. This reflects our cultural preference for so-called “vehement passions” over “minor feelings”. Cultural critic Sianne Ngai notes of the western literary tradition: “Something about the cultural canon itself seems to prefer higher passions and emotions, as if minor or ugly feelings are not only incapable of producing ‘major’ works, but somehow disabled the works they do drive from acquiring canonical distinction.” This explains a lot about the record’s unfairly diminished role in the alternative rock narrative. Hatfield herself stopped playing its songs shortly after it was released. “Immediately after recording the album, I was really embarrassed by it,” she explained to Billboard, “but now I’m really proud of myself.” Hey Babe will strike a chord with a new generation of listeners who are shy, ambivalent, inward and emotionally complex.

If I’ve got a big race like the London Marathon, I’ll sleep for only about six hours and never right through. The night before an event I used to get no sleep at all, but as you get older you sort those things out. I always sleep well after a big race as my body is in bits. Eat I never eat breakfast – just coffee – and bananas are the only thing I can stomach on a race morning.

Devoting too much mental energy to nutrition started to affect my training so now my ethos is, “If you eat the right stuff in moderation with some bad stuff in between, it doesn’t really matter.” Work I train for only 12 hours a week, but what I do is very intense. I spend an hour Monday to Friday doing distance work in Richmond Park. Then after an afternoon break and collecting the kids from school, I’m at the gym by 6pm doing speed work on a resistant static roller. There are 10 of us in there with the windows shut and the coaches screaming; it’s like torture. If I’m having a tough session, I’ll shout or scream. Family I see my kids every day and every other weekend. I do the school run morning and afternoon, which fits in with my training schedule.

May told MPs on parliament’s liaison committee on Tuesday that the government planned to inject more funding into the NHS through a 10-year funding plan. Corbyn urged her to ensure a fair share of any new funding went to mental health provision, by “ringfencing NHS mental health budgets to support those going through a mental health crisis, at a time when they most need our help and our support”. He called for the government to ensure there were “more mental health professionals to help people in a crisis”. Corbyn also paid tribute to the families of Connor Sparrowhawk and Teresa Colvin, who died in the care of private provider Southern Health, which was recently fined £2m after a long-running campaign. The prime minister said lessons had been learned since the Sparrowhawk and Colvin cases in 2012 and 2013. “These incidents took place some time ago and lessons have been learned by the health and social care system,” she said. “There have been significant steps taken in raising awareness of autism and making sure there is support available.” May added that “a comprehensive CQC inspection into Southern Health is expected later this year”. The prime minister insisted there were 1,400 more people accessing mental health services every day than when the Conservatives came to power in 2010. “Dealing with mental health means addressing it in a variety of ways. We are taking more steps to address the issues of mental health than the Labour government ever took when we they were in power,” she said. And she pointed to a series of recent policy announcements, including identifying a teacher at each school to identify students in mental health difficulties. The prime minister also highlighted the influence of social media, and online bullying, as a contributor to mental health difficulties among young people, and pointed to the need to “help our young people develop more resilience on social media”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"global-development/2018/may/07/child-slavery-victim-uk-government-sexual-assault","type":"article","sectionId":"global-development","sectionName":"Global development","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-07T06:00:41Z","webTitle":"Child slavery victim sues Home Office after sexual assault at Morton Hall","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2018/may/07/child-slavery-victim-uk-government-sexual-assault","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2018/may/07/child-slavery-victim-uk-government-sexual-assault","fields":{"headline":"Child slavery victim sues Home Office after sexual assault at Morton Hall","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"A Vietnamese victim of child slavery has launched legal proceedings against the government after he was sexually assaulted at Morton Hall immigration removal centre, the Guardian can reveal. The Home Office has admitted that the 19-year-old – known as H – was being detained illegally when he was attacked by another inmate, who attempted to rape him in his cell in 2016. H had already been recognised as a potential victim of child trafficking at the time of the assault and the Home Office accepts that he should not have been subject to immigration detention. After the assault, H continued to be held at Morton Hall for a further six months. Following interventions by law firm Duncan Lewis, the Home Office confirmed that H was a victim of modern slavery but refused to release him. It has continued to try to deport him back to Vietnam. According to clinical psychologists who assessed H during his detention, he was left severely traumatised and fearing for his life after the assault, which triggered memories of earlier rapes and abuse he had suffered at the hands of his traffickers. Morton Hall accepts that the assault took place, but did not launch an investigation into the attempted rape or provide any support to H after the attack. The centre began an internal enquiry into the attack only after being contacted by lawyers from Duncan Lewis, who threatened legal action. H was trafficked from Vietnam to the UK at the age of 16 and was forced to tend cannabis plants in a house in Derbyshire. When the house was raided by police and H was found locked inside, he was charged with cannabis cultivation and eventually prosecuted and sent to a young offenders’ institution. He was transferred directly from incarceration to Morton Hall in Lincoln. In a statement, H said: “My time in immigration detention was awful. After this incident, I was really paranoid that other detainees would hurt me all of the time. I felt scared all the time and I found it very difficult to sleep or eat. Morton Hall staff do not protect the detainees. Although terrible things have happened to me in the past, the effect of immigration detention made this even worse.” Ahmed Aydeed, director at Duncan Lewis, said the assault formed part of a catastrophic failure on the behalf of the UK authorities in their duty of care to H. “This is a vulnerable victim of slavery who was a child at the time of his exploitation – who was locked inside a cannabis house and then criminalised, incarcerated in a young offenders’ institution and then illegally detained in immigration detention where he suffered a highly traumatising assault, which was then never investigated,” he said. “Our client’s treatment undermines the government’s rhetoric on its commitment to protecting victims of slavery and its own guidance on how child trafficking victims should be supported. Is this really how we treat those who have experienced slavery in the UK?” H has now launched a civil action against Morton Hall based on negligence and breach of its statutory duties under the Human Rights Act for failing to launch an internal investigation or refer the incident to the police. Duncan Lewis has also begun a judicial review against the Home Office on behalf of H, asking for deportation proceedings to be halted and for the Home Office to admit systemic failings in the treatment of victims of slavery in the UK. H says that when he was 16 years old he was lured from his rural village to Ho Chi Minh city by people he had met on Facebook and was brought to meet a group of men who said they could take him to Europe. When he declined, he was locked in a room, tortured, raped and forced into debt bondage. He says he was also beaten with electrified sticks and burned with heated rods. The men told him they would kill his family if he refused to go. When he reached the UK, H was taken to a property used as a cannabis farm in Derbyshire and told to look after the plants, he says. He was deliberately starved and kept locked inside the house for weeks at a time. Following a police raid on the property and H’s arrest by Derbyshire police, he was recognised as a potential victim of child trafficking by the Home Office. However, neither the police nor the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) were informed of his status and he was later sentenced to eight months at a young offenders’ institution. While in detention the Home Office initiated deportation proceedings and H was taken directly to Morton Hall, where the sexual assault took place. H is now in a safe house for victims of trafficking and has been released on bail from immigration detention. His application for discretionary leave to remain has been turned down. The appeal to have this decision reversed forms part of the judicial review against the Home Office. H says he is too scared to return to Vietnam because his traffickers know where he lives and have threatened to harm him if he fails to repay money they spent to transport him from Vietnam to the UK. He says he has been unable to contact his parents, who have moved since he arrived in the UK. The judicial review is due to be heard in the high court in May. The civil case against Morton Hall continues. Vietnamese children were among the largest groups of slavery victims identified by the National Crime Agency (NCA) in 2017. Many like H, continue to be brought to the UK to work in cannabis farms. Overall, the number of possible child victims identified by the NCA in 2017 grew by two-thirds compared with 2016. Almost half of the 5,145 cases reported – 41% – involved the possible exploitation of a child aged under 18. Chloe Setter, head of advocacy, policy and campaigns at Ecpat UK (Every Child Protected Against Trafficking), said: “It is heartbreaking to see young people, often suffering from trauma after years of abuse, being wrongly criminalised, detained like prisoners or denied appropriate support. It is disturbing that the UK is identifying ever-higher numbers of trafficked children but often failing to provide the right protection to keep them safe.” The Home Office said in a statement: “The UK has a proud history of granting asylum to those who need our protection and every case is assessed on its individual merits. As the appeal is ongoing it would not be appropriate to comment further.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/mar/28/police-make-arrest-in-hunt-for-hatton-garden-heist-ringleader","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-28T12:39:54Z","webTitle":"Police make arrest in hunt for Hatton Garden heist ringleader","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/mar/28/police-make-arrest-in-hunt-for-hatton-garden-heist-ringleader","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/mar/28/police-make-arrest-in-hunt-for-hatton-garden-heist-ringleader","fields":{"headline":"Police make arrest in hunt for Hatton Garden heist ringleader","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Police hunting for a ringleader behind the £14m Hatton Garden heist nicknamed “Basil” have made an arrest. Scotland Yard said a 57-year-old man was detained on Tuesday morning in London in connection with the 2015 burglary in which which elderly crooks broke into a secure vault and stolejewellery, cash, gold and platinum. Announcing the arrest, police said a number of items were seized from the address raided in Islington, north London, when detectives executed a search warrant at 7.30am. Flying Squad detectives have been searching for those who evaded capture after the burglary. Their main target has been Basil, a mystery figure who has been at large for the past three years. After members of the gang were convicted and jailed for the heist in 2016, police put out an appeal for information about Basil. There are no plans to reissue it, it is understood. Police think he played a crucial role in getting the gang into the building housing the vault that contained the safety deposit boxes. The mystery man helped the gang but his identity has never become public. Those convicted of the burglary say they did not know his real name. Police gave few details about the raid, but said the man was arrested “on suspicion of non-residential burglary”, and not for the lesser charge of handling stolen goods. The heist over the Easter weekend in 2015 was the largest burglary in English criminal history and a large amount of the stolen valuables are still unaccounted for. The men drilled through a 50cm-thick concrete wall and broke into 73 security boxes in London’s diamond district without leaving a forensic trace. Among the ringleaders convicted after a 2016 trial were John Collins, 77, of Islington; Daniel Jones, 63, of Enfield, north London; Brian Reader, 78, of Dartford, Kent; and Terry Perkins, 69, from Enfield, who died in prison in February. The break-in began on 2 April 2015 and CCTV showed Collins and others arriving in a white van at Hatton Garden at around 8.20pm. Soon after, a red-haired man – the unidentified Basil, possibly wearing a wig – let them in through a fire exit on a nearby street, which had access to the building housing the vault at 88-90 Hatton Garden. Basil opened the door of the building, having gained codes for doors and a key for a mortice lock on the front door. Police believe Basil, whose face investigators were unable to get a clear image of from the CCTV footage, was brought in for technical expertise. He was most likely involved in several roles, including neutralising the alarm and handling the electrics. Once in, Basil opened a fire escape door to the building."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/apr/03/millions-flee-bloodshed-as-congos-army-steps-up-fight-with-rebels-in-east","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-03T04:00:06Z","webTitle":"'The wars will never stop' - millions flee bloodshed as Congo falls apart","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/03/millions-flee-bloodshed-as-congos-army-steps-up-fight-with-rebels-in-east","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/apr/03/millions-flee-bloodshed-as-congos-army-steps-up-fight-with-rebels-in-east","fields":{"headline":"'The wars will never stop' - millions flee bloodshed as Congo falls apart","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Justin Kapitu is dying. He does not know it yet, and the doctors treating the 22-year-old rebel fighter are unlikely to tell him soon, but his chances of surviving more than a few months are virtually non-existent. Kapitu was wounded in a clash between his rebel group and a rival faction in December. Even in the remote green forested valleys and hills of the far east of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), where the battle took place, few paid much attention. Such scrappy, bloody confrontations have become an almost daily occurrence. Bullets shattered Kapitu’s right arm and damaged his intestines. Emaciated and traumatised, he is being treated at the single hospital serving the half million inhabitants of Masisi territory, about a thousand miles east of Kinshasa, the capital. Kapitu weighs only 30kg (4st 7lb), is in constant pain and can absorb just a fifth of the nutritional value of the small amount of food he can ingest. Abandoned by his former comrades, he is unsure of the whereabouts of his family. “I was just a foot soldier so I don’t really know why we were fighting,” he said. “There are lots of reasons I think .... I don’t think the wars here will ever stop. They will probably get worse.” Kapitu’s analysis is shared by many. The vast central African country has been hit by waves of violence, rebellions, protests and political turmoil in recent months, leading to worries about a new civil war like that which killed five million people between 1997 and 2003. Across the country the security situation has deteriorated markedly as government authority has collapsed, emboldening rival militia groups who hold sway over large areas of territory, often competing for the DRC’s rich resources. The president, Joseph Kabila, is desperately clinging to power as various groups and individuals use violence to gain cash, territory and support before possible elections later this year. The humanitarian situation is dire. More than 13 million Congolese need humanitarian aid, twice as many as last year, and 7.7 million face severe food insecurity, up 30% from a year ago, the United Nations said in March. Many humanitarian officials complain that global attention has been diverted to more heavily reported crises in the Middle East. More than 4.5 million people are displaced, the highest number in the DRC for more than 20 years, latest figures show. There are outbreaks of cholera. The fighting is, as Kapitu feared, getting worse. In recent weeks, thousands of army soldiers attacked villages across the province of North Kivu, where rebel groups are based. Around the town of Beni, DRC’s army is fighting an Islamist-inspired militia blamed for killing 14 UN peacekeepers in November, the worst loss of life in a single incident for the organisation for 25 years. Dozens have died in frequent ambushes and skirmishes. Though Goma, the biggest city in the east, remains calm, militias have clashed with security forces on its outskirts. Elsewhere in the east, ethnic tensions have led to massacres. Around the town of Bunia, hundreds have died. There have been fierce battles west of the town of Masisi, as government troops attacked the base of a powerful local warlord known as General Delta. Among the more than 1.4 million forced from their homes in North Kivu province by the recent fighting is Baraka Buira, who fled with her brother and sister when armed men from one of the most powerful local militia attacked her village near the small town of Nyabiondo shortly after government troops launched an offensive against its bases three weeks ago. Hidden among the trees, the 14-year-old watched as men were beaten and women dragged screaming into huts. Buira saw several corpses on the ground but believes her parents also fled. She is unaware of their whereabouts. “We are suffering. This is our unhappiness,” said Buira, who carried her two smaller siblings for 48 hours to reach the relative safety of a camp for displaced people. The camp has no water and no food distribution since aid organisations withdrew from the region citing growing insecurity months ago. A family has allowed Buira to share their makeshift shack, but can provide little else. One of the few international NGOs still working in the area is Médecins Sans Frontières. It supports, among other projects, a hospital with more than 300 beds at Masisi, where 17,000 people received care in 2017, a health centre in Nyabiondo, a network of mobile clinics and a fleet of ambulances. The work is increasingly dangerous. In the last two months, MSF personnel and vehicles have been attacked five times. Logistics pose enormous challenges too. It can take an entire day to drive the 60km from Goma to Masisi on muddy dirt tracks. There are no paved roads and many remote communities can only be reached by motorbike, some only after days walking on forest tracks. Patients regularly die when roads are cut by landslides, torrential rains or fighting. “The problem is that a volatile situation like we have now means people need us more than ever, but makes reaching them harder,” said Sebastien Teissier, who leads the MSF project at Masisi. The crises have been exacerbated by an absence of international forces. The United Nations mission in the DRC is the largest and most expensive peacekeeping effort, but five UN bases near Masisi were shut last year, following a US-led push to cut costs. Major Adil Esserhir, a spokesman for the UN peacekeepers, said the force was now “more agile”. “We have had to do the same work with less resources. The problem we are facing as a military [force] is that we must give a solution to a problem that is not military,” he said. Meanwhile the country has been roiled by protests, often bloodily repressed, since Kabila’s second electoral mandate expired 15 months ago. A rebellion in central provinces cost thousands of lives last year and there have been a series of mass prison breaks. “There is a lack of political will to crack down on the militia ... The only way this regime can keep power is to maintain a situation which allows them to keep pillaging. Each armed group can be tied to an official in Kinshasa, either in government or in the army,” said Fidel Bafilenda, an analyst in Goma. Senior officials admit the problem. “This is a country where anyone can exploit a militia. I can’t deny that there are contacts between politicians and the [armed] groups but there’s no proof that they are financing them. We are a young democracy,” said Julien Paluko, the governor of North Kivu. Paluko, a Kabilia loyalist, blamed “an absence of state authority” for the problems in North Kivu, which lies more than 1,000 miles east of Kinshasa. The army and police are demoralised, corrupt and poorly trained. An economic downturn and soaring prices have hit salaries. “Where there is no police, army or justice system, it’s the law of the jungle. We have to do better. We have had some difficult times but we’ve made a lot of progress too,” he said. The renewed fighting has meant a wave of sexual violence. Anastasia Icyizanye, an MSF health worker working in Nyabiondo, said fighters from one armed group raped 60 women in January when it seized a village market. MSF say they have recorded twice as many incidents of sexual violence each month in 2018 compared to last year. “Whenever there is fighting there is systematic rape – in villages, at checkpoints on roads, wherever,” Icyizanye said. DRC observers are particularly fearful of the growing tension between ethnic communities. Despite fertile soil and plentiful water, there is fierce competition for land in the heavily populated green hills above Lake Kivu, as well as for lucrative mines where gold, coltan and other key commodities prized in the developed world are scratched from the ground by artisanal miners. Leaders of the many local rebel groups say they are acting in self-defence. “We are simply protecting our villages. When the government and its allies stop trying to force us off our land then we will stop fighting. Until then the wars will continue,” Colonel Faustin Misibaho, a senior officer in the Patriots’ Alliance for a Free and Sovereign Congo (APCLS) told the Guardian. Many of the fighters are very young. Kapitu was 14 when he joined the rebels, seeking revenge after government soldiers killed his father and grandfather during a raid on their village. “My group killed a lot of people. We were really feared and respected,” he said. “I don’t think about those I killed personally. Why should I? They wouldn’t think about me if it was the other way round.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/mar/28/russian-officials-accuse-opposition-of-exploiting-shopping-centre-fire","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-28T17:08:56Z","webTitle":"Russian officials accuse opposition of exploiting shopping centre fire","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/28/russian-officials-accuse-opposition-of-exploiting-shopping-centre-fire","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/mar/28/russian-officials-accuse-opposition-of-exploiting-shopping-centre-fire","fields":{"headline":"Russian officials accuse opposition of exploiting shopping centre fire","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Several Russian officials and pro-Kremlin commentators have accused the country’s opposition of trying to take advantage of a blaze at a shopping centre that killed dozens of people, most of them children. The remarks came after thousands of people held an unsanctioned vigil in the Siberian city of Kemerovo, where Sunday’s fire killed 64, with many expressing anger over the government’s response to the tragedy. “We have come to the conclusion that this was a clear, planned demonstration aimed at discrediting the government,” said Vladimir Chernov, a vice-governor of Kemerovo region, without offering any evidence for his claim. “Very many [of the demonstrators] were stoked up young people … people attended without understanding what they were doing there.” In a similar move, Vladimir Putin’s leading political curator, Sergey Kirienko, warned political experts on Wednesday that “tragedies like these would be used for provocations”. The Russian president arrived in Kemerovo on Tuesday to find anger at officials’ handling of the tragedy. Thousands of residents congregated in a central square in a rare public demonstration with some calling for him to come to address them, or for the resignation of the local government. Riot police were deployed around the local administration building. On Wednesday a nationwide day of mourning was held for victims of the fire – the country’s deadliest since a blaze at a nightclub in 2009 that killed 156 – and the first funerals took place in Kemerovo. Among the first people buried were a grandmother and her two grandchildren – aged eight and 10 – who died in a locked cinema on the shopping centre’s top floor while watching cartoons. They were buried in the same grave. Moscow and St Petersburg also held unsanctioned vigils on Tuesday evening, attended by thousands. The tragedy has led to a tacit tug-of-war between government and public initiatives. The mayor’s office hastily arranged a 5pm vigil by the Kremlin in Moscow after activists called mourners out to attend a 7pm memorial nearby. Five people have been detained by investigators who said fire alarms at the mall were shut off and emergency exits locked. A Russian court on Wednesday arrested the manager of the shopping centre for two months. But it is unclear whether any regional officials will also be investigated. In Kemerovo, several heated confrontations between locals and officials laid bare heightened tensions over the tragedy and a public distrust in information released by the government about the fire. In one encounter, Sergey Tsivilyev, a vice-governor for the region, accused a protester of “making PR of the tragedy”. The protester, Igor Vostrikov, responded by saying he had lost three young children, his wife and sister, all of whom were trapped in the cinema. Members of a “citizen’s action group” who met Putin said they believed hundreds had been killed in the fire, although the official death toll remained at 64. Yelena Mizulina, a pro-Kremlin MP who helped introduce socially conservative legislation such as the country’s ban on gay propaganda, said she wanted to speak in support of Putin on a national TV programme on Tuesday evening. “It’s a stab in the back, it’s a terrible shock,” said Mizulina. “What he’s doing today for Russia are incredible things, defending Russia in the international arena, carrying through reforms of unbelievable power internally.” Vladimir Solovyov, one of the country’s most-watched television hosts, said during the same programme that “when the crowd demands blood and doesn’t care about facts ... Then that’s already not a government.” Warnings about possible provocations from the opposition came just weeks after Putin overwhelmingly won re-election in the Kemerovo region with more than 85% of the vote. While Putin remains popular across the country, the results of the election only reveal so much. Dissatisfaction over local issues, such as poor services or stagnant wages, remain higher and the Kremlin is concerned about local protests snowballing into larger movements. In a video blog released on Wednesday evening, the Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny dived into the fray, saying that the death rate of seven of every 1,000 Russians killed by fire was a product of pervasive graft in the country’s firefighting services. “These people in the Winter Cherry shopping centre were killed by corruption,” he wrote."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2018/mar/29/readers-recommend-playlist-songs-about-clocks-and-watches","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-29T11:00:13Z","webTitle":"Readers recommend playlist: songs about clocks and watches","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/mar/29/readers-recommend-playlist-songs-about-clocks-and-watches","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/mar/29/readers-recommend-playlist-songs-about-clocks-and-watches","fields":{"headline":"Readers recommend playlist: songs about clocks and watches","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Here is this week’s playlist – songs picked by a reader from hundreds of your suggestions last week. Thanks for taking part. Read more about how our weekly series works at the end of the piece. A watch, for someone my age at least, feels like a part of the body that just ought to be there – leaving the house without it is impossible. Checking the time is a habit. If I have forgotten it, I’ll keep looking pointlessly at the empty expanse of wrist. Ensuring everything is in place, then, let’s begin our journey. She’s gone, and all [Samuel John] Lightnin’ Hopkins has left is Just a Wristwatch on My Arm. No money, but he knows what time it is and how much has passed. “I’ll just wait until your money comes home,” he says. A story of true romance. Or the true blues at least. Aussie rockers Wolfmother use a Sundial as a metaphor for the passage of time. Given enough of it, according to them, the ordinary can come to seem extraordinary. Or the strangeness of the ordinary can be revealed. Heavy rock began as an interpretation of the electric blues, and you can still hear the influence, but there’s little of the laid-back or the melancholy here. Some have drawn comparisons to Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath. Far, far away from this sound and fury sits Nataly Dawn. Like Lightnin’, she’s Counting Down the seconds and minutes. And whatever the clock tells her it’s time to do, that’s OK. She’ll let the time pass “until I’m with you”. She doesn’t say anything about his money either. That’s more like it. Beautifully written, beautifully sung. What more could you want? “Each watch I smash apart, just adding to my power”. Steady on. We like our watches in these parts. Mind you, this Dukes of Stratosphear song, 25 O’Clock, is here partly by popular acclaim, nominated several times, with one poster even saying they would be “amazed if the Dukes don’t make the list”. But the song, with its slightly ‘Floydian intro, did worm its way into my affections. Ah, Nick Drake. How could I not list his lovely At the Chime of the City Clock? It’s good to be reminded of this eternally young man’s immense talent. A boy from the country, loose in the city where even the chime of the clock seems different. “In the light of a city square / Find out the face that’s fair / Keep it by your side / When the light of the city falls / You fly to the city walls / Take off with your bride.” I said when opening the topic that songs with the sound of clocks as well as clockwise lyrics would be in the running. The next offering, Trellisaze by Slowdive, is devoid of lyrics and as abstract and dreamlike as anything they have recorded. An old-fashioned ticking of a pendulum-driven grandfather clock, some wordless vocals and a hypnotic sound that draws the listener into a world that seems – dare I say it – timeless. We need a wake-up call and can count on Della Reese to provide (a rather unusual) one, by way of her Clock That’s Got No Hands. Della insists that’s what she needs. This is another song about a lover who has departed. In this take on the theme, Della’s not going to count any seconds or stare at any wristwatch. A clock without hands and a calendar without any days so she doesn’t have to know how long he’s been gone. We’ve had our clocks and our watches and a sundial. But Scott Walker is occupied with the speaking clock – the version I remember from my childhood. A woman I was convinced was called Tim, because that’s what you had to dial back when telephones had letters as well as numbers. I never had the kinds of thoughts about the Time Operator Walker expresses here, mind. And if I’d known that he had, well I’d have challenged the bounder to a duel. Over to France for La Pendule by Ina-Ich. I’m relying on an online translation of the lyrics to justify its inclusion. That and the fact that it sounds so compelling. It begins, charmingly, with chimes but soon turns rather dark – in a good way. There’s nothing dark about a classic Smokey Robinson song. Lyrically inventive and vocally ethereal. The perfect voice for soothing the troubled soul and lyrics from a man once called America’s “greatest living poet”. Where’s Smokey’s Nobel prize? That’s what I’d like to know. And so to Pink Floyd. No, not the song about the axe. This one: Time. “Ticking away / The moments that make up a dull day” and all that. The original was nominated, but I have to go for the Easy All Stars take on the theme. Another, more dubwise version by the same crew was nominated quite late in the day and caused something of a dilemma, but this won out in the end. The whole Dub Side of the Moon album is a prime example of something that just shouldn’t work, but does. A remarkable achievement. And finally, how come I had never heard of Krista Detor before? Nobody tells me anything. Our finale is a song performed by the lady from Indiana with Karine Polwart, Emily Smith and Rachael McShane. Somewhere bells are ringing, somewhere someone’s marrying Or a casket someone’s carrying – a crowd somewhere is gathering Somewhere a bell is marking what is passing and sublime Like the clock of the world keeping perfect holy time Written to celebrate Darwin Day and appearing on the Darwin Song Project album, it seems to me to be a simply beautiful way to end this week’s clockwise list. I hope you think so too. New theme: how to join in The next theme will be announced at 8pm (GMT) on Thursday 29 March. You will have until 11pm on Monday 2 April to submit nominations.

A Day in the Life of Marlon Bundo, a picture book written by Jill Twiss that recounts how Pence’s rabbit falls in love with a male bunny, was an immediate hit, reaching No 1 on Amazon. Publisher Chronicle Books has said it is now printing 400,000 copies, up from an initial figure of 40,000. Dedicated “to every bunny who has ever felt different”, Oliver’s title was released in response to – and just before – Pence’s daughter Charlotte and wife Karen’s Marlon Bundo’s A Day in the Life of the Vice President, which is currently No 48 on Amazon. Pence has said that gay marriage will lead to the “deterioration of the family” and “societal collapse”. Proceeds from Oliver’s book will go to Aids United and the LGBTQ charity the Trevor Project. But beleaguered independents in America have slammed the late-night television show host’s decision to point viewers towards Amazon for purchase when initially announcing the surprise publication. Booksellers told US book trade magazine Publishers Weekly that they had not been informed about the title. “I didn’t even know there was a vice-presidential bunny,” New Hampshire bookseller Laura Cummings, owner of White Birch Books in North Conway, told the magazine. In an open letter, the Golden Notebook Bookstore in Woodstock’s owner James Conrad called the Amazon-only release “a slap in the face”. “I am a gay man who co-owns an independent bookstore,” he wrote. “These stores, in the tradition of gay and lesbian bookstores that are now nearly extinct, tirelessly work to promote a range of issues from freedom of speech, women’s rights, immigration issues, diversity – I can go on. We donate money, public space and our heart to causes on a daily basis.” Chronicle’s president Tyrrell Mahoney apologised to independent booksellers, telling them: “We had to ensure that the book was a complete surprise for the Last Week Tonight with John Oliver audience,” and so “ultimately agreed to make the book available for purchase at the time of the on-air surprise by allocating a percentage of the print run to Amazon and making the rest of the first print run available to all our other retailers as soon as possible”. But independents told Publishers Weekly that they were used to respecting embargos, and would have kept the secret. “Indie bookstores are used to taking all necessary steps to protect the confidentiality of title information, including signing of affidavits, and would certainly have done that in this instance given the chance,” said chief executive of the American Booksellers Association, Oren Teicher. “ABA firmly believes that our industry is stronger when we can all compete on a level playing field, and, conversely, that providing one channel a competitive advantage is, in the end, bad for everyone.” The title’s dedicated website now directs customers towards a range of booksellers, with independents, chains and Amazon among its options. It is, however, currently out of stock at both Amazon and independent bookshop site IndieBound, as Chronicle rushes through its latest reprint."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/mar/28/what-did-i-learn-from-my-diy-dna-test-how-foolish-i-was-to-sign-my-life-away","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-28T15:03:04Z","webTitle":"Why did I risk my privacy with home DNA testing?

I blame my Neanderthal heritage","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"I have made a terrible mistake. I have sold all my DNA on the internet. Actually, it’s worse than that: I recently paid a not-insignificant sum to a technology company that could decide to sell my DNA on the internet. Why did I do this? Well, embarrassing as it is to admit, I did it because all my friends did. Direct-to-consumer genetic testing is all the rage these days and many a millennial gathering seems to include a discussion about your 23andMe or Ancestry.com test results – at least in the US, anyway, where the technology is most popular. The DIY DNA industry entered the mainstream last year and is projected to grow rapidly. Industry estimates suggest that roughly 1 in 25 adult Americans now have access to their genetic data. Getting your DNA analysed is easy. Simply buy one of the numerous kits available, spit in a tube and send said spit to a lab. A few weeks later you get a report breaking down whatever genetic information you have paid for. I chose to shell out $199 (£140) for an analysis that promised information about my ancestry and genetic propensity to conditions including Parkinson’s disease, late-onset Alzheimer’s and various forms of cancer. That’s the Ferrari of at-home genetic tests, by the way. For just $29 (£20), I could have bought a Superhero DNA test revealing my “unique superhero traits”. Disappointingly, this doesn’t test you to see if you are part spider but looks at whether you have gene variants linked to things such as high muscle strength. So, what did my results reveal? Well, mainly that, like many things in life, direct-to-consumer genetic testing is tailored for white people. The test was able to break down my 53.5% European ancestry in very granular detail, telling me what percentage British and Irish I was compared with Italian, French, Balkan and Iberian. However, it broke down the rest of my heritage into the incredibly broad categories of Middle Eastern and north African, explaining in a helpful blurb that, hey, they’re basically the same thing. My results contained a lot of information I have long suspected: such as the fact that I do not have the genetic makeup of an elite athlete. It also offered some highly dubious “insights”. Apparently, people with my genetics tend to wake up at 8.39am on their days off, for example. Perhaps the most fascinating thing I learned was that my DNA contains 238 Neanderthal variants. I thought that might make me special but, no, we are all a little bit Neanderthal apparently. Our Neanderthal ancestry affects us in ways I had never imagined. I am proud to say I have one Neanderthal variant associated with a reduced tendency to sneeze after eating dark chocolate. I’m putting that information on LinkedIn immediately. Although, to be honest, I wouldn’t be surprised to find LinkedIn has already procured a copy of my genetic makeup and is using it to suggest other people I should add to my professional network. The company’s privacy policy contains the usual caveats about not using your sensitive information without your consent, but these are very broad, and consumer protection experts have advised that you ought to assume that, when it comes to DNA tests, you are signing your life away. Delving into my DNA taught me some fascinating things about Neanderthal sex and afforded an opportunity for some genetic navel-gazing. However, nothing I learned was worth the price-tag and privacy risks involved. Direct-to-consumer genetic testing may be growing in popularity, but I strongly suggest you don’t try it at home. Meanwhile, my only consolation for idiotically sending my intimate information into the ether is that I can at least blame my Neanderthal DNA. No wonder those guys went extinct. Heineken’s new ad shows the industry has a thinking problem Advertising people are supposed to know how to communicate. That is literally their job. Marketing departments invest a lot of time and money in understanding the different ways in which their messaging might be interpreted. Nevertheless, not a month seems to go by without a large company releasing a tone-deaf ad that should never have seen the light of day – and, indeed, probably never would have if most ad agencies weren’t largely melanin-free zones. Dove and H&amp;M have both apologised for “racist” adverts in recent months. This week, Heineken Light joined the club with a commercial featuring a bartender sliding a bottle of beer past a number of black people before it lands next to a light-skinned woman. “Sometimes, lighter is better,” a tagline announces. It does not take a genius to see what the problem with this is. It did, however, take a number of complaints before Heineken canned the ad. On Sunday, for example, Chance the Rapper tweeted that it was “terribly racist” and said he thought some companies were purposely “putting out noticeably racist ads so they can get more views”. I think it is highly unlikely that is the case. I worked in advertising for several years and when it comes to offensive ads, I reckon it’s fair to say you should not ascribe to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity. Ads such as Heineken’s aren’t a machiavellian attempt to get more views; they are a reflection of the woeful lack of diversity in most ad agencies and marketing departments. The reason you get “noticeably racist” ads such as these is not because people are actively trying to make them but because the industry still seems incapable of noticing just how racist it is. Why our future health may depend on cockroach power The American cockroach is a terrifying creature. It can fly, run as fast as the human equivalent of 210 miles an hour, and live for a week without a head. Keys to the cockroach’s powers are encoded in its DNA, which has recently been sequenced by Chinese scientists.

Katie (Bella Thorne) is a superhot high-school graduate with the (genuine) condition of XP, or xeroderma pigmentosum, which means she can’t go out in sunlight. Coyly, the movie is set in Washington state: the Twilight heartland. Her adoringly protective dad Jack has homeschooled her – he is played by Rob Riggle, usually a broad comedy guy. Katie likes nothing more than going out late at night and wholesomely busking her keening, insightful songs with the acoustic guitar that naturally belonged to her late mother (cue: soft-focus flashbacks at the beach). She does this at the, erm, strangely dark and mostly deserted railway station, evidently a place where musically minded but tragically unwell young women can pick up a few bucks late at night. Then the hunkily sensitive young Charlie (played by Patrick Schwarzenegger, son of Arnold) happens to be ambling along by the tracks and is entranced by her music. They get to talking. He too has problems: a shoulder injury has put him out of the swim team and ruined his chances of a sports scholarship. But he did that while he was drunk, so the fault was totally in his stars. Katie can’t bear to tell him about her condition or why they can only meet in the evening for all activities up to and including kissing, but one night Charlie takes her on a wild late-night trip to Seattle. It’ll be all right as long as they keep an eye on the time! Gulp!

The arrest of the former Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont in Germany on Sunday, and the decision by his former education minister, Clara Ponsatí, to turn herself in to Scottish police on Wednesday, may be diplomatically delicate. But despite protests from German leftwingers and Scottish, Spanish and Belgian nationalists, Europe’s leaders show little sign of budging from their position that Catalonia’s independence drive must remain strictly a matter for Madrid. The Spanish case against Puigdemont and other members of his former government who fled abroad – besides Ponsatí in Scotland, three are currently in Belgium and two in Switzerland – is therefore a judicial, not a political, question, they believe. “Spain is a democracy, where the rule of law exists,” Angela Merkel’s spokesman said after Puigdemont was detained near the Danish border on his way from Finland to Brussels, where he had been in self-imposed exile since late October. Others are not so sure. Germany’s far-left Die Linke party called Puigdemont’s arrest a disgrace, arguing – in the words of the its European affairs spokesman, Andrej Hunko, that the criminal case “is clearly politically motivated”. In Scotland, the SNP MP Angus MacNeil said the Scottish police should not be “doing the political work of the fascists” in the Spanish government, while in Spain, the Basque nationalist MP Izaskun Bilbao demanded urgent EU action on Spain’s “territorial problems”. Mark Demesmaeker, an MEP from the New Flemish Alliance, which seeks the secession of Flanders from Belgium, said Madrid was “escalating the repression. Democracy is in crisis, dialogue has been denied. The EU must open its eyes and facilitate political dialogue.” The SNP’s parliamentary leader in Westminster, Ian Blackford, wrote to the Spanish ambassador to London to say his country’s pursuit of the separatist politicians “goes against the principle of democracy and of respect for human rights, and risks people’s basic civil liberties”. The former Catalan leaders – who argue Spain is authoritarian, the case against them is political and that as elected politicians they had a democratic mandate to push for regional independence – are wanted on charges ranging from rebellion to misuse of public funds for organising last October’s independence referendum, which Spain’s top court ruled was unconstitutional. The charge of rebellion, which carries a maximum sentence of 30 years in prison, is questioned by some Spanish legal experts since it requires evidence of a “violent uprising” and could be hard to prove in court. Few European countries have a direct equivalent for it, which may also prove an obstacle to extradition. The EU, already dealing with Brexit, the fallout from Italy’s elections and growing tensions with its eastern members, has little appetite for any formal intervention. Under the Lisbon treaty it is in any case bound to respect the “essential state functions, including ensuring the territorial integrity” of member states. While Brussels is tussling with rightwing, populist governments in Poland and Hungary over the rule of law and fundamental democratic values, Spain – despite Madrid’s forceful, sometimes violent, attempt to disrupt the referendum – is seen as a country that respects its judiciary and can resolve its own political conflicts. The bloc, which views itself above all as a members’ club, is also concerned that recognising the outcome of an illegal referendum would set a precedent for other regions with aspirations to independence, such as Flanders, Lombardy and Corsica. Many believe the EU could offer behind-the-scenes mediation, and that Madrid might benefit from being told, informally, that it is not really helping itself by tackling Catalonia’s unrealistic drive for independence as it would high treason. But few member state governments see any benefit in either angering Madrid or encouraging secessionists. Their stance is unchanged since Donald Tusk, the European council president, said last year: “It is not on our agenda. All of us have our opinions, but formally speaking there is no space for an EU intervention.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/mar/29/royal-flying-doctors-funded-to-provide-mental-health-outreach-for-first-time","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-28T19:13:20Z","webTitle":"Royal flying doctors funded to provide mental health outreach for first time","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/mar/29/royal-flying-doctors-funded-to-provide-mental-health-outreach-for-first-time","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/mar/29/royal-flying-doctors-funded-to-provide-mental-health-outreach-for-first-time","fields":{"headline":"Royal flying doctors funded to provide mental health outreach for first time","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The Turnbull government will provide an extra $84m to the Royal Flying Doctor Service to expand essential health services by providing mental health nurses for remote and rural areas. On Thursday the prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, and deputy prime minister Michael McCormack will be in Broken Hill to announce that the service will establish a mental health outreach clinic for the first time in its 90-year history. In the 2018 budget the Turnbull government will provide a total of $327m over four years to ensure ambulance, dental and mental health services are extended to areas where commonwealth-funded activity currently doesn’t reach or is limited. About $84m is new funding for psychologists and mental health nurses in a mental health outreach clinic program to begin operation by the start of next year. Last year the Royal Flying Doctor service cared for 335,000 people including 36,799 air retrievals and 70,576 road transfers of patients. Its chief executive, Martin Laverty, said the services’ aeromedical and dental services “now have certainty” with the extension of funding. “We can now also deliver a new mental health service to underserved country areas in all states and the Northern Territory,” he said. “All who live, work, and travel in country Australia can do so knowing the [Royal Flying Doctor Service] is on standby if needed, thanks to support of the Liberal-Nationals government.” The chief executive of Mental Health Australia, Frank Quinlan said: “Remote Australians see mental health professionals at one fifth the rate of city people. “Large parts of country Australia have no registered psychologists. This new funding for mental health care in remote Australia will help to fill that gap.” The Royal Flying Doctor Service is celebrating its 90th birthday. In a statement Turnbull said: “That’s 90 years of providing care to Australians living in some of the nation’s most remote areas, often in the most challenging circumstances. “Ninety years of changing lives. Ninety years of saving lives.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/mar/28/michael-gove-recycle-image-plastic-bottles-green","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-28T11:14:39Z","webTitle":"Michael Gove’s latest bid to recycle his image | Jonathan Freedland","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/28/michael-gove-recycle-image-plastic-bottles-green","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/28/michael-gove-recycle-image-plastic-bottles-green","fields":{"headline":"Michael Gove’s latest bid to recycle his image","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"It used to be so simple. The relationship between enlightened, progressive folk and Michael Gove was one of straightforward loathing. He was the education secretary who had so enraged parents, pupils and especially teachers that even David Cameron realised he had to be moved out of sight before the Tories dared face the voters in 2015. And that was before Brexit. Plenty of remainers are convinced that, had it not been for the decision of Gove and Boris Johnson to campaign for leave, Brexit would have been defeated, fatally framed as the lost cause of Nigel Farage and the eccentric Tory fringe. Gove particularly gave leave a patina of intellectual respectability: had he not declared for Brexit first, it’s hard to imagine Johnson would have joined Farage alone. What’s more, it was Gove who uttered the words that distilled the spirit of populist disdain for facts and evidence, and became a slogan for our post-truth age: “I think that the people of this country have had enough of experts.” For all those reasons, then, Gove is a natural villain for the Guardian-reading classes. And yet, what’s this? Today the secretary of state at the Department of the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs has been praised by Greenpeace, WWF and, even if tentatively, by the Green party leader, Caroline Lucas. The prompt for these plaudits is his decision to introduce across England a deposit scheme for all drinks containers, whether bottles made of plastic or glass or cans. Under the scheme, consumers will pay a penny or two more for each drink they buy, but then receive a cash or voucher when they hand the container back for recycling. Green groups have been demanding this move for years. They have seen the figures from, say, Germany where the scheme has been in place since 2003 and has led to a recycling rate for plastic bottles of 99%, compared with just 43% of the 13bn plastic bottles sold in the UK every year. But today’s green praise for Gove is no one-off. My esteemed colleague George Monbiot has admitted his own shocked admiration for some of Gove’s policy decisions, tweeting last November: “My thoughts about #MichaelGove when he was education secretary were unprintable. But as environment secretary he’s the one spot of light in a terrible government.” What Monbiot had in mind that day was Gove’s backing for a total ban on insect-harming pesticides in fields across Europe, in the light of evidence showing that those neonicotinoids had caused grave damage to colonies of bees. A month later, Monbiot was popping up in the letters column of Private Eye, defending Gove from attack and saying that on the question of soil health, “Gove was right and Private Eye was off with the fairies.” More profound is Gove’s plan to make farming subsidies dependent on recipients providing a public good. From now on, landowners won’t get cash simply for owning land: they will have to prove that they are making a genuine contribution to the environment. That is a serious shift. Animal welfare groups have similarly welcomed the moves Gove has made towards a ban on ivory sales, bigger penalties for animal cruelty and the imposition of CCTV in slaughter houses. Environmental groups wish that the proposed ban on all petrol and diesel cars and vans by 2040 was accelerated, but they say that, overall, they have come to see Gove as an ally. All of this is quite a turnaround. Of course, Gove himself would say there’s no contradiction between his two personas, hate figure and poster boy for the liberal left. He argues that, for example, it’s thanks to Brexit that the UK will soon be able to restrict the live export of animals or ban products that breach UK animal welfare standards. More deeply, he would say that he remains ideologically consistent – that conservation is, naturally, a conservative ideal. But a more sceptical view is possible. For one thing, as a former journalist, Gove understands the importance of narrative in politics: he has carefully and deliberately cultivated this new green-friendly version of himself. Seasoned Defra-watchers say that many of his headline-grabbing announcements amount to less than meets the eye, either expending little political capital or else avoiding cast-iron commitments. Even this latest bottle deposit scheme is still only at the consultation stage. And what might be the purpose of this canny repositioning? Recall that in those crazy post-referendum weeks, Michael Gove knifed his Brexiteer busmate Boris Johnson by offering himself as a candidate for the Tory leadership. That ambition has not evaporated. Gove understands that a Brexiteer admired by usually hostile elements of the left could be quite an enticing prospect for a post-Theresa May Tory party. If Gove is being nice to bees and doing his bit for recycling, it won’t solely be out of concern for the planet’s future – but with an eye on his own. • Jonathan Freedland is a Guardian columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"artanddesign/2018/mar/29/rabbit-town-theme-park-very-familiar-works-of-art-indonesia","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-29T01:00:01Z","webTitle":"Is Rabbit Town a rip-off?

The theme park with very familiar art","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"A bizarre new theme park that claims to be designed for “selfie tourism” in Indonesia is causing consternation over accusations that it unashamedly rips off famous international works of art. Located in the city of Bandung, West Java, the Rabbit Town theme park features a rabbit petting zoo and art installations that appear to be blatant replicas of famous works. One installation, called the Patrico Sticker Room, which features a white room covered in colourful dots, looks a lot like renowned Japanese artist Yayoi Kusama’s work Obliteration Room. Other international artworks that are said to have been copied include Chris Burden’s lampposts installation Urban Light – at Rabbit Town it is called Love Light – and several rooms that bear uncanny resemblances to displays at the Museum of Ice Cream in Los Angeles. Rabbit Town markets itself as a destination for “selfie tourism” and its Instagram account, which includes the tagline “the way to more happiness” punctuated by a rabbit emoji, features dozens of its guests taking photos at its installations. Sunaryo, a celebrated artist and gallery owner in Bandung, first heard about Rabbit Town when it went viral on social media this week. “This is embarrassing because Bandung is known as a creative city but then you have someone making this,” he said. “For artists who work hard for their careers, to have their works taken like that is heartache.” Sunaryo said the inspiration behind the works was clear and their public and commercial display problematic. Rabbit Town, he suggested, should apologise and clarify the permissions status for the works. Amir Sidharta, an art researcher and auctioneer, said Rabbit Town was clearly catering to the art market. “I think Rabbit Town is the kind of place in which the owner is very responsive to what people are looking at in museums,” he said. “People are going to museums not for their knowledge enhancement but more for taking selfies.” People in Indonesia’s art world are understandably upset about Rabbit Town, he said, and not only because of copyright issues. The theme park “could have easily engaged many Indonesian artists, since we have many talented Indonesian artists that could have produced unique creations just for his place, and that would be much more interesting.” Rabbit Town was opened in January by Henry Husada, the chief executive and chairman of the Kagum Group, and is located on his two-hectare property, according to a report by the Indonesian news site Kompas.com. Husada’s interest in rabbits is thought to be derived from his Chinese zodiac sign. As well as taking selfies, Rabbit Town visitors can also feed doves and koi fish, see monkeys, pet rabbits and view Husada’s collection of rabbit sculptures. The theme park has been contacted for comment."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"global/2018/apr/03/good-to-meet-you-gaynor-mcgrath","type":"article","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"Global","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-03T10:59:14Z","webTitle":"Good to meet you … Gaynor McGrath","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2018/apr/03/good-to-meet-you-gaynor-mcgrath","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global/2018/apr/03/good-to-meet-you-gaynor-mcgrath","fields":{"headline":"Good to meet you … Gaynor McGrath","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Long ago, working near Hampstead Heath in London, I would climb up great trees on the Heath at lunchtimes, and settle down on a comfortable branch to read my Manchester Guardian.

He then starts from the front and studies every photo and drawing, and asks me all about them.

Researchers have unearthed 29 footprints in a layer of sediment on the shoreline of Calvert Island in British Columbia. Between 11,000 and 14,000 years ago, as the world was coming towards the end of the last ice age, the sea level there was 2m to 3m lower than today. While it is not clear quite how many humans were responsible for the tracks, the team said there are at least three different sizes of footprints, including one set that appeared to belong to a child. “We were actively searching for archaeological sites along this lower shoreline when we came across the footprints. It is likely the tracks were left in an area that was just above the high tide line 13,000 years ago,” said Dr Duncan McLaren, first author of the research from the University of Victoria in British Columbia and the Hakai Institute on Calvert Island. Writing in the journal Plos One, the team describe how they began excavations on the island in 2014, noting that nearby there were shell-containing man-made rubbish dumps, or middens, which dated to up to 6,100 years ago, as well as chipped stone tools and manmade arrangements of stone boulders on the seashore. “This site has a large, protected beach, which we felt was likely to have attracted people to it for many millennia. As sea level has been relatively stable in the region over the last 14,000 years, we reasoned that this area had potential for very old archaeological remains,” said McLaren. The first human footprint was unearthed 60cm below the surface of the current beach, pressed into a layer of brown clay and filled with black sand and gravel. Fortunately, small pieces of wood were discovered in the heel of the print, and were radiocarbon-dated to just over 13,000 years ago. The team returned during 2015 and 2016 to carry out further excavations, uncovering another 28 footprints. In some cases it was possible to see the impressions of individual toes and arches of the feet. Measurements of 18 of the tracks revealed they were made by at least three different individuals. “We had to excavate very carefully and slowly, which was difficult as we had to race the tide,” said McLaren. McLaren said the finds helped to unpick a longstanding conundrum. In the last ice age, Siberia and Alaska were connected by a large land bridge in an area known as Beringia, while Canada was covered in ice sheets.“The basic question that many archaeologists ask is: ‘How did people get from Beringia to the area south of Canada during the last ice age?’” said McLaren. The new research adds weight to the idea that humans moved along glacier-free areas of land along the coast, between the ice and the sea – areas known to have provided a refuge for various plants and animals. “It suggests that people were using watercraft, and thriving and exploring coastal areas very early on,” McLaren said. Prof Nick Ashton, curator of Palaeolithic and Mesolithic collections at the British Museum, who has worked on the ancient Happisburgh hominid footprints in Norfolk, welcomed the findings. “This is an important discovery that has implications for the earliest colonisation of America,” he said. “It supports the idea that the first peopling of the Americas was from eastern Asia at a time of lower sea levels, when the landmasses were larger, but probably with the assistance of sea-faring vessels. The footprints provide a very tangible link to the first Americans.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2018/mar/20/inflation-dips-to-27-as-impact-of-brexit-vote-starts-to-fade","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-20T10:34:07Z","webTitle":"Inflation dips to 2.7% as impact of Brexit vote starts to fade","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/mar/20/inflation-dips-to-27-as-impact-of-brexit-vote-starts-to-fade","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/mar/20/inflation-dips-to-27-as-impact-of-brexit-vote-starts-to-fade","fields":{"headline":"Inflation dips to 2.7% as impact of Brexit vote starts to fade","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Inflation fell further than expected last month, as the impact of the Brexit vote on the price of petrol and food began to fade, easing the pressure on squeezed British households.

Phil Gooding from the ONS said a small fall in petrol prices alongside a slower rise in food prices than last year helped to pull down inflation: “Many of the early 2017 price increases due to the previous depreciation of the pound have started to work through the system.” The pound plunged immediately after the leave vote, driving-up the cost of importing fuel and food to Britain and putting intense pressure on household finances. Consumer spending has fallen as a consequence, while average wage growth has failed to beat inflation since the middle of last year. . The faster than expected decline in the rate of inflation will please the UK chancellor, Philip Hammond, as it brings closer the point at which real wage growth should return for British workers. The ONS will deliver an update on workers’ pay and the country’s latest employment figures on Wednesday. The ONS pointed to falling hotel prices and the cost of buying ferry tickets rising more slowly than a year ago. The price of seasonal produce such as fresh vegetables also rose by much less than a year ago, when flooding and storms in the Mediterranean led to a poor harvest. Although wage growth is unlikely to rise above inflation just yet, the chancellor told MPs at the spring statement last week that he expected inflation would fall back to the government’s target rate of 2% and that pay would rise at a faster rate within the next 12 months. The financial secretary to the Treasury, Mel Stride, said the government was cutting taxes and raising the minimum wage for the lowest earners. “This is part of our plan to build an economy that works for everyone.” Despite the promise of rising wages, some economists expect average earnings will remain below their pre-financial crisis peak until at least the middle of the next decade, making the post-crash era one of the worst periods for pay growth since the Napoleonic wars. Labour said the latest figures showed workers were still struggling with real earnings lower than when the Tories first came to power in 2010. Peter Dowd, shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, said the spring statement was a “missed opportunity that exposed Philip Hammond’s complacency, as it contained no new measures to deal with this rising burden faced by many working families”.However, the bigger-than-expected fall in price growth could undermine the Bank of England’s arguments for raising interest rates from as early as May. Mark Carney, the Bank’s governor, has suggested rising global oil prices and an upswing in the world economy could offset the fading impact of the Brexit vote, which could force Threadneedle Street to act. The Bank’s monetary policy committee, which could provide a hint for a May rate hike at its next meeting on Thursday, will also be watching for greater evidence of wage growth to support its case for raising the cost of borrowing. Economists expect pay to rise this year amid the lowest levels of unemployment since the mid 1970s, which should help to increase their bargaining power to demand higher wages. James Smith, an economist at ING Bank, said: “On the face of it, [the latest inflation reading] takes some of the pressure off the Bank of England to hike rates again in the near-term. However, policymakers are increasingly focusing on wage growth, which has been showing signs of life recently.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2018/mar/20/fishermen-tell-us-what-you-think-of-the-recent-brexit-concessions","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-20T10:18:24Z","webTitle":"Fishermen: tell us what you think of the recent Brexit concessions","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/mar/20/fishermen-tell-us-what-you-think-of-the-recent-brexit-concessions","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/mar/20/fishermen-tell-us-what-you-think-of-the-recent-brexit-concessions","fields":{"headline":"Fishermen: tell us what you think of the recent Brexit concessions","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"After pledging to repatriate control of UK fisheries and set quotas as part of core Brexit strategy, the government appears to have backed down in face of EU opposition.

Unfortunately for Liverpool the problem is increasingly that you can’t have enough of one. Fresh from selling Philippe Coutinho – or the poor man’s Christian Eriksen – to Barcelona they are bracing themselves for what transfer parlance would term another “raid” on their current star asset. That piece of goods is, of course, the remarkable Mohamed Salah – and now that he has been selfish enough to grab 37 goals for club and country by mid-March the rest of us will have to suffer an excruciating summer in which he is linked with Real Madrid, Barcelona and Paris Saint-Germain on a daily basis. All three are said to want the masterful Egyptian, and all three would probably be told a world-record offer is what is would take to get their man. If it’s going to happen, we can pray it happens quickly. Another talismanic wide forward could move on for rather less, although Crystal Palace might consider £40m small change for Wilfried Zaha given that, without him, their hopes of staying up would be consigned to dust. As it is they are quite likely to be fine, so will they wish the 25-year-old farewell and good luck when Tottenham come a-calling for one of their long-term targets? There is also a chance that whoever is managing Chelsea next season might benefit from his services. If the sound of pen and paper can be heard wafting over the Cobham rooftops, though, it more likely to be a result of Luke Shaw seeking sanctuary at his boyhood club. His days at Manchester United look numbered – unless, of course, the boss who keeps digging him out is turfed off before him. If José Mourinho does, as is far more likely, stick around then he will replace Shaw with the Fulham wunderkind Ryan Sessegnon. He might also lavish some riches on Real Madrid’s Raphaël Varane. And Mourinho also has an answer to the midfield problem that all those hundreds of millions simply haven’t yet solved. That answer is Aaron Ramsey – who you may remember joined Arsenal ahead of United back in 2008 – and he could be tempted given that his contract only has a year and a bit to run. Arsenal, in turn, are keen on the Paraguayan midfield metronome Richard Sánchez, a 21-year-old who currently plays for local big guns Olimpia. They also have their eyes on someone to play in nets, with Petr Cech getting no younger. Bernd Leno, linked with Liverpool and Napoli on these very pages only yesterday, is the man they are after – with £25m potentially enough to usher him out of Bayer Leverkusen."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"business/live/2018/mar/20/uk-inflation-sterling-wages-facebook-shares-markets-business-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-20T14:52:49Z","webTitle":"UK inflation rate hits seven-month low as Brexit effect fades - business live","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2018/mar/20/uk-inflation-sterling-wages-facebook-shares-markets-business-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/live/2018/mar/20/uk-inflation-sterling-wages-facebook-shares-markets-business-live","fields":{"headline":"UK inflation rate hits seven-month low as Brexit effect fades - business live","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Time for a quick recap Britain’s cost-of-living crisis has eased a little, after inflation fell back from its recent highs. The consumer prices index fell to 2.7% in February, down from 3% in January, and closer to wage growth. The Office for National Statistics reported that food and fuel inflation slowed, pulling down the benchmark cost of living. But, prices are still rising ahead of earnings - although tomorrow’s labour market statistics may show the gap narrowing. The impact of the pound’s fall after the EU referendum is starting to fade, after driving import prices sharply higher in 2017. Economists are split over whether the Bank of England will raise interest rates in May, as it tries to get inflation back down to 2% without driving up unemployment. Andrew Sentance, senior economic adviser at PwC, has warned that inflation could get an Easter bump, which would hurt households. In the markets, European stock markets are clawing back some ground after Monday’s selloff. But Facebook is being shunned again; its shares down another 3% as politicians and regulators probe how users’ personal data has been used. Despite Facebook’s deepening problems, the US stock market is recovering from Monday’s losses. The Dow Jones industrial average, which shed 335 points yesterday, is up 180 today. The tech-focused Nasdaq is flattish, with software firm Adobe up 2.8% and chipmaker NVIDIA up 1.1%. Facebook, though, is still down 3%. Back on inflation, our economics editor Larry Elliott has warned that the Bank of England could raise interest rates in May - if wages rise over the next couple of months. He writes: Earnings growth has been creeping up and before too long earnings will be increasing more quickly than prices. The sharper than expected fall in inflation means the return to rising real incomes will occur sooner and that will mean stronger growth and – from the MPC’s perspective – the threat of higher wage inflation. While there has been little in recent economic data to justify a May increase in rates, earnings data will be crucial. If the annual increase edges closer to 3%, a spring rise will be a real possibility. No sign of a bounceback for Facebook yet: Over in New York, shares in Facebook have fallen by another 3% at the start of trading. That’s on top of yesterday’s 6.7% rout, and knocks another $15bn off its market capitalisation. The selloff comes as the data scandal that hit the company last weekend deepens, with several new developments today: A former Facebook executive has told the Guardian that numerous companies harvested the personal data of its users America’s Federal Trade Commission is reportedly probing whether Facebook violated the terms of a 2011 consent decree over its use of personal data A parliamentary committee has asked Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg to answer questions European stock markets have recovered a little ground this morning, after yesterday’s selloff. In London the FTSE 100 has gained 22 points, having slumped to a 15-month low on Monday. However, worries over global trade spats, the Facebook data crisis and uncertainty over the pace of US interest rate rises are all keeping traders edgy. Elsewhere in the markets, legendary motor racing star-turned-airline manager Niki Lauda has landed a deal with Ryanair. The Irish budget airline has agreed to buy a 25% stake in Laudamotion - the Vienna-based operator which was created out of Laudi’s previous airline, Niki (formerly part of Air Berlin, which went bust last year). Ryanair intends to boost its state to 75% as soon as EU regulators have given their approval. It will lend Laudamotion six planes, which will boost its fleet to 21 -- helping it to challenge rival Lufthansa. Jane Foley, head of foreign exchange strategy at Rabobank, believes the Bank of England’s monetary policy committee will raise interest rates at least once this year. And despite today’s inflation figures, she believes they will hike Bank Rate from 0.5% to 0.75% in May. “Our expectation is of no change to rates at this week’s BoE meeting] but of a rise at the May meeting. In our view, though, the market is still focusing too much on the committee’s voting patterns. It is possible for every member to hold steady this time while also planning to vote for a hike in May. “The markets are better served by reading the Bank’s minutes closely and observing Mark Carney’s comments. It was clear at Davos, for example, that he was readying the markets for a potential rate increase during the first half of the year. “In terms of a November hike, there remain two core issues at play. The first is Brexit. If the process runs smoothly, the environment will be much more conducive to a rate rise. Secondly, the Bank will monitor UK wage growth closely. If this increases, pushing up inflation, it will be a lot easier to justify a rate hike. “These are significant factors, though, and so it is possible to envisage a rate rise in May but none later in the year if Brexit negotiations hit a snag and wages are flat.” The pound has dipped slightly, following the news that Britain’s consumer prices index has dropped to a seven-month low. Traders are calculating that the inflation slowdown makes a UK interest rate rise a little less likely in the next few months. But sterling is only down 0.1% against the US dollar today, to just over $1.40 (this tweet from Bloomberg makes it look more dramatic though!) The muted reaction suggests the City believes a May rate hike is still possible. Obviously the Bank of England will be pleased to see inflation falling towards its target of 2%. But if wages do pick up, policymakers might conclude that labour market slack has been eroded, so the economy can handle higher borrowing costs. Thursday’s meeting is an opportunity for the BoE to drop some hints... Households won’t be popping champagne bottles open when wages finally start rising faster than inflation. Economist Rupert Seggins has shown how workers’ earnings power has been badly eroded since the financial crisis, meaning people are poorer in real terms: In other news, the threat of a global trade war has hit investor confidence in Germany: House price inflation also fell last month, but is still rising faster than wages. The average house price rose by 4.9% in the 12 months to January, down from 5% a month earlier. Prices rose slowest in the North East (0.7%) and London (2.1%), but jumped fastest in the East Midlands (7.3). It’s possible that wages will catch up with inflation this month, predicts Stephen Clarke, senior economic analyst at the Resolution Foundation. “Import-driven inflation is clearly slowing. Food and beverage prices are rising at a slower rate than last month and further falls are likely. We can also see a slowdown in transport inflation, contributing just 0.35 ppts to annual inflation down from 0.8ppts a year ago, and the price of utilities is rising at a slower rate than before. Both are underpinned by a fall in the price of energy from its New Year highs. “The sharp fall in inflation means we could be seeing an earlier end to the pay squeeze than previously expected, perhaps as early as this month” We get the latest UK earnings figures tomorrow, in the unemployment data for November-January. Economists predict that wages rose by 2.6% per year in that quarter, which would almost eliminate the gap. Mel Stride, financial secretary to the Treasury, insists that the government is helping families cope with inflation. He says: “We know families feel the cost of living at the end of every working week. From next month a typical taxpayer will pay 1,000 less income tax than in 2010. “And we are increasing the National Living Wage, which is already helping the lowest earners see their pay rise by almost 7% above inflation. This is part of our plan to build an economy that works for everyone.” Stride also suggests that real wages should start rising again soon, as inflation is expected to keep dropping: Unions aren’t impressed, though. TUC general secretary Frances O’Grady warns that workers desperately need a proper pay rise after years of struggles: She says: “Britain’s living standards crisis is far from over. Today’s fall in prices may ease the pressure a bit. But working people will still be worse off at the end of this parliament than before the crash. “The government must up its game. Millions of workers haven’t had a proper pay rise in years. “Unless ministers invest in the infrastructure and public services needed for better-paid jobs, the UK will remain at the bottom of the league for real wage growth.” It’s now 14 months since the pound hit a 31-year low against the US dollar at $1.20, driving import prices higher. Sterling has since recovered to around $1,40. Phil Gooding, head of CPI at the Office for National Statistics, believes the impact of the pound’s slide is now fading: “A small fall in petrol prices alongside food prices rising more slowly than last year helped pull down inflation, as many of the early 2017 price increases due to the previous depreciation of the pound have started to work through the system. “Hotel prices also fell and the cost of ferry tickets rose more slowly than last year, when prices were collected on Valentine’s Day when many people could have been taking mini-breaks.” The battle against inflation isn’t over, warns Andrew Sentance, senior economic adviser at PwC. He predicts that consumer prices could push higher this month, as retailers and transport firms prepare for Easter: “It is not a surprise to see UK inflations tarting to fall back - from 3% in January to 2.7% in February. Forecasters were expecting price increases to ease back this year. But the rate of reduction is likely to remain slow and volatile. The fact that Easter is early this year could push inflation back up again in March. Sentance (a former Bank of England policymaker) also argues that UK interest rates could soon rise - even though inflationary pressures are easing. The UK recovery is now nearly nine years old, and yet our official interest rate is exactly where it was nine years ago. A further interest rate rise would be justified this Spring - which would show that the UK is following the lead of the US Federal Reserve in embarking on a policy of gradual and careful interest rate rises.” This slowdown in inflation should bring some relief to poorer families, says Richard Lim of Retail Economics: “Key areas driving the decline included transport and food which comprise a large chunk of expenditure, especially for the least affluent households. “While real earnings remain in negative territory, the financial pinch will continue to ease and we expect growth to resurface by mid-2018.” Jeremy Cook, chief economist at WorldFirst, predicts that UK pay rises could overtake inflation soon: “Following the decision by the ONS to exclude pork pies and nightclub bottled lagers from the inflation basket, we will soon get to a point wherein the declines the pound suffered following the EU referendum go a similar way. CPI at 2.7% is the lowest since July of last year and while wages are hardly setting the world alight, we could be within a few months of real wages turning positive for the first time since the beginning of last year.” British inflation seems to be falling back from its recent peak, says Suren Thiru of the British Chambers of Commerce: Economist Simon French of Panmure Gordon agrees that import price inflation is cooling. The BBC’s Kamal Ahmed is optimistic that real wages will start rising soon. More detail: Petrol prices fell by 0.2 pence per litre between January and February, to 120.8 pence per litre in February. Food and non-alcoholic beverages prices rose by 0.1% between January and February this year compared with a rise of 0.8% a year ago. This drop in inflation suggests that the impact of the Brexit vote is finally fading. Transport and food has the biggest downward impact on inflation, according to the Office for National Statistics. It says: The largest downward contributions to the change in the rate came from transport and food prices, which rose by less than a year ago. Falling prices for accommodation services also had a downward effect. Rising prices for footwear produced the largest, partially offsetting, upward contribution. In recent months, import costs had been pushed by drop in sterling after the EU referendum in June 2016. That impact may now be easing. Breaking! UK inflation has fallen to its lowest since last July. The consumer prices index has fallen to 2.7% in February, from 3% in January, taking some pressure off hard-pressed households. It suggests that the squeeze in earnings is coming to an end, as wages rose by 2.8% per year in December (although by 2.5% in the October-December quarter). More to follow! Real wages in the UK have been falling since last spring, so the end of the cost of living squeeze can’t come soon enough. New data from Barclaycard shows that 39% of people feel poorer than a year ago, due to rising inflation. Food and fuel prices are a key factor. Here’s some details: two-thirds (67 per cent) say it is because their weekly shop seems more expensive than it used to be 41 per cent say filling up the car seems more expensive than it used to A fifth (21 per cent) say the cost of a night out or meal in a restaurant seems more expensive than it used to One in five (20 per cent) say that the cost of travelling on public transport has gone up Economist Sam Tombs predicts that today’s inflation data will cut the chances that the Bank of England raises interest rates this spring. Just in: Europe’s trade commissioner, Cecilia Malmström, is jetting to America to insist that the EU is excluded from the new tariffs on steel and aluminium imports. Malmström, who has already threatened retaliatory action on American products, will meet with commerce secretary Wilbur Ross. However, US officials have already warned that president Trump will make the final decision, with a rather broad-brush approach: Economist Rupert Seggins is tweeting some handy charts about inflation: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Britain’s inflation is in the spotlight today, and for the first time in months we might get some good news. Economists predict that the consumer prices index fell in February, from January’s 3% to around 2.8% last month. If so, that would ease some of the pressure suffered by households since the pound slumped after the Brexit vote. The data is released at 9.30am - here’s the situation last month: A fall in inflation would offer hopes that the cost of living squeeze might be ending. Wages rose by 2.5% per year in the last quarter, and by 2.8% in December alone. If that trend continues, it’s possible that real wages might actually turn positive soon. Weaker inflation also takes some pressure off the Bank of England to raise interest rates, so today’s report could move sterling. Konstantinos Anthis, head of research at ADS Securities, says: The British pound will be front and centre this morning in light of the release of the UK inflation report. The Consumer Price Index is the number one concern for the Bank of England as the rallying inflation has forced the British central bank to grow more hawkish and signal three rate hikes over the next three years. Today’s report will be important in assessing when the first hike for this year will come. The Bank of England will set interest rates on Thursday (we’re not expecting a hike, though). The ONS will also release its latest UK house price data (for January). Also coming up today.... The technology sector is reeling after Facebook was engulfed in the Cambridge Analytica data scandal. Last night, around $36bn was wiped off Facebook’s value, knocking $5.5bn off Mark Zuckerberg’s personal wealth, as politicians demanded to know how the personal details of 50m Facebook users were harvested. As public anger mounts, Zuckerberg has been keeping a remarkably low profile. Parliament, though, wants answers. Conservative MP Damian Collins, chair of the digital, culture, media and sport select committee declared: “It’s time for Mark Zuckerberg to stop hiding behind his Facebook page.” Jasper Lawler of CMC Markets says investors have serious concerns: This is not the first time that Facebook have been caught being lax over their controls; both users and regulators are going to want this to be the last or at least see the firm go to extraordinary lengths to prevent incidences like this happening again. The next few weeks will be crucial as to how Facebook responds to the allegation. With Uber suspending its driverless-car testing after one of its vehicles hit and killed a woman in Arizona, big tech is under more scrutiny than ever. City traders will also be watching for the latest economic confidence figures from Germany, and consumer confidence across the eurozone. And in parliament, MPs will be quizzing top officials from Office of Budget Responsibility over last week’s spring statement. including chairman Robert Chote.

The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission is investigating the impact of Google, content aggregators such as Apple News and social media platforms such as Facebook on the state of competition in media and advertising. The inquiry has taken on a new urgency in the wake of revelations about Cambridge Analytica’s mining of Facebook data. The inquiry was triggered by the concerns of the former senator Nick Xenophon that tech giants were damaging the viability of Australian media companies, which have lost print advertising dollars since the digital disruption. The News Corp chief executive, Robert Thomson, has been highly critical of Google and Facebook, claiming they foster a “dysfunctional” and “debased” online environment that harms journalism. The vice-president of news for Google, Richard Gingras, said on Tuesday that the company was talking to Australian authorities and publishers about improving revenue streams for local media and combatting “disinformation”. “We recognise there are important changes going on,” Gingras said during a press briefing from New York. “So yes, it’s hugely important that various bodies [like the ACCC] look into these questions with greater knowledge and sophistication.” Gingras said he was already working with Fairfax Media and, in a reference to attacks from News Corp, said he would much rather collaborate than “exchange criticisms in the press”. Launching the $300m Google News Initiative to counter the effects of fake news and falling media advertising revenue, Gingras said the marketplace for information had changed – “no one uses the newspaper like we used to” – and that he was well aware of the impact of Google. Last year the select committee on the future of public interest journalism heard that 3,000 jobs in Australian journalism had been lost in the past five years, from News Corp, Fairfax Media and the ABC among others. Gingras deflected questions about Google’s dominance of digital advertising share and said Google sent millions of dollars of revenue back to publishers as well as traffic, and had recently launched products to drive subscription to newspapers. Between 2011 and 2015 Australian newspaper and magazine publishers lost $1.5bn and $349m respectively in physical print advertising revenue but only gained $54m and $44m in digital advertising, according to the ACCC issues paper. Google and Facebook now account for about three-quarters of total Australian online advertising expenditure. Google also said it was improving its algorithms to more heavily weight results towards “authoritative sources” to combat fake news. “One of the challenges of breaking news events is that they do attract bad actors,” Gingras said. “We will continue to enhance our ability to detect those situations and then, during a fast-breaking news event, shift our balance more towards authority.” He said YouTube was also changing and would highlight its “Top News” shelf as a place to find relevant content from verified news sources. The “Disinformation Lab” based at the Shorenstein Centre at Harvard is being funded by Google to monitor fake news during elections. A spokeswoman for the ACCC said submissions to the inquiry close in two weeks but was unable to confirm whether Google had provided a submission yet."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2018/mar/20/labor-vows-to-block-largest-removal-of-marine-area-from-conservation-ever","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-20T08:53:02Z","webTitle":"Labor vows to block 'largest removal of marine area from conservation, ever'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/mar/20/labor-vows-to-block-largest-removal-of-marine-area-from-conservation-ever","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/mar/20/labor-vows-to-block-largest-removal-of-marine-area-from-conservation-ever","fields":{"headline":"Labor vows to block 'largest removal of marine area from conservation, ever'","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Labor says it will move to disallow new marine park management plans proposed by the Turnbull government, branding the change the “largest removal of marine area from conservation, ever, from any government in the world”. The new management plans were uploaded by officials on the federal register of legislation on Tuesday, cutting across a public announcement the Turnbull government had planned to make on Wednesday. The shadow environment minister, Tony Burke, said the changes being proposed by the government were a significant step backwards in terms of conservation. Labor will move to disallow the proposed management plans in both the House of Representatives and the Senate. “There has never been a step backwards in conservation area as large as this from any country on earth,” Burke said on Tuesday. Labor before it lost office in 2013 unveiled a network of 42 marine reserves that was largely welcomed by environmental groups, but was designed to have a minimal impact on commercial activities, which led to some criticism from conservationists and scientists. When Tony Abbott came to government in 2013, Labor’s proposal was suspended. Abbott said he did not want to “lock up our oceans” and that more consultation was needed. The Turnbull government has taken the process through to its conclusion. Following a scientific review the Coalition released draft management plans for consultation in September last year. The final boundaries appeared on Tuesday. Burke said the government’s proposal was more negative than the one proposed by its experts. “Josh Frydenberg has looked at those changes and determined that even they didn’t go far enough and has decided to take even more areas out of environmental protection.” Labor says the plans have also opened up a recreational fishing zone to commercial operators. “The worst area affected is the Coral Sea,” Burke said. “Purse seine, longlining and mid-water trawling, which is the same method used by the super trawler, are all now allowed across the Coral Sea with a clear uninterrupted path from north to south.” The environment minister, Josh Frydenberg, rejected Burke’s characterisation. He described the new regime as “a world-leading management regime” for Australia’s marine parks. Frydenberg said the new management plans would mean Australia had 36% of its waters included in marine parks, and the new plans would be beneficial for recreational fishers. He said under the revised arrangements 97% of commonwealth waters within 100km of the coast would be open for recreational fishing, and 80% of marine parks. Frydenberg said the government’s proposal would mean an increase of 200,000 square kilometres in the area with seafloor protection. The government acknowledges that its new management plans contain fewer green zones, but it contends that “overall” there will be more areas protected by both green and yellow zones.

They have been with him for half a century. “Every time I think about it, it’s like pulling a scab off a sore,” he says. “It’s a hurtful, painful thought: that a man of love is killed by hate; that a man of peace should be killed by violence; a man who cared is killed by the careless.” Jackson and fellow civil rights veteran Andrew Young are the last surviving disciples of Martin Luther King who witnessed his assassination on 4 April 1968. Others who were at the Lorraine motel in Memphis, Tennessee, that day have been claimed by the passing decades. And each milestone anniversary has offered a snapshot of Jackson’s, and the nation’s, jagged and jarringly uneven narratives. Twenty years after the deadly shooting, in 1988, Baptist preacher Jackson was mounting his second bid to become America’s first black president. He invoked King and his death repeatedly as he took on Michael Dukakis in the Democratic primaries and caucuses. He won 11 contests but failed to gain the nomination. At the 40-year mark after King’s death, the torch had been passed to Barack Obama, locked in a Democratic primary of his own against Hillary Clinton and under pressure over his relationship with the outspoken pastor Jeremiah Wright. The senator praised Jackson, a fellow Chicagoan, for making his run possible. On the night Obama won the presidency, Jackson wept. Now it is 50 years and the wheel has turned again. Jackson announced last November that he has been diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease. Donald Trump, endorsed by the Ku Klux Klan, is in the White House. Just as many saw King’s assassination by the escaped convict James Earl Ray – a white man partly inspired by the segregationist governor George Wallace – as a reactionary strike against revolution, so Trump’s election has been interpreted as (in King’s phrase) a “white backlash” against Obama. Amid the tumult of the 1960s, King, outspoken against the Vietnam war, was one of the most hated men in America and his life was in constant danger. His house was bombed, his followers were killed, his name was trashed by newspaper editorials and his phones were tapped by J Edgar Hoover’s FBI. His two-thirds disapproval rating in a 1966 Gallup poll sits at odds with today’s “I have a dream” sanctification. “They loved him as a martyr after he was killed but rejected him as a marcher when he was alive,” recalls Jackson, 76, still a dedicated activist, speaking by phone from an African development conference in Morocco. “We tend to embrace martyrs. In many ways he has a moral authority now you wouldn’t see if he was still alive. He is a universal frame of reference for moral authority, the global frame of reference for nonviolent justice and social change. If he had not died, that probably would not be the case.” King and a group of close aides, including Jackson, headed to Memphis to support predominantly African American garbage workers who had gone on strike for better safety conditions and pay after two colleagues were crushed to death in the back of a truck. On the night of 3 April, members of the civil rights leader’s inner circle went to a public gathering at the Mason Temple. “He was reluctant to come to the meeting that night,” Jackson says. “He had a migraine headache, he didn’t feel like talking. Ralph Abernathy [a close friend of King] and I went to the church. The people saw us coming in: they were cheering. “Then Ralph Abernathy said to me, ‘Jesse, they’re not cheering for us. They think Martin’s behind us.’ He laughed. He went to the back of the church and called Dr King on the phone. He said, ‘Martin, come to the church and let them see you.’ Dr King said, ‘I’ll be there in a few minutes,’ and he came. Then Ralph Abernathy gave him a rather long introduction to give him time to think.” King went on to deliver a speech unbearable in its prescience. He described the “threats out there” and what fate might befall him at the hands of “some of our sick white brothers”. He said: “But it really doesn’t matter with me now, because I’ve been to the mountaintop. And I don’t mind. Like anybody, I would like to live a long life – longevity has its place. But I’m not concerned about that now … I’ve looked over and I’ve seen the promised land.” Jackson says: “There are those who think he was anticipating the next day. He had just come from a plane which had been emptied because of the threat of the plane being hit by a terrorist attack. He was aware but he felt that ‘a coward dies a thousand times before his death, but the valiant taste of death but once’. He refused to be afraid because of the risk of ambush and sabotage; he refused to stop what he was doing out of fear because he did it out of courage.” The next day, King was staying at his regular Memphis haunt, the Lorraine motel. It was 6pm and the group were preparing to head out for dinner. King was standing on the balcony outside room 306. As Jackson, who was in the car park eight feet below, tells it: “He said, ‘You’re late for dinner … You don’t even have on a shirt and tie.’ I said, ‘Doc, the prerequisite for eating is appetite, not a tie.’ He laughed and said, ‘You’re crazy.’ We joked around that way.” King turned to Ben Branch, a saxophonist standing next to Jackson, and asked him to perform his favourite song, Take My Hand, Precious Lord, at a rally later that night: “Play it real pretty.” Then came the shot. King was hurled back violently, blood gushed from his jaw and neck as his spinal cord was severed. His tie was ripped off by the force of the bullet. Jackson heard police shout, “Get low! Get low!”, and pour into the scene with guns drawn. He adds: “We were traumatised to see him lying there soaked in blood, 39 years old. He’d done so much to make America better, built bridges, sacrificed his livelihood, sacrificed his life. I remember Ralph Abernathy coming out and saying, ‘Get back my friend, my friend, don’t leave us now,’ but Dr King was dead on impact.” Jackson walked to his room and called King’s wife, Coretta. “I said to her I think he’s been shot in the shoulder. I couldn’t say what I saw. She had a certain resolve, a certain understanding of the danger of the mission. She’d seen him stabbed, she’d heard the threats. She knew the price you paid for trying to make America better. She had made peace with the fact he could be killed, they both of them could be killed, the house could be bombed. She’d made peace with it over a 13-year period.” King was taken to hospital but never regained consciousness and was pronounced dead about an hour after being shot. It was a seismic shock. “In many ways it redefined America: before and after Martin Luther King,” Jackson says, claiming: “When he was killed, the FBI in Atlanta jumped on the tables in jubilation.” But the news also unleashed fury across the country. Riots broke out in more than a hundred cities, leaving 39 people dead, more than 2,600 injured and 21,000 arrested, with damage estimated at $65m. The civil rights movement was at a crossroads. Some African American leaders called for greater militancy; others vowed to adhere to King’s nonviolent confrontation and disruptive resistance. Jackson reflects: “We had to make a big decision: allow one bullet to kill a whole movement for which we worked and forfeit the game, or fight even harder, and we did that. In his name we kept fighting. We’ve never stopped, as a matter of fact. He laid the groundwork. The coalition started rebuilding on the ground laid by his philosophy.” There were many strides forward – school integration, affirmative action – and bitter reversals – school resegregation, voter suppression, a shift from spending on poverty to mass incarceration – along the way. He draws a biblical comparison: “Barack won the election in 2008. That’s 40 years after ’68, which means that it was 40 years in the wilderness. We never stopped working, never stopped raising issues, never stopped fighting poverty, never stopped fighting the war. And then, with the momentum of 40 years, we take the White House, win it twice in a row. That an African American man can win in this hostile nation toward black aspiration is significant all by itself, it seems to me.” And yet then, as if in malign mockery of King’s now overly quoted phrase, “the arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice”, came Trump, who rose to political prominence by questioning whether Obama was born in America and has used the presidency to stoke racial divisions. The author and journalist Ta-Nehisi Coates has called the 45th president a white supremacist. Would Jackson use the same description? “Self-declared. It’s not exactly a secret. Trump’s cabinet makeup, the decision makers: there is white male supremacy ideology. The dangerous part of the white supremacy is in a global world we need the desire and the vision to compete and communicate with the world. We’re surrendering world leadership. There’s no leadership on climate change, on African development. We share 2,000 miles of border with Mexico and they’re a trading partner; to offend Mexico is irrational; to offend Canada likewise. “Dr King believed in multiracial, multicultural coalitions of conscience, not ethnic nationalism. He felt nationalism – whether black, white or brown – was narrowly conceived, given our global challenges. So having a multiracial setting said much about his vision of America and the world, what America should stand for as well as the world.” It is this internationalist, outward-looking perspective that nourishes Jackson as he looks back on achievements of the past half-century that his mentor would surely have applauded. He points to the restoration of Haiti’s exiled president, Jean-Bertrand Aristide, the release of Nelson Mandela and end of apartheid in South Africa, the liberation of Africa from colonialism and occupation and, back home, the rising number of African Americans in Congress and other political offices. “The moral arc of the universe is long and it bends towards justice but you have to pull it to bend; it doesn’t bend automatically,” Jackson muses. “Dr King used to remind us that every time the movement has a tailwind and goes forward, there are headwinds. Those who oppose change in some sense were re-energised by the Trump demagoguery. Dr King would have been disappointed by his victory but he would have been prepared for it psychologically. He would have said, ‘We must not surrender our spirits. We must use this not to surrender but fortify our faith and fight back.’”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/mar/20/labor-signals-it-will-cushion-pensioners","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-20T04:56:29Z","webTitle":"Labor hints at concessions to shield pensioners from tax policy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/mar/20/labor-signals-it-will-cushion-pensioners","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/mar/20/labor-signals-it-will-cushion-pensioners","fields":{"headline":"Labor hints at concessions to shield pensioners from tax policy","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Labor is signalling it will cushion pensioners from the impact of its policy to end cash rebates for excess imputation credits, as new analysis from an independent economic thinktank blasts the Turnbull government for over-egging its political attack on the proposal. The shadow treasurer, Chris Bowen, said on Tuesday that Labor was fully committed to the policy unveiled last week but added that the opposition was “always looking at ways to help pensioners”. The policy, which abolishes franking credit cash rebates for retiree investors, affects about 200,000 pensioners and part pensioners as well as wealthier retirees with low taxable income because they are drawing tax-free income from their super funds and other assets. While Labor held the Melbourne electorate of Batman with a positive swing at the byelection last weekend, swings against the ALP were recorded in the northern suburbs of the electorate, such as Reservoir, which have a higher proportion of pensioners than other areas within the boundaries. Labor also performed better on pre-poll votes than it did on byelection day itself. While those differences are not definitive, they could suggest the policy, unveiled last Tuesday and immediately attacked by seniors’ groups and the self-managed super fund industry, shifted some votes in Batman. Labor is also facing the prospect of more byelections in marginal seats as a consequence of last year’s dual citizenship imbroglio. The high court is currently considering the eligibility of the ACT senator Katy Gallagher to sit in parliament. If the ruling goes against her, it could possibly put more seats in play. The policy delivers Labor $11.4bn over the next two financial years and $59bn over 10 years – money Labor needs to fund income tax cuts and social spending in the lead-up to an election due next year. New analysis from the Grattan Institute points out that the Turnbull government is using “deeply misleading” claims in political attack lines against the proposal. Brendan Coates and Danielle Wood from the Grattan Institute argue in an analysis published by Inside Story that some low-income retirees could be negatively affected by the proposal but the bulk of the impact will be felt by wealthier seniors. The authors argue that while 14,000 maximum-rate pensioners and 200,000 part-pensioners will be hit, the vast bulk of the revenue will come from wealthier retirees. They also take issue with some of the claims produced by the government since Labor unveiled the measure last week. “The government claims that 54% of people affected by Labor’s policy – some 610,000 individuals – have taxable incomes of less than $18,200,” Coates and Wood say. “And it says that 86% of the value of all franking credits refunded are received by those with taxable incomes of less than $87,000 a year. These claims are deeply misleading. Taxable income ignores the largest source of income for many wealthier retirees: tax-free superannuation.” The views from Grattan line up with arguments from the respected independent economist Saul Eslake who told Guardian Australia last week the government’s critique was “misleading in the same way that most of what [the treasurer] Scott Morrison said about Labor’s policy on negative gearing was misleading”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2018/mar/20/nobody-believes-rees-mogg-actually-cares-about-fish-your-best-comments-today","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-20T12:33:35Z","webTitle":"'Nobody believes Rees-Mogg actually cares about fish': your best comments today","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/mar/20/nobody-believes-rees-mogg-actually-cares-about-fish-your-best-comments-today","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/mar/20/nobody-believes-rees-mogg-actually-cares-about-fish-your-best-comments-today","fields":{"headline":"'Nobody believes Rees-Mogg actually cares about fish': your best comments today","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"We’re highlighting some of the conversations you are having around our biggest stories, including on fisheries policy, homelessness and continued fallout from reporting on Facebook and Cambridge Analytica.

May should reconsider Brexit transition concessions on fishing, says Rees-Mogg - Politics live Our politics live blog this morning focused on the Tory backbencher’s comments made during a radio interview discussing Monday’s Brexit agreement. ‘If anyone believes Rees-Mogg [cares about] fish I have some magic beans to sell you’ What is this obsession with the fish? As an industry, it’s a minuscule part of the GDP, less than 1%, it employs around 25k people. To put in perspective, the NHS has currently 80,000 vacancies to fill, more than three times the total number of people working in the fishing industry, the vast majority of this fish is exported into the EU anyway, the UK itself imports most of its preferred fish, most of the cod in your fish and chips comes from Iceland or Norway. The hypocrisy of Farage pontificating about fisheries is just enraging, this waste of space was an MEP sitting in the EU fisheries committee for years, he showed up at one meeting. And if anyone really believes that Rees-Mogg gives an actual f**k about fish I have some magic beans to sell you. Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall, a chef with no political connections has managed to change EU fishing policy with 800k signatures and an awareness campaign while Ukip, with a large number of UK MEPs and a political group in the EU parliament can’t do it, that just underlines the utter incompetence of Farage and buddies. CivisEuropeae ‘They are scrabbling around for crumbs to save some face’ [Mogg and his supporters] are now trying to spin the line that the activity of a few hundred fishing boats – not even a rounding error in UK GDP – is important and significant in the Brexit transition deal. Come off it. They know they won’t get their way now, so are scrabbling around for crumbs to save some face. As Raphael Behr said yesterday, the increasingly obvious question is: why are we doing this? The answer “because we voted for it” is simply not good enough. The consequences of Brexit are now coming into sharp focus. A hard Brexit would cost more – in money and social capital – than the country can afford. A group of people are wondering whether or not to climb a mountain. They hold a vote. A slim majority votes to go for it and they set off. After a while it becomes clear that they misjudged the task and made the wrong decision. Should the group continue or go back? TerribleLyricist If you’re homelessness minister, maybe you should know something about it Readers have been sharing their thoughts beneath an article written in response to homelessness minister Heather Wheeler, who recently said she didn’t know why the number of people living homeless in the UK was rising. ‘I was incensed by her blase approach to the problem’ Thank you for this article. I read the interview with Wheeler and felt incensed by her blase approach to the serious problem. She showed no compassion, spewed out the scripted party lines, displayed ignorance and, I thought, deliberately lied to avoid accepting responsibility for Tory party policy decisions increasing homelessness. Theresa May crowed “we plan to eradicate homelessness by 2027” during PMQs. I would be interested to see the strategy they have, if one exists, because they would need to stop the terrible benefits sanctions process to make that happen and why can’t the ‘strategy’ be implemented sooner? Izzybe ‘The government knew the consequences their decisions would have’ Every cut the governments have made since 2010 has been met with rational explanations of the hardship they would cause from charities and campaign groups. Their predictions have come true, the government knew the consequences at the time the decisions were made, they had the evidence this would happen. They really do know why. ela346 The Guardian view on data protection: informed consent needed An editorial focusing on issues around our Cambridge Analytica and Facebook reporting says that when privacy becomes a commodity to be traded, the integrity of democratic politics is at risk. Here are some of your thoughts. ‘I’m horrified that Facebook has become the main way that many people get their news’ So let’s get this right. Someone signs away their privacy, the privacy of on average 160 Facebook “friends”, and the result of two knife edge elections, just for the fun of a popular psychology quiz. I used to think I could say “no” to Facebook by not using it. I used to think that the biggest Facebook danger was running up a credit card debt because Facebook is very good at advertising goods. I used to see Facebook as an irritant, taking advertising money from more reliable news sources, making itself the main way to communicate with a growing number of people in my life. It never occurred to me that others had looked at Facebook targeted advertising and seen a political goldmine for knife edge elections. I’m horrified that Facebook has become the main way that many people get their news, and that Facebook filters that news to what they want to hear, what their Facebook “friends” want them to hear. YouHaveNoComment ‘First decade free then we IPO and you are an addict we’re pimping’ The utopian promise of the web was, in a way, encapsulated in the early meme “On the Internet nobody knows if you’re a dog.” The web’s excitement was in allowing the user to become content producer, in allowing identity to be expandable and in allowing free speech to actually be heard. There was, of course, political utopianism as well: the promise of drawing back representative democracy toward direct democracy via the “digital town hall” was also generating copy everywhere. And what of all this? Well, now we know what happens when commerce and authority collaborate to remove the threat of all this utopia by giving away the tools and platform to make web pages (just enter the information in this box and then press “share”) and setting up a gated community for all your “friends”. Their version of utopia seemed like a lot less work than writing html. What a paradise! No need for web designers and that.

But the Arcola theatre in Dalston, east London, has playfully monkeyed about with his Swiftian satire, published in 1997, which pokes fun at the human belief that we are top of the evolutionary tree. It’s spry stuff. This is by no means your typical page-to-stage adaptation that plays to an audience’s familiarity with a well-known title. At its best it is both hallucinatory and unsettling in the way it spins your perspective on the world with all the riotous glee of a chimpanzees’ tea party. Perspective is what interests Turner prize-winning artist Simon Dykes (Bryan Dick), who wakes up one morning after a night of heroic overindulgence to discover that his life has been transformed. In a spin on Kafka’s Metamorphosis, Simon finds his girlfriend, Sarah (Vivienne Smith), has turned into a chimpanzee. (Kafka’s story A Report to an Academy, about an ape behaving like a human, is clearly another influence.) But then everyone else is an ape, too, including Simon’s gallerist George (Stephen Ventura) and famed psychiatrist Dr Zack Busner, who is called on to treat what this new world views as Dykes’s delusion that humans were evolution’s most successful primates, and that he is one of them. Soon, Simon finds himself in a familiar but entirely skewed world where the orifices of the powerful are bowed down to, where Shakespeare wrote “that which we call an arse by any other name would smell as sweet”, where the Shard was built without any need for scaffolding, and where nobody bats an eyelid when a female bank worker in oestrus is mounted by many male apes on the steps of Chalk Farm tube. Climbing the greasy career pole is just as cut-throat: Busner, “the undisputed alpha shrink of the Royal Free NHS Foundation Trust”, is facing attempts to displace him. The fact that Busner is played by a woman – the excellent Ruth Lass – only points up the absurdity of all the macho posturing. Given a neat, minimalist design by Sarah Beaton, this is an evening that is easy to admire, slightly harder to love. Patrick Marmion’s script fillets 400-plus pages down to an elegant two hours, and if the joke wears thin, Oscar Pearce’s directorial debut boasts real invention and swagger, from the way that the cast are turned into bandy-legged apes to the puppet children who haunt the stage like little ghosts. If it doesn’t entirely come off, that is in part because the targets are so scatter-shot, from the contemporary art world, through the workings of the NHS to the way we view, talk about and deal with species that we consider inferior to ourselves. Despite some very fine performances including some adroit ape-like vocalisations, and the best efforts of Dick to show Simon’s inner confusion and despair, the show always seems keener on showcasing its larky cleverness than on creating real feeling. As the satire is ramped up to include a Jane Goodall-style zoologist, who is studying humans in their natural African habitat, the piece becomes more haunted by the spectre of extinction. But by then you may not give a monkey’s. At the Arcola, London, until 21 April.

Speaking as ministers considered whether to introduce more sanctions against Russia over the attack on Sergei and Yulia Skripal in Salisbury, the Labour leader suggested they should wait for evidence before imposing further measures. And in an interview with the BBC to be broadcast later on Tuesday, Corbyn again stopped short of blaming the Kremlin for the attack. “What I’m saying is the weapons were made from Russia, clearly,” he told Radio 4’s World at One. “I think Russia has to be held responsible for it, but there has to be an absolutely definitive answer to the question: where did the nerve agent come from?” Corbyn added: “All fingers point towards Russia’s involvement in this, and obviously the manufacture of the material was undertaken by the Russian state originally.” A convoy of buses and people carriers left the embassy in London at around 10am on Tuesday. The passengers included the 23 diplomats expelled by Theresa May last week. Family members, some holding pet carriers, were also seen boarding the vehicles. Embassy workers waved to the leaving diplomats and their families as the buses pulled away, a Reuters photographer at the scene said. In response to the prime minister’s action, Russia expelled 23 British diplomats on Saturday and closed the British Council in Moscow. The UK’s national security council was meeting on Tuesday to consider any further measures against Russia. In the Netherlands, staff at the Russian embassy in The Hague stood in tribute to their expelled colleagues on Tuesday. In a tweet, the Russian embassy in the Netherlands claimed the UK had been making life difficult for diplomats by delaying visa applications, even before the current dispute. The former Labour cabinet minister Andrew Adonis called on the government to expel Alexander Yakovenko, Russia’s ambassador to the UK, calling him a “cheap propaganda agent”. Corbyn’s earlier warning not to “rush ahead of the evidence” led to criticism from Conservatives and unease on his own frontbench. In his latest remarks, Corbyn repeated his call for Russia to be sent samples of the nerve agent novichok to help determine its source. “I asked the Russians be given a sample so that they can say categorically one way or the other,” he said. The Skripals remain in a stable but critical condition after being exposed to novichok more than two weeks ago. The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, has previously said Labour agreed with May that Russia was responsible for the attack. He also described the poisoning as a “state execution”. But Corbyn maintained there had to be a relationship with Russia and said he would still “do business” with President Putin if Labour came to power. “Would I do business with Putin? Sure. And I’d challenge him on human rights in Russia, challenge him on these issues and challenge him on that whole basis of that relationship,” he told the BBC. On Monday, May hit back at Putin’s dismissal of her claim that Russia was responsible for the attack. Her comments followed strong words from Boris Johnson, who accused Russia of trying to conceal “the needle of truth in a haystack of lies” about the case. Writing in the Daily Telegraph, the foreign secretary said the use of a nerve agent against the Skripals was “very deliberate”. “The obvious Russian-ness of the weapon was designed to send a signal to anyone pondering dissent amid the intensifying repression of Mr Putin’s Russia,” he wrote. “The message is clear: we will hunt you down, we will find you and we will kill you – and though we will scornfully deny our guilt, the world will know that Russia did it.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"news/2018/mar/20/facebook-data-cambridge-analytica-sandy-parakilas","type":"article","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-20T11:46:42Z","webTitle":"'Utterly horrifying': ex-Facebook insider says covert data harvesting was routine","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/mar/20/facebook-data-cambridge-analytica-sandy-parakilas","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/2018/mar/20/facebook-data-cambridge-analytica-sandy-parakilas","fields":{"headline":"'Utterly horrifying': ex-Facebook insider says covert data harvesting was routine","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Hundreds of millions of Facebook users are likely to have had their private information harvested by companies that exploited the same terms as the firm that collected data and passed it on to Cambridge Analytica, according to a new whistleblower. Sandy Parakilas, the platform operations manager at Facebook responsible for policing data breaches by third-party software developers between 2011 and 2012, told the Guardian he warned senior executives at the company that its lax approach to data protection risked a major breach. “My concerns were that all of the data that left Facebook servers to developers could not be monitored by Facebook, so we had no idea what developers were doing with the data,” he said. Parakilas said Facebook had terms of service and settings that “people didn’t read or understand” and the company did not use its enforcement mechanisms, including audits of external developers, to ensure data was not being misused. Parakilas, whose job was to investigate data breaches by developers similar to the one later suspected of Global Science Research, which harvested tens of millions of Facebook profiles and provided the data to Cambridge Analytica, said the slew of recent disclosures had left him disappointed with his superiors for not heeding his warnings. “It has been painful watching,” he said, “because I know that they could have prevented it.” Asked what kind of control Facebook had over the data given to outside developers, he replied: “Zero. Absolutely none. Once the data left Facebook servers there was not any control, and there was no insight into what was going on.” Parakilas said he “always assumed there was something of a black market” for Facebook data that had been passed to external developers. However, he said that when he told other executives the company should proactively “audit developers directly and see what’s going on with the data” he was discouraged from the approach. He said one Facebook executive advised him against looking too deeply at how the data was being used, warning him: “Do you really want to see what you’ll find?” Parakilas said he interpreted the comment to mean that “Facebook was in a stronger legal position if it didn’t know about the abuse that was happening”. He added: “They felt that it was better not to know. I found that utterly shocking and horrifying.” Parakilas first went public with his concerns about privacy at Facebook four months ago, but his direct experience policing Facebook data given to third parties throws new light on revelations over how such data was obtained by Cambridge Analytica. Facebook did not respond to a request for comment on the information supplied by Parakilas, but directed the Guardian to a November 2017 blogpost in which the company defended its data sharing practices, which it said had “significantly improved” over the last five years. “While it’s fair to criticise how we enforced our developer policies more than five years ago, it’s untrue to suggest we didn’t or don’t care about privacy,” that statement said. “The facts tell a different story.” ‘A majority of Facebook users’ Parakilas, 38, who now works as a product manager for Uber, is particularly critical of Facebook’s previous policy of allowing developers to access the personal data of friends of people who used apps on the platform, without the knowledge or express consent of those friends. That feature, called friends permission, was a boon to outside software developers who, from 2007 onwards, were given permission by Facebook to build quizzes and games – like the widely popular FarmVille – that were hosted on the platform. The apps proliferated on Facebook in the years leading up to the company’s 2012 initial public offering, an era when most users were still accessing the platform via laptops and computers rather than smartphones. Facebook took a 30% cut of payments made through apps, but in return enabled their creators to have access to Facebook user data. Parakilas does not know how many companies sought friends permission data before such access was terminated around mid-2014. However, he said he believes tens or maybe even hundreds of thousands of developers may have done so. Parakilas estimates that “a majority of Facebook users” could have had their data harvested by app developers without their knowledge. The company now has stricter protocols around the degree of access third parties have to data. Parakilas said that when he worked at Facebook it failed to take full advantage of its enforcement mechanisms, such as a clause that enables the social media giant to audit external developers who misuse its data. Legal action against rogue developers or moves to ban them from Facebook were “extremely rare”, he said, adding: “In the time I was there, I didn’t see them conduct a single audit of a developer’s systems.” Facebook announced on Monday that it had hired a digital forensics firm to conduct an audit of Cambridge Analytica. The decision comes more than two years after Facebook was made aware of the reported data breach. During the time he was at Facebook, Parakilas said the company was keen to encourage more developers to build apps for its platform and “one of the main ways to get developers interested in building apps was through offering them access to this data”. Shortly after arriving at the company’s Silicon Valley headquarters he was told that any decision to ban an app required the personal approval of the chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, although the policy was later relaxed to make it easier to deal with rogue developers. While the previous policy of giving developers access to Facebook users’ friends’ data was sanctioned in the small print in Facebook’s terms and conditions, and users could block such data sharing by changing their settings, Parakilas said he believed the policy was problematic. “It was well understood in the company that that presented a risk,” he said. “Facebook was giving data of people who had not authorised the app themselves, and was relying on terms of service and settings that people didn’t read or understand.” It was this feature that was exploited by Global Science Research, and the data provided to Cambridge Analytica in 2014. GSR was run by the Cambridge University psychologist Aleksandr Kogan, who built an app that was a personality test for Facebook users. The test automatically downloaded the data of friends of people who took the quiz, ostensibly for academic purposes. Cambridge Analytica has denied knowing the data was obtained improperly, and Kogan maintains he did nothing illegal and had a “close working relationship” with Facebook. While Kogan’s app only attracted around 270,000 users (most of whom were paid to take the quiz), the company was then able to exploit the friends permission feature to quickly amass data pertaining to more than 50 million Facebook users. “Kogan’s app was one of the very last to have access to friend permissions,” Parakilas said, adding that many other similar apps had been harvesting similar quantities of data for years for commercial purposes. Academic research from 2010, based on an analysis of 1,800 Facebooks apps, concluded that around 11% of third-party developers requested data belonging to friends of users. If those figures were extrapolated, tens of thousands of apps, if not more, were likely to have systematically culled “private and personally identifiable” data belonging to hundreds of millions of users, Parakilas said. The ease with which it was possible for anyone with relatively basic coding skills to create apps and start trawling for data was a particular concern, he added. Parakilas said he was unsure why Facebook stopped allowing developers to access friends data around mid-2014, roughly two years after he left the company. However, he said he believed one reason may have been that Facebook executives were becoming aware that some of the largest apps were acquiring enormous troves of valuable data. He recalled conversations with executives who were nervous about the commercial value of data being passed to other companies. “They were worried that the large app developers were building their own social graphs, meaning they could see all the connections between these people,” he said. “They were worried that they were going to build their own social networks.” ‘They treated it like a PR exercise’ Parakilas said he lobbied internally at Facebook for “a more rigorous approach” to enforcing data protection, but was offered little support. His warnings included a PowerPoint presentation he said he delivered to senior executives in mid-2012 “that included a map of the vulnerabilities for user data on Facebook’s platform”. “I included the protective measures that we had tried to put in place, where we were exposed, and the kinds of bad actors who might do malicious things with the data,” he said. “On the list of bad actors I included foreign state actors and data brokers.” Frustrated at the lack of action, Parakilas left Facebook in late 2012. “I didn’t feel that the company treated my concerns seriously. I didn’t speak out publicly for years out of self-interest, to be frank.” That changed, Parakilas said, when he heard the congressional testimony given by Facebook lawyers to Senate and House investigators in late 2017 about Russia’s attempt to sway the presidential election. “They treated it like a PR exercise,” he said. “They seemed to be entirely focused on limiting their liability and exposure rather than helping the country address a national security issue.” It was at that point that Parakilas decided to go public with his concerns, writing an opinion article in the New York Times that said Facebook could not be trusted to regulate itself. Since then, Parakilas has become an adviser to the Center for Humane Technology, which is run by Tristan Harris, a former Google employee turned whistleblower on the industry.

Other executives from Cambridge Analytica joined him in speaking to undercover reporters from Channel 4 News about the dark arts used to help clients, including fake bribery stings and hiring prostitutes to seduce rivals. “Send some girls around to the candidate’s house, we have lots of history of things,” Nix said. “We could bring some Ukrainians in on holiday with us, you know what I’m saying.” Cambridge Analytica used a shifting network of names and front groups to remain secret, Nix said. “We’re used to operating through different vehicles, in the shadows, and I look forward to building a very long-term and secretive relationship with you,” Nix said in an initial phone call. Theresa May’s spokesman said she backed an investigation by the information commissioner, Elizabeth Denham, who told Channel 4 News she had issued a demand for access to Cambridge Analytica and would be applying to the courts on Tuesday for a warrant. More than 48 hours since the Observer revealed the harvesting of 50 million users’ personal data, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has remained silent. The company’s value shrank by $36bn on Monday, and it faces multiple investigations and a #DeleteFacebook social media campaign. Need a quick catch-up as we enter day three? Here’s a brief video explainer. * * * Lost in transition – Well, the good news is that plenty of the Brexit transition uncertainty is over. The bad news is that Theresa May has given up a fistful of her demands in order to get it. The FTSE suffered but the pound reacted well to the news, which included a timeline for single market and customs union membership, but the political backlash duly followed. The potentially most painful climbdown was agreeing to the “back stop” plan of keeping Northern Ireland under EU law to avoid a hard border. The UK also rolled over on the treatment of EU citizens during the transition and the renegotiation of fishing quotas. Jacob Rees-Mogg said it was “hard to see what points the government has won” and plans to lead a protest of Brexit-supporting MPs on Wednesday, who will throw fish out of a boat as they pass by parliament. Dan Roberts and Alan Travis write that David Davis can claim a partial, if pyrrhic, victory but there are five problems with it. * * * Closing scene – The Weinstein Company, battered by the sexual abuse scandal of former chairman Harvey Weinstein, says it has filed for bankruptcy and will now release its staff from non-disclosure agreements. The step had long been sought by the New York attorney general, Eric Schneiderman, who filed a lawsuit against the company last month on behalf of its employees. Schneiderman called the move “a watershed moment”. * * * Self-driving fatality – A woman has died after being hit by a self-driving Uber car in the first such recorded case in the US. Elaine Herzberg was pushing her bike along a road when the Volvo SUV travelling at about 40mph hit her without slowing down. The incident happened in Arizona, whose governor, Doug Ducey, is a strong supporter of the technology being tested in his state, criticising other governments for “over regulation”. * * * Cure in sight – The most common cause of blindness could be treated within years after a stem cell therapy worked successfully on two patients. Both had advanced wet age-related macular degeneration, which destroys the central vision, but were able to read a book after a “patch” of stem cells was placed over damage at the back of the eye. The hope is that an off-the-shelf treatment will be available for NHS surgeons within five years. * * * Sex and her city? – The stage is set for an actor best known for her role in Sex and the City to run for governor of New York. Cynthia Nixon, aka Miranda Hobbes, posted a campaign video that focused on inequality and the need for education reform. Nixon will face a tough battle against Andrew Cuomo, who is running for his third term but if she’s successful she would become both the city’s first female and first openly gay governor. * * * Lunchtime read: Does testosterone really make you mean? It is often wheeled out as an excuse for patriarchal society: women, with their lower testosterone levels, have evolved to nurture and multitask in the domestic sphere, while men are hardwired to take risks, compete and furnish as many women as possible with sperm, thus ensuring the future of the species. But does this trashing of testosterone stand up to lived experience? A good person to ask is Charles Ryan, who runs a San Francisco clinic and regularly relieves men of their testosterone as part of a treatment for prostate cancer. Sport Vince Hilaire speaks to Dominic Fifield about his autobiography in which he describes the primitive environment he had to contend with while playing for Crystal Palace and Portsmouth in the 70s and 80s. “I remember running out at Palace and that first song they sung about me: ‘We’ve got a brown boy on the wing, tra-la-la, la-la’ to the Boney M tune,” he says, taking it as a compliment at the time. Barney Ronay has admitted he was wrong on Mohamed Salah, with Liverpool’s £35m forward one of the best buys in years after his false start at Chelsea. The halo could be the most effective method yet devised to reduce F1’s appeal, argues Richard Williams, warning against changes that alter the point of the sport. While Ireland captured international attention for completing the grand slam at Six Nations, other events showed that all is not well within the game of rugby union. Finally, Stuart Broad believes his England Test career is set for another trademark surge of wickets after a back-to-basics spell of self-tuition. Business Asian shares sank following an overnight decline on Wall Street after Facebook reported its worst loss in four years. Investors are awaiting the first Federal Reserve meeting under the new chairman, Jerome Powell, and anticipating the first rate increase of the year. The pound is buying $1.402 and €1.136. The papers It is a day of Cambridge Analytica, Brexit, cures and car crashes. The Guardian splashes on fresh revelations about the data firm, with news its executives have been “caught boasting of dirty tricks to swing elections”. The Times also leads on the burgeoning scandal, its front page headline reads “British firm sends ‘girls’ to entrap politicians.” It also carries the Uber self-driving car fatality. The FT nudges aside Facebook’s woes and Brexit to make way for the self-driving Uber that killed a pedestrian in Arizona. The Daily Telegraph leads on the fishing quota row sparked by Theresa May’s Brexit transition deal, while also making space for the Uber crash. The i and Metro also lead on the big day for Brexit. The Sun and Mirror cover day two of Ant McPartlin’s car crash. The Daily Mail and Daily Express meanwhile lead on the potential discovery of a cure for the most common cause of blindness.

I write to ask you to disclose to the Australian public the correspondence between you and your advisers and the former governor-general of Australia, Sir John Kerr, in relation to Sir John’s dismissal of the Whitlam government on 11 November 1975 (Australian Archives record AA1984/609). Aware that in 1991 you brought forward the disclosure date from 2037 to 2027, I request that you do it again and order immediate release. On 16 March 2018 a federal court judge ruled that the papers are not the property of the commonwealth of Australia, they are private property. Sir John died in 1991. His beneficiaries and executors have relatively modest and attenuated standing in this matter. Practically, it is your decision to make. Please consider the following factors. More than 40 years on, the history of the dismissal cannot be written adequately, nor can its lessons for Australia’s constitutional law and conventions be fully absorbed and discussed, until those papers are released. In this matter, disclosure would be an aid to looking forward as much as looking back, perhaps more so. The Australian principals – John Kerr, Gough Whitlam, Malcolm Fraser – are gone. They can neither suffer criticism nor claim vindication in consequence of disclosure of the papers now. But many participants in the event, and millions touched by it, are still with us. With knowledge of what the papers contain some participants may have more to contribute, with benefits both to accurate history-writing and to the continuing discussion of constitutional themes. Less abstract, but no less sincere, is the likely beneficial impact of disclosure on some surviving participants. The dismissal marked indelibly some lives that are in their final third, shall we say. I glimpsed its effects on some when, in 2013-14, I was helping to gather and edit their contributions to planned coverage by Guardian Australia of Whitlam’s life and career. Not knowing, decades after, important elements of an event of such personal consequence is an injustice to them that you can remedy. In this matter, the “right to know” is both general and personal. Passions have cooled, so factors that you and your advisers in the past may have counted against disclosure no longer apply. Australian law seems unable to resolve this matter. I have been professionally acquainted for many years with Australian laws which, putting it broadly, regulate openness and discretion: freedom of information, archives, privacy etc. I am not surprised by the judge’s decision and do not refer to it in a letter to you in order to contest it. I raise it because of its wider implications. What are the Australian people to make of a legal system that seems unable to yield up to an incontestably well-credentialed academic some old papers of enormous significance to the nation’s history? How should Australians feel when their legal system implicitly tells them that they must again look far abroad for an authoritative ruling on a matter of such consequence? These are testing times for the democracies. By this act of disclosure, you can nourish Australia’s. The federal court judgment contains details that I trust you can accept will seem odd to contemporary Australians. In exchanges involving, variously, Sir John, your advisers, then prime minister Malcolm Fraser, and senior Australian officials, a reader looks in vain for serious consideration of the public’s interest in disclosure. The unexamined assumption in most exchanges is of secrecy, of whether the duration of withholding will be very, very, very long, or just very, very long. I understand that this was orthodox thinking for those times, but ought it not stop now? You will recall the rancour that the dismissal aroused, tainted as it was by unconventional stealth. (In politics, a degree of stealth is trite; this was different.) Some parts of the judgment give a sense that Sir John had something to be ashamed of in his communications with the palace. Disclosure would clear that up at last, and allow Australians to consider in a better informed way the events of 1975 when considering their constitutional arrangements in future. Not all the papers are significant. Some are newspaper clippings, which, we learn from the judgment, Sir John’s helper gamely wrestled into photocopiable form at night when the office was quiet, in order that Sir John may have a copy of his correspondence with the palace. Even if you are not persuaded to disclose letters yet, perhaps those parts of the bundle consisting of material that was public at the time or has been made public since could be released. It would be of value to know which parts of the public commentary of those days Sir John wanted you and your advisers to read. Partial disclosure carries risk though. As the Economist long ago noted, when all the doors are closed the smallest chink of light seems very revealing, but it usually distorts more than it illuminates. Some of the contents seem to relate to your son and heir Charles. He was young then, and perhaps he communicated with Sir John or with advisers in ways that would discomfort him now. Three thoughts on that, offered with all due respect for you: youthful misjudgment is forgivable; his discomfort does not outweigh the public interest in favour of disclosure to Australians; and any discomfort is better felt now than when he is king. Over your long reign many Australians have come to respect you, regardless of how they feel about the dismissal or Australia’s constitutional arrangements. I believe a decision to disclose these papers, made not in future by one of your successors but by you now, would enhance that respect. Yours sincerely. • Paul Chadwick is the Guardian’s global readers’ editor"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"film/2018/mar/20/weinstein-company-bankruptcy-releases-employees-ndas","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-20T04:17:37Z","webTitle":"Weinstein Company files for bankruptcy and frees staff from secrecy orders","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/mar/20/weinstein-company-bankruptcy-releases-employees-ndas","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/mar/20/weinstein-company-bankruptcy-releases-employees-ndas","fields":{"headline":"Weinstein Company files for bankruptcy and frees staff from secrecy orders","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"US film and TV studio The Weinstein Company, whose ex-chairman Harvey Weinstein has been accused of sexual harassment and assault, said on Monday it has filed for bankruptcy with an offer from an affiliate of private equity firm Lantern Capital Partners to acquire its assets. Crucially, the company also said it was releasing all employees from non-disclosure agreements. “Today, the Company also takes an important step toward justice for any victims who have been silenced by Harvey Weinstein,” read the statement. “Since October, it has been reported that Harvey Weinstein used non-disclosure agreements as a secret weapon to silence his accusers. Effective immediately, those ‘agreements’ end. “No one should be afraid to speak out or coerced to stay quiet. The Company thanks the courageous individuals who have already come forward. Your voices have inspired a movement for change across the country and around the world.” The step had long been sought by New York attorney general Eric Schneiderman, who filed a lawsuit against the company last month on behalf of its employees. Schneiderman called the move “a watershed moment”. The Weinstein Company, which has about 100 employees, filed for bankruptcy, listing $500m to $1bn in liabilities and $500m to $1bn in assets. The studio’s bankruptcy comes after it spent months looking for a buyer or investor. The company inked a deal with an investor group led by former Obama administration official Maria Contreras-Sweet, but the group terminated its offer earlier this month after seeing that the company had more liabilities than previously disclosed. Weinstein Co said in a statement it entered into a “stalking horse” agreement with a Lantern Capital affiliate, that would purchase substantially all of the assets of the company. The offer from Lantern will set the floor for higher and better bidders in a court-supervised auction. Lions Gate Entertainment Corp had made an earlier offer for some of the company’s assets, as had Qatar-owned film company Miramax, which was founded by Harvey Weinstein and his brother Bob Weinstein. Both could be among potential bidders in the auction. More than 70 women accused the company’s co-founder, Harvey Weinstein, who was one of Hollywood’s most influential men, of sexual misconduct, including rape. Weinstein has denied having non-consensual sex with anyone. Movie producer Killer Content also said bankruptcy would be the best option for the company, and that it may be interested in the studio’s assets in a bankruptcy auction. Launched in October 2005, the studio produced and distributed critically acclaimed hits including The King’s Speech and Silver Linings Playbook, as well as TV series such as long-running fashion reality competition Project Runway.

Tactical kicking was taboo when Cheika coached the Waratahs and he has kept kicking to a minimum while in charge of the Wallabies. Maybe it was Cheika’s background playing running rugby at Randwick; maybe it was the influence of rugby league or perhaps it was playing to the Sydney crowd, who have a strong distaste for kicking. Whatever the reason, Cheika has always strongly emphasised playing with the ball in hand, which was part of his team’s identity, as he likes to put it. Ironically, however, Cheika’s old team the Waratahs showed that tactical kicking does indeed have a place in Australian rugby, in their remarkable 51-27 win against the Melbourne Rebels in equatorial conditions in Sydney last Sunday afternoon. Waratahs playmakers Bernard Foley and Kurtley Beale employed cross kicks and high balls to tall outside backs such as Israel Folau and Taqele Naiyaravoro with devastating results. The most surprising aspect of the Waratahs’ aerial assault against the Rebels was that it took them so long to adopt the tactic. Much was made of Folau’s shift from fullback to the right wing for the Rebels game, but Folau had played on the wing in the back end of all of the Waratahs’ previous three games this season to accommodate Bryce Hegarty coming off the bench to play fullback. In these games against the Stormers, Sharks and Jaguares the Waratahs may have sent the odd cross-kick Folau’s way, but nothing like the concerted approach against the Rebels with both Foley and Beale booting the ball with purpose. Neither Foley nor Beale are noted tactical kickers, but together they got the job done. It is something Cheika and Wallabies attack coach Stephen Larkham will need to consider when they devise Australia’s tactics for the Irish series in June. Under the new ruck laws which favour the attacking team by reducing the contest for possession at the breakdown, teams are able to hold onto possession for longer periods of time. If you can control possession, you can control the game. No team in world rugby has adapted to the new laws better than Ireland, who ground Eddie Jones’ England into the Twickenham turf last Saturday on their way to completing the European Grand Slam. As a result of the new ruck laws, teams are committing fewer players to the breakdown and fanning out to create brick walls in defence in phase play. Ireland five-eighth Jonathan Sexton’s tactical kicking was crucial to the Irish Grand Slam because it disrupted the defensive line. Similarly, the Wallabies will need Foley and Beale to employ an attacking kicking game, a tactic that has not been wholeheartedly embraced in Australian rugby since Will Genia and Quade Cooper directed the Queensland Reds to the Super Rugby title in 2011. Kicking the ball a lot may go against the grain of running playmakers such as Foley and Beale, but attacking kicking, or contestable kicking, is designed to regain possession to re-launch attack with the ball in hand. And unlike the Waratahs, Cheika would not need to move Folau from his preferred position at fullback to the wing to adopt this tactic. It worked for the Waratahs against the Rebels, but in previous games Folau became almost invisible after being shifted to the wing. In the Waratahs’ 24-all draw with the Sharks in Durban, Folau touched the ball 15 times at fullback in the first 51 minutes of the game and only once on the wing in the last 29 minutes, highlighting the fact he can be taken out of the game on the wing. The last thing Cheika would want to do is shut out the Wallabies’ most potent attacking weapon. With the Wallabies, Folau would be better suited at fullback. There he has a multitude of sources from which to attack and interchange with the right winger for cross-kicks and the like. Where Folau plays is less important than Cheika recognising that a once forbidden tactic could hold the key to unlocking the defence, and help the Wallabies do what he most wants them to do – attack."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/mar/20/patience-wears-thin-for-tathra-residents-as-they-wait-to-return-to-bushfire-ravaged-town","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-20T05:59:33Z","webTitle":"Patience wears thin for Tathra residents as they wait to return to bushfire-ravaged town","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/mar/20/patience-wears-thin-for-tathra-residents-as-they-wait-to-return-to-bushfire-ravaged-town","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/mar/20/patience-wears-thin-for-tathra-residents-as-they-wait-to-return-to-bushfire-ravaged-town","fields":{"headline":"Patience wears thin for Tathra residents as they wait to return to bushfire-ravaged town","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Evacuated residents from the New South Wales beach town of Tathra have spoken of the chaos and confusion caused by a lack of official warnings and substandard communications infrastructure, as authorities prepare to allow a staggered return to the bushfire-ravaged seaside village. The Bega showgrounds, about 20 minutes inland from Tathra, continued to act as the nerve centre for hundreds of people displaced by Sunday’s fire. Those gathered in the packed-out hall were still hanging out for scraps of information from the regular briefings from the Rural Fire Service. On Tuesday, authorities apologised for the conflicting advice and misinformation being given to residents by the various organisations involved in the recovery operation. Locals remained stoic and relatively upbeat when Guardian Australia visited the centre on Tuesday. Most were anxious to get back to their homes, and patience was visibly fraying for some. The failure of warning systems and communications infrastructure remained the chief concern of those gathered in Bega. Questions remained about the suitability of phone-based warning systems for areas such as Tathra, where reception is notoriously bad. When the power went out at lunchtime on Sunday, about three hours before the fire front hit, it left little avenue for warnings to be communicated. The dearth of information left many confused and oblivious to the intensity of what was approaching. Tathra resident Neroli Dickson was first alerted to trouble by her teenage son, who came home to tell her there was heavy smoke outside. “And I actually said ‘No if there was an emergency people would be communicating with us. You need to stay calm’,” she said. “And he said come out on the street. I went out and, I hate to admit it, but my 15-year-old might be across it.” Two more residents, Ian Alker and Gary Newton, said they got next to no official warning of the approaching fire. Both received texts from the emergency warning system, but they came only at 3.48pm, well after the fire began to hit Tathra. “There was no reception, my wife was going ‘Where are you? Where are you?’,” Alker said. “She was down at the evacuation point. We couldn’t communicate.” Many residents gathered at the surf club, the most obvious assembly point in the town. But they said there was no one there from the Rural Fire Service to give them further directions. They had no idea if the two roads out of the town were safe. “We just needed a tower so we could communicate,” Dickson said. “That’s all they could have done better I reckon, and that’s an infrastructure issue.” Busloads of residents were taken on grim tours back through the town on Tuesday, although they were not able to get out and into their homes. Authorities were working frantically to facilitate a staged return of residents to parts of Tathra. The town had been divided into zones, and residents were scheduled to be returned once each was deemed safe by the council and emergency services. Residents could be returned as early as Tuesday evening, although officials were reluctant to give any guarantee on the timing, saying the environment was still fluid. Crews were hoping to have the fire, which spread across more than 1,200 hectares, contained by Tuesday afternoon. About 500 people affected by the disaster signed up to Red Cross’s Register.Find.Reunite service on Monday. There were earlier concerns about airborne asbestos, and some properties remained cordoned off while testing was conducted. Authorities were handing out asbestos information sheets to residents at the evacuation centre. Residents were less critical of a perceived lack of hazard reduction work in the lead-up to the fire. News Corp quoted residents critical of the lack of hazard reduction burning in recent years, particularly in national parks around Tathra. But Michael Hergenhan, a Tathra resident, said there had been large-scale burn-offs in recent years. “I remember a big one maybe two years ago, because it smouldered for about four-five days,” he said. Several other residents spoke of seeing recent hazard reduction work around Tathra. Fewer still were concerned about reports the Rural Fire Service had twice rejected the offer of an urban firefighting pumper to help battle a fire in rugged terrain near Tathra. The RFS issued a statement saying the vehicle would not have been able to access the relevant area. “The local NSW RFS duty officer who received the offer of assistance, based on the information they had on the location and terrain, identified that the vehicle would not be able to gain access to the area,” a spokesman said. “As an urban structure firefighting vehicle, the pumper is not suitable for firefighting areas off established roads, and does not have the correct safety equipment to be working in a remote bushland area.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/mar/20/allowing-shorts-at-a-catholic-girls-school-is-sensible-and-without-hidden-intent","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-20T03:47:11Z","webTitle":"Allowing shorts at a Catholic girls' school is sensible and without hidden intent | Rebecca Dargie","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/20/allowing-shorts-at-a-catholic-girls-school-is-sensible-and-without-hidden-intent","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/20/allowing-shorts-at-a-catholic-girls-school-is-sensible-and-without-hidden-intent","fields":{"headline":"Allowing shorts at a Catholic girls' school is sensible and without hidden intent","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Demands for the resignation of a school principal by a conservative section of its parent community have been gleefully reported by the defenders of education in the rightwing press. The spat at Santa Sabina, a Catholic girls’ school in the Sydney suburb of Strathfield, came to light after the launch of a new uniform which included the option of knee-length shorts or trousers, along with the usual school dress or skirt. The school’s principal, Dr Maree Herrett, while praising the uniform’s comfort and practicality, told the Sydney Morning Herald that the broader scope offered students a variety of ways to “express femininity or masculinity” (the school’s junior campus includes boys until year four). Herrett also suggested that girls who are thinking about gender might appreciate the choice. Keeping their finger on the pulse of schoolyard sartorial elegance, the vigilant Ross Cameron and Rowan Dean, on their Sunday morning Sky News programme, predictably seized upon Herrett’s comments as an example of political correctness gone mad. Seeking further evidence of radicalism, they trawled her Twitter feed to find a recommendation of a book, Gender Reckonings, a social science text examining, among other themes, gender relations, gender fluidity, and equality. As an academic and leader of a girls’ school, it’s hardly surprising that Herrett might find the dynamics of gender equality and expression worth a read, but the discussion whipped a conservative section of parents at the school into a frenzy and led to calls for the board to dismiss her. At a weekend meeting, they expressed their fears that the principal was “trying to brainwash” their daughters. It would be wonderful to think that the recommendation of an academic text by a school principal could have such an impact on her charges, but I haven’t met too many teenage girls likely to storm the sociology section at Dymocks based on the advice of an educator, no matter how respected she might be. Catholic schools, along with other faith-based institutions, are heavily criticised in many quarters, and some question their relevance and value. For the first time in its 125-year history Santa Sabina, a Dominican school, is giving its girls the chance to wear shorts in summer. It’s a simple and sensible change, without hidden intent. Quite separately, the fact that the head of a traditional girls’ school might support a progressive, pragmatic, and inclusive agenda is something to celebrate and emulate. What more could we hope for young women than the chance to examine social structures intellectually? Within a demanding academic curriculum, and brilliant music and sports programmes, these students are learning that their place in the world is valid and not defined by gender. This may be a radical concept for ultra-conservative parents and commentators, but for most, it’s the only way forward. Miranda Devine, surely a proponent of freedom of expression, used her column on Sunday to advocate the parents’ fears about Herrett and the “genderless school uniform”. She quoted a father’s letter to the school board, asking: “Must we remind you that teaching children about gender fluidity is against our religion, against evolution and against the teachings of Christ.” Gender fluidity is of course not taught at Santa Sabina, any more than darning or ironing. And I don’t know what “teachings of Christ” the letter-writer has read, but if they include evolution, the Catholic church has come a very long way, and girls wearing shorts is just the beginning. • Rebecca Dargie is a parent of girls at Santa Sabina College"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/mar/20/pauline-hansons-one-nation-declares-30000-for-use-of-james-ashbys-plane","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-20T01:18:30Z","webTitle":"Pauline Hanson's One Nation declares $30,000 for use of James Ashby's plane","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/mar/20/pauline-hansons-one-nation-declares-30000-for-use-of-james-ashbys-plane","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/mar/20/pauline-hansons-one-nation-declares-30000-for-use-of-james-ashbys-plane","fields":{"headline":"Pauline Hanson's One Nation declares $30,000 for use of James Ashby's plane","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Pauline Hanson’s One Nation has belatedly declared $30,375 for the use of James Ashby’s plane and a $57,720 donation from a Victorian property developer. In an amendment to the party’s 2015-16 financial disclosures lodged on 15 March, the party declares 243 hours flying time in the Jabiru single-engine aircraft at $125 an hour. The plane is at the centre of an ongoing Australian Electoral Commission investigation. The party has also amended its 2014-15 declaration to declare a $57,720 donation from Vicland, which is one of property developer Bill McNee’s companies. When Hanson first used the plane while campaigning in 2015 she described it as her own but it is registered and insured in the name of her adviser, James Ashby, who claims it is his. In April 2017, on the ABC’s Four Corners program McNee denied funding the purchase of the plane, saying he had not funded the party beyond what was publicly disclosed. In response to the program, Ashby said the hours flown for party business on his aircraft had been declared in accordance with the AEC rules. In May, AEC officials told Senate estimates the provenance of the plane and whether it was properly declared was under investigation. In the hearing Hanson suggested One Nation had written to the AEC in January 2017 seeking advice about how to disclose use of the plane and had submitted logbooks “because it is so unusual for a plane to be used for electoral campaigning”. On 15 March the party submitted an updated disclosure, subtracting $38,989 from the “gifts-in-kind” category and adding $30,375 to the “total receipts” section, which includes both donations and other receipts. The amended total for gifts-in-kind is $30,375, which is described in a footnote as: “James Ashby Jabaru Single Engine Light Aircraft Through enquiry – price for dry hire rate @$125.00/hr 243 hrs @ $125.00 per hour = $30,375.00.” The price of $125 is consistent with commercial quotes for one hour of private hire of a Jabiru J160. Labor senator Murray Watt said the “belated declaration ... raises more questions than it answers” and called on Hanson to “finally come clean” about the matter. “It is still not clear who actually owns the plane – James Ashby, One Nation or Senator Hanson herself,” he said. “Where did the $100,000 come from to buy to the plane? Was it a gift from Senator Hanson’s property developer mate, Bill McNee? “Was it declared, like all political donations are meant to be?” An AEC spokesman said: “The AEC is still actively investigating disclosure matters related to the plane. “In line with standard practice, the AEC makes no comment regarding matters currently under investigation.” Under electoral laws, amendments to returns can be lodged at any time. During the trade union royal commission Bill Shorten was forced to defend $75,000 in donations belatedly declared in 2015 relating to his 2007 campaign to enter federal parliament.

New Zealander went from 'Hobbiton' to Trump's White House","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Donald Trump’s new deputy chief of staff is a New Zealander who hails from the tiny North Island town of Matamata – otherwise known as “Hobbiton”. Dubbed “New Zealand’s most successful man” by local media, Chris Liddell was a contender to be Trump’s chief economic adviser, and is a former chief financial officer of General Motors, Microsoft, and The International Paper company, the world’s largest pulp and paper company. Born in 1958 in rural Matamata, Liddell is one of five siblings. Liddell’s school-teacher father died when he was young and Liddell studied at Mount Albert Grammar and Auckland University before gaining a doctorate from Oxford University and pursuing investment banking. After chairing top New Zealand companies, Liddell was awarded New Zealand business leader of the year in 2010, and was appointed a Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit for services to business and philanthropy. Colleague Rob Drury of New Zealand company Xero told the New Zealand Herald Liddell’s appointment to the inner circle of the White House could be beneficial for New Zealand. “It’s a great opportunity and to have a New Zealander in that role is I think really good for New Zealand,” said Drury. “We’re just excited for Chris that he’s that close to power. Chris has strong Kiwi values and I think it can only be a really positive appointment for everybody.” Prime minister Jacinda Ardern told TVNZs Breakfast show Liddell was “very much a Kiwi”. “I have been asked questions on whether this means will we get our exemptions of aluminium and steel,” said Ardern. “Look, I am sure he will be mindful of the US relationship with New Zealand, but ultimately he is being employed to do a job that is much larger than just that, but who knows what it will mean for us.” Since relocating to America and gaining US citizenship Liddell worked as chief financial officer for some of America’s largest companies, and was also the executive director of transition planning for the Mitt Romney presidential campaign in 2012. In January 2017 Liddell was appointed as an assistant to Donald Trump and director of strategic initiatives, and has continued to be promoted through the ranks during Trump’s first year in office. Liddell told TVNZ’s Q&amp;A programme Trump would be a more moderate president than he had appeared on the campaign trail. “People focus on the president, as they should, because the president’s the single most important person, but the president works through these huge numbers of other people running various departments and so forth, so who he starts to surround himself, how he manages those people, will define his success,” Liddell said. “Donald Trump’s a very atypical president. He’s not a traditional Republican. He’s not a traditional Democrat. He’s a mixture of both of them. And if you want to take an optimistic view, and I’m optimistic, I think he will actually come up with some policies that both sides will be willing to look at.” Liddell is married to Republican socialite and philanthropist Renee Harbers."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/mar/20/george-pell-hearing-told-new-allegations-against-cardinal-have-been-made-to-police","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-20T02:30:33Z","webTitle":"George Pell hearing told new allegations against cardinal have been made to police","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/mar/20/george-pell-hearing-told-new-allegations-against-cardinal-have-been-made-to-police","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/mar/20/george-pell-hearing-told-new-allegations-against-cardinal-have-been-made-to-police","fields":{"headline":"George Pell hearing told new allegations against cardinal have been made to police","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The committal hearing into historical sexual offence allegations against Cardinal George Pell has heard that a new statement containing additional allegations against him has been made to police. Pell’s defence barrister, Robert Richter QC, told Melbourne magistrates court on Tuesday that a witness due to face cross-examination had on Monday night made another statement to police. The development was “problematic”, Richter said. It was unclear if the new statement would result in charges being laid, Richter told the court. However, he said that the witness’s original statement should be withdrawn. It is understood the witness’s allegations will now be dealt with in an investigation separate to the committal hearing currently taking place. Prosecutors did not dispute the case being handled in this way. Witnesses who gave evidence on Tuesday morning, including a Catholic priest, Charles Portelli, and a retired schoolmaster, John Mallinson, were asked by Richter about their memories of the layout of St Patrick’s Cathedral in Melbourne in the late 90s. They were asked about who could enter and exit corridors and rooms without a key, including the priest’s sacristy, and about how closely choir boys were supervised by staff as they entered and exited the cathedral as part of a procession for mass. At the time, Pell was archbishop of Melbourne. “There was never an opportunity for the archbishop to be alone in the priest’s sacristy?,” Richter put it to Portelli. “No,” Portelli said. Richter also put it to Portelli that any allegation of misconduct by the archbishop in the sacristy during Sunday mass would be impossible due to who had access to the room. Portelli agreed. However, Portelli told the court that other masses were held at the church throughout the year that did not fall on a Sunday and where the choir was required. In the afternoon the court heard evidence from Maxwell Potter, who was sacristan at St Patrick’s Cathedral while Pell was archbishop. Richter told Potter that there was an allegation that “a couple boys had been in the priest’s sacristy … and the then archbishop came back all by himself, walked into the sacristy and did something to those boys”. He put it to Potter that given the limited access boys had to the room and the fact that it was often locked, there was no way this allegation could be true. Potter agreed. When the committal hearing ends in just under two weeks time, magistrate Belinda Wallington will decide if there is enough evidence to order Pell to stand trial for historical sexual offence allegations. Further description of the charges cannot be given for legal reasons. Pell will not have to enter a plea unless he stands trial. Pell has attended each day dressed in a beige jacket, often sitting taking notes or with his head bowed. He has been supported throughout by his friend Katrina Lee, the executive adviser for the Catholic archdiocese of Sydney. Pell is the highest-ranking Vatican official to be charged in the Catholic church’s long-running sexual abuse scandal. He has taken leave from the Vatican in Rome to attend court. He has strenuously denied all allegations. The committal hearing continues."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2018/mar/26/country-diary-the-unexpected-effects-of-road-builders-changes-to-landscape","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-26T04:30:15Z","webTitle":"Country diary: the unexpected effects of road-builders' changes to landscape","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/mar/26/country-diary-the-unexpected-effects-of-road-builders-changes-to-landscape","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/mar/26/country-diary-the-unexpected-effects-of-road-builders-changes-to-landscape","fields":{"headline":"Country diary: the unexpected effects of road-builders' changes to landscape","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The climbing bend of an overpass, in a frigid easterly wind, early. I’ve come because of an eye-hook bird I’ve often seen hovering here. A kestrel – static in the air as if on a pole, above this corner in precisely the same place. More recently, I’ve seen a red kite showing interest too, wheeling and listing and riding the wind like its namesake. If it was a child’s kite, its line would have been tied to the barrier of this bend. I’ve seen the kestrel for years, usually at dusk, against the sunset sky like a mad little spatter of dirt on a west-facing window. Wings frantic, head down, tail splayed. Watching. Why was a bird of prey so fixedly interested in the scrubby, rising corner of a small rural overpass built of steep earth and concrete, crossing the busiest road in the county? Yes, Kestrels are the “roadside raptor”, the “motorway falcon”, famously, distinctively so. Close verge grass gives rodents less cover, traffic noise more fright – ideal hunting ground. But why this spot, so tenaciously? The overpass is new, less than a decade old. Snow from the weekend’s fall is still here, harder in the direction of the wind. I climb the barrier and down the slope beyond, the bit with its back to the roads, the bit the birds watch. Ranks of saplings planted when the overpass was built tell a chronology of a decade’s growth-race: luxuriant spruce, gaunt birch, thickety thorn. The ground is hummocky grass turned yellow by the winter. The slope is moated by a trench, then a fence. I wasn’t expecting a revelation over the barrier. Teeming voles? No. I do get an unexpected one: what this overpass has done is put a hill where there wasn’t one. Ten metres in a flat landscape gives a long view. Just the lines of fields and a big sky, but an unfamiliar take nonetheless. As I turn to go there’s a snap and a quick movement down there: two rabbits, under the fence, down a hole; enough, perhaps, to catch the eye of the bird that catches mine."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2018/mar/20/mario-vargas-llosa-mexico-journalists-press-freedom-murder","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-20T06:30:33Z","webTitle":"Mario Vargas Llosa: murder of Mexican journalists is due to press freedom","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/mar/20/mario-vargas-llosa-mexico-journalists-press-freedom-murder","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/mar/20/mario-vargas-llosa-mexico-journalists-press-freedom-murder","fields":{"headline":"Mario Vargas Llosa: murder of Mexican journalists is due to press freedom","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Nobel laureate Mario Vargas Llosa has provoked outrage in Mexico by saying that the murder of more than 100 journalists in Mexico over the past decade was due to an expansion of press freedom. “There is more press freedom in Mexico today than 20 years ago, without doubt,” he said in an interview on Monday. Twelve journalists were murdered in the country last year, putting it on a par with Syria. Reporters Without Borders ranked Mexico at 147 out of 180 countries on its 2017 World Press Freedom Index. But Vargas Llosa suggested the deaths were a sign that press freedom was improving. “The fact that more than 100 journalists were murdered is, in grand part, to be blamed on the freedom of the press today, which allows journalists to say things that were not permitted previously. Narcotics trafficking plays an absolutely central part in all of this,” he said. His comments prompted an immediate and scathing reaction from Mexican reporters. “Not a word of empathy for the victims of the murdered journalists and even less a reflection on crime organised by the powerful,” tweeted Jenaro Villamil, a reporter with the newsweekly Proceso. Vargas Llosa was also criticised for suggesting that drug traffickers are the main source of violence against Mexico’s press. Organised crime groups have targeted many journalists, but press freedom advocates say public officials often pose more problems for the media than narcotics traffickers. Politicians and public officials in Mexico have a long history of threatening, intimidating and even ordering attacks on reporters. Last year it was revealed that the country’s government had used spying software to target reporters and activists. “[He’s] thinking that the main aggressor of journalists in Mexico is organised crime and it’s not like that,” said Javier Garza, former editor of the newspaper El Siglo de Torreón. “The main aggressors of journalists are public officials: government, political parties and public security forces.” Vargas Llosa’s comments came in an interview with the online radio host Carmen Aristegui, who has herself been forced off air twice after running afoul of the authorities. It was not the first time that Vargas Llosa has made headlines with recent remarks. In a Sunday column in the Spanish newspaper El País, he blasted feminism as “the most determined enemy of literature, which seeks to decontaminate it of machismo, multiple prejudices and immoralities”. Last month, he admonished Mexicans not to commit “democratic suicide” by voting for the leftwing populist – and current frontrunner – Andrés Manuel López Obrador in the country’s 1 July presidential election. López Obrador – who has tapped a vein of deep discontent over corruption, violence and disgust with the political class – currently leads polls by double digits. But Vargas Llosa has compared him to Hugo Chávez and warned that Mexico risks the same ruin as Venezuela. López Obrador responded by calling Vargas Llosa – who mounted an unsuccessful campaign for the presidency of Peru – as “a good writer, but a bad politician”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"us-news/2018/mar/20/us-primary-elections-republican-democrat-what-to-watch","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-20T10:00:37Z","webTitle":"US primary elections: five races that could reshape the political landscape","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/mar/20/us-primary-elections-republican-democrat-what-to-watch","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/mar/20/us-primary-elections-republican-democrat-what-to-watch","fields":{"headline":"US primary elections: five races that could reshape the political landscape","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Spring is coming. This means the return of warm weather, flowers and competitive primaries. After Democrats notched wins over the winter in the special election for Alabama’s Senate seat and in Pennsylvania’s 18th congressional district, the change of the calendar means a change in the electoral landscape. Starting with Tuesday’s competitive elections in Illinois – where a Democratic incumbent may lose his seat to a progressive challenger and a battle royale is shaping up for the governor’s mansion – the season will be filled with ferocious primaries as well as a special election caused by a congressional sexual harassment scandal. These are five of the most contested races coming up in the next few months. Arizona Where: Arizona’s 8th congressional district special election Who: Republican Debbie Lesko and Democrat Hiral Tipirneri When: 24 April Why It Matters: the special election on 24 April, which was prompted after longtime incumbent Republican Trent Franks resigned when he allegedly offered a staffer $5m to carry his child, will be the first held in the Sun Belt since Trump took office. Although the seat is not likely to change hands – Donald Trump won the deep red suburban Phoenix district by 21 points in 2016 – it will serve as more evidence of the GOP’s struggles in advance of the midterm elections. West Virginia Where: West Virginia’s Republican primary For US Senate Who: mining executive Don Blankenship, congressman Evan Jenkins and state attorney general Patrick Morrisey When: 8 May Why It Matters: the Democratic incumbent Joe Manchin represents the state where Donald Trump did best in 2016 winning 68.5% of the vote. Republicans are desperate to take the seat and are currently in a three way primary that includes Evan Jenkins, a two-term congressman who is backed by Mitch McConnell, state attorney general Patrick Morrisey who backed by conservative groups like the Senate Conservatives Fund, and Don Blankenship, a former mining CEO who spent a year in jail on charges related to a 2010 mine disaster that killed 29 people. The winner in the primary will automatically become a focus of national attention as Republicans try to keep their slim majority in the Senate. Texas Where: Texas’s Democratic primary runoff for the 7th congressional district Who: attorney Lizzie Pannill Fletcher, journalist Laura Moser When: 22 May Why It Matters: the race has become a battleground in the fight between Washington Democrats and leftwing activists in a suburban Houston seat once thought to be safe Republican territory before Hillary Clinton won it in 2016. Fletcher has been embraced by groups like Emily’s List as the best chance for the party to win the seat. In contrast, Moser was the subject of an opposition research document released by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) before the first round of voting in an attempt to keep her from making the runoff. Instead, it backfired and rallied support from progressive activists to her campaign. The winner of the runoff will face incumbent the Republican John Culbertson in November. California Where: California’s non-partisan primary for US Senate Who: state senate president pro tempore Kevin de León, Senator Dianne Feinstein When: 5 June Why It Matters: Feinstein, a Democrat who was first elected in 1992, is facing a challenge from the left from the top Democrat in the state senate. California’s unique top two primary system means that both are likely to advance to a general election in November. However, the first round of voting on 5 June will make clear whether the 84-year-old Feinstein will face a significant threat from progressives who have long been dissatisfied with her. California Where: California’s non-partisan primary for the 48th congressional district Who: 15 candidates including incumbent Republican Dana Rohrabacher When: 5 June Why It Matters: Rohrabacher is a controversial figure who has long been known as the most vocal cheerleader for the Kremlin on Capitol Hill. Democrats have long seen him as vulnerable in November. However, due to the number of the Democratic candidates who are running against him, they may not get that chance. Scott Baugh, the former Republican leader in the California state assembly, entered the race late as a challenger to Rohrabacher. Due to California’s top two primary and the traditional Republican lean of the district, it’s possible that no Democrat could make the ballot in November. It’s one of several seats in California where a crowded Democratic field has left the possibility of the party being shut out in the general election."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2018/mar/19/mississippi-abortion-law","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-20T21:39:25Z","webTitle":"Judge blocks restrictive Mississippi abortion law just signed by governor","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/mar/19/mississippi-abortion-law","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/mar/19/mississippi-abortion-law","fields":{"headline":"Judge blocks restrictive Mississippi abortion law just signed by governor","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Mississippi’s governor signed the nation’s tightest abortion restrictions into law on Monday – but less than 24 hours later it was blocked by a judge. Governor Phil Bryant, a Republican, had signed HB 1510 on Monday afternoon with immediate effect, banning most abortions after 15 weeks of gestation. Bryant has frequently said he wants Mississippi to be the “safest place in America for an unborn child”. The law’s only exceptions are if a fetus has health problems making it “incompatible with life” outside the womb at full term, or if a pregnant woman’s life or a “major bodily function” is threatened by pregnancy. Pregnancies resulting from rape and incest are not exempted. But on Tuesday, a judge temporarily blocked the law after a request by the state’s only abortion clinic and a physician who works there. Dr Sacheen Carr-Ellis of the Jackson Women’s Health Organization had stated in court papers filed within a few hours of the new legislation being enacted on Monday that a woman 15 weeks or more pregnant was scheduled for a Tuesday afternoon abortion. Abortion rights advocates called the new law unconstitutional because it limits abortion before fetuses can live outside the womb. US district judge Carlton Reeves heard arguments Tuesday before granting the clinic’s immediate request for a temporary restraining order. “The supreme court says every woman has a constitutional right to ‘personal privacy’ regarding her body,” Reeves wrote in a brief decision that quoted previous legal rulings on abortion. “That right protects her choice ‘to have an abortion before viability.’ States cannot ‘prohibit any woman from making the ultimate decision’ to do so.” The owner of Mississippi’s only abortion clinic, Diane Derzis, opposes the law and had pledged to sue, duly filing suit on Monday. Derzis said after the state legislature passed the bill earlier this month, sending it to the governor, that if Bryant signed it her clinic would be forced to turn away women who seek abortions after 15 weeks and refer them out of state, where the number of clinics is also dwindling in the face of legal and legislative challenges by a resurgent conservative religious movement. Carr-Ellis said in a statement: “A woman who is pregnant should have the ability to make the decision that is best for her about the course of her pregnancy, based on her own values and goals for her life.” The woman who had been scheduled to have an abortion on Tuesday afternoon was able to go ahead with the procedure. Republican House speaker Philip Gunn said at the bill’s signing Monday: “The winners today are those babies that are in the womb, first and foremost.”The legal challenge could ultimately set up a supreme court showdown over the 45-year-old landmark Roe v Wade case that legalized abortion in the US in 1973. Mississippi, a relatively poor state, has the highest infant mortality rate and worst overall ranking in the nation for children and infant care, according to the 2018 Health of Women and Children report published earlier this month by America’s Health Rankings, which has been publishing an annual state-by-state assessment for nearly 30 years, according to Newsweek. Along with shortening the window in which a woman can seek to have an abortion, the law, also known as the Gestational Age Act, also says a person found guilty of performing an abortion after 15 weeks of gestation will face a felony conviction and up to 10 years in prison and could have their medical license suspended or revoked. Before the new law, Mississippi banned abortion after 18 weeks of gestation."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2018/mar/21/australian-governments-water-buyback-displayed-pythonesque-haggling-skills","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-20T20:29:03Z","webTitle":"‘Monty Pythonesque’: $80m water buyback was 25% more than asking price","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/mar/21/australian-governments-water-buyback-displayed-pythonesque-haggling-skills","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/mar/21/australian-governments-water-buyback-displayed-pythonesque-haggling-skills","fields":{"headline":"‘Monty Pythonesque’: $80m water buyback was 25% more than asking price","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"“Monty Pythonesque” is how the Australia Institute has described the federal government’s decision to pay $80m for a water buyback in the Condamine-Balonne river system in Queensland last year. The Guardian reported this month that the company selling the water to the commonwealth, Eastern Australian Agriculture, had immediately recorded a $52m gain on the sale of its water in July 2017. The company itself had valued the water rights much lower in its accounts. The purchase, which involved the rights to harvest overland flows, usually only available in flood conditions, was undertaken without open tender. Now the Australia Institute, the public policy thinktank, says the commonwealth paid 25% more than the seller was initially asking for. It has analysed documents produced to the Senate after a request from the Nick Xenophon Team senator Rex Patrick. They show the commonwealth paid $2,745 a megalitre for the water, whereas the company had initially been seeking $2,200. The company was initially seeking a separate payment of $16m for the commonwealth to buy the large storage located on its property to hold the water, but the sale of the storage did not go ahead. The Australia Institute says the price was not adjusted accordingly with the result that the commonwealth paid over the odds. “The department displayed Pythonesque haggling skills and paid a final price above what the vendor had first sought,” the institute said. A spokesperson for the federal agriculture department confirmed that the government did not buy the storage. “The final sell offer negotiated was a much larger parcel of water (28.7 GL) and did not include a storage,” a spokesman said. “The price paid took into account a commercial valuation and the unique characteristics of the offer in terms of its size, location, high environmental benefits and low socioeconomic impact.” The details of the valuation were redacted in the documents released. A series of water buybacks in 2017 undertaken by the former water minister Barnaby Joyce have come under intense scrutiny because they were undertaken without tender. In some cases there are doubts about the reliability of the water; in others there are questions about the sums paid by the commonwealth. Achieving water recovery for the environment in the Condamine-Balonne Valley in southern Queensland has been difficult, the Australia Institute noted. But it said this purchase of nearly 29 GL of overland flow for nearly $80m raised a number of serious issues aside from whether it was value for money. “The next problem is that even if we could store our overpriced water, an overland flow licence is legally attached to land title. If it ever flows off the property, it can be captured by adjourning properties – like Cubbie Station,” said Maryanne Slattery, the Australian Institute’s senior water researcher. “So, it is unlikely that the water can actually be used for the environment at all. Serious questions need to be asked as to why Barnaby Joyce as water minister signed off on the purchase of such expensive, unsecure water. “Water purchases like this might look good on paper but they seriously undermine the basin plan.” This was disputed by the department. “This water has clear and significant environmental benefits for the Lower Balonne, including the Culgoa and the Narran Lakes – a Ramsar-listed wetland of international importance,” a spokesman said. The department said the Narran Lakes wetlands support more than 40 migratory bird species, including ibis and spoonbills. The water would also be used to enhance the Culgoa floodplain, which is another important local environmental target. Eastern Australia Agriculture had offered to sell its water rights a few years back during competitive tendersrun by the department but these offers had been rejected. Patrick, who is from South Australia, which is at the end of the Murray-Darling system, said he intended to refer the matter to the auditor general. “Yet again, a detailed and plausible claim that the government has not achieved value for money for the taxpayer in its execution of the Murray-Darling basin plan,” he said. “The Australia Institute has compared the government’s negotiating skills when it comes to the purchasing of water to a Monty Python skit. If it wasn’t so serious, it would be funny.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/blog/live/2018/mar/19/bexit-davis-barnier-press-conference-russia-salisbury-srkipal-denials-over-spy-poisoning-growing-increasingly-absurd-says-boris-johnson-politics-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-19T17:45:30Z","webTitle":"Brexit transition deal breaks seven promises made by ministers, say campaigners – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2018/mar/19/bexit-davis-barnier-press-conference-russia-salisbury-srkipal-denials-over-spy-poisoning-growing-increasingly-absurd-says-boris-johnson-politics-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/blog/live/2018/mar/19/bexit-davis-barnier-press-conference-russia-salisbury-srkipal-denials-over-spy-poisoning-growing-increasingly-absurd-says-boris-johnson-politics-live","fields":{"headline":"Brexit transition deal breaks seven promises made by ministers, say campaigners – as it happened","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The UK has struck a deal on the terms of the Brexit transition period after making a series of concessions to Brussels and accepting a “back stop” plan of keeping Northern Ireland under EU law to avoid a hard border with the Republic of Ireland. The Kremlin has insisted the UK must prove Russia’s role in the poisoning of a former spy or apologise, as the EU called on Moscow to provide “full and complete disclosure of its novichok programme” to international experts. The Conservatives spent more than £18.5m while losing their majority at last year’s general election, against £11m of spending by Labour and £6.8m by the Liberal Democrats, newly released figures have shown. Downing Street expressed its concern for the Facebook data breach that affected tens of millions of people involving the analytics company that worked with Donald Trump’s campaign team. In an urgent question on the issue which finished a few minutes ago, Dominic Grieve, the Conservative former attorney general, was one of several MPs who called for much tougher penalties for data breaches of this kind. Grieve said: It’s been apparent for a long time that the obtaining of data, the use that can be made of it, for commercial or political purposes, is a goldmine for those who wish to breach the law and the sanctions that can be visited on those that do this are entirely inadequate. I’m perfectly aware that the government is amending the legislation, but I have to say I don’t think the laws that we are enacting in terms of the penalties on those who behave in this fashion are anything like draconian enough. The financial incentives are far too great to break the law, the penalties proportionally insufficient, and ultimately we are going to have to be much tougher if we are going to stop this sort of behaviour. Matt Hancock, the culture secretary, said he had “some sympathy” for Grieve’s argument. He also said it was “outrageous” that Facebook responded to the complaints by suspending the Facebook account of the whistleblower who exposed what had happened. Labour has confirmed that it will host its first music festival this summer. That’s all from me for today. Thanks for the comments. Nigel Farage, the former Ukip leader, says Theresa May should resign in the light of today’s Brexit transition deal. In the Commons Hilary Benn, the Labour MP who chairs the Commons Brexit committee, tabled an urgent question about customs. He asked the minister responding, Treasury minister Mel Stride, when Chris Grayling, the transport secretary, was planning to tell MPs about the plan he announced on Question Time last week to have no new checks on lorries arriving at Dover after Brexit. And how was this compatible with the government’s plan to leave the customs union, Benn asked. Stride refused to repeat the assurances Grayling gave and instead pointed out that Grayling also said on Question Time that the government was opposed to having a hard border at Dover and that the the government would not be stopping every lorry at Dover. “This, of course, is absolutely right,” Stride said (implying that other parts of what Grayling said on Question Time were less reliable.) As the Press Association reports, Downing Street has listed a number of improvements which the UK secured in today’s draft withdrawal treaty text, compared to the version put forward by the European commission last month. The list includes: Explicit agreement that the UK can sign and ratify trade deals during the transition period, to be brought into force on January 1 2021; The ability for the UK to act in international bodies in its own right during the transition period; Freedom for the UK to move to future arrangements on foreign policy and defence collaboration as soon as they are ready and not to be bound to accept or apply EU decisions it does not agree with; Creation of a joint committee to oversee the transition agreement, with a clear commitment on both sides to act in good faith; Wording to make clear that Gibraltar is included in the agreement; Safeguards to ensure that the UK is consulted on fishing quotas for 2019, with a commitment that Britain’s share of the total catch cannot change; Agreement that UK citizens will be free to live and work in the EU during the transition period and a reduction from two years to six months in the proposed “grace period” for EU citizens to apply for immigration status in the UK. Mike Hookem, the Ukip fisheries spokesman, has described today’s transition deal as a “total betrayal” of British fishermen. He said: When the EU say they will allow consultation on fishing rules, we all know that means the UK will be totally ignored. It’s bad enough at the moment while we are still part of the EU. The simple fact is, the Tories betrayed the fishing industry on the way into the EU, and totally shafted the same sector on the way on the way out. Open Britain, which is campaigning for a soft Brexit, claims that the draft EU withdrawal agreement published today (pdf) contains provisions that would centralise powers in the hands of ministers. Article 157 says the UK and the EU will set up a joint committee to resolve any disputes about the withdrawal agreement. And article 159 says the decisions of the joint committee shall be binding on both sides. In the draft both articles are coloured green, meaning they are agreed items, not items still subject to negotiation. Chris Leslie, a Labour MP and Open Britain supporter, said: In the referendum campaign we were told leaving the EU would be about ‘taking back control’ but it is more and more apparent that UK Ministers see this about being centralising power in their hands. Their EU withdrawal bill already gives them the power to rewrite laws without reference to parliament and now it appears they want to extend that power indefinitely through this draft treaty. Most ironically of all, they would be able to use this power if they secured the agreement of the EU for any law changes they proposed. They have not even discussed this idea in parliament before they have agreed it with the European commission. They need to now immediately come to parliament and tell us what they think they are playing at. The Scottish Conservative MP Douglas Ross has strongly criticising the fishing elements of the transition deal. In a statement he posted on Twitter, he said that the government had delivered “far less” than he hoped for and expected and that “it would be easier to get someone to drink a pint of cold sick than to sell this as a success”. Echoing language used by this Scottish Tory colleagues Ross Thomson, John Lamont and Ruth Davidson (see 2.08pm), he said he would not support any final deal that did not give the UK “full control” over fish stocks and vessel access. In the Commons John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, has tabled an urgent question asking what the government has done to address the problems of “dirty money” in the UK. Ben Wallace, the security minister, responded on behalf of the government by trying to blitz McDonnell with an exhaustive list of measures. He said the government had made money laundering harder; reversed the burden of proof for people suspected of getting money from organised crime; allowed assets to be confiscated from people guilty of human rights abuse; backed a Magnitsky amendment to the sanctions bill going through parliament; made it easier for criminals’ money to be taken from bank accounts; introduced powers to allow terrorists’ assets to be frozen; made failing to prevent tax evasion a criminal offence; prosecuted people under the Bribery Act; introduced fair prosecution agreements to incentivise companies to face up up to fraud allegations; put one minister in charge of economic crime; beefed up the powers of the Serious Fraud Office; held an anti-corruption summit; estabished a joint financial analysis centre in the National Crime Agency; established a register of beneficial ownership of companies; and committed to establishing a public register of overseas owners of UK property. McDonnell replied by saying that, for all this, “dirty money” was still a big problem. He said the National Crime Agency still estimates that £90bn of criminal money is laundered through the UK ever year. A more measured attack came from the Labour MP Margaret Hodge, a former chair of the public accounts committee. She told Wallace: I do acknowledge that the government has taken some steps. What I would put to the minister is that they have not taken enough steps. She said she was particularly concerned about tier 1 investor visas, which allow foreigners to come to the UK if they are investing £2m. She said Russians were one of the main users of this scheme. What does the government do to ensure this money is clean, she asked. Wallace said “not for the first time” Hodge was making a good suggestion. He said the government would be looking at this scheme to ensure it did better due diligence. (If you are interested in this topic, Ed Miliband and Geoff Lloyd’s Reasons to be Cheerful podcast had a good discussion on this last week - not least because it included a contribution from my Guardian colleague Luke Harding.) These are from Sky’s David Blevins. Sinn Fein on today’s deal The DUP on today’s deal And here is how Blevins sums it all up very crisply. Leave Means Leave, a successor to the Ukip-linked Leave.EU campaign, has criticised today’s deal. In a statement it said: While there has clearly been some commendable progress, we are very concerned over the Northern Ireland backstop proposal. This is a dreadful way of negotiating. Just weeks ago, the prime minister said ‘no UK prime minister could ever agree to this’. Once again we appear to have caved in. This is totally unnecessary and UK negotiators must insist that this is removed from the text. We also have serious concerns over the proposals for our fishing waters. Under the current plans, we will not be taking back control of our fisheries when we leave the EU – something which the government had previously promised. Mats Persson, who worked in Downing Street for David Cameron as a Europe adviser, says that, although a transition deal has been announced today, the fact that it is conditional on a final withdrawal agreement being reached in the autumn means businesses cannot be 100% sure it will happen. As a result, many will want to activate “no deal” contingency plans, he says. According to BrexitCentral’s David Scullion, the Scottish Conservative MP Ross Thomson has said the UK should set its own fishing policy during the transition. The government claims that the UK will not be part of the commons fisheries policy during the transition because it will not be in the EU. This is technically correct, although for all practical purposes the UK will remain in the CFP during that period. The European parliament has welcomed the draft withdrawal agreement. In a statement, it welcomes, among other things, the fact that “UK proposals advocating discrimination between EU citizens arrived before and after the start of the transition period have been rejected.” Steve Peers, a professor of EU law, has written a long Twitter thread on what’s new in the draft withdrawal treaty published today. It’s thorough and authoritative, and well worth reading if you take a close interest in Brexitology. This is from my colleague Dan Roberts. Open Britain, which is campaigning for a soft Brexit, says today’s transition deal contradicts seven promises made by Brexiters in government. There is a briefing here with the detail. And here is the start of a Twitter thread setting out the “broken promises”. The CBI has described the transition deal as “a victory for common sense”. In a statement its director general, Carolyn Fairbairn, said: This is what businesses have been calling for since last summer. It brings a welcome gift of time for firms on both sides. While some sectors may need more than 20 months to prepare for post-Brexit life, this is a victory for common sense that will help protect living standards, jobs and growth. It shows what can be achieved when people and prosperity are placed above politics and ideology. Adam Marshall, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, has also welcomed the deal. He said: This is a milestone that many businesses across the UK have been waiting for. The agreement of a status quo transition period is great news for trading firms on both sides of the channel, as it means that they will face little or no change in day-to-day business in the short term. While some companies would have liked to see copper-bottomed legal guarantees around the transition, the political agreement reached in Brussels is sufficient for most businesses to plan ahead with a greater degree of confidence. Many companies will now have the clarity they require to proceed with investment and hiring strategies that would otherwise have remained in question. His reference to the absence of “legal guarantees” refers to the fact that the transition deal is conditional upon there being a withdrawal agreement. As David Davis, the Brexit secretary, admitted recently, there is a possibility that the withdrawal agreement talks could collapse without a deal at the last moment. In those circumstances, there would be no transition and the UK would leave the EU abruptly at the end of March next year. Mike Cherry, national chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses, is also pleased. He said: Finalising transition period terms will gift some certainty to the UK small business community and protect it from a damaging cliff-edge moment. Wherever possible, small firms want only one set of rule changes that take effect from the end of 2020. It’s good to see an agreement which will largely mean business owners can continue to operate broadly as they do now until 31 December 2020. Today’s announcement will make it that much easier for firms to plan, grow, trade, invest and hire. Scotland’s rural economy secretary, Fergus Ewing, has lambasted the Tories after the UK government agreed to keep the common fisheries policy in place for the full two year Brexit transition period. Ewing accused Ruth Davidson, the Scottish Tory leader, and Michael Gove, the UK environment secretary, of breaking promises that the UK would immediately pull out of the CFP on the day of Brexit. Remaining in the controversial policy, which gives EU fleets a large share of UK landings, has in fact emerged as one of the UK’s main concessions to win a deal on the two year transition period after the UK leaves the EU in March 2019. Ewing said: The Tories have sold out the Scottish fishing industry once again and Ruth Davidson should be shame-faced for her fastest broken Brexit promise yet. Just last week she said ‘Britain will leave the CFP as of March 2019’. Now we know not only will the UK have to abide by CFP rules during the transition period, it will lose the voting rights it has now. The Tories have delivered the worst possible outcome for Scotland’s fishing industry. Davidson acknowledged on Monday the deal was not to her liking, describing it as an “undoubted disappointment.” She said: Having spoken to fishing leaders today, I know they are deeply frustrated with this outcome. I’ve made clear to them that I will continue to do everything in my power to ensure their interests are protected during the implementation period and beyond. The deal is uncomfortable puts both the Tories and the Scottish National party in difficult territory. The Tories won six prized SNP seats in north east Scotland, a stronghold for the British fishing industry, partly on promises of delivering Brexit. The SNP, however, still insists that an independent Scotland would rejoin the EU, and with it the CFP. Ewing’s stress on Davidson’s broken promises works only so far. Six members of staff have announced plans to resign from Labour HQ, according to sources, including some senior figures. Their decisions follow on from the departures of Iain McNicol and Emilie Oldknow, who had been tipped as a potential successor. The moves come a day ahead of an NEC meeting at which it is expected that Jennie Formby will be appointed general secretary. Sources say the figures include those who worked closely with McNicol, and they will work out their three month notice periods, covering the local elections. The Guardian understands that those leaving include: Julie Lawrence, who is the director of the general secretary’s office, John Stolliday, head of the compliance unit, Dan Simpson, who was London Labour director but has been doing mat cover as PLP secretary, Neil Fleming in London and Simon Jackson on policy and research. Yesterday a Scottish Conservative MP, John Lamont, said he would vote down any Brexit deal that did not give Britain full control of its fish stocks. Ruth Davidson, the Scottish Conservative leader, backed his stance on Twitter. The Twitter exchanges did not clarify whether Lamont and Davidson were setting conditions for after Brexit day, or after the transition. As the UK and the EU have agreed today, the UK won’t have full control of its fish stocks during the transition. Davidson has now clarified her stance in a post on Facebook. She says that she accepts that Scottish fishermen are “deeply frustrated” about the arrangements for the transition, and that, in the long term the UK must have “full control” over boats and fish stocks. I am more determined than ever to ensure that this long-term prize for our fishing industry is seized. So I should make it clear today that I will not support a deal as we leave the EU which, over the long-term, fails to deliver that full control over fish stocks and vessel access. In its guidelines for a future trade deal the EU says it wants EU fishermen to continue to have the same access to British waters after Brexit that they do now. Theresa May has accepted they should have some access, in return for British fishermen having some access to EU waters. Davidson’s call for “full control” sounds sounds firm and definitive, but it may just be semantic muscularity. There is no doubt about the UK notionally having “full control”. But, exercising that control, it then plans to grant the EU a level of access to its waters. The eventual outcome may or may not be acceptable to fisherman, but it will be compatible with the “red line” imposed by Davidson. The Scottish Fisherman’s Federation has criticised today’s Brexit transition deal. In a statement, its chief executive Bertie Armstrong said: This falls far short of an acceptable deal. We will leave the EU and leave the CFP, but hand back sovereignty over our seas a few seconds later. Our fishing communities’ fortunes will still be subject to the whim and largesse of the EU for another two years. Put simply, we do not trust them to look after us. So we issue this warning to the EU: be careful what you do or the consequences later will be severe. To our politicians we say this: some have tried to secure a better deal but our governments have let us down. Here is my colleague Daniel Boffey’s story on today’s Brexit deal. Open Britain, which is campaigning for a soft Brexit, has put out this statement from the Labour MP Chuka Umunna says today’s deal shows that Brexiters have had to “surrender on almost every single point”. Despite once claiming they held all the cards in the negotiations, in the end the Brexiters have been prepared to compromise and surrender on almost every single point. On the divorce bill, on the primacy of European law, on freedom of movement, on fisheries, the government has yet again capitulated. We should be in no doubt that this will be the shape of things to come in the negotiations over the future relationship. Umunna says that, instead of having a transition, it would make more sense to extend article 50 and remain in the EU after March 2019 pending negotiations. And Best for Britain, which is opposed to Brexit and campaigning for a second referendum, has released this statement from its CEO Eloise Todd. This exciting Brexit future is looking less and less like a global Britain heading for the sunlit uplands and more and more as though it will consist of ministers going cap in hand to Donald Trump for crumbs. Far from taking back control this deal signs us up to something that looks very similar to EU membership until 2020, yet we won’t have any say over the rules of the club in that period. Here is the full text of Michel Barnier’s statement at the start of the press conference (mostly in French - an English language version does not seem to be available yet.) And here is the full text of David Davis’s statement at the start of the press conference. Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, has welcomed the transition deal. But he says the government could have agreed it months ago. This agreement could have been signed months ago but ministers wasted time fighting among themselves, holding out on negotiating objectives that they have failed to achieve and pursuing their reckless red lines. Labour was the first to call for sensible transitional arrangements because it is the only way to protect jobs and the economy. It is welcome that they have finally struck a deal on transition and now the government must prioritise negotiating a final agreement that protects jobs, the economy and guarantees there will be no hard border in Northern Ireland. According to ITV’s Carl Dinnen, the DUP are “relaxed” about the fact that the regulatory alignment proposal (the “backstop” solution to the Irish border problem) is still in the draft withdrawal agreement. The Times’s Bruno Waterfield says the UK side are talking up five achievements from the deal. (Waterfield means bigging up, not begging up, although “begging” does have potential Freudian connotations. The UK does not want to be seen as a loser.) Nicola Sturgeon, the Scottish first minister, has said that the transition deal appears to be a “massive sellout of the Scottish fishing industry”. She was commenting on this tweet from the BBC’s Sarah Smith. Theresa May has put out this statement about today’s deal. I think the message people can take from this is that prior to December people questioned whether we would get agreement then. We did. People questioned whether we would get agreement now. We have. I think what this shows is that with good will on both sides, working hard, we can get an arrangement for the future which will be in the interests of the UK and in the interests of the European Union and it will be good for all parts of the UK. Here are the main points from the Davis/Barnier press conference. Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, and David Davis, the Brexit secretary, have reached a deal on a transition agreement. The news has been welcomed in the City, where sterling has hit a one-month high against the dollar. (See 12.15pm.) The UK has compromised on some of the EU’s key demands for the transition. It will end on 31 December 2020 (the EU’s preferred date), not around March 2021 (the UK’s preferred date). And EU nationals arriving in the UK during the transition will get the same rights as EU nationals here before. Theresa May originally said she would resist this. The UK has accepted that EU fishermen will still get the same access to UK waters during the transition as they do now. The UK’s share of fishing quotas will remain the same. But it will only have the right to be consulted about any changes to the total catch; it will not have a veto. The UK will have the right to negotiate its own trade deals during the transition, the EU has confirmed. But it will not be able to implement those deals until after the transition is over. The UK and the EU have published a new version of the draft withdrawal treaty (pdf). It is colour-coded, showing where the two sides have reached agreement (in green), where they are halfway towards an agreement (in yellow) and where matters are unresolved (in white). The EU has retained the provisions in the draft treaty proposing regulatory alignment between Northern Ireland and Ireland as a “backstop” solution to the border issue, even though Theresa May described this wording as unacceptable. Both sides are committed to a solution, but today’s document shows that they are not closer to deciding what this could be. The EU has retained a version of the proposed “punishment clause” that could be used to penalise the UK during the transition if it were seen to break single market rules. (See 12.10pm.) The UK has not accepted this. When an earlier version of the proposal was first floated, Davis accused the EU of acting in bad faith. Q: What is the difference between signing a trade deal during the transition, and signing one afterwards? And, if you can sign one during the transition, won’t that be one of the fastest in history? And when can trade talks start? Davis says the UK wants to get on with the talks on the future partnership as soon as possible. And there will be no trade deal like it, because the start from the same place. He says an 18-month trade deal would not be the fastest in the world. Chile has done some more quickly. This will be the “biggest, the most comprehensive, the most effective trade deal ever”, he says. Barnier says, when the UK leaves the EU, it will leave 750 EU deals. There will be a lot of work for the UK to do. As for when the trade talks with the UK will start, he says the EU will need a mandate. He will be mandated to begin discussions on this, he says. They have to talk trade. But it is not just trade. There are other areas - security, legal cooperation, partnership on security and defence. And he says these will be “discussions”. He uses that word because formal negotiations cannot start until the UK has left the EU. In the meantime they will be scoping an agreement for the future commercial relationship, from about April, he says. Barnier says formal trade negotiations between EU and UK will not start until after Brexit, although discussions on “scoping” a deal will take place before. The press conference is now over. Q: Does the transition cover Gibraltar? Davis says it does. “That is our view of it.” The UK is still having discussions on this with Spain, he says. Barnier says Gibraltar will leave the EU at the same time as the UK. Q: Hasn’t the UK broken all its promises by saying a hard border in Ireland is a possibility? Davis says the UK remains steadfast in its commitment to avoiding a hard border in Ireland. He refers to Simon Coveney’s tweet earlier, in which the Irish foreign minister accepted this was a priority for the UK. (See 10.37am.) Q: [To Barnier] Unless you are willing to block the final agreement, haven’t you given way on Ireland? Barnier says he thinks it will still be possible to find a practical solution. But he repeats the point about how nothing is agreed until everything is agreed. Q: Do you accept the transition will end on 31 December 2020? Davis says December 2020 is the end date. Davis confirms Brexit transition will end on 31 December 2020. Davis says attention must now turn to the future. The prime minister has set out a powerful vision of the future for the trade relationship. His job is to deliver on it, he says. He ends by saying a good deal is closer than ever before. Davis says both the UK and the EU are committed to December’s joint report “in its entirety”. That means the legal text must include reference to the backstop solution. But Davis says the UK wants to ensure that an alternative solution to the border issue is found. The pound has just hit a one-month high against the US dollar, as City traders welcome Barnier and Davis’s statements. Sterling is now up 1%, or 1.3 cents, to $1.4080, extending its earlier gains. Davis says the offer for EU nationals living in the UK will be reciprocal. Davis says the implementation period is about providing certainty for the short-term, but also about allowing the UK to begin preparing for life outside the EU. The UK will be able to sign trade deals during this time, he says. He says a joint committee with representatives from the UK and the EU will be set up to resolve differences that arrive. There will be a commitment from both sides to work in good faith. He says safeguards have also been agreed for annual fishing negotiations. They will only apply for 2019. For 2020, the UK will negotiate fishing as an independent state. For 2019, the UK will be consulted about fishing quotas. And its share of total catch cannot be changed, he says. On foreign policy, he says the UK could choose not to apply EU foreign policy decisions during the transition. David Davis, the Brexit secretary, is speaking now. He says today marks a significant step in the Brexit process. He says both sides have worked hard to agree a time-limited implementation period. The Telegraph’s Anna Isaac points out that the so-called transition “punishment clause” is still part of the text. Barnier is now winding up. He says the elements of this deal, including the transition, will only take effect if the final withdrawal agreement is agreed. Barnier turns to the governance of the withdrawal agreement. The governance arrangements affecting the rights of EU nationals have been settled, he says. But other governance arrangements are yet to be finalised. On Ireland, he says a note has been published today showing how this issue will be dealt with. It says both sides are committed to the joint report published in December, “in all its aspects”. It has been agreed that the backstop solution (regulatory alignment) must form part of the withdrawal agreement. The backstop will apply unless and until another solution is found, he says. Barnier confirms the regulatory alignment solution for Ireland will be part of withdrawal agreement as a backstop option. Barnier says there has also been an agreement on the transition. During the transition the UK will no longer participate in EU decision making processes, he says. UK will not participate in EU decision-making during the transition, Barnier says. But it will still be bound by single market rules. EU nationals arriving in UK during the transition will get same rights as EU nationals there before, says Barnier. Here is the new, colour-coded text of the draft withdrawal agreement. Barnier says a new text of the draft withdrawal agreement is being published. It is colour-coded. The green bits are the bits that are agreed, he says. The yellow bits refect areas where there is a political agreement, but the legal text needs to be agreed. And the bits in white are where there is no agreement, or where discussion has not started, he says. Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, starts by thanking both sides for their hard work. He says this agreement will be a legal agreement. Today they are presenting a legal text. They are able to agree a large part of what will be an agremeent for the ordered withdrawal of the UK from the EU. Barnier says a legal text on the transition has been agreed. But we are not at the end of the road. There is more work to do, particularly on Ireland, he says. He says he will present what has been agreed to EU leaders on Friday. Before then, he will also present it to MEPs and to the commission, he says. The press conference is now starting. There is a live feed here. Number 10 told reporters at the morning lobby briefing that David Davis would be making an imminent announcement on the progress of the talks. Asked if the prime minister was preparing to “sell out” UK fishermen, Downing Street said it would be clear that was not the case. The prime minister’s spokesman said: In terms of the implementation period, we’ve been clear we want to have proper protections in place for UK fishermen. In the Mansion House speech, the PM was clear that UK fishermen should get a fairer share. Here is a thread from Politico Europe’s Tom McTague on the transition deal. These are from my colleague Daniel Boffey in Brussels. In an article for today’s Daily Telegraph (paywall) Jacob Rees-Mogg, the Tory backbencher and chair of the European Research Group, which is pushing for a harder rather than a softer Brexit, says that the UK will be seen as a “joke nation” if it does not get a transition deal that enables it negotiate and sign trade deals during that period. He says: We must be able to negotiate and sign trade deals. Yet this does not depend just on our legal ability to do so. It depends on how other countries view us. If they think that we are bound by the EU’s “duty of sincere cooperation” or its common commercial policy, then they will rightly not take us seriously. The critical aspects of trade negotiations happen at the end when deals are done. We will not get there if other states see we cannot cut deals. In the words of one country’s frustrated trade negotiator, Britain has to decide if it is a serious country or a joke nation. It would be humiliating for others to have cause to think thus of us. The article reads as if Rees-Mogg is laying down an ultimatum to the prime minister. But, in practice, he seems to be signalling he’s starting to compromise. The EU has already signalled that the UK will be allowed to negotiate trade deals with the transition (so long as it waits until after the transition is over before it implements them.) Rees-Mogg’s objections to a transition deal used to be much stronger. In January he was saying that if during the transition the UK had to remain subject to the European court of justice, obey new EU laws, and keep paying into the EU budget, it would be a vassal state. All three of these conditions will apply to the transition deal due to be announced later today. But, in his Telegraph article, Rees-Mogg barely mentioned them. The Electoral Commission has published figures showing how much the main parties spent during the 2017 general election. These sums cover the “regulated period” - the year leading up to polling day. They show the Tories outspent Labour by around £7.5m. Detailed figures are available on the commission’s website here. The Wall Street Journal is reporting that a broad agreement has been reached on the Brexit transition. Business Insider’s Adam Payne says EU sources are confirming the WSJ report. This is from Sky’s Beth Rigby. Here is some more comment on the statement from EU foreign ministers on the Salisbury nerve agent attack. (See 10.10am.) From Ian Bond, director of foreign policy at the Centre for European Reform From Jonathan Eyal, an associate director at RUSI From Peter Foster, the Daily Telegraph’s Europe editor The pound is rallying this morning, on hopes that Britain and the European Union are making progress towards a Brexit transition deal. Sterling has jumped by almost a cent against the US dollar to $1.403, a three week high. Against the euro, the pound has risen by 0.5% to €1.14 - a five-week high. Traders are reacting to speculation that David Davis and Michel Barnier are making progress at today’s meeting, ahead of the EU summit later this week. It sounds like the upcoming Davis-Barnier press conference could be significant.... Manfred Weber, the German MEP, Merkel ally and leader of the centre-right European People’s party group in the European parliament, says that Vladimir Putin is “leading a modern war against the west” and that Europeans need to “stop being naive”. Simon Coveney, the Irish foreign minister, posted this on Twitter earlier this morning. And after a meeting with Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, he posted this. The BBC’s Adam Fleming thinks there is a difference in tone between the two tweets. Here is the Wall Street Journal’s Simon Nixon on the statement from EU foreign ministers. (See 10.10am.) But the Telegraph’s James Crisp says Italy was very supportive towards the UK as the statement was being drawn up. Boris Johnson, the foreign secretary, has welcomed the statement from EU foreign ministers. (See 10.10am.) The EU foreign affairs council has just issued a statement about the Salisbury nerve agent attack. Here it is in full. The European Union strongly condemns the attack that took place against Sergei and Yulia Skripal in Salisbury, UK on 4 March 2018, that also left a police officer seriously ill. The lives of many citizens were threatened by this reckless and illegal act. The European Union takes extremely seriously the UK government’s assessment that it is highly likely that the Russian Federation is responsible. The European Union is shocked at the offensive use of any military-grade nerve agent, of a type developed by Russia, for the first time on European soil in over 70 years. The use of chemical weapons by anyone under any circumstances is completely unacceptable and constitutes a security threat to us all. Any such use is a clear violation of the Chemical Weapons Convention, a breach of international law and undermines the rules-based international order. The EU welcomes the commitment of the UK to work closely with the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) in supporting the investigation into the attack. The union calls on Russia to address urgently the questions raised by the UK and the international community and to provide immediate, full and complete disclosure of its novichok programme to the OPCW. The European Union expresses its unqualified solidarity with the UK and its support, including for the UK’s efforts to bring those responsible for this crime to justice. The EU will remain closely focussed on this issue and its implications. The formula that the EU is taking “extremely seriously” the UK’s assessment that Russia was “highly likely” to be responsible for the Salisbury attack is not quite a full endorsement of the British government’s position. But it reflects the language the US and Germany were using early last week before they firmed up their position on Thursday and signed the joint statement from the UK, the US, France and Germany saying that there was “no plausible alternative” to Russia being responsible. The Telegraph’s James Crisp thinks this is as much as the UK could hope for from the EU as a whole at this point. According to AFP’s Danny Kemp in Brussels, we are getting a David Davis press conference later. And here is more from Patrick on the German response to the Skripal poisoning. This is from my colleague Patrick Wintour, the Guardian’s diplomatic editor. The UK’s gambling regulator has given the government the all-clear to defy calls to cut the stakes on the roulette-style games offered on controversial fixed-odds betting terminals (FOBTs) to £2, my colleague Rob Davies reports. Federica Mogherini, the EU’s foreign policy chief, said this morning the EU will announce a common position in response to the Salisbury attacks later today. It is unclear whether that statement will outline sanctions or other counter-measures against Russia. EU leaders will also discuss the Salisbury attacks at a summit in Brussels on Thursday and Friday. Some foreign ministers suggested today may be too soon to take decisions. Spain’s Alfonso Dastis said: We think now the time is for an extended examination of all the elements involved with the participation of the OPCW [Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons]. Experts from the OPCW will be visiting Porton Down in Wiltshire today to assess the nerve agent used to poison Sergey Skripal and his daughter. Belgium’s foreign minister, Didier Reynders, said it was necessary to put pressure on Russia to take part in a real inquiry. Sweden dismissed Russian claims that it was the source of the nerve toxin as “ridiculous and totally unfounded”. Margot Wallström, the country’s foreign minister, said Russia was “trying to make some kind of diversion from the real issues”. Two big stories are likely to dominate today. David Davis, the Brexit secretary, is meeting Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, in Brussels today amid speculation that they will finalise a deal on the Brexit transition, ahead of the EU summit taking place at the end of this week. And there is still in intense focus on whether Britain will take further action against Russia, after the nerve agent attack in Salisbury and last week’s diplomat expulsions that were that were replicated by Moscow. Boris Johnson, the foreign secretary, is discussing Russia at a meeting of EU foreign ministers in Brussels this morning. As he arrived he told journalists that he was encouraged by how much support there was for the UK and its decision to hold Russia responsible for the attack. He explained: The Russian denials grow increasingly absurd. At one time they say they never made novichok. At another time they say they did make novichok, but all the stocks have been destroyed. Then again they say they made novichok and all the stocks have been destroyed, but some of them have mysteriously escaped to Sweden or the Czech Republic, Slovakia, or the United States or even the United Kingdom. What people can see is that this is a classic Russian strategy of trying to conceal the needle of truth in a haystack of lies and obfuscation. What really strikes me, talking to European friends and partners today, is that 12 years after the assassination of Alexander Litvinenko in London, they are not fooling anybody anymore. There is scarcely a country round the table here in Brussels that has not been affected in recent years by some kind of malign or disruptive Russian behaviour. That is why I think the strength and resolve of our European friends is so striking today. (On Thursday Johnson was arguing that Russia was not seriously trying to deny responsibility for the Salisbury attack, but never mind. What is consistent in what Johnson is saying is that he is accusing Moscow of dishonesty and of failing to take the nerve agent attack seriously.) Here is the agenda for the day. Morning: Boris Johnson attends a meeting of the EU foreign affairs council in Brussels. 11am: Downing Street lobby briefing 2pm: Sir Vince Cable, the Lib Dem leader, speaks at a Brexit conference. 2.30am: Damian Hinds, the education secretary, takes questions in the Commons. Also, David Davis, the Brexit secretary, is meeting Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator in Brussels. They are expected to hold a press conference around lunchtime, but that has not been confirmed. And at some point today experts from the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons will arrive in the UK to start their own investigation into the nerve agent used in Salisbury. As usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web. I plan to post a summary at lunchtime and another in the afternoon. You can read all today’s Guardian politics stories here.

The new ministerial guidelines, come after the state government was drawn back into controversy about minister Mark Bailey’s use of a private email account, mangocube6@yahoo.co.uk Palaszczuk had been expected to outlaw the use of private emails before parliament resuming on Tuesday. The new guidelines go further, however, banning Facebook messenger, SnapChat and encryption services Wickr and WhatsApp. The prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, has previously said he used Wickr and WhatsApp, as opposed to text messaging, to communicate with MPs and journalists. It’s understood many of the conversations between federal Liberal MPs before the 2015 leadership spill took place using encrypted messaging. Queensland’s opposition leader, Deb Frecklington, has repeatedly called for Bailey to resign over his use of the private email account, a scandal the government had hoped would disappear before its second term. Bailey was stood down from cabinet in July last year after the Crime and Corruption Commission found a “reasonable suspicion of corrupt conduct” relating to the potential destruction of public records. Bailey had deleted his personal account after a right to information request by News Corp Australia. An investigation by the state archivist ultimately found “no evidence” to suggest Bailey wanted to “conceal corrupt conduct” and he was reinstated ahead of the November 2017 election. Frecklington told reporters in Brisbane the new guidelines were irrelevant if Bailey remained in cabinet and refused to voluntarily release his full tranche of private emails “The premier didn’t enforce the old guidelines for Bailey, so how can Queenslanders trust that she’ll enforce these new ones?” Frecklington said. Palaszczuk said posts on Facebook and Twitter were excluded from the ban as they were public documents “and are therefore disclosed”. “Cabinet endorsed my decision today. These rules take effect from tomorrow and the ministerial handbook has been updated accordingly,” she said. “Following findings of the Crime and Corruption Commission on the risks associated with private email use I committed to review our record keeping and information managements policies. “I have already made clear my expectation that all ministers, assistant ministers and ministerial staff use only government email accounts for official business.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/mar/19/reporting-on-african-gangs-akin-to-media-terrorism-says-melbourne-campaigner","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-19T05:55:43Z","webTitle":"Reporting on 'African gangs' akin to 'media terrorism', says Melbourne campaigner","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/mar/19/reporting-on-african-gangs-akin-to-media-terrorism-says-melbourne-campaigner","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/mar/19/reporting-on-african-gangs-akin-to-media-terrorism-says-melbourne-campaigner","fields":{"headline":"Reporting on 'African gangs' akin to 'media terrorism', says Melbourne campaigner","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The co-founder of the #AfricanGangs campaign says widespread media coverage connecting crime to people of African descent in Melbourne was akin to “media terrorism”. Speaking at a forum on the so-called “African gang crisis” at the Immigration Museum in Melbourne on Monday, Natalina Andrew said she used the term because “they are trying to terrorise my community.” She cited the example of teenagers allegedly being provoked by a Daily Mail photographer, an incident that was criticised by Victoria police. “We panic when it’s 6pm or 6.30pm, time for the current affairs or the news,” she said at the Monash University forum. “We call each other and say: what are they saying about us, are they talking about African people … The end of your bulletin is the start of our nightmare. We go to bed and we have nightmares.” Andrew and co-founder Maker Mayek started the #AfricanGangs social media campaign in protest against weeks of one-dimensional media coverage of so-called street gangs of South Sudanese youths. Both are of South Sudanese descent. Andrew said the campaign started as a way to “fight back” against media coverage, which was grouping gatherings of young South Sudanese people into “gangs”. They began sharing images of their lives, like Mayek sitting at his desk job or Andrew at a restaurant, with the tag #AfricanGangs. “We love this community and we love Australia,” Andrew told the forum. “If we didn’t love Australia we would not be here. If I didn’t love Australia I wouldn’t have started the hashtag, I would have just packed my bag and left.” Journalist and film-maker Santilla Chingaipe said Australian media companies needed to implement diversity training to help predominantly white newsrooms recognise and overcome their own biases. Chingaipe said journalists should ask themselves: “If this was a white person, would I ask this question?” The former SBS journalist said coverage of so-called African street gangs, which began with a series of articles in the Herald Sun in December and was picked up across the media spectrum, including by Guardian Australia, was heavily based on race. “To think about the way ‘African’ has been used in headlines, it’s coded language, it means ‘black’,” she said. “When you see ‘African gangs’ they are saying ‘black gangs’, except they can’t say that.” She said many news reports created a narrative that suggested “a causal link between race and crime”. She said experts including Victoria police separated issues of youth crime from the African migrant population at large, but that media outlets continued to report the more sensationalist comments of politicians such as Peter Dutton. “The sanest voice in this African gangs thing has been the Victoria police,” Chingaipe said. “To have that not be listened to, I find that extraordinary.” University of Melbourne academic Dr Berhan Ahmed, a former chair of the African Think Tank, said lack of diversity in Australian newsrooms and other institutions allowed racist narratives to take root. “When we have got one monoculture reporting on other cultures, what can you expect?” he said. Fairfax Media journalist Benjamin Millar, who has reported extensively on the western suburbs of Melbourne that were the centre of the alleged crime crisis, said lack of diversity led to simplistic reporting. “When you have the kind of hysteria we had over summer, the situation where Africanness becomes synonymous with crime, and we are almost in the situation where crime is synonymous with Africanness,” Millar said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/mar/19/housing-plan-urges-coalition-to-help-create-500000-affordable-homes","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-19T17:00:18Z","webTitle":"Housing plan urges Coalition to help create 500,000 affordable homes","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/mar/19/housing-plan-urges-coalition-to-help-create-500000-affordable-homes","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/mar/19/housing-plan-urges-coalition-to-help-create-500000-affordable-homes","fields":{"headline":"Housing plan urges Coalition to help create 500,000 affordable homes","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The federal government will be urged to help create 500,000 social and affordable rental homes in a plan that includes tax incentives for superannuation to invest in affordable housing. The Everybody’s Home campaign director, Kate Colvin, will outline the community housing and homelessness sector’s plan at the National Press Club on Tuesday. An Essential poll, also released on Tuesday, showed a majority of voters think the Turnbull government is not doing enough to fix housing affordability, including half of Coalition voters. The housing plan calls for capital investment in 300,000 new social and Aboriginal housing properties and a new tax incentive or direct subsidy to leverage super fund and other private-sector investment in 200,000 low-cost rental properties. In the meantime, the government should increase rent assistance. First-home buyers should be prioritised over property speculators by “resetting the tax system”, the plan says, endorsing changes to negative gearing and capital gains tax. The Everybody’s Home campaign also wants nationally consistent renters’ rights, including the abolition of “no grounds” evictions, limiting rent increases to once a year and minimum standards to ensure rental properties are habitable. The Essential poll found 62% of people think the government should do more to fix housing affordability, while 60% think the opposition should also go further. It had a sample of more than 1,000 and a margin of error of 3%. The poll found 49% of Coalition voters believe the government is not doing enough and 57% of Labor voters believe the opposition should do more. Colvin said the Everybody’s Home campaign would “address the entire housing system to make sure every Australian has a safe, secure roof over their head whether they’re buying, renting or at risk of homelessness”. “Making sure everyone has a home is a top-order priority for Australians but it is not matched by action from our political leaders. That needs to change,” she said. “Genuine home buyers are missing out to people building investment portfolios. There’s a chronic shortage of social and affordable rental options, and it’s causing record levels of homelessness.” Last week the Australian Bureau of Statistics released statistics showing that homelessness had increased by 14% between the 2011 and 2016 censuses, with 116,427 people now thought to have no permanent home. In the 2017 budget the Turnbull government unveiled a number of housing affordability measures including increasing the capital gains tax discount for affordable housing and allowing first-home buyers to use the tax benefits of superannuation to save a deposit. Economists welcomed the measures but rated them less likely to affect house prices than Labor’s policies to halve the capital gains tax discount and to restrict negative gearing to new properties. In comments to Guardian Australia a spokeswoman for assistant minister to the treasurer, Michael Sukkar, said the national housing market had cooled in the last six months but housing affordability would be a “permanent feature” of Turnbull government budgets. “We can’t rest on our laurels,” she said. “The government remains committed to reducing pressure on housing affordability for Australians across the spectrum, from first-home buyers, to older Australians looking to downsize, to those who rely on social housing, and those who are experiencing homelessness.” In March 2017 the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority put limits on interest-only loans favoured by negatively geared investors, which led to loans to first-home buyers increasing to their highest level in five years. In February, Malcolm Turnbull said the government had taken a “more measured and calibrated approach to the housing market” and the Apra changes had resulted in a “big reduction in interest-only loans”. Turnbull repeated the claim that the government’s policies were like “using a scalpel ... rather than a meat cleaver”, despite the revelation of Treasury documents that said the impact of Labor’s policies would be “relatively modest”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/mar/20/stormy-daniels-trump-lawsuit-distraction","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-20T12:28:26Z","webTitle":"The Seth Rich lawsuit matters more than the Stormy Daniels case | Jill Abramson","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/20/stormy-daniels-trump-lawsuit-distraction","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/20/stormy-daniels-trump-lawsuit-distraction","fields":{"headline":"The Seth Rich lawsuit matters more than the Stormy Daniels case","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"When I hear the name Stormy Daniels, and that’s a lot lately, I have the same vision inside my head. It’s Donald Trump, right before the presidential debate with Hillary Clinton in St Louis on 9 October 2016. At the time, I, along with just about everyone I knew, mistakenly thought Trump was finished because the notorious Access Hollywood tape had just come out. But there he was sitting next to three women with far less memorable names – Paula, Kathleen and Juanita – who had accused Bill Clinton of past sexual harassment and assault. Trump had claimed, without offering evidence, that Hillary had brutalized and threatened the women in order to silence them. He brought them to St Louis to rattle Clinton. (This was also the debate in which he loomed over Clinton, Frankenstein style). But all along, surprise, surprise, it was Trump who was doing the silencing. The usually prim Wall Street Journal has taken the lead on the Stormy story, detailing how Trump’s personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, paid the porn star, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, $130,000 in hush money to keep her quiet about an affair she had with Trump in 2006. On 18 February2018, Cohen publicly declared that he used his own funds to pay Daniels in October 2016, just 10 days before the presidential election, to maintain discretion regarding the alleged affair with Trump. On 6 March 2018, Daniels filed a lawsuit against Trump claiming that her non-disclosure agreement is inoperative because Trump never signed it. It’s been wall to wall Stormy ever since. Certainly, hush money paid by Trump’s lawyer is a legitimate news story, but not one that rivals nuclear talks with North Korea. Rex Tillerson’s exit couldn’t even throw Stormy offstage. That’s a problem. There are now so many scandals swirling around Trump that everything becomes a fetid, confused sideshow. It’s a warped kind of entertainment. Every new scandal shrouds the previous one. But it’s hard to beat the president and the porn star. Bill Clinton’s purported harassment of an Arkansas state employee or sex with a White House intern don’t even come close. We can’t wait to hear from Stormy herself. Will 60 Minutes air its rumored blockbuster? Will Jimmy Kimmel get an interview? Oh where oh where will our Stormy be? It’s thrilling to think Buzzfeed may unlock Stormy’s lips by making her a witness in the libel action Cohen filed against Buzzfeed after the site published the Christopher Steele dossier. Trump blasted Buzzfeed as a “failing pile of garbage”, after it published the dossier. But Stormy’s a better scandal star than even the Russian prostitutes whom Steele described Trump cavorting with. Buzzfeed was already selling “failing pile of garbage” merch on its website (with proceeds going to the Committee to Protect Journalists). Can “Free Stormy” buttons be far behind? This all wouldn’t be as troubling if Stormy weren’t overshadowing the brave Florida students demanding gun control. She’s the perfect bait for our media snacking habits and shortened attention spans. But there are far more serious lawsuits than Stormy’s that we should be focusing on. I’ve previously written about Fox News’ shameless coverage of the 2016 unsolved murder of a young former Democratic National Committee staffer named Seth Rich. Last week, ABC News reported that his family has filed a lawsuit against Fox, charging that several of its journalists fabricated a vile story attempting to link the hacked emails from Democratic National Committee computers to Rich, who worked there. After the fabricated story ran on the Fox website, it was retracted, but not before various on-air stars, especially Trump mouthpiece Sean Hannity, flogged the bogus conspiracy theory suggesting Rich had something to do with the hacked messages. This shameful episode demonstrated, once again, that Rupert Murdoch’s favorite network, and Trump’s, has no ethical compass and had no hesitation about what grief this manufactured story caused to the 26-year-old murder victim’s family. It’s good to see them striking back, since that is the only tactic that the Murdochs and Trumps of the world will respect or, perhaps, will force them to temper the calumny they spread on a daily basis. Of course, the Rich lawsuit does not have the sex appeal of the Stormy case. The rightwing echo chamber will brazenly ignore its self-inflicted wounds. And, for the rest of the cable pundit brigades, the DNC emails and Rich are old news. A porn star who once frolicked with a president beats a murder victim falsely tarnished every time. And what better distraction could there be to deflect attention from the outrageous firing of Andrew McCabe than threatening to pursue Stormy for millions and millions for breaking her oath of silence? So now we wait, with bated breath, for Stormy to tell all to Anderson Cooper. I can almost guarantee that this interview will be a letdown, but we will all tune in, anyway. It’s a cliche to say that this administration is like a car wreck. It’s terrible, but we can’t turn away. This is how Donald Trump wants it. Better than anyone, he knows how to create mayhem as a distraction and ride on its waves. That’s why he is threatening to seek $20m in damages from Stormy. It keeps this ridiculous story going, at least until something even more outrageous comes along.

He had arrived home on a flight from Sydney, and from the air the blaze had looked nothing more than a spot fire. There was no hint of the speed at which it was ripping through bushland towards the sleepy seaside town. Payne’s power and internet were out. The phone was dead. As he sat in his car hoping for a radio update, the roar of the helicopters came closer and closer. The smoke thickened and it dawned on Payne that something had gone terribly wrong. “Suddenly, in the space of about 15 minutes, it just started getting really serious,” he told Guardian Australia. “We started thinking about what we were going to grab, then there was just a vehicle in the street that said ‘Get out now’. So we had about two minutes. I grabbed the dog, some photos, and we got out.” In an instant, an inferno was upon them. The gardens in neighbouring homes burst into flames as the floating embers found their way into dried-out shrubbery. Through his neighbours’ windows, he could see the rapidly approaching fire tearing through the bush behind his home. “If we left it a couple more minutes I don’t think we would have got out,” he said. “You know you see those photos when everything is just bright orange and smoky? Dead set I could see about 10 metres ahead of me in the car. I had the hazard lights on, you couldn’t see a thing.” Payne and his wife have lived in Tathra for 18 years. They left not knowing whether their house would make it through the afternoon and spent the night at Bega showgrounds along with hundreds of other Tathra residents. It wasn’t until Monday morning that he learned his house was standing, but badly damaged. “There’s a mate of mine who’s in the town somehow, and he’s actually just texted me a photo of the house,” he said. “She’s a bit singed, she’s a bit black on the edges, but she’s still standing.” On Monday afternoon the Rural Fire Service released its first grim assessment of the state of the town: 69 houses had been destroyed, another 39 damaged and 30 caravans or cabins lost. About 90% of the fireground had been assessed, and residents would be allowed back to their houses where it was safe, the RFS said. Malcolm Turnbull was shocked at the destruction when he visited Tathra on Monday with the NSW premier, Gladys Berejiklian. “Thank heaven there have been no lives lost,” he told reporters during a visit to the Bega evacuation centre. “That’s a great tribute to the community, to the firefighters, to all of that preparation and resilience.” The mood among the Tathra residents gathered at Bega was surprisingly upbeat despite the devastation, Payne said. About 70 houses and other buildings are thought to have been destroyed in the fire. Payne, the store manager at the local Woolworths, helped organise food, drink, sanitary items, phone chargers and blankets, aided by Ben Sealey, Woolworths’ group manager for the NSW south coast. Narelle Griffin, the secretary of the Bega showgrounds, said the fire had moved through so quickly it caught most people unaware. Many were still unsure whether their houses were standing. “Look they’re amazing, the people are amazing. It’s all I can say, if I’d lost my home, and I’ve spoken to people who have … they’re just so resilient,” she said. “It’s been so quick and such a shock. I think they’d all like to get back into their homes and into Tathra to see first hand.” On Monday afternoon NSW police urged the public to stay away from fire-affected areas while emergency services worked to make them safe. Teams from the Rural Fire Service and police were still assessing the extent of the damage. The owners of the Tathra Beach Motor Village were forced to evacuate as the fire bore down on the town. They told Guardian Australia they fled north, out of the town, but have heard conflicting reports on the extent of the damage. “We have no real idea of what damage has been done as there are a lot of different sources trying to tell us different things, which makes it hard on us. Some sources are saying we’ve lost half the park and others suggesting there’s much less damage,” the owners said in a statement. “The only thing we really need to get out to people is we ask that customers with vans on site do not enter the park until they have first been contacted by us allowing them to do so. “We understand it is a devastating situation and they will want to know what’s going on but we want to make sure our guests are safe first and we’ve had a chance to assess the situation before contacting van owners notifying them of the end result.” On Monday firefighters were still battling to control the 1,000-hectare fire. It started on Saturday and moved rapidly towards Tathra, fanned by very strong winds and high temperatures. The fire tore through several kilometres of bushland and crossed a river before it reached the seaside town. No serious injuries or deaths have been reported, and no one has been reported missing. Payne said it could have been a lot worse. “The important thing is that at this stage, from what people are telling us, that they believe no one has been seriously injured or hurt,” he said. “At the end of the day it’s just stuff. We just pick up and go again.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/mar/21/im-following-the-footsteps-of-my-aboriginal-ancestors-the-first-astronomers","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-21T00:06:15Z","webTitle":"I'm following the footsteps of my Aboriginal ancestors, the first astronomers | IndigenousX","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/21/im-following-the-footsteps-of-my-aboriginal-ancestors-the-first-astronomers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/21/im-following-the-footsteps-of-my-aboriginal-ancestors-the-first-astronomers","fields":{"headline":"I'm following the footsteps of my Aboriginal ancestors, the first astronomers","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"I like to talk about astronomy a lot. No, scratch that, I love to talk about astronomy. All. The. Time. Thank goodness I do just that for a living. I’ve worked at Sydney Observatory for the past two years as an astronomy educator, which is essentially my glorified term for a tour guide. My favourite part about being an astronomy educator is answering questions, although there is one question that I often find difficult to answer, “What is your favourite part about space?” When you have a passion for such a huge subject with so many great subtopics it really is hard to pick just one. If you go outside on a clear night, the air whistling with a cool evening breeze, no matter whether you’re in the city or out in country, you can look up and see some amazing things. The stars are a gorgeous sight just by themselves, but for an astronomer like me they are just the beginning of an endless cosmos. Once you look past the stars with a telescope, you can see many more amazing objects. Nebula, massive clouds of interstellar dust and gas creating groups of thousands of stars, dwarfed by globular star clusters sporting millions of stars! Even beyond that there are millions upon millions of galaxies for us to explore. These are some of my favourite things, but if I were to pinpoint my favourite part of astronomy it would be that you can never stop learning. My second love to talking about astronomy is learning, and astronomy is the best field to continuously learn in. Our universe is precisely 5% atoms – or “sparkly stuff”, as one of my favourite astronomers calls it – and the other 95% is composed of dark matter and dark energy. You may have heard of these terms before. Essentially, these terms describe some sort of matter (stuff) and energy that we can’t see or detect, yet mathematically we think they must be there. So of course, if we can’t see it we call it “dark”. There are things we know we don’t know, like our friends dark matter and dark energy, but there are also things we don’t know we don’t know! I learnt this concept on a youth personal development course called EmpowerU. You don’t know what you don’t know, or in other words, there is always more you can learn. Indigenous culture is rich with astronomical knowledge. I started hearing about Kamilaroi and Boorong astronomy while training at Sydney Observatory and was absolutely blown away. As soon as I learnt just a little bit about our ancestors’ complex knowledge, I knew I had to learn more. I was hooked. I didn’t always know what country I came from, but I always knew I was Aboriginal. When I started learning about Kamilaroi and Boorong astronomy, I had a driving force within me pushing me to learn more about my culture. That’s when I did some digging into the family background and discovered that I am Wiradjuri. So, I went and I researched, I talked to people, I researched some more and once again I was blown away by what I found. Great celestial emus that indicate when emu eggs are available, star clusters that bring the summer. Even now, two years on from that first critical moment, I am learning more and more about our amazing culture. Just the other week I was exploring in the bush and came across some beautiful rock carvings that appeared to show seven planets, plus the moon, all in a line. Back when there was no light pollution you would have had the ability to see six planets in the sky with the naked eye. Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn and Uranus. I kept looking and thinking, and I realised that there was one planet missing. Surely it couldn’t have been Neptune, the farthest major planet in the solar system, because it’s not physically visible to the human eye. I realised that this eighth circle could be the Earth. I was flabbergasted – this could be evidence of our people knowing that Earth is a planet along with the others in our night skies, orbiting around a bright hot star called the sun, a millennia before the likes of Galileo, who discovered this a mere 400 years ago! Rich astronomical knowledge that dates back over 65,000 years runs through our veins. We should embrace it. Why? Because we are the first astronomers!

Boris Johnson will today seek to convince the EU foreign affairs council to join him in fresh condemnation of Russia after his explosive claims that Moscow has been creating and stockpiling nerve agent novichok and working out how to use it for assassinations. Scientists from the UN-backed Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons arrive today to analyse samples of the agent used to poison the former spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia. The foreign secretary made his claims after Russian EU ambassador Vladimir Chizhov issued blanket denials and said British agents might have used their stockpiles at Porton Down. As the row enters its third week, Johnson dismissed Chizhov’s comments, saying they were “not the response of a country that really believes it’s innocent”. On Sunday, Vladimir Putin, fresh from a profoundly unsurprising electoral victory, denied any such nerve agents existed and said the idea of carrying out such a killing during an election campaign would be “rubbish, drivel, nonsense”. The latest theory to gain prominence is that the Skripals were poisoned via his car’s ventilation system. The report, from ABC news in the US, came as counter-terrorism police renewed their appeal for sightings of Skripal’s burgundy BMW 320D saloon car on 4 March. ABC also reported that at least 38 people in Salisbury had been identified as having been affected by the nerve agent. * * * Analyse this – Facebook and Cambridge Analytica, the company that worked with Donald Trump’s election team, have been accused of misleading MPs after the Observer revealed that more than 50m Facebook profiles were harvested and used to build a system that may have influenced voters in the 2016 US presidential race. Conservative MP Damian Collins, who heads the parliamentary committee investigating fake news, said he would call the heads of both companies to give further testimony. Cambridge Analytica head Alexander Nix, he said, needed to explain why he had told MPs last month his company had not received data from Facebook. Collins also called on Mark Zuckerberg to testify rather than send more lowly executives who “claimed not to know the answers”. * * * Spring bloom (-ing cold) – The prospect of even more transport chaos than usual on a Monday looms today after much of Britain woke up to ice and snow warnings with parts of the south-west forecast to receive flurries up to 30cm deep. Parts of the A30 have been closed and Highways England urged motorists to drive with caution and pack snow kits in the worst-affected areas. Hundreds of flights were cancelled yesterday, sports events were called off and police and rescue teams had to dig dozens out of snow drifts on major roads. Don’t worry, on Tuesday it will be back to normal. Time to prepare for an Easter wonderland? Surely not. * * * British woman killed fighting in Syria – A 26-year-old Briton has died while fighting for Kurdish forces in northern Syria, her commanders have said. Anna Campbell, from Lewes, East Sussex, was killed by a Turkish missile on Friday. Her father, Dirk Campbell, described her as a “beautiful and loving daughter” who “would go to any lengths to create the world that she believed in”. Her military commanders in the US-backed Kurdish Women’s Protection Units (YPJ) praised her “revolutionary spirit, which demonstrated the power of women”. Kurdish militants have vowed to wage a guerrilla war against the Turkish military and their Syrian rebel proxies after the latter swept into the northern Syrian city. Tens of thousands have already fled Afrin in recent days. * * * You cannot be serious – Martina Navratilova has taken aim at the “good old boys’ network” at the BBC and revealed that fellow Wimbledon pundit John McEnroe was paid at least 10 times more than she was last year. Navratilova said she was told she was getting paid a comparable amount, adding: “We were not told the truth, that’s for sure.” BBC Sport said McEnroe’s role was of “a different scale, scope and time commitment” and was therefore not comparable. * * * Lesson for us all – A teacher from Brent who learned snippets of Gujarati, Hindi and Tamil to bond with her pupils has been crowned the world’s best teacher. Andria Zafirakou was handed $1m at a ceremony in Dubai for her work at a school in Alperton, a poor area with pupils from a wide variety of backgrounds. The arts and textiles teacher is the first British winner. * * * Lunchtime read: Secrecy at the heart of the palace How much did the Queen know about her governor general’s plan to use his colonial-era powers to dismiss Australia’s elected prime minister? The answer is, we don’t know, and we won’t until the Queen decides to release the letters she exchanged with him, something that underlines why Australia should ditch her, writes Jenny Hocking. The events of 1975 might have largely faded from memory in the UK but still resonate in Australia as one of the “most controversial and tumultuous events” in its modern history. Those are the words of Justice John Griffiths, a federal court judge who ruled on Friday that the communications with governor general, John Kerr, discussing the ejection of Labor prime minister Gough Whitlam must remain secret. Amid a political stalemate at the time, Kerr had raised the prospect of sacking Whitlam with Prince Charles and then with the Queen’s private secretary, Sir Martin Charteris. Hocking, the historian who sought to force the release of the letters, said the court verdict was deeply disappointing for Australia’s history and its independence. The palace letters will remain embargoed on the instruction of the Queen, which Hocking described as “an absurd and humiliating situation for any nation”. Sport A day supposedly to confirm Tiger Woods’s status as the returning hero instead belonged to Rory McIlroy, who rose above the heckles to deliver a stunning final round and claim victory at the Arnold Palmer Invitational. At the BNP Paribas Open, Juan Martín del Potro rallied from three match points down in the third set to beat top-ranked Roger Federer 6-4, 6-7, 7-6, handing the world No1 his first loss of the year. Pedro’s extra-time header took Chelsea past Leicester and into the FA Cup semi-finals, where they will meet last season’s losing finalists, Southampton. In the other semi, Manchester United will face Tottenham Hotspur. And an unexpectedly one-sided Six Nations Championship has made two things crystal clear: there can be no disputing that Ireland are the European side best placed to succeed at the Rugby World Cup; and unless England absorb some harsh lessons, the chances of them prospering in Japan are on a par with Eddie Jones holidaying in Wales. Business The CBI is concerned that Britain will lose out on as much as €1bn (£880m) in annual European funding for research and development because of Brexit. The business lobby group wants the government to renew its membership of the scheme to safeguard investment.

The papers Fallout from the Observer’s investigation into Cambridge Analytica features strongly on the front pages today. The Guardian leads on the growing calls for investigations and hearings into Facebook and Cambridge Analytica. The story also makes the front page of the FT, with the headline: “Facebook feels the pressure over claims its data helped Trump win.” The Daily Telegraph takes the issue into its new technology series, with Matt Hancock, the secretary of state for digital, culture, media and sports, saying the “wild west” era for technology firms is over. The Times reports that Facebook is being urged to “come clean” over the leaking of data on 50 million users but leads on the gambling watchdog backing away from tough curbs on the maximum betting amounts allowed on some addictive machines. Meanwhile, the Daily Mail continues its plastics pollution investigation, this time looking into the spread of airborne plastics.

The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) is currently examining the impact of search engines and social media on competition in the media and advertising markets. Guardian Australia understands the inquiry’s remit could also allow it to examine concerns about the impact of Facebook and firms like Cambridge Analytica on local political advertising. Cambridge Analytica helped Donald Trump win the US presidential election and is currently under investigation in the US and UK, including into any possible role in the European Union referendum. On Sunday the Guardian revealed how whistleblower Christopher Wylie created a “psychological warfare tool” used by Trump’s chief strategist, Steve Bannon, which harvested Facebook data from more than 50 million people. The collection of the data was authorised but Facebook’s policy barred it from being sold on or used for advertising. Facebook has since suspended Cambridge Analytica and its parent company, SCL. On Tuesday the Australian Information and Privacy Commission demanded Facebook provide information on whether any Australians were affected by the unauthorised use of Facebook profile data. Commissioner Timothy Pilgrim said he was aware of reports that Facebook profile information “was acquired and used without authorisation” and he would “consider Facebook’s response and whether any further regulatory action is required”. The Privacy Act confers the commissioner with a range of regulatory powers including to “investigate an alleged interference with privacy”, and wideranging enforcement penalties, including seeking civil penalties, he said. The office of the treasurer, Scott Morrison, who called the ACCC inquiry, referred questions from Guardian Australia to the commission. The terms of reference cannot be changed but a spokesman for the ACCC said an issues paper published last month outlined the matters the inquiry was considering. The paper called for public submissions, including on “the extent to which consumers understand what data is being collected about them by digital platforms, and how this information is used”. Labor’s communications spokeswoman, Michelle Rowland, said informed consent and the collection and use of consumer data was “a recognised source of concern”. The Greens’ digital rights spokesman, Jordon Steele-John, urged the ACCC to consider whether it could investigate the use of data harvesting in elections. He said there were “significant questions to be answered about where and how the data used in these campaigns was obtained, and whether it was legal to do so”. Justin Warren, a spokesman for Electronic Frontiers Australia (EFA), said his organisation was likely to compile a submission for the ACCC. Warren said the kind of behaviour revealed over the weekend “threatens to undermine democracy”. “This has now been publicised that not only are these organisations gathering data from people who didn’t necessarily give informed consent, in fact informed consent seems to be absent,” he said. “We don’t think Cambridge Analytica is the sole form of this data gathering and attempted manipulation … We’re concerned other political organisations are dealing with other firms doing the same kind of thing.” On Monday EFA and other organisations called on all Australian political parties to detail any involvement with Cambridge Analytica or SCL, including whether they had ever provided any government data, such as electoral rolls. In April last year Guardian Australia reported Cambridge Analytica was looking to set up in Australia, and had met members of the Liberal party, including the then veterans affairs minister, Dan Tehan. The 2017 meeting was raised again by Labor in Senate question time on Monday. Asked for his assurance that any information from Australian Facebook users would not be improperly exploited by political parties, the federal communications minister, Mitch Fifield, said the Liberal party always complied with the relevant law. A spokesman for the Liberal party’s federal secretariat told Guardian Australia: “We are not using Cambridge Analytica.” The federal Labor and Greens parties also said they do not use Cambridge Analytica. Most political parties legally use data analytics. The South Australian Liberal party engaged the services of i360 for its successful state election campaign. A report in the Australian described the tool, which among other methods was “harvesting social media data”, as having “revolutionised” the SA Liberal party’s marginal campaigning."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/mar/21/indigenous-group-offered-10m-in-water-to-help-pass-murray-darling-plan","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-21T00:00:03Z","webTitle":"Indigenous group 'offered $10m in water' to help pass Murray-Darling plan","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/mar/21/indigenous-group-offered-10m-in-water-to-help-pass-murray-darling-plan","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/mar/21/indigenous-group-offered-10m-in-water-to-help-pass-murray-darling-plan","fields":{"headline":"Indigenous group 'offered $10m in water' to help pass Murray-Darling plan","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The government offered an Indigenous group $10m in water entitlements as it tried to get its plan to reduce water for environmental flows in the Murray-Darling basin through the Senate, a senior Indigenous leader has said. Fred Hooper, who heads the Northern Murray-Darling Basin Aboriginal Nations group, said he interpreted the 11th-hour offer as an attempt to get him to persuade Labor to support the government. Hooper was in Canberra last month to lobby Labor and crossbench senators, including Derryn Hinch and Pauline Hanson, to vote for a disallowance motion that ultimately blocked the government’s plan. The Senate’s vote had been delayed several times during the previous week as the shadow water minister, Tony Burke, negotiated with the government over its plan to cut 70 gigalitres from the annual allocation set aside to restore health to the ailing river system. Hooper said the offer was made by Nektarios Tsirbas, an adviser to the minister, David Littleproud, in a morning phone call on 14 February. “It was $10m to buy water for Aboriginal people if I supported their amendments,” Hooper said. “I saw it as the government’s way to get me to change Labor’s mind and vote against the disallowance. If I’d accepted the offer the Wilcannia mob downstream would have had my guts for garters.” Aboriginal communities in New South Wales have been hard hit by the Darling river’s deterioration in recent years, especially in Wilcannia, where the water has again stopped flowing and a red alert for toxic blue-green algae is in place. Tsirbas denied he had offered Hooper any inducement to persuade Labor to change its position. “Fred has misinterpreted our discussion,” Tsirbas said. “I described all the issues we were negotiating with Labor, including our commitments around Indigenous engagement.” Tsirbas said he could not remember if $10m was offered, but confirmed that an amount designated for “economic water” was proposed. He said the money would have been given to the national Indigenous Land Council to invest directly in water on behalf of the basin’s Indigenous groups. “Yes, it was offered at short notice, but these kinds of negotiations move quickly,” he said. Hooper, who represents dozens of Indigenous nations across the north of the basin, said the offer also included two paid positions, one in the Northern Basin Aboriginal Nations Group (NBAN) and one in the Murray Lower Darling Rivers Indigenous Nations (MLDRIN). Hooper said he told Tsirbas he “was not prepared to go back to Tony Burke for the offer that he’d provided”. “I said I didn’t have the authority to accept any offer and that he’d have to offer me $100m before I’d start to take it seriously,” Hooper told Guardian Australia. “I would have been punished severely for supporting an amendment to take 70 gigalitres out of the river system. All the research, the science, shows Aboriginal communities need more water, not less,” he said. Indigenous groups have argued for years that the northern basin’s annual 390 gigalitres for environmental flows is not enough to save the system. A source familiar with the basin plan said Hooper told them about the last-minute offer. “I was amazed that an offer of this type was made,” the source said. “I said to Fred, ‘You have to weigh it up – $10m might get you three gigalitres. It’s not much shared between 85,000 people.’” The source said they did not advise Hooper what to do but they were later “relieved” to know he had turned down the offer. The disallowance motion was passed later that day, with the support of Labor and several crossbenchers. It blocked the government’s proposed reduction in environmental water coming from northern basin rivers and sparked immediate threats from the NSW and Victorian governments that they would walk away from the $13bn Murray-Darling basin plan. Littleproud, a Queensland National, became water and agriculture minister in last year’s reshuffle. The National party has previously not countenanced any specific Indigenous right to water, despite references in the basin plan to Indigenous “cultural” use. If Labor had accepted the offer, it might have provoked a strong backlash from National party members. Burke is now negotiating with the government over proposed amendments to allow irrigators in the southern basin to keep an extra 650 gigalitres of water a year. A second Greens-initiated disallowance motion must come before Parliament by 8 May. Weeks after the first motion was passed, a leaked 2017 report revealed the Murray-Darling Basin Authority believed the poor state of the Darling was due to upstream water extraction by irrigators. The authority had held the report for several months before the crucial vote, but had not released it. Burke said it showed Labor had been right in supporting the disallowance."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/mar/18/juan-martin-del-potro-roger-federer-naomi-osaka-indian-wells","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-18T23:21:33Z","webTitle":"Juan Martín del Potro beats Roger Federer at Indian Wells for first Masters title","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/mar/18/juan-martin-del-potro-roger-federer-naomi-osaka-indian-wells","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/mar/18/juan-martin-del-potro-roger-federer-naomi-osaka-indian-wells","fields":{"headline":"Juan Martín del Potro beats Roger Federer at Indian Wells for first Masters title","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Juan Martín del Potro rallied from three match points down in the third set and beat top-ranked Roger Federer 6-4, 6-7, 7-6 to win the BNP Paribas Open, handing the world No1 his first loss of the year. Del Potro held a match point at 8-7 in the second-set tiebreaker, but he lost the final three points on his own errors and allowed Federer to force a third set. They were on serve in the third until Federer broke for a 5-4 lead with a backhand winner off del Potro’s serve. Federer had a chance to serve out the match, holding two match points but del Potro staved both off to force deuce and broke to force a deciding tiebreak. In the tiebreaker, Del Potro raced to a 6-1 lead, helped by two Federer double faults. He closed out the win on his third match point when Federer’s forehand failed. “I’m still shaking, I’m so nervous,” said Del Potro after the match. “I was thinking [about missing match points]. I played really well in the [third set] tiebreak ... It’s like a dream after all my problems and surgeries.

In a stark decision, Justice John Griffiths held that these historically significant letters, written at a time that he recognised as “one of the most controversial and tumultuous events in the modern history of the nation”, should remain secret. Although Griffiths noted the “clear public interest in the content of the records”, he found that “the legal issues … do not turn on whether there is a public interest in the records being published”. The court ruled that the palace letters are “personal” and not Commonwealth records and do not come under the Archives Act, which would have required their release after 30 years. Instead, they are to remain closed until at least 2027, with their release even after that date subject to the approval of both the governor general’s official secretary and the Queen’s private secretary. This means that the Queen’s embargo over their release will continue, potentially indefinitely. From a purely common-sense perspective, it is difficult to reconcile the court’s view of the palace letters as “personal” and not Commonwealth records with its description of them as addressing “topics relating to the official duties and responsibilities of the governor general”, as “periodic briefings to the Queen”, and as “reports to the Queen”. The court pointed to the long-standing practice in the United Kingdom that such correspondence is considered “personal”, and that they are “housed in the Royal Archives and access to them is governed by specific agreements”, confirming that the imperial presumption of royal privilege and secrecy still exists in Australia despite our position as an apparently independent constitutional monarchy. Rule Britannia. I took this case in an effort to secure public access to the palace letters because of their undoubted significance to our history, and also to ensure that access to them would be determined by an Australian court according to Australian law and not as a quasi-colonial gift of access by the Queen. A federal court action was the only way to contest what appeared to us to be a perverse designation by the National Archives of letters between the Queen and the governor general as “personal”. Contesting this designation was at the heart of proceedings. Our view, as argued by our legal team led by Antony Whitlam QC, is that the palace letters are Commonwealth records, between the monarch and her representative in Australia, about political matters and at a critical time in our history. They form part of our national historical estate which it is the responsibility of the National Archives of Australia to preserve and provide access to, and in which all Australians should share. The decision to retain the Queen’s embargo over these letters as “personal” is the latest iteration in the highly contested and still evolving history of the dismissal, which has long been cloaked in secrecy, error and even outright deception. The Kerr papers have given up some startling revelations over the last decade which have transformed our knowledge and understanding of the history of the dismissal of the Whitlam government. As Whitlam’s biographer, I spent the best part of a decade working through previously unexamined archival material and in particular Kerr’s papers in the National Archives. It was in those papers that the previously unknown role of Sir Anthony Mason, then a high court justice, was revealed. Mason had secretly met with Kerr over several months, acting as advisor and guide for the governor general, and even drafting a letter of dismissal for him. His involvement remained hidden from the prime minister Gough Whitlam at the time, and from the Australian public and our history for a further 37 years. Kerr’s papers also provided the first glimpse of the palace letters, extracts from some of the letters being among his papers and cited in his handwritten journal, and also of the role of the palace in the dismissal. There can be no doubt then, from what we already know, that the palace letters are extraordinarily important historical documents, as I set out in The Dismissal Dossier – the Palace Connection. Kerr had raised the prospect of dismissing Whitlam as early as September 1975, in a conversation with Prince Charles and subsequently with the Queen’s private secretary, Sir Martin Charteris. The palace agreed that “should this contingency arise” and if Whitlam sought to recall him as governor general, the palace would “try to delay things” in order to protect Kerr’s position as governor general. This constitutionally improper and profoundly disturbing secret communication between the governor general and the palace over his own tenure is one of the still embargoed palace letters, from Charteris to Kerr in early October 1975. That these letters are now to remain secret is deeply disappointing – for our knowledge of the dismissal, for our history and our national independence. The palace letters will now remain embargoed on the instruction of the Queen, an absurd and humiliating situation for any nation. I had hoped that by securing the release of the palace letters, all Australians could finally know the full story of the dismissal of the Whitlam government. While it is a disappointing outcome for our history, and for the right of all Australians to know their own history, this decision will only heighten the enduring questions over just how much the palace knew about the dismissal, and intensify the view that the palace was deeply involved. We are in the remarkable position now that it is the Queen who will determine when, and if, we can see these critical documents in our history. I call on Malcolm Turnbull to make good his promise of three years ago to instruct the Queen to release these letters, although I hold out little hope that our once supreme republican prime minister will do so. The federal court’s decision to maintain the Queen’s embargo over our own historical documents will propel moves towards a republic. The lingering power of what Whitlam termed the “relics of colonialism” can only end when we are an independent nation with an Australian head of state – when we are an Australian republic. • Jenny Hocking’s latest book is The Dismissal Dossier"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2018/apr/30/country-diary-i-call-to-the-boulderers-can-you-spot-me","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-30T04:30:02Z","webTitle":"Country diary: I call to the boulderers 'Can you spot me?'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/apr/30/country-diary-i-call-to-the-boulderers-can-you-spot-me","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/apr/30/country-diary-i-call-to-the-boulderers-can-you-spot-me","fields":{"headline":"Country diary: I call to the boulderers 'Can you spot me?'","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"John Buchan’s hero Richard Hannay crosses my mind as I reach an impasse while walking along the banks of the Eden to Armathwaite crags. A flight of steps descends into Sandy Bay, created from fine-grained sand churned up from the riverbed each flood. Only, while Buchan’s 39 steps descend to sands between white chalk cliffs in Kent, Armathwaite’s stairs are sandwiched between red sandstone precipices. Also, Hannay’s adversaries were international spies; mine are old age and a dodgy hip. The steepness of the narrow steps and the lack of a handrail oblige me to face inwards as I head down toward the shore. I have to let my trekking poles dangle from loops attached around my wrists, so my hands can be free to grab the ancient steps as handholds. Gingerly I descend, lowering one boot at a time. Sometimes a Vibram sole meets thin air. Is there a step missing? I can’t always tell. I become cragfast, unable to go up or down. Across the little amphitheatre three boulderers in snazzy rock shoes, their fingertips white with climbing chalk, are surmounting overhangs and traversing blank-looking walls. They don’t go much higher than 15ft-20ft before heading down again – or even actually baling out, leaping into the sand or on to the shock-absorbing crash mats they have left below. How it all returns! The blissful hours I spent bouldering here in the 1980s, enough to wear away the ridges of my fingerprints. The Forestry Commission has been doing its bit to attract more climbers to Armathwaite. Prompted by the British Mountaineering Council, it has recently been felling trees further along the riverbank because their canopies in summer had been obliterating rock buttresses, leaving them damp and slippery after rain. Today, open once more to any available sun, they are snuff dry. Enough wool-gathering. Tensed leg muscles hurt. “Can you spot me?” I call, climber’s jargon for “Please stand by below!” Arms upraised to buffer any possible fall, the boulderers shepherd me down the remaining steps back to terra firma. A photo shows me looking bashful. Are there 39 steps here too?

Anna Campbell, from Lewes, East Sussex, was volunteering with the US-backed Kurdish Women’s Protection Units (YPJ) – the all-female affiliate army of the People’s Protection Units (YPG) – in the besieged city of Afrin when the convoy she was travelling in was struck by a Turkish missile on 16 March. Sources say the 26-year-old initially travelled to Syria to join the Kurdish struggle against Islamic State, but begged her Kurdish commanders to send her to the Afrin front after Turkey launched a ground and air offensive to oust Kurdish forces from its borderlands in January. “They refused at first, but she was adamant, and even dyed her blonde hair black so as to appear less conspicuous as a westerner,” a YPJ source told the Guardian. “Finally they gave in and let her go.” She is not only the first British woman killed fighting alongside Kurdish forces in Syria, but also the first Briton to die there since Turkey launched its incursion into Kurdish-held territory on 20 January. In a statement to the Guardian on Sunday, YPJ commander and spokesperson Nesrin Abdullah said: “[Campbell’s] martyrdom is a great loss to us because with her international soul, her revolutionary spirit, which demonstrated the power of women, she expressed her will in all her actions … On behalf of the Women’s Defence Units YPJ, we express our deepest condolences to [her] family and we promise to follow the path she took up. We will represent her in the entirety of our struggles.” Her father, Dirk Campbell, described her as a “beautiful and loving daughter” who “would go to any lengths to create the world that she believed in”.“Anna was very idealistic, very serious, very wholehearted and wanted to create a better world. She wasn’t fighting when she died, she was engaged in a defensive action against the Turkish incursion.” In recent months Turkey has shifted its focus from fighting Isis in Syria to preventing the YPG from establishing a foothold along its border, arguing that the YPG is linked to its own insurgent group, the Kurdistan Workers’ party (PKK). The US, EU and Britain, however, do not consider the YPG a terrorist group, which it has supported in its fight against Isis since 2014. Dirk Campbell said his daughter had dedicated her life to the fight against “unjust power and privilege”. He said she was a committed human rights and environmental campaigner who would “put herself on the line for what she believed in”. “It seems a small thing, but I remember when she was 11, she protected a bumblebee from being tormented by other kids at school,” he recalled. “She did it with such strength of will that they ridiculed her. But she didn’t care. She was absolutely single-minded when it came to what she believed in, and she believed what Turkey is doing is wrong.” He said his daughter’s passion for campaigning was inspired by her mother, Adrienne, who was well-known on the south of England’s activism scene and died of breast cancer five years ago. “Anna was a credit to her mum, my wife, and was carrying on a lot of the kind of work that she was doing,” he added. Campbell told her father of her plans to travel to northern Syria last May after she heard about the grassroots feminist and socialist revolution that has swept Rojava (the semi-autonomous Kurdish region of northern Syria and heartland of the YPG/J) and inspired the Kurds’ fight against Isis. “I didn’t try to stop her,” Mr Campbell said. “Because I knew, once she had decided to do something, she was unstoppable. That’s why she went to Rojava: to help build a world of equality and democracy where everyone has a right to representation. When she told me she was going I joked: ‘It’s been nice knowing you.’ I just knew it might be the last time I’d see her.” Upon arrival in Rojava, Campbell completed the YPJ’s mandatory month-long military training course, in which new recruits learn basic Kurdish, weaponry and battlefield tactics on top of a crash course in the egalitarian and feminist ideology of the YPG/J, and was assigned to an infantry division, comprising a mix of Kurdish and international fighters. There she was given the nom-de-guerre Helîn Qerecox and sent to the front. YPJ sources said she spent her first months in the country fighting in Deir ez-Zor, Isis’s last major stronghold and scene of the jihadist group’s bitter last stand. But with Isis now on the brink of defeat, foreign fighters within Kurdish ranks have faced a choice: return home or remain in Syria to help the YPG repel Turkey’s attack. “After the initial attacks on Afrin, comrade Helîn insisted on joining the operation to defend Afrin,” said Abdullah. “Before leaving, she had already received her military training, and, although we wanted to protect her and did not agree with her decision … she incessantly insisted on her wish to leave for Afrin. She even gave us a condition: ‘Either I will go home and abandon the life as a revolutionary or you send me to Afrin. But I would never leave the revolution, so I will go to Afrin’.” She added: “For us, as the YPJ, comrade Helîn will always be a symbol as a pioneering internationalist woman. We will live up to her hope and beliefs. We will forever pursue her aim to struggle for women, for oppressed communities.” Mark Campbell, activist and co-chair of the Kurdistan Solidarity Campaign, added: “Anna, by all accounts, was taken deep into the heart of the Kurdish people as she stood side by side with them in their darkest hour. Our thoughts and condolences are with Anna’s family and friends as this time.” Campbell is believed to be the eighth British citizen killed while serving with Kurdish forces in Syria."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/blog/2018/mar/18/chelsea-morata-antonio-conte","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-18T20:25:53Z","webTitle":"Chelsea’s Morata tries to run his way into Antonio Conte’s good books | Barney Ronay","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2018/mar/18/chelsea-morata-antonio-conte","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/blog/2018/mar/18/chelsea-morata-antonio-conte","fields":{"headline":"Chelsea’s Morata tries to run his way into Antonio Conte’s good books","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Antonio, Antonio. And still, just about, Antonio. Never mind the tide of snark on social media, or the sense of death that attaches itself to the endgame of every Chelsea manager; the travelling fans still sing Antonio Conte’s name with the same protective affection as they did from the start at the King Power Stadium. Chelsea kept their season alive here, edging past Leicester City into the FA Cup semi-finals. But this was also a victory studded with a sense of what might have been in another, happier second Conte season. Most obviously there was a scoring return to the Chelsea attack for Álvaro Morata, in a week when Conte had adopted the fashionable posture of wronged superstar manager, the coach whose only failings are the failings of others, betrayed by the workaday qualities of the human clay at his disposal. Conte has suggested his players overachieved in winning the title last year, credit naturally to his own transformative powers. But even Prospero has a limit to his magic and the suggestion is that Conte clearly was under-backed by his generals. It is a position that sits uncomfortably with the addition this year of a £60m centre-forward who has been left to limp along as an ill-fitting part through the difficult days since Christmas. Morata came to the King Power Stadium having played 42 minutes of football this month and having failed to score since Boxing Day. Conte can moan about his players being beneath his attentions but this is still a high-grade £60m centre‑forward, a player Conte has now been involved in signing twice, in a team that has played to his weaknesses and dwelt on his flaws. Not so much here, though. Instead for an hour Morata provided a gathering sense of life at the point of the Chelsea attack, on the kind of night where the wind scrapes the face like a blunt razor blade and when even the idea of spring, of sun and warmth, seems almost inconceivable. The reservations about Morata’s style have centred on his preference for scooting on to through-passes, finding clever angles, rather than holding the ball with his back to goal. It is a tribute to Diego Costa’s all-round bile-ridden craft that he offered both options in the same grizzled package. Could Conte have worked at this with Chelsea’s record signing, dredged a little more from him or even adapted his attacking plans? Apparently not. Easier simply to whinge and bridle, to linger on the flaws in his squad, the impossible black holes. Before kick-off the former Real Madrid and Juventus man had been introduced to the crowd, a little vaguely as “Alvaro Marato”. But he ran eagerly from the start, even if there were some early clanks and groans. Midway through the first half Morata was left writhing on the floor after a lunge by Wes Morgan that applied the full weight of that sack of gravel masquerading as a right thigh to Morata’s big toe. He did not stop, though. Like a rusty racing bicycle easing through the first few revolutions of its wheels, chain clicking, brake blocks hissing, Morata did start to find space, looking ever more menacing as Chelsea held the ball or found space for a cross. The goal was coming. It arrived on 42 minutes, made by Willian, such a wonderful surging presence in the last month. Easing away from a knot of Leicester players in midfield, Willian looked up and threaded in his centre-forward with exactly the right kind of pass, a pass that might have been wrapped with a ribbon and decorated with “Álvaro” in blue frosted icing. Morata seized on it like a starving man, hared in on goal and finished with a beautifully easy shift of his body, slipping the ball nicely past Kasper Schmeichel’s left hand. And suddenly he looked confident, shark-like, romping about with a sense of menace. In part this was a function of Chelsea having so much more possession in the first half, a 60-40 split that removed the need to fight and haggle and scrap for the ball, and freed Morata to make those little runs off the centre-backs. Leicester found some encouragement as Chelsea slackened. Riyad Mahrez had been particularly disappointing, even his fetching lop-sided canary yellow pie crust hairstyle seeming to droop as the second half wore on. But he began to find his passing range and Jamie Vardy sniped in to grab an equaliser. Pedro headed the winner in extra time. And a minute later Morata left the pitch having run hard and shown at times a real gloss of class in his touch and movement. Indeed, to watch him here was to wonder again why his time at Chelsea has been so disappointing since a fine scoring performance against Atlético Madrid in September. Conte offered faint praise for his “strength” afterwards and this was an admirable return in many ways."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/mar/19/morning-mail-facebook-under-pressure-over-data-breach-claims","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-18T20:01:07Z","webTitle":"Morning mail: Facebook under pressure over data breach claims","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/mar/19/morning-mail-facebook-under-pressure-over-data-breach-claims","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/mar/19/morning-mail-facebook-under-pressure-over-data-breach-claims","fields":{"headline":"Morning mail: Facebook under pressure over data breach claims","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Good morning, this is Eleanor Ainge Roy bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Monday 19 March. Top stories Facebook and the analytics company that worked with Donald Trump’s election team are coming under mounting pressure, with calls for investigations and hearings to explain a vast data breach that affected tens of millions of people. Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House intelligence committee, called for the company to be “thoroughly investigated” and said Facebook must answer questions about how it came to provide private user information to an academic with links to Russia. In Britain, the head of the parliamentary committee investigating fake news accused both companies of misleading MPs, while the Conservative MP Damian Collins said he would call the heads of both companies, Alexander Nix and Mark Zuckerberg, to give testimony. No one can pretend Facebook is just harmless fun any more, writes Ellie Mae O’Hagan, while Olivia Solon says the breach will make Facebook and other social media companies even more secretive. Cambridge Analytica – owned by Robert Mercer and formerly headed by the sometime Trump adviser Steve Bannon – was suspended pending further information by Facebook on Friday amid allegations it gathered personal details from more than 50 million users without their consent. The whistleblower, Christopher Wylie, 28, who worked with an academic at Cambridge University to obtain the data, explained how it was used to build a software program to predict and influence voters’ choices. The Berejiklian government has made changes to the leadership of the department whose responsibilities include water policy, after scandals over the administration of water in NSW. The government has announced that the head of the Department of Industry, Simon Smith, will be replaced by Simon Draper, from today. The department, which reports to Niall Blair, is responsible for the portfolios of primary industries and water, as well as industry policy. The change follows a torrid eight months for Blair and his bureaucrats after ABC’s Four Corners revealed allegations of water theft in the Barwon-Darling river system. Donald Trump has cast doubt on memos of conversations between him and the fired FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe that have reportedly been handed to the special counsel Robert Mueller. Trump said McCabe did not take notes during their meetings, causing speculation that the president is preparing to fire Mueller in an attempt to shut down the Russia investigation. “I don’t believe he made memos except to help his own agenda, probably at a later date. Same with lying James Comey. Can we call them Fake Memos?” Trump tweeted on Sunday. McCabe was fired on Friday, two days short of qualifying for his pension. Aung San Suu Kyi has reportedly addressed Myanmar’s ongoing Rohingya crisis at a closed-door meeting of south-east Asian leaders, asking for help from Australia and Asean nations with humanitarian relief. At a meeting of leaders at the Australia-Asean summit in Sydney, she addressed the issue “comprehensively [and] at some considerable length”, the Malcolm Turnbull said. “Aung San Suu Kyi ... seeks support from Asean and other nations to provide help from a humanitarian and capacity-building point of view. Everyone seeks to end the suffering.” More than 650,000 of the Rohingya ethnic and religious minority have fled Myanmar for Bangladesh since August, fleeing violence by the country’s military, including murder, rape and the torching of villages. The UN has said the persecution “bears all the hallmarks of genocide” but Myanmar has denied the allegations. The Liberal National party MP George Christensen has attacked his own government for funding abortion services in Australia and around the world. The federal member for Dawson was joined by the incoming Queensland senator Amanda Stoker yesterday as they addressed hundreds of anti-abortionists at a rally outside parliament in Brisbane. Christensen said he had been filled with shame when he learned that the federal Coalition gave $9.5m to an international planned parenthood agency that he claimed made money from terminations. He said he would write to the treasurer to urge him to divert funding from an international planned parenthood agency to pregnancy, crisis and counselling services for young Australian mothers.

Many progressives feel conflicted about Donald Trump’s protectionist trade policies. After all, isn’t he just opposing business-friendly trade deals (including the TPP and Nafta) which labour, social and environmental advocates have opposed for years? So-called free trade deals have always skewed towards allowing large private corporations to do business unfettered in any market, and some of the clauses involved – such as investor-state dispute settlement panels – are an affront to democracy.

There can be no disputing that the runaway grand slam winners, Ireland, are the European side best placed to succeed at the Rugby World Cup next year. And the other inescapable conclusion? Unless England absorb the harsh lessons of their worst finish in 31 years, the chances of them prospering in Japan are on a par with Eddie Jones holidaying in Wales in the near future. The gap in alertness and execution between green and white over the past two months has been almost painful to behold. Rory Best’s side were the most organised and intelligent of champions, precision engineered by the razor-sharp Joe Schmidt. England? Those English fans still clinging to the fast fading memories of 2016 and 2017 need to accept the opposition have not just caught up with Jones’s squad but, in several respects, overtaken them. Where to start? Despite Jonny May’s late try on Saturday, England amassed only 10 points more over the course of their five games than Italy, who did not have the luxury of facing themselves. Never before in the professional era have they had a leaner campaign; not even at their lowest ebb at the 2015 World Cup did they look so collectively wooden. Those still admiring the emperor’s new clothes would be better advised to ask how many previous World Cups have been won by the fifth-best side in Europe. No wonder Sir Clive Woodward feels England are now “staring down the barrel” and “in a big hole” with a three-Test summer series looming against a South Africa team under purposeful new management and looking to recall a number of foreign-based stars. Jones is perfectly entitled to talk about “sticking to the process” and insist that “every champion team has a run like this” but it will be a difficult script to maintain should England go down 3-0 against the Springboks in June. “I think we’re moving forward, I know that’s hard to see,” Jones insisted on Saturday night. He must have an unbelievably powerful microscope. If only the solution was simply about launching an urgent quest for fresh personnel. While the injured Billy Vunipola and Jack Nowell would both make a ball-carrying difference, Jones has already rotated his resources to little avail. His supposedly game-changing selections in the front and back rows failed to pay off on Saturday, dropping George Ford delivered no improvement in midfield fluency and England’s ability to finish strongly becomes irrelevant if they troop in 21-5 down at half-time. All of which leaves Jones virtually back where he started two years ago. His players apparently recorded excellent GPS readings in training last week but no amount of gym prowess can mask the relative shortage of natural leaders, the steady deterioration in attacking fluency, the mushrooming penalty counts or the leaden body language. Turning wine into water is not Jones’s normal party trick but he does now need to consider whether the full-on nature of his regime should be dialled back to reflect his players’ already heavy workloads. It cannot be a total coincidence that Ireland, Wales and Scotland, most of whose players operate in the Pro 14, fill the top three places in the final Six Nations table while the national teams of France and England buckle beneath the relentless demands of their respective domestic club leagues. The good news for England’s weary infantry is that they should be sharper next season, having finally shaken off the lingering effects of last summer’s Lions tour. There is one snag: exactly the same will apply to Ireland and Wales, who both host England in the 2019 championship. Had it not been for a dodgy TMO decision and brilliant last-ditch cover tackle last month, Wales, too, might well have cracked Twickenham. Much can still change before the World Cup but, if Ireland’s half-back totems Johnny Sexton and Conor Murray stay fit, Sean O’Brien, Robbie Henshaw and Josh van der Flier make satisfying returns from injury and Jacob Stockdale and Garry Ringrose keep improving, even New Zealand will struggle to escape Dublin unscathed this November. England’s captain, Dylan Hartley, remains resolute – “Other teams are getting better and we’ve got to do the same” – but even he admitted to being struck by Ireland’s cool, calm and clinical demeanour. At least England’s effort levels never wavered and Elliot Daly’s brace of tries further underlined his world-class value. But to see Tadgh Furlong deliver an inch-perfect pass to Bundee Akee to set up CJ Stander’s artfully constructed first-half score – Schmidt remembered a similar set play working against England in 2015 and dusted it down for the big occasion – was to glimpse a visiting team operating at a level above their opponents in terms of control and sophistication. When Stockdale broke the individual record for the most tries in a Six Nations season, assisted by Jones’s curious eve‑of‑game request for the in‑goal areas to be extended, it was in effect game over by half-time. Ireland richly deserve their holy grail, only their third grand slam after 1948 and 2009, and their own winning run now stands at a record 12 Tests. England, for their part, have not lost three successive Six Nations games since 2006, a sequence which prefaced the dismissal of Andy Robinson as head coach that autumn.

The little-known Retrievers didn’t merely defeat the Cavaliers, the top overall seed in the field who had lost only twice all season and won the Atlantic Coast Conference by four games before running the table in the conference tournament. They emerged from a half-time stalemate to break Virginia’s spirit during a second half that never felt close down the stretch, picking their teeth with a national-best defense that had surrendered an average of 53 points all season. Final score: No16 UMBC 74, No1 Virginia 54. You read that correctly. The same UMBC who lost to Albany by 44 points less than two months ago, that finished second to Vermont in the America East and needed a last-second three-pointer in the conference tournament final to punch their first NCAA ticket in more than a decade, won by 20 points over college basketball’s best team and made a mockery of the pundits both armchair and professional. No16 seeds had played 135 first-round games against No1s entering Friday night’s contest and lost all of them by an average margin of nearly 25 points. There had been a few close calls down the years. Princeton famously came within one point of beating top-seeded Georgetown in 1989. One year later Murray State took Michigan State to overtime before fading. Western Carolina had two shots in the final seconds to topple Purdue in 1996, twice missing their chance at history. But the blowouts far outnumbered the near misses. None had even come within single digits of the holy grail since Arizona’s nine-point win over Weber State in 2014. Until Friday. Surely there have been more consequential upsets in NCAA tournament lore: North Carolina State’s buzzer-beating stunner over Houston’s Phi Slama Jama in 1983 and Villanova’s epochal triumph over Georgetown in 1985 were both in national championship games and became archetypes of the modern-day March Madness mythos as it ballooned into the mainstream spectacle that today generates nearly $1bn in TV money. Louisiana State (1986), George Mason (2006) and VCU (2011) were each No11 seeds who scored Elite Eight upsets over No1s to complete improbable runs to the Final Four. Florida Gulf Coast, one of a few No15 seeds to knock off a No2, delivered a stirring encore against San Diego State to crash the Sweet 16. All UMBC won on Friday was a second-round date with Kansas State on Sunday. But there was something about No16 over No1, one of the last things in sports that had never, ever happened, that took on a mythology of its own and made natural fodder barroom debates: the sort of psychic blockade once associated with the four-minute mile and the sound barrier. One day it could happen, we told ourselves year after year, even as it felt less and less likely with each passing tournament. Now it finally has. And it couldn’t have come at a better time for college basketball, which has played out the season amid a spreading FBI probe into widespread bribery, fraud and cheating at the highest echelons of the sport that’s already ensnared dozens of top programs, prompting the NCAA to launch an independent investigation led by former US secretary of state Condoleezza Rice. Yet for one night the essential purity of the knockout format managed to overshadow the problems mounting at the gates, putting a fine point on why the NCAA tournament endures as one of America’s most valued sporting traditions: Throw together 68 teams in a one-and-done format and there’s no telling what will happen. Unlike football where the big guy will beat the little guy 10 times out of 10, basketball is a sport where one untimely injury, one whistle-happy referee or one hot hand can leave a heavily favored top seed scratching for its life. The better team doesn’t always win. On Friday night, the hot hand belonged to UMBC’s Jairus Lyles, who poured in a game-high 28 points on 9-for-11 shooting and etched his name alongside the long roll of previously anonymous heroes who vanish from American life as quickly as they appeared, but whose cameos endure in our sporting consciousness: Arceneaux and Lewullis, Pittsnogle and Farokhmanesh, McFadden and Blizzard. There’s no sensible reason a college basketball tournament should hold a nation of 320m souls in its thrall for three weeks every year, but it doesn’t take long to discover there’s very little that makes sense about March Madness. It’s right there in the name. It’s an event that showcases a unique cross-section of America, from urban centers to outlying areas that go unrepresented by professional sports teams, brought together under one tent like no other event in sports. The whole enterprise points directly into the mainline of why people watch sports: they’re unpredictable. And never more than on Friday night in Charlotte."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/mar/18/fitbit-ace-fat-shaming-toy-children-impressionable-young-minds","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-18T06:00:10Z","webTitle":"Is a fat-shaming toy fit for impressionable young minds? | Barbara Ellen","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/18/fitbit-ace-fat-shaming-toy-children-impressionable-young-minds","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/18/fitbit-ace-fat-shaming-toy-children-impressionable-young-minds","fields":{"headline":"Is a fat-shaming toy fit for impressionable young minds?","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"A new Fitbit wristband called Fitbit Ace has been launched for children over eight. It will feature “reminders” for them to get active, undertake family step-challenges and also monitor sleep patterns. Thankfully, the calorie-counting device found on normal Fitbits has been disabled, but is that enough? Bearing in mind the UK’s child obesity problem – according to figures from NHS Direct, a third of children between two and 15 are overweight or obese – some people may feel that the Fitbit Ace could only be a boon. However, that’s debatable. Children are already bombarded with harmful messages about body image. Overweight kids are teased. Normal-sized girls feel that they should be on strict diets. Even young boys are succumbing to anorexia. Do children need what amounts to a “fat-shaming toy”? While many teenagers have owned Fitbits, the difference was that they were officially perceived as adult products, set apart from the child’s world. Now there’s this designated child-fitness “toy” pumping out information that’s arguably too complex for a young mind to properly process. While the Fitbit Ace is monitoring physical progress, who is monitoring the child’s reactions and emotions? After all, motivating children to get fit is just one important aspect; another would be stopping them from going too far with what may feel like a new playground craze. What may seem like a harmless motivational gimmick could lead an immature mind into disturbing, obsessive behaviour. Orthorexia (the type of anorexia that masks itself as a health and fitness obsession) is a very real issue that should not be encouraged in anybody, never mind children. The good news is that there are already devices widely available to encourage most children to be healthier and fitter – they’re called parents. • Barbara Ellen is an Observer columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/mar/17/batman-byelection-labor-declares-victory-for-ged-kearney","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-17T10:38:55Z","webTitle":"Batman byelection: Labor's Ged Kearney defeats Greens' Alex Bhathal","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/mar/17/batman-byelection-labor-declares-victory-for-ged-kearney","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/mar/17/batman-byelection-labor-declares-victory-for-ged-kearney","fields":{"headline":"Batman byelection: Labor's Ged Kearney defeats Greens' Alex Bhathal","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Labor has declared victory in the Batman byelection for the former Australian Council of Trade Union president Ged Kearney. “Oh, they said we’d never do it, but we did,” Kearney told an ecstatic crowd at the Labor post-election event in Thornbury. “I want the people of Batman to know that I have listened, that Bill Shorten has listened, and we are going to take everything you have said to Canberra.” The federal opposition leader, Bill Shorten, said Labor would not take the win for granted. “Tonight I want to make a promise to all of the voters of Batman, the ones who voted for Labor and the ones who voted for other candidates ... that Labor hears the lesson and the message of Batman,” he said. “I promise that we do not treat this election campaign as a triumph and an end in itself, but as another step in the way to giving Australians the sort of government they want with the policies that make a difference to everyday Australians.” A 1.4% swing to Labor saw Kearney leading 52.2% to 47.8% in two-party-preferred terms about 9.30pm, with about 57% of the vote counted. Kearney was also leading the primary vote with 42.4% to the Greens candidate Alex Bhathal’s 40.8%. About 30% of the vote is through pre-poll or postal votes and yet to be counted. Bhathal congratulated Kearney in her concession speech, saying it had been “an honour” to contest the seat against her. “Obviously its not the result all of us would have wanted,” Bhathal said. She said it was a “difficult night”, but added: “I’ve always said regardless of the result we would have a strong woman member from a caring profession.” Kearney in turn thanked Bhathal for a “hard-fought campaign.” Kearney is the first woman ever elected to Batman in its 112-year history and brings the proportion of women in the federal Labor caucus to 48%. The win is a significant victory for Labor, which has held the seat, vacated by the resignation of David Feeney over citizenship issues, for 80 years. Labor only retained the seat in 2016 owing to preferences from the Liberal party, which did not run a candidate in the byelection and held it on a margin of just over 1%. It came despite Labor announcing a controversial new tax policy to axe cash dividend imputation credits, which Labor volunteers told Guardian Australia had caused a significant number of anxious calls from asset-rich, cash-poor retirees in the final days of the Batman campaign. Labor volunteers erupted into cheers and chants of “Ged! Ged! Ged! Ged” when the ABC election analyst Antony Green declared a likely Labor victory, and began handing out party poppers in anticipation of Kearney’s arrival. Earlier, the Greens MP Adam Bandt, who worked alongside Bhathal throught the 34-day campaign, said a low voter turnout could have affected the vote. Bandt was handing out how-to-vote cards in Clifton Hill in the southernmost tip of the electorate and said the queues had been much lower than at the 2016 election campaign. He told the Greens election night party at the Preston brewpub Tallboy and Moose that the result would either be known within a few hours, or not for several weeks. Unfortunately for the Greens, the first prediction proved true. Greens members remained optimistic as results trickling from the Australian Electoral Commission began to show a swing toward the Labor party. “It’s so close,” volunteer Cassie Hadson told Guardian Australia. “I think we if we lose now we will still have a good swing and that will put us in a better position at the next election.” It’s unclear whether Bhathal, who was on her sixth attempt to win the seat, will stand again. She was first preselected in 2001. Speaking outside the Thornbury pre-poll station on Friday, she said she “can’t really make any predictions” about whether she would run again, citing the party’s grassroots preselection process. “I know that I’ll still be living in my street in South Preston, I’lll still be a social workers and I’ll be an active community worker regardless,” she said. Bhathal was on the verge of branching out into private practice when Feeney resigned but put the move on hold to contest the byelection. The Greens campaign was dogged by sniping and infighting, which culminated in the leaking of a confidential report on a bullying complaint against Bhathal to the media last week. The infighting began with criticism of Bhathal for backing the state Greens MP Lidia Thorpe for preselection at the Northcote byelection in November over the previous candidate, and Darebin City councillor, Trent McCarthy. Bhathal has played down the impact those reports had on her campaign but it was a frequent topic of conversation at the Greens election party, with one volunteer showing photos of damage to a Bhathal poster in her front yard that she attributed to an “anti-Alex Green”. One long-term Greens watcher said a loss in Batman would be an “open wound”, caused by some members of the party “willing themselves to lose”. The Stop Adani campaign, which has been campaigning heavily in the progressive seat in an attempt to wedge Labor into withdrawing support for the Queensland coalmine, has raised concerns that a Labor win in Batman rewards the party for equivocating on the project."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/live/2018/mar/17/south-australian-election-plus-batman-byelection-results-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-17T12:15:09Z","webTitle":"Liberals triumph in South Australian election – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2018/mar/17/south-australian-election-plus-batman-byelection-results-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/live/2018/mar/17/south-australian-election-plus-batman-byelection-results-live","fields":{"headline":"Liberals triumph in South Australian election – as it happened","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"So for the first time since 1997, Nick Xenophon does not have a seat in an Australian parliament. That is going to bring about its own change in South Australian politics. As well as his federal team. Keep an eye on that one. Ged Kearney has signalled pretty strongly that Labor is taking its Batman lessons federally. Bill Shorten was in wholehearted agreement. So watch that space as well. And Malcolm Turnbull just got another state on board with his national energy guarantee, plus another friendly face at Coag meetings. The Liberals will be looking at the SA result for its wider implications … but I don’t know if you can take it as part of a wider trend towards the Liberals. But they will be taking note of Steven Marshall’s very early call that he would not be dealing with SA Best, which you could say played the role of One Nation in this election, and what that meant for a more concrete result, as well as the poor performance of Cory Bernardi’s party in his home state. And, finally, the Greens have their own lessons to examine from the Batman loss and what it means for the party moving forwards. From what I am hearing (and it is very early mail) the Greens have some tough decisions to make about the party’s direction, and not just in Victoria. All in all, tonight’s elections have set off a ripple effect for Australia’s political parties, as the country gears up for the next federal election. We have a Senate-only sitting week next week, which we will be covering, live, before the entire parliament is back, with Ged Kearney, on 26 March. (Oh, and the Liberal party retained Cottesloe in the WA byelection) Thank you to the Guardian Australia team for helping drag me across the line tonight, and for you, for reading and playing along, with my feverish blogging. I will be back with you with Politics Live on Monday. But in the mean time, enjoy what is left of your weekend, maintain the rage, and spend at least some time logged off. We’ll be sure to catch you up on anything you miss. Night! Let’s take another look at the seats that are still in play in South Australia. The Liberal party is leading in 25 seats, four of these seats by relatively slim majorities: Adelaide by 316 votes (1.4%) King by 401 votes (1.2%) Newland by 298 votes (0.9%) Heysen by 792 votes (2.7%) Even if SA Best catches up in Heysen, it’s also possible Nick Xenophon’s party will fall into third and the Liberal party will win easily over Labor. The Liberals need to stay in the lead in three out of these four seats to form a majority, and they are in a good position to do so. But their position isn’t quite as certain as they looked earlier, or as the parties are treating the situation. They are also trailing in the seat of Mawson by 232 votes (1.6%). He finishes with this: It’s been way too long between drinks for the Liberal party in South Australia. Now, we have been given a wonderful opportunity by the people of South Australia. I thank the people of South Australia. We specifically asked them to give us a majority government because we know that a majority government will be able to drive the reform agenda that we so desperately need here in South Australia. I thank the people ofSouth Australia for doing that and I absolutely guarantee, I give you my commitment, that I and every single person in the team will be working diligently every day over the next four years so that we can build a brighter future, a better future for South Australia and I genuinely support and appreciate everybody’s support. Thank you very much. And he walks off to the same track he walked in on, The Man. Which has lyrics like this: Errrrr – it sounds as though Steven Marshall has just thanked John Howard ahead of Malcolm Turnbull. After the last election, he offered to help me in any way he could. The counsel that he provided was invaluable. He came and spoke to our party room. He really has been a great prime minister for Australia, but, personally, I have always found him to be just such a great contributor, not judging but always encouraging and I will be very grateful. I thank the prime minister for coming to [South] Australia, Julie Bishop for coming to South Australia and supporting us in our campaign to take back government. The last time we took government from Labor in South Australia was 25 years ago. “Jay rang to give his congratulations to the Liberal team, I would like to thank Jay for his call, to his service to this state as premier for six years, look, it is a tough job but I am really looking forward to it,” Steven Marshall says. A massive thank you to the people of South Australia who have put their trust, their faith in me and the Liberal team for a new dawn, a new dawn for South Australia! And to the strains of the Killers’ The Man, Steven Marshall takes the stage. Not the most humble of tracks. Bill Shorten and Ged Kearney have claimed victory in Batman in two rousing speeches, frequently interrupted by the crowd interrupting into chant or song. Shorten promised voters that Labor would not take victory in Batman to mean that they could ignore the demands of progressive voters or those who had turned away from Labor: Tonight I want to make a promise to all of the voters of Batman, the ones who voted for Labor and the ones who voted for other candidates ... that Labor hears the lesson and the message of Batman. Shorten said he knew many voters were “disillusioned with politics as usual”. Tonight in this venue we celebrate a victory for Labor, but beyond this room into the lounge rooms of Batman more broadly in Australia, I promise that we do not treat this election campaign as a triumph and an end in itself, but as another step in the way to giving Australians the sort of government they want with the policies that make a difference to everyday Australians. Kearney, speaking over chants of “Ged! Ged! Ged!”, said: “Oh, they said we’d never do it. But we did.” She thanked Alex Bhathal for a “hard-fought campaign”, then addressed the voters of Batman: I want the people of Batman to know that I have listened, that Bill Shorten has listened, and we are going to take everything you have said to Canberra. Kearney is the first woman elected to the seat of Batman in its 110-year history, and brings the proportion of women in the federal Labor caucus to 48%. Walking in to his election party, the SA Liberal leader, Steven Marshall, told the ABC his plan was to “make a speech and then start partying”. Calla Wahlquist will have more for you in just a moment but as a taster from Ged Kearney’s speech: Ooh, they said we’d never do it, but we did. Bill has already said it all, our future PM, I might add … but what I just want to say is this is a victory for true Labor values. Because, our campaign spoke to everyone from the ring road to the river. We spoke to local issues … and we spoke to national progressive values. Workers’ rights, climate change, social justice and a better Australia. Kearney also thanked Alex Bhathal for a “hard-fought campaign”. We’ll bring you some of Ged’s speech as soon as we can. Jay Weatherill: I suppose the other thing that as I’ve got another role, it’s leader of the Labor party. And this great party, and all of its supporters, has sustained me and our government throughout the whole of this period, this 16-year period. It’s the strength of the Labor party and the Labor movement more generally. That’s allowed us to continue to really replicate these Labor governments, it’s also the reason why we remain strong now. As we leave government, we leave government united, strong and with a real sense of purpose. So ensure that all of you keep your heads high, because you have absolutely nothing to be ashamed of in a loss, losses occur. And what we always were seeking to do was to fight to win, we never at any stage in this process sought to save the furniture or sought to somehow just limit the loss, we were always fighting for victory. And we’ll return to that quest at some stage in the future. That was, you have to say, a very warm and gracious concession speech. A true class act. About a quarter of votes for the SA Legislative Council have now been counted. The Liberal party leads with 31.5%, down from 36% in 2014. Labor’s vote has dropped from 31% to 30%. This would give each party at least three seats, with both parties in with a good shot of winning a fourth seat. SA Best is on 19%, which would give them two seats with an outside chance of a third. This compares with 12% for the Nick Xenophon-endorsed team in 2014. The Greens vote has dropped from 6.5% to 5.6%. This amounts to about two-thirds of a quota. Cory Bernardi’s Australian Conservatives are on 3.5%, compared with 4.4% for their predecessor Family First in 2014. This is less than half of a quota. The Dignity party, which is running the sitting MLC Kelly Vincent, has doubled its vote from 0.9% to 1.9%, but that won’t be enough to win a seat. On these numbers, which could change, you’d expect to see four Liberals, four Labor, two SA Best and one Green. This would mean that Dignity’s Kelly Vincent and Conservatives’ Robert Brokenshire would both lose their seats to SA Best’s Connie Bonaros and Frank Pangallo. This would give a total result of eight Labor, eight Liberal, two SA Best, two Greens, one Conservative and one seat for independent John Darley, a former Xenophon ally. Weatherill said he had called the Liberal leader, Steven Marshall, to concede not so long ago, and, well, I’ll let him tell you: I called Steven Marshall and conceded that he had won this state election. Now, I’m so sorry that we couldn’t bring home another one to you. But I passed on to Steven Marshall my congratulations from our party, on his personal achievement, and also the achievement of his candidates, in winning their seats, and forming a government for the state of South Australia. It’s an enormous privilege to be premier of South Australia. And I wished him all the best on his endeavours to really take that role and make it his own role. One of the things we both agree on is this is a great state and he has all of our support to take on this most important role. South Australia’s Labor leader, Jay Weatherill, has taken to the stage in Adelaide to concede defeat after 16 years of ALP rule: I am sorry I could not bring home another victory, but I do feel like one of those horses who has won four Melbourne Cups and I think the handicap has caught up to us on this occasion. “Friends, I want to thank in particular though, our outstanding candidate Ged Kearney.” The crowd chants “Ged, Ged, Ged” as Shorten goes on to thank the Labor campaign director, and various Labor peeps, and then asks for a moment’s reflection to “thank the people of Batman”. And tonight I want to make a promise to all of the voters of Batman, the ones who voted for Labor and the ones that voted for other candidates, I want to make this promise, that Labor hears the message and lesson of Batman … Many voters are disillusioned with politics as usual … they have a sense that the system is not working for ordinary people. The cheers loud and the smiles are broad as the Labor faithful welcome Ged Kearney to the stage as the incoming MP for Batman. I haven’t seen Bill Shorten look this happy since Kristina Keneally lost Bennelong. He raises Kearney’s hand high and the crowd goes wild. “Friends, I said in 2016 that Labor was back, I can now say in 2017 that Labor is back in Batman. (Except it is 2018.) “From the bookmakers to the commentators they wrote Labor off in Batman, but you have proved them wrong – thank you!” Oh look - turns out quotas work. Jay Weatherill looks almost ready to address his election party, where he will be conceding the night to the Liberals. For a quick recap of the night in Batman, head here. A few of you have pointed out this tweet from earlier in the day. So, does the opposite also prove true, or … The Liberal party soiree has just greeted the call of the election for their team with a huge roar. Here at the Hackney hotel in the leafy inner east of Adelaide, the atmosphere is of course considerably more lively than at the SA Best HQ. After winning the popular vote at three of the past four elections, only to remain in opposition for 16 years, even the most confident Liberals harboured doubts that tonight would be their night. Most candidates are still at their local events but will be pouring in shortly. The federal senator David Fawcett told Guardian Australia: “You could feel it over the final couple of weeks, there was a real mood for change and with the of scrutiny SA Best, people saw they weren’t the saviour, therefore it had to be us.” Christopher Pyne says the SA result is part of a wider trend towards the Liberal party, pointing to its win in Tasmania as well (Queensland would be the outlier there, given that Labor was returned with a majority). But Pyne tells Sky that elections are decided “on the economy” which is why he believes Malcolm Turnbull will win the next election. That might be a little too simplistic. There was a swing against the Liberals in Bennelong (on the primary vote) and there has been a swing against the Liberals in South Australia (on the primary vote). South Australia had the same party in power for 16 years and saw some pretty big boundary changes. Tasmania is always a crap shoot and Turnbull is coming up to his 30th Newspoll loss in a row. The longtime Greens candidate Alex Bhathal has given a gracious concession speech, congratulating Ged Kearney on her win, and saying: “I’ve always said regardless of the result we would have a strong woman member from a caring profession.” Bhathal said the result was “obviously” not what the Greens wanted but said it had been an “honour” to run against Kearney. According to Ben Eltham, who is at the Greens event, Bhathal thanked her campaign team, the Greens leader, Richard Di Natale, Adam Bandt, Janet Rice, the state MP Lidia Thorpe, and the parents of Thornbury primary school, saying: “I know this has been a difficult night.” Kearney and Bhathal have been cordial throughout the campaign, admitting to being similar candidates: professional, progressive women who have very similar personal political opinions. The difference has been their party policies. Commentators have already put the blame for the unexpected Greens loss on toxic infighting but Di Natale reportedly told the crowd it was due to Labor doing a preference deal with rightwing parties. Both Labor and the Greens preferenced each other over other parties, and Kearney is leading on primary votes. The last time the Liberals held a majority government in South Australia, Paul Keating was prime minister. We are now waiting on Ged Kearney to address her party in Batman. We’ve received results from the first pre-poll booth. It’s come from the Labor heartland of Bundoora at the northern end of the seat. The Greens gained swings in both election-day booths in Bundoora, but has gone backwards by 2.7% in Bundoora’s pre-poll booth. This is a small booth, but it seems clear that the Greens will not pick up the vote they need in the pre-poll, which confirms that Labor’s Ged Kearney will win the Batman byelection. We don’t know precisely how many votes are yet to report in Batman, but my rough count suggests the Greens would need at least 57% of the remaining votes to win. That’s not going to happen. There are a lot of very disappointed faces at the Greens party, not counting Alex Bhathal and Richard Di Natale’s. Given what we saw come out internally within the Greens during the byelection (with a pretty big fight between an increasingly factionally divided party) and the fight over what the Greens should be standing for, expect to see more fallout over the next couple of months, and not just in Victoria. Di Natale just predicted Bhathal would come back and win Batman (or whatever it is renamed) at the next federal election, but I wouldn’t be so sure about that. Ged Kearney was chosen for a reason. Labor has also just proven its taxation policies are not the election poison, as has been predicted, and has earmarked inequality as the foundation of its campaign heading into the next election – which has already begun. Bhathal has now lost Batman six times. Some readers may be confused about how the Liberal party is on track for a majority despite pretty much no seats changing hands. This is because the recent electoral redistribution radically redraw the map to turn a number of Labor seats into notional Liberal seats. The Liberal party managed a majority of the statewide two-party-preferred vote in 2010 and 2014, winning 53% in 2014, but couldn’t manage to form government at either election. South Australian law required the electoral commission to draw boundaries which would give a majority of seats to a party who has won a majority of the two-party-preferred vote. The commission threw up its hands after the 2010 election and insisted it couldn’t achieve this outcome, but did do so after the 2014 election. It looks as though the Liberal party has mostly won those redrawn seats, without winning much more. Adam Bandt has taken the stage at Alex Bhathal’s party and says preferences went against the Greens. But he is claiming victory in making climate change an issue across Australia. The party leader, Richard Di Natale, said it was a very “tight-run race” but “because of all the preferences of all the hard-right parties … that we are just going to fall short tonight”. So for the first time in 16 years, South Australia will have a new government, with the Liberals all but having claimed victory. Christopher Pyne is having a VERY good night –a not only has Steven Marshall got across the line, but Cory Bernardi’s Australian Conservatives have not had the showing that they may have expected to have, with SA Best taking AC’s portion of the vote. The Liberal party will form a majority government in South Australia. Ben Raue is ready to call it: We have been waiting for votes from Liberal leader Steven Marshall’s seat, and we’ve now received these, confirming his re-election, with votes firming up in some other close races. The current count has the Liberal party on 25 seats, Labor on 18, independents on three, with Heysen remaining in doubt. The most interesting seat in South Australia right now is in Heysen. Right now the Liberal party’s Josh Teague leads SA Best’s John Illingworth with 51.8% after preferences. The ABC computer suggests this is enough for SA Best to squeak into the lead once the remaining booths report. But it assumes SA Best stay in the top two. SA Best is on 24% of the primary vote, with Labor on 19% and the Greens on 12.5%. The Greens recommended preferences to Labor. If their votes tend to favour Labor, that could well see Labor’s candidate overtake Illingworth, at which point SA Best preferences would presumably help the Liberal party to win the seat. Unless the Liberal party gains ground on SA Best in the remaining booths, we definitely won’t be able to call this seat until those Greens preferences are distributed. The Liberal party looks like having 23 seats in South Australia, winning three seats from Labor (Colton, King and Mawson), which, if that count holds, means they just need one more to win government in their own right for the first time in 16 years. Fun fact: this is the first election that the Liberals have used the i360 system, which, in its most basic form, allows for targeted campaigning. It’s a system which takes information people give, through surveys and what not, and then builds a targeted response – what exactly will win that person’s vote? The Liberals have been a little behind in using technology, but it looks as though that is changing. Seriously, the next federal election is going to be INSANE. At SA Best function at Palace Nova in Adelaide, the mood was getting grim with results below expectations among the crowd watching the ABC News results come in. A groan that greeted projections that Nick Xenophon would lose in Hartley turned into a cheer as the man himself walked in. A subdued, tired-looking Xenophon declared that SA Best had broken the two-party duopoly by coming second in a range of seats, highlighting Joe Hill’s performance in Finnis and a potential victory in Heysen. There were some pantomime boos at mention of the underhanded tactics by the major parties and the pokies lobby. The biggest cheer came when Xenophon said it wasn’t over in Hartley, urging everyone to wait for the preferences to come in (even though Labor, the Liberals, the Greens and the Australian Conservatives have all preferenced against him). He concluded with a promise to “make the parliament a work horse not a rocking horse”, and a movie suggestion: “Not sure if you all want to watch something other than the election. Maybe Winston Churchill, Our Darkest Hour?” It looks as though the Turnbull government is about to get another state on board for its national energy guarantee (remember that?). From Ben Raue: The Liberal party is getting closer to winning a majority in South Australia. By my count, they are on 22 seats, with Labor trailing on 18 seats. The Liberal party are still competing with Labor in Adelaide and Waite, and with SA Best in Heysen. We have on data from the marginal Liberal seat of Dunstan. If they can hold the other seats they are leading, and win two of these four, they’ll hold a majority. The Greens have not conceded as yet but Labor is confident enough to declare Ged Kearney as the winner of the Batman byelection contest. And the party tells me, it looks like doing it with a slight swing to it to boot. And from my feverish, tea-stained throne, this is also what I am hearing: We now have all but two election-day booths reporting results in Batman and the swing to Labor has blown out to 1.7%. We are still waiting for up to 30,000 pre-poll and postal votes, with Labor leading by about 3,000 votes. The Greens would need about 55% of the remaining votes, which would be quite remarkable. I’m not calling Batman for Labor quite yet but we’re getting close. Nick Xenophon has not conceded but he has admitted he is not having the night he thought he would be having when he announced his campaign: This is, this is not the beginning of the end, it’s actually the end of the beginning. Because I think we’re going to see some very interesting things happening. We’ll have a presence in the state parliament and we’ll build on that presence and build on it, so that every day, for the next four years, we’ll hold the government, the next government of South Australia, to account. We’ll hold the opposition to account, we’ll make the parliament a work house, not the rocking horse it is now. Let’s wait and see what happens. It will be a long night. We won’t have an idea for three or four days as to what is happening. It could be some issues about some of the misleading material put out by the major parties and the hotels association. My final remarks to you is thank you to the bottom of your heart, to the campaign team, to all the candidates who did a very brave thing. It takes a lot of courage to run for parliament and it’s been pretty nerve-wracking for a lot of people, pretty daunting. But every one of the candidates I ran with did SA Best proud and did the state proud for the way they conducted themselves. The South Australian result is looking fairly dismal for SA Best at the moment. By my quick count, I have the Liberals on 19 seats, Labor on 17 seats, three independents, and Labor and Liberal still competing for five close seats (with no data from two other marginal seats). SA Best only appears to have a good shot at winning a single seat – the Adelaide Hills district of Heysen, in the heart of the federal seat of Mayo. It has come in the top two in quite a few seats but in most of them it is not polling enough to have a chance of winning. It is sitting on just under 15% of the statewide vote right now. SA Best’s leader, Nick Xenophon, is sitting on a primary vote of 26% in Hartley. That’s about 15 percentage points behind the Liberal MP, Vincent Tarzia. He’s only managing 42% of the vote after preferences. Unless there is a dramatic shift in the remaining booths, Xenophon will be without a seat at the end of the night. I’m listening to a lot of commentary, and it might be the fact that I am still slightly feverish, but I’m a little shocked at the number of people pointing out that the primary vote for the major parties in the South Australian election looks like being fairly low. If anyone has been paying attention to politics at any time in the last few years, a low primary vote for the majors is nothing new. The Liberals primary vote is traditionally higher than Labor’s but even that has been dropping. Because, and I know this probably shouldn’t be the newsflash it seems to be, people are sort of sick of politics. And so they lodge their votes with the third-party choices. Which we are seeing growing. And the biggest problem the Liberals will have moving forwards is there seems to be more third-party choices emerging among its voters, cannibalising its vote, then there is on the Labor side of the political fence. And the biggest issue for both major parties there is those preference flows can go anywhere. One Nation, SA Best and to a lesser extent, Australian Conservative voters do not follow how-to-vote cards. There is a trend towards voters changing how they view elections. But the political parties still seem a little behind that -– it is going to be a very interesting time ahead of us. “It has been quite an election campaign,” Nick Xenophon tells his party, acknowledging that the results “have been mixed”. “We have come second in a whole swag of seats … so that is a pretty good foundation to build on,” he says, adding: “This has been an incredible campaign, when you consider we did this on a shoestring, when you consider the major parties spent more time fighting SA Best [than each other].” He also mentions the campaign the hotels industry ran against his party in “a brutal and bruising campaign”. The swing to Labor is now up over 1% in Batman, which would double their margin in the seat from 1% to 2%. Labor has gained a swing of almost 11% in the Northcote South booth in the Greens’ heartland. The Greens polled about 66% after preferences at this booth in 2016 but this has dropped to about 55%. There are a bunch of quite strong swings to the Greens at the northern end of the seat, gaining 5.1% in Kingsbury and 4.6% in Burbank. But these booths are being outweighed by a lot of small swings to Labor in the centre of the seat and some whacking big swings to Labor at the southern end. The longtime Labor strategist Bruce Hawker just told the Sky News panel he is sitting on that “obviously, they are not going to win” in relation to Labor’s chances in South Australia. He thinks it is an “extraordinary result” though, that Labor has held on to some core seats, given the Queensland experience in 2012 (which he has intimate knowledge of) which saw the party there wiped out to just seven seats after 14 years in power. Take from that what you will. Christopher Pyne is counting 22 seats for the Liberals – you need 24 to win in SA. He is basing his count on what his people are reporting from the vote. Red-clad volunteers at the event at Thornbury theatre erupted into cheers at the ABC election analyst Antony Green’s prediction of a Labor win. They are now handing out party poppers in anticipation of Ged Kearney’s arrival, which is expected imminently. Everyone here sees it as a solid Labor victory, despite nearly 30% of the vote being in pre-poll or postal. Labor’s social media team is on it in South Australia. #prayforCalla At least three independents look set to retain their seats in South Australia (not including any SA Best candidates). The sitting independent Geoff Brock looks set to win a third full term in Frome. The Liberal-turned-independent Troy Bell has a substantial lead in Mount Gambier, while the ex-Labor MP Frances Bedford has a substantial lead in Florey. The larger the crossbench, the more likely we will end up with a hung parliament, so these results improve the chances we won’t see a clear result. Antony Green is predicting a Labor win in Batman (50% of the vote has been counted and Labor is ahead). Ben Raue is still crunching the Batman numbers: Twenty-eight booths have reported two-candidate-preferred votes in Batman and the vote is ticking up slowly for Labor. Their swing is now 0.69%. I’ve divided up polling booths into three areas: the centre, north and south. The swing to Labor in the south is running at just over 5%, with a swing of 2.6% in the centre. Meanwhile the Greens vote is up 2.5% in the north. On the issue of postal votes, Stephen Murray, who really enjoys this kind of thing (and thank goodness he does) crunched the numbers a little earlier: Our intrepid Melbourne reporter Calla Wahlquist has headed over to Ged Kearney’s party. There are a lot of seats in South Australia yet to be called (some are too close, others just don’t have any data), but it is clear that SA Best won’t be challenging the major parties across a vast swathe of seats. SA Best is only competing in a handful of seats so far, with Labor and Liberal retaining a substantial number of their safer seats. The best prospect for SA Best will be to win a handful of crossbench seats. This outcome has become obvious over the last few weeks but it’s worth stating that the actual results confirm this prediction. In Hartley, the Liberals are still ahead on 40%, (Vincent Tarzia is the incumbent) and Nick Xenophon is on 25%. Labor’s candidate, Grace Portolesi, looks like coming second though, if the Greens preferences flow through to her, meaning Tarzia would hold on. At the SA Best party function at Palace Nova cinemas in the Adelaide city centre, a few dozen campaign volunteers are watching Nick Xenophon being interviewed by ABC News on the big screen. There’s plenty of grumbling about the questions – the campaign extras feel the media haven’t been fair on their leading man over the past few weeks and are worried this will torpedo their chances. All the volunteers who spoke to Guardian Australia had joined the SA Best campaign because they’d been personally helped at some point by Xenophon, from a nurse at the aged-care facility at the centre of the Oakden abuse scandal to someone who’d been helped in a family matter. A typical example is the Kanmantoo labourer Bryan Cunnington, watching the silver screen with a Coopers pale ale in hand and wearing a luminous orange “Grab a stick and stick it up em” shirt (he also has a spare one in white). Cunnington been volunteering with Xenophon since the 2007 federal Senate run, because the candidate had helped him find a job when he was unemployed. “I like Nick because he’s sensible, and working for the people, not the 1%” he says. With 169 of South Australia’s 701 booths counted, Labor looks like having won 11 seats, the Liberal party looks like claiming 12 and the crossbench is looking at one seat. But that is a very early count. The overall Batman result isn’t shifting. Labor is leading but not by enough to call the seat. But there have been been some remarkable results. Labor polled over 60% after preferences in Bundoora South in 2016. The result is a perfect tie this year – 513 votes each. That’s a swing of 10.3%. Speaking to Sky, Adam Bandt said he was hearing “a lot of people were caught on the hop and caught out of state”, with turnout an issue for the Greens (as it is for Labor) . He now says “all going well” this will be the last time he speaks as the only Greens lower house MP. Word from the Greens: the party is “still optimistic”. Word from Labor party: it’s “cautiously optimistic”. At this stage, Antony Green’s computer is predicting a Labor win, with a slight swing. Twenty booths have reported preference distributions in Batman and the trend is clear. Labor is up just slightly (the swing is now 0.4%) while defending a 1% margin. Labor appears to be gaining ground in the centre and south of the seat while losing ground in the north, suggesting an equalisation of support across the seat. This may suggest that Labor’s Kearney has done a good job at regaining support from the Greens in the south (although the Greens will likely still win a majority there) while the Greens have been effective at building support in the suburban north. And from the party: It is an absolute heart stopper/cliffhanger/nailbiter in Melbourne. Right now Ged Kearney is pulling ahead of Alex Bhatal – fascinatingly Kearney is doing well in the south of the electorate, which is Greens heartland, and comparatively less well in the north, particularly Reservoir. Labor will be daring to dream right now but we’ve still got a fair whack of the Northcote vote to come. Two days ago I reported that Labor’s private polling had the contest absolutely neck and neck. Looks like they were right. You would have to say that one of the biggest things in Labor’s favour in batman is David Feeney is no longer the candidate. Ged Kearney may have some of the *celebrity* candidate about her, but she also has a proven track record with core Labor values. It is still too early to call but, at this stage, Labor has a fighting chance to hold the seat Antony Green is warning us he does not expect to call the South Australian election early tonight. Batman is coming in faster than South Australia at the moment, where just under 2% of the vote has been counted. In Melbourne, Ben Raue tells us: There’s been a few more very good results for Labor in the south of Batman. They are up 7.9% after preferences in Clifton Hill, 4.7% in Collingwood North and 3.6% in Westgarth – all medium-sized southern booths in the Greens heartland. Overall the Labor swing after preferences is sitting on 0.7%. Greens volunteers and members at Tallboy and Moose, the hipster pub where Alex Bhathal is holding her election party, are nervously refreshing the AEC website on their phones and sharing photos of vandalised campaign signs, which have been variously attributed to Labor or to “anti-Alex Greens”. One Greens watcher tells me there will be “a reckoning” within the party if Bhathal is elected to clamp down on dissenting voices. They say there has almost been a “willingness to lose” among some Greens. Bhathal herself has been dropped off at home after campaigning past 6pm (I have been told it took some effort to usher her into a car) and will not turn up here until the result is known. For those looking for the results as they come in, you will find Batman here and South Australia here. Quick jump to international politics, because this is important: Labor tells us they are happy with what is happening in the southern part of the seat. But this is a very fast-moving beast. We don’t have much in from South Australia (hence the focus on Batman) but there are a few marginal Liberal seats where Labor is doing quite well and could be on track to gain seats, including: Adelaide – Labor up 5% with 3.9% counted Waite – Labor up almost 10% with 1.7% counted This would be enough of a swing for Labor to win Adelaide and would leave Waite as a virtual tie. Just for the record, the Liberals have said they would not govern with SA Best in the event of a hung parliament. Labor got across the line in the last state election in 2014 with the support of a couple of independents but we have seen boundary redistributions since then. The ALP has not ruled out working with the crossbench to stay in government, but you have to ask (and I say this as a Queenslander who saw Labor win an election it really should have lost and then get wiped out at the following election) would you want to? Silly question, I know. We have six booths reporting preferences now. Labor has dropped by over 4% in Reservoir but are gaining small swings in the five other booths. The overall swing to the Greens sits at 0.55%, short of what they need to win. The trend in those booths doesn’t look good for the Greens but the swings to Labor aren’t big enough to close the door. Speaking to Sky News, Nick Xenophon said he was trying to “defy political gravity” by running in Hartley, but “that is where I live” so that is where he wanted to run. As for what will happen if SA Best wins seats but he fails in his own bid? Don’t write me off just yet, but I will be around to be a mentor, supporter to those who are elected, if I don’t get across the line, but at this stage, I am not conceding anything. He said he was hoping for a handful of seats in the lower house and between two and four in the upper house. With 14.6% of the vote counted, Antony Green’s computer is predicting a Labor win in Batman, but the man himself stresses this will continue to go back and forth for a while. Or, as the expert Ben Raue tells us: The primary vote figures from Batman are all over the place, with Labor gaining a much bigger primary vote swing in the southern booths of Alphington North and Collingwood North. We will have to wait for the preferences to be distributed to know more. So it is very close in Batman at this stage. We are still waiting on results from South Australia but so far in the Melbourne byelection there has been a swing to the Greens in the north and swings to Labor in the south. This is getting interesting. Those booths are starting to pile in for Batman. So we now have five booths reporting primary votes in Batman, and three booths reporting two-candidate-preferred votes. Labor’s vote after preferences has dropped 4.4% in Reservoir, and gone up 1.6% in Reservoir West, and has gone up 1.8% in the small booth of Murray in the centre of the seat. Overall this translates into a swing of 0.88% to the Greens. The Greens need a swing of 1.03%, so it’s extremely close. Adam Bandt has taken the stage at Alex Bhathal’s party. Calla Wahlquist is there. We’ve now got the first three booths in Batman, including two large booths in the northern suburb of Reservoir (a stronger area for Labor). There’s a swing of 11% to the Greens in Reservoir, and a swing of 5.8% in Reservoir West. Labor dropped 3% in Reservoir, and gained 5% in Reservoir West. Far too early to say anything but it suggests the Greens can gain ground in the north. We’ll need to wait for the two-candidate-preferred figures to know more. This translates into an overall swing of 8.9% to the Greens and 2.2% to Labor. Australia’s preferential voting system is always most interesting when there are three candidates with a chance – the order of elimination becomes important, with the third-placed candidate’s preference proving crucial. An SA Best vote of 16% to 17% (predicted by last night’s polls) would likely see them break into the top two in a handful of seats, at which point it becomes crucial as to how the third-placed party is recommending its preferences. Labor is recommending preferences to SA Best ahead of the Liberal party in 18 seats, and the reverse in 17 other seats, and is offering both options in Nick Xenophon’s seat of Hartley. The Liberal party is offering two different tickets in Hartley, but is preferencing SA Best ahead of Labor in every other seat. We are starting to get some very early results in for Batman as well. As the South Australian votes start to roll in, let’s take the time to throw back to one of the more … well, it sort of defies description … moments of the campaign – Nick Xenophon’s election ad. The Australian Conservation Foundation has released some final exit polling for Batman, which found that Adani – or at least stopping the Queensland coalmine – was a major issue for voters. The sample size was 230 people, which is a small sample, even for a byelection, but it does point to one of the issues Labor has been faced with this campaign and will face at the next federal election. The ACF polling found 74% of voters opposed the mine, while 56% were influenced in their vote by the issue. “You can’t stand up for something unless you are having a fight about something,” says Christopher Pyne on Sky, explaining why Jay Weatherill was so combative against Canberra. Polls are officially closed in both of the elections we are covering tonight. It is still too early for results, but they should start coming though soon. In the meantime, hit us with your predictions – send them through to @amyremeikis while we wait for the comment section to open (it is coming, I promise) and I’ll include some in the blog. This is almost certainly the last time we’ll be paying attention to voting in a seat named Batman. The electorate, named after John Batman, looks likely to be renamed in the upcoming Victorian redistribution, with draft recommendations due in the next few weeks. Most submissions have supported a proposed name change, with most proposals suggesting naming the seat after Simon Wonga, a 19th century Wurundjeri elder. Labor has admitted it has an uphill battle to win Batman–despite having held the seat since it was created in 1949. From inside the Labor tent, we are told that Labor “struggles” in areas where the median house price is over $750,000. Batman has seen a lot of housing price growth over the last couple of decades – you’d be lucky to get much change from $750,000 in most Batman suburbs these days. And that low voter turnout we were talking about is another issue for Labor, and the Liberals making the decision to not run a candidate in the byelection has also made things more difficult, because that is just more people not turning out out to vote. And preferences could be important here. There has been a real “teal” trend in inner suburbs popping up across the nation, particularly the east coast, where traditional Liberal voters are turning to the Greens because of environmental concerns. That could lead to the Australian Conservatives, who are running a candidate, seeing their preferences head to the Greens. I know it bucks traditional thinking but we saw it in Queensland and are seeing it more and more as the demographics in inner-city seats change. During the 2016 general election, Labor saw Liberal preferences flow to it. But where there was no Liberal candidate, like in Northcote in the state byelection, Labor reports the Greens won the preference flow. In the last decade Labor reports its vote in Batman has dropped, while the Greens have nearly doubled their vote over the same period. All in all, Labor is not confident. But it looks as though Labor isn’t the only party worried about voter turnout in Batman: The polls have closed for the Batman byelection and Alex Bhathal’s election-night party, at Preston brewpub with terrible acoustics and ferns hanging from the ceiling, is starting to fill up. Volunteers in green shirts are being strategically arranged behind television journalists preparing to do live crosses and, as I write, another cameraman, who I assume belongs to the Greens, is steadily filming me. This is how the magic happens, people. Labor folk are gathering about 700 metres down the road, in Thornbury. The party is suggesting there has been a low voter turnout in the southern half of the electorate, which would spell bad news for the Greens. The bulk of their vote comes from south of the Bell Street divide. Early exit polls conducted by Lonergan Research commissioned by environmental groups tend to disagree, but the last few years have taught us not to rely overmuch on the accuracy of exit polls. Volunteers at Thornbury primary school, where both Bhathal’s children and those of the state Greens MP Lidia Thorpe, who won the Northcote byelection in November, attend. They say it has been a mixed day. The only one with great success at winning over taciturn voters is Peachy the dog. We are a few minutes out from the polls closing in the South Australian election and it is still looking too close to call: Speaking to Sky, Christopher Pyne said he expects Labor to hold on to Batman. Labor’s Amanda Rishworth said she thinks it is going to come down to voter turnout. Byelections traditionally have lower turnout than general elections, because, really, who can be bothered (I’m just stating the general ennui surrounding byelections, not making a personal comment). Especially in a byelection which won’t change the government. One of the questions which tripped Nick Xenophon up towards the end of the South Australian campaign was who would lead SA Best if he fell short in Hartley. He didn’t have an answer. He was also asked how he would pay for the regional infrastructure he promised, a question he answered by pointing to cutting from the biggest government departments. Which, as in most states, are health and education. So that didn’t go down overly well. The Electoral Commission of South Australia has just listed a $25,000 donation to the Liberals made on 8 March from Rudy Gomez’s Cartwheel Resources, the company that wants to build a mine “twice as big as Olympic Dam” at Lake Gairdner national park. This would be the donation amount both parties refused to specify in this story. As we already knew, Gomez donated $50,000 to Nick Xenophon’s SA Best campaign and is thoroughly fed up with dealing with Labor’s project approval process. While we’re on donations, the SA branch of the Australian Hotels Association has poured more money into its bid to stop Xenophon’s election, donating a furthter $10,000 to Labor and even chucking $5,000 the way of Advance SA, the party made up of breakways from Xenophon’s political movement. Meanwhile, in Adelaide, before the close of polls: Nick Xenophon is likely to lose in Hartley but SA Best could pick up one of two seats. The Liberals think they are on track to get 25 or 26 seats. Remember Labor needs a positive swing of 3% to stand still. My feedback from Labor folks who have been handing out in Batman today is turnout is down in the south of the electorate, which is the Greens stronghold within the boundaries. This might be good news from their perspective, or it might just mean a number of people have already voted – we’ll have to wait and see. In the north of the electorate, there has been some blowback today from Macedonian voters still angry that the ALP distributed campaign materials in Greek. One of the big questions in this byelection has been what will Liberals do, given that the Liberals attracted 20% of the vote in the 2016 federal election and the party is not running a candidate in this contest. If the battle between Labor and the Greens is tight, what the Liberals do will make a material difference to the outcome. Do they vote, or do they stay at home? The feedback from polling places is Liberal voters are out and seeking out the Australian Conservatives candidate. Buckle in. Welcome to a night of politics. Not only do we have South Australia deciding the most unpredictable election in recent memory, we also have the good burghers of Batman deciding whether Adam Bandt gets some company on the Greens side of the lower house crossbench. Both campaigns have been fraught, full of drama and, at least from what the people are telling us, coming down to the wire. But this is Australian politics, where nothing is certain. Nick Xenophon has bet his political future on being a state powerbroker, but SA Best, his rebranded party, fumbled in the last few weeks of the campaign and Xenophon himself is no certainty to win the seat of Hartley. Labor have been in power for 16 years, which has been one of the strongest cornerstones of the Liberals’ campaign, as Steven Marshall argued it was beyond time for a change. Meanwhile, Jay Weatherill has been talking up all of Labor’s successes, including its shift to renewable power sources. Will it be enough? We’ll find out soon enough. Outside of South Australia, Melbourne has seen the battle of the left, as the Greens and Labor slug it out for the seat of Batman, left vacant by David Feeney’s misplacement of dual citizenship papers. Ged Kearney’s and Alex Bhathal’s campaign for the seat has almost been the sideshow to party infighting and policy disputes. The polls tell us the Greens are on track for a historic win. There is not long to go to see if those polls are correct. So join us as we indulge in what looks set to be a night of political upsets. Which is basically like political Christmas to us political livers. Katharine Murphy is watching all the events and we have Calla Wahlquist, Ben Raue and Max Opray in the field. Comments will be turned on from 7pm, but you can find me on Twitter in the meantime – @amyremeikis. Grab your drink of choice, settle in and get ready with the refresh button – polls are about to close."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/mar/17/flights-cancelled-as-mini-beast-threatens-10cm-of-snow-in-south","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-17T15:30:02Z","webTitle":"Blizzard conditions expected to disrupt travel across UK","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/17/flights-cancelled-as-mini-beast-threatens-10cm-of-snow-in-south","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/mar/17/flights-cancelled-as-mini-beast-threatens-10cm-of-snow-in-south","fields":{"headline":"Blizzard conditions expected to disrupt travel across UK","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Blizzard conditions that could cause havoc on the roads have been forecast by the Met Office for Saturday night and Sunday morning. Yellow and amber ice and snow warnings are in effect for many parts of the UK as the “mini-beast from the east” brings more snow showers and freezing temperatures. “Travel delays on roads are likely, stranding some vehicles and passengers. Some delays and cancellations to rail and air travel are likely,” the Met Office said. Traffic on the M25 was disrupted after a serious accident on Saturday afternoon between junctions 17 and 18 anticlockwise in Hertfordshire. Police stopped clockwise traffic to allow the air ambulance to land and take off. A crash also closed the westbound junction of the M4 in Wiltshire between junctions 14 and 15, Highways England said. Snow covered large parts of eastern England and Scotland overnight, and temperatures dipped as low as -5C. “It will be bitterly cold with some snow for many places over the weekend,” said Alex Burkhill, a Met Office meteorologist. “There are some very strong winds, meaning it could feel as low as -7C or -8C for some people.” By the end of Saturday, most places will have seen some snow, with the potential for up to 25cm falling on higher ground in the south-west on Sunday. More than 100 flights were cancelled at Heathrow airport on Saturday in anticipation of the snow and ice, and Highways England advised motorists to avoid transpennine roads. The Met Office issued amber weather warnings for snow in London, south-east England, Yorkshire and the Midlands for Saturday and Sunday, with lesser yellow warnings in place for most of central and eastern England and Scotland. “The best way to describe this is as a real return to wintry conditions,” said Mark Wilson, another Met Office meteorologist. “‘Bitterly cold’ is the best way to describe it – temperatures on the face of it probably just around freezing, but with wind it’s going to feel well below freezing.” The warnings state that travel disruption is possible, rural communities could become cut off, vehicles may be stranded, and power cuts may occur. The cold weather is expected to last until Tuesday, when temperatures will return to their seasonal norms. Richard Leonard, Highways England’s head of road safety, said: “Our gritter drivers will be out treating our roads around the clock, but it is still important to drive to the conditions when snow is forecast. “Make sure you keep your distance and reduce your speed if you need to travel because, even in conditions that seem normal and when the snow is not settling, it can be slippery if ice patches have formed or where fresh salt has not been worked into the carriageway.” Most cancellations at Heathrow were on short-haul flights, but British Airways said some transatlantic flights were affected. Lufthansa, Aer Lingus, TAP Air Portugal and KLM also made cancellations."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/blog/2018/mar/18/football-pierre-ndaye-mulamba-zaire-1974-world-cup","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-18T19:33:04Z","webTitle":"Mulamba is living like a pauper 44 years after Zaire red-card farce | Paul Doyle","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2018/mar/18/football-pierre-ndaye-mulamba-zaire-1974-world-cup","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/blog/2018/mar/18/football-pierre-ndaye-mulamba-zaire-1974-world-cup","fields":{"headline":"Ndaye Mulamba is living like a pauper 44 years after Zaire red-card farce","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Poor and wheelchair-bound, Ndaye Mulamba has just been told he faces eviction from his rented home in Kinshasa, 44 years after he was ejected from the World Cup for kicking a referee up the backside. Mulamba is nearly 70 and that may be a surprise if the last time you heard mention of him was when a minute’s silence was held in his honour before a match at the 1998 Africa Cup of Nations, when the players of the Democratic Republic of Congo and Burkina Faso marked his “death” in an accident at an Angolan diamond mine. That turned out to be a case of mistaken identity. Mulamba has never even been to Angola. Nor has he ever kicked a referee up the backside but that was the offence for which he was sent off at the 1974 World Cup, when the career of Mulamba and his Zaire team-mates lurched from glory to tragic farce. Tragedy has stalked glory throughout his life. The red card was also a case of mistaken identity. Mulamba was shown it when his team were 4-0 down to Yugoslavia, who went on to win 9-0. In the 23rd minute the referee, Omar Delgado of Colombia, was scolding a Zaire player for a foul when he felt a boot up his derrière. He turned round and sent off Mulamba, whose bewilderment greatly amused commentators who did not realise that the referee had got the wrong man and interpreted his perplexity as further evidence of the naivety of the first team from sub-Saharan Africa to reach the World Cup. By the next day’s newspapers it was the referee who was being ridiculed. But Fifa backed its man and banned Mulamba for a year. The real culprit was Mwepu Ilunga. Yes, the same man who would earn lasting notoriety in Zaire’s next match when he rushed out of a defensive wall and whacked the ball downfield so that Brazil could not take a free-kick. People still laugh at that now. Ilunga broke the rules deliberately to protest against authorities who were not just depriving him and his fellow Leopards of their livelihoods, but also threatening their lives. The Leopards of Zaire had travelled to West Germany as national heroes and African champions. Earlier in 1974 they had swaggered to victory in the Africa Cup of Nations, with Mulamba scoring nine goals in the tournament, a record that still stands. His goalscoring feats had already earned him a slew of nicknames, such as Volvo and Mustang – because of his speed – but most commonly Mutumbula, after a deadly nocturnal spirit reputed to inflict misery on those he visited. One local newspaper even dubbed him Hitler (“because of his destructive power”) after he scored six goals in a cup match. That tag didn’t stick. The squad were presented with brand new Volkswagen Passats after their Nations Cup triumph but never saw the win bonuses they had been promised. Bonuses were their only income, none of them earning wages from playing. Nor did they get their bonuses for reaching the World Cup. Which is why the mood grew mutinous during the tournament. They performed quite well in their first match, a 2-0 defeat by Scotland. After that they were assured that a sports ministry envoy was on the way with their overdue bonuses. The cash never showed up. The team talk before the Yugoslavia game was given not by their manager, the former Yugoslavia goalkeeper Blagoje Vidinic, but by an emissary of Zaire’s president Mobutu Sese Seko. “We have reason to believe that the Yugoslav authorities persuaded the coach to reveal your game plan so we have decided to put him in isolation and make some changes,” said the emissary, as recalled by Mulamba in Claire Raynaud’s book La Mort M’Attendra. So now the regime was not only refusing to pay the players but in effect sabotaging their performances. Well, two could play that game. Mobutu warned after the Yugoslavia match that that if they lost by more than three goals against Brazil, there would be hell to pay. They lost 3-0. When they returned home the Leopards were held captive in the presidential palace for four days while their fate was decided. Eventually they were allowed to rejoin their families. Mulamba played for the Kinshasa side AS Vita until he was 38 and then made ends meet with small coaching gigs. In 1994 the Confederation of African Football honoured him for the record he set 20 years previously, inviting him to a ceremony in Tunis where he was presented with a medal. A cigarette company paid for his suit for the event. He returned proud, happy to have been remembered. A few days later four masked men in military uniforms broke into his home and demanded the medal, plus money. The commotion awoke Mulamba’s nine-year-old son, Tridon, who ran in to help. A soldier hit the child with a rifle butt, killing him. Mulamba was shot twice in a left leg, marched out, beaten up and thrown off a bridge. He spent eight months in hospital before being transferred to South Africa for further care. He stayed there, living penniless in a township, for years. Now he is back in Kinshasa. “Physically he is frail but he still has the mentality of a champion,” says Alain Makengo, a football-loving lawyer who several years ago began lobbying for Mulamba and his former team-mates to be given support that would allow them to spend their twilight years in dignity. “They brought such joy and honour to the country and inspired so many young people that it is terrible to see some of them in such precarious situations,” says Makengo, who succeeded in getting the Congolese government to pay the players a stipend. Mulamba’s equates to around £175 per month. His rent costs slightly less than that. “If he pays it, how does he eat?” asks Makengo."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/mar/17/how-two-third-party-insurgencies-pulled-up-short-in-australias-super-saturday","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-17T12:39:58Z","webTitle":"How two third-party insurgencies pulled up short in Australia's super Saturday | Katharine Murphy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/mar/17/how-two-third-party-insurgencies-pulled-up-short-in-australias-super-saturday","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/mar/17/how-two-third-party-insurgencies-pulled-up-short-in-australias-super-saturday","fields":{"headline":"How two third-party insurgencies pulled up short in Australia's super Saturday","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"As political victories go, Labor’s win in the seat of Batman on Saturday night will go down as one of the standouts of recent times. On paper the byelection was the Greens’ to lose. The party fielded a well-known candidate who has stood at several previous elections. Batman was a stronghold in terms of ground game infrastructure and resources, boasting the biggest local branch in the country. The Greens had been gaining on Labor in every federal election since 2004 and almost claimed the seat in 2016. But Labor held the seat on Saturday night, winning on primary votes and on preference flows, and recording positive swings in the south of the electorate in suburbs regarded as having already crossed over to the Greens. Labor is constantly grappling with the challenge of speaking to its two constituencies – the post-materialist swinging progressive voters who defect to the Greens on moral triggers, and its core constituency of working people. Ged Kearney – unlike her accident-prone predecessor, David Feeney – proved herself a fusion candidate capable of speaking to both constituencies, boosted by a powerful bloc of institutional support and a volunteer army blasting wind in her sails. Saturday night’s contest demonstrates that the right candidate and the right campaign messages can make a big difference in inner-city contests where Labor is sandbagging against a political insurgency from the left. It demonstrates that the inevitability of the rise of the Greens based on demographic change in inner-urban Australia perhaps isn’t entirely inevitable. There was turbulence in the closing week of the campaign for Labor, with a stuff-up in campaign materials that caused deep offence in the Macedonian community, and after Bill Shorten’s announcement that Labor would end cash rebates for excess imputation credits for individuals and superannuation funds – a development that had local strategists fearing a backlash. While the messages in public from key Labor figures about the party’s prospects in Batman were always cautious, party research indicated the party had a strong chance of holding the seat during the final week – those stuff-ups notwithstanding – although it suggested the result would go down to the wire. Labor holding Batman is a boost for Shorten, who had braced for the worst, and a blow for the Greens and their party leader, Richard Di Natale. Implicitly referencing inevitable internal bloodletting after factional infighting put a drag on the Batman campaign, the Greens candidate, Alex Bhathal, said on Saturday night, more in hope than in certainty, that she wished that the party would “be kind to ourselves and each other” in the wake of the loss. Frankly, that seems unlikely. So what’s the main wash-up of super Saturday? There were two electoral contests in Australia on Saturday night where a third party attempted to go toe to toe with a party of government and, despite registering a healthy protest vote – a trend that certainly can’t be ignored by major-party politics – both insurgencies pulled up short. Nick Xenophon in South Australia struggled to convince voters he had a coherent platform in a genuine three-way fight, and the Greens in Batman ran a campaign heavily reliant on negative messaging against Labor, which proved something of a drag when progressive voters would prefer a centre-left government to a conservative one. Kearney attempted to channel that momentum for Labor in her victory speech. She thanked the people of Batman for breaking her way, and she promised she would faithfully represent their interests in Canberra. “This is a victory for true Labor values,” Kearney told her true believers. “Labor is on its way to a Shorten Labor government.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/mar/17/lead-petrol-more-deadly-than-we-thought-brexit-bring-it-back","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-17T19:00:42Z","webTitle":"Lead is even deadlier than we feared, but Brexit could put it back in our petrol | Geoffrey Lean","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/17/lead-petrol-more-deadly-than-we-thought-brexit-bring-it-back","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/17/lead-petrol-more-deadly-than-we-thought-brexit-bring-it-back","fields":{"headline":"Lead is even deadlier than we feared as the full extent of its toxic effects are revealed","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Looking back, it seems insane. Bluntly put, we took a known poison and – for three quarters of a century – used it in machines that puffed it out in breathable form. Then we drove them millions of miles a day, all over the world, regularly dosing billions of people with the toxin. Now the full effects of using lead in petrol – surely the greatest ever mass poisoning experiment – are becoming clear, almost exactly 35 years after an award-winning Observer campaign caused it to be banned in Britain. They seem far worse than anyone imagined, and provide a stark warning against cutting pollution standards after Brexit. Last week, a massive new study concluded that lead is 10 times more dangerous than thought, and that past exposure now hastens one in every five US deaths. A similar effect is expected in Britain and other industrialised countries. The study, published in the Lancet Public Health journal and believed to be the first to research the effects of low levels of lead exposure on the general public, also concludes there is no safe level of the toxic metal: people with the lowest detectable amounts were still affected. Researchers at four North American universities, led by Bruce Lanphear, of Simon Fraser University in Vancouver, studied the fate of 14,289 people whose blood had been tested in an official US survey between 1988 and 1994. Four fifths of them had harboured levels of the toxic metal below what has, hitherto, been thought safe. The study found that deaths, especially from cardiovascular disease, increased markedly with exposure, even at the lowest levels. It concluded that lead kills 412,000 people a year – accounting for 18% of all US mortality, not much less than the 483,000 who perish as a result of smoking. Philip Landrigan, of New York’s Mount Sinai School of Medicine, possibly the world’s top expert on pollution’s effect on health, endorses the study and Alastair Hay, an expert on lead from Leeds University, calls it “very well done”. He adds that, since blood lead levels in the UK were similar, there could be much the same effect as in the US. Of course, we suspected none of this when this newspaper campaigned against lead back in the early 1980s. We pressed for a ban because of increasing evidence – dismissed by the scientific establishment – that low levels of the toxic metal were damaging children’s brains, lowering IQ and increasing disruptive behaviour. The danger of high lead levels has been known at least since the second century BC, when the Greek physician, Discorides, noted that it made “the mind give way”. Some historians even believe that lead-lined wine vats helped cause the decline of the Roman empire. An especially nasty form of the metal, tetraethyl lead, was first put in petrol to prevent car engines “knocking” in 1922. By the early 1970s, more than 100,000 tons of it were put into American vehicles alone each year. By then, a lone scientist, Derek Bryce-Smith, of Reading University, had begun to campaign against it. He would say that he had first been alerted to the dangers when, as a young man, he had asked the manufacturers for a sample of tetraethyl lead for an experiment and was warned that “if I got any on my finger it would drive me mad or kill me”. He was ridiculed and marginalised by other scientists. Slowly, however, people took up the cause, most notably a Wimbledon housewife, Jill Runnette, who ran a campaign that – against all the odds and entrenched scientific opinion – succeeded in persuading ministers to reduce its level in petrol by two thirds in 1981. Her hand was strengthened by a meticulous US study that showed conclusively that lead knocked several points off children’s IQ. Yet, even before it was published, four leading British authorities circulated a paper attacking it. And the study’s author, Herbert Needleman, was twice investigated for scientific misconduct. He was vindicated but ministers still refused to act on lead until a UK study had come up with the same result. One told me that British children had to be shown to be affected as well as US ones – as if they were different species. The final blow was struck by a year-long public campaign led by the activist, Des Wilson, and – in April 1983 – the government finally announced that the use of the toxic metal would be phased out. Crucially, it did so on a precautionary basis. With leading scientists still resisting the evidence of effects on children, a royal commission advised that action should be taken, short of absolute proof, as there were enough grounds to suggest the danger was real. First, the rest of Europe, then almost every nation on Earth, followed, and levels in blood have fallen worldwide. It was not before time. Since then, low levels of lead have also been linked to high blood pressure, stroke, heart and kidney disease, ADHD and accelerated ageing. There is even good, if surprising, evidence that it increased juvenile crime: many studies have shown rates mirroring the rise and fall of lead in petrol. In 2002, the World Health Organisation called lead in petrol “a catastrophe for public health”. Worryingly, the “precautionary principle” that led to the phase-out, and is enshrined in EU law, is in danger from Brexit. Some industries and rightwing politicians have long campaigned against it, demanding much more evidence. So far at least, it has not been incorporated into withdrawal measures. On Thursday, the environment secretary, Michael Gove, promised at a conference organised by Prosperity UK to strengthen, rather than weaken, pollution controls on leaving the EU. But he failed to give a specific reassurance on the precautionary principle. This is important because undue delay kills. Absolute proof of damage comes from counting corpses. If Britain had waited for it before taking action on lead in petrol, this week’s alarming news would have been more devastating still."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"us-news/2018/mar/18/new-orleans-chef-food-experiment-black-white-pay-more","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-18T11:00:06Z","webTitle":"Should white people pay more for lunch?

New Orleans chef tests social experiment","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Imagine standing in a line for lunch. The customer in front you pays $12 for his food box but when you go to pay for the same product, the chef asks if you’re willing to shell out $30 instead. Why? Because you’re white. Would you pay? That was the premise of a social experiment mounted by New Orleans chef Tunde Wey in February. Much to his own surprise the answer was, for the most part, yes. Nearly 80% of white customers agreed to pay the inflated price for a pre-fixed Nigerian food box lunch at Wey’s Saartje food stand – after he explained that the request was meant to shine a light on New Orleans’ dramatic and widening income gap. “I wasn’t expecting it,” Wey said. “What was happening at the stall is that I represented a consequence – this personification of accountability.” Median net income for white families in New Orleans is more than $63,000. For black families, it is just below $26,000. Wey’s $18 food price gap was intended to approximate this earnings gap, which has been growing since cataclysmic flooding after Hurricane Katrina in 2005 radically reshaped the city. “First I introduce the facts and as a white person, you are now an antagonist in this framework,” Wey said. “But I offer you an easy out. You can pay $12 or you can pay $30. What are you going to do?” Wey offered to redistribute the extra money back to black patrons, the majority of whom did not take him up on the offer. Some, he said, asked if they could pay $30 too. Wey identified such reactions, and the willingness of whites to pay more, largely as a function of patrons’ demographics. The Roux Carre foodhall caters to a wealthier crowd. More than 44% of customers, white and black, told researchers they were in the “$65,000 and up” annual income bracket. Trends still emerged. For example, white patrons who decided to pay the $30 were more likely to be female: 91% of white women did so compared with just 55% of white men. “I don’t think it’s as difficult to talk to a woman and tell her, ‘There’s something about my personhood that I have nothing to do with and it’s affecting my income and affecting what I can achieve in life,’” said Anjali Prasertong, a nutritionist and writer who was enlisted by Wey to collect data. “Pretty much every woman has experienced that herself.” Wey said he thought the experiment may have been more effective at showing how people respond to social pressures than exposing feelings about income inequality. “Probably talking to him [made me decide to pay $30],” one white patron told researchers. “It made it more of a personal decision. I think it’s a little bit of both, and it’s a little bit of white guilt. I’m like, ‘Yeah, yeah, what else am I going to say? There’s not much!’” Still, the point of the experiment was not to redistribute wealth. It was to start a conversation. “This isn’t going to change the racial wealth disparities in the city,” Wey said. “It was meant to show, in principle, what the burden of cost looks like for people who have less resources.” Wey, who was born in Nigeria, said he was responding to the “Eurocentric perspective of popular food culture”. Inspired by the Black Lives Matter movement, he is planning to mount his next culinary social experiment in Detroit in late April."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/mar/18/little-baghdad-a-chance-to-mingle-with-war-traumatised-iraqi-refugees","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-17T23:50:34Z","webTitle":"Little Baghdad: a chance to break bread with Iraqi refugees fleeing war and trauma","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/18/little-baghdad-a-chance-to-mingle-with-war-traumatised-iraqi-refugees","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/mar/18/little-baghdad-a-chance-to-mingle-with-war-traumatised-iraqi-refugees","fields":{"headline":"Little Baghdad: a chance to break bread with Iraqi refugees fleeing war and trauma","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"When Najat Alkmamees was a housewife in Baghdad – looking after her husband, a teacher, and their children – she often spent time in her garden. She would tend to the chickens, a source of eggs and meat, and luxuriate among her plants and trees: hibiscus, pistachio, okra, aubergine. “I wouldn’t buy anything from outside,” she says. “I made everything from pickles to pastries.” That peaceful existence ended when Alkmamees, now 72, opened an envelope in the post. Inside was a bullet and a list of names, including her 18-year-old son. Scrawled on a note was two words: “Leave or otherwise.” Tragedy followed. In 2007, Alkmamees and her husband were viciously beaten by masked men in their home. That same year her son-in-law was kidnapped (presumed dead; his whereabouts remain unknown) and her brother-in-law murdered. Last year, her sister and nephew were gunned down in the street. Fleeing for their lives, the family scattered around the world. Alkmamees and two daughters found asylum in Australia; two other daughters went to Sweden; and her son ended up in America. With no right to travel, Alkmamees, now a widow, has not seen her children since they were separated. “Before my husband passed away, he asked me to look after our son,” she says, wiping away tears and banging her hand against her leg in frustration. A bright gold charm bracelet, decorated with tags bearing the names of each of her children, rattles. “What’s killing me now is that I cannot make this happen.” For all her pain (“I eat and cry, I sleep and cry”) Alkmamees has found some kind of sanctuary – in a community garden in Fairfield, western Sydney, where she lives. Unable to speak a word of English, she grows vegetables and fruits, and reaps the rewards, taking some home and selling others to make a few dollars. Alkmamees is one of several refugees who attend the Parents Café, a social enterprise located in the grounds of Fairfield high school. This weekend she will sing an Iraqi song as one of myriad performers at Little Baghdad: Cafes and Gardens, put on by Powerhouse Youth Theatre (PYT) Fairfield, the group behind Sydney Opera House parkour show Jump First, Ask Later and acclaimed Sydney festival show Tribunal. The evening, held on March 16-17 and 23-24, takes the form of an Iraqi dinner party. Guests are invited to sit down on Persian rugs in the garden, where they will be regaled with stories. Meanwhile, slam poets will perform in a mud hut (traditionally found in rural Iraq); homemade bread will be served hot out of the garden oven; and violinists will play. The night will end with the dabka, an Arab folk dance. “It’s about saying we have these stories but don’t feel sorry for us,” says the PYT Fairfield artistic director, Karen Therese, speaking during rehearsals. Performers, dressed in intricate gowns and elaborate gold headdresses sewn by women in the Parents Café, bang drums and stamp their feet, laughing. Therese wants to engineer conversations: to allow Sydneysiders to meet refugees and to show them they are valued despite negative coverage. “Politicians get up on TV and say: ‘We don’t want refugees!’” bemoans Therese. “A lot of refugees won’t interact with other Australians because they think that [Australians] won’t like them and they don’t want them here.” Food, she adds, is a “strategy” to get people together. “It’s about coming to have a cup of tea with a stranger and understanding a culture [while] bringing down those boundaries and fear of the unknown.” Critically, the substantial Iraqi immigrant population in Fairfield (which is sometimes known as Little Bagdad) will make up a percentage of the audience, too. Meanwhile, the entertainment dished up alongside the tabbouleh, falafel and baklava will mix the traditional with the contemporary in the form of urban poetry and art. As co-curator Jiva Parthipan puts it, “it’s a shared space”. Hanging over the evening, however, is a sense of urgency: launched in 2010, the Parents Café – which has been celebrated by the United Nations high commissioner for refugees as a role model for settlement – is now facing closure. If founder and manager Haitham Jaju cannot find an extra $150,000 in funding it will have to shut down in the next three months. Termination letters have already been handed to staff. A crowdfunding campaign has been launched. For those who rely on it, closure spells disaster. Confusingly, the Parents Café is not a real café (although Iraqis do come to chew the fat and drink tea). Its main purpose is community building and education for newly arrived adults from war-torn countries: as well as the garden, a commercial kitchen and thriving catering business, workshops are offered in everything from English language to sewing and computer skills. Jaju, 51, a former Iraqi diplomat who sought asylum with his wife and three children in 2006, knows what it is like to arrive in a new country with nothing. A government envoy at home, here he worked the nightshift at Woolworths stacking shelves. Founding the Parents Café was a way to reduce a sense of profound isolation. “Refugee women who don’t speak English can’t just go out and get a bus – [even the smallest of tasks are] profoundly complicated,” explains Therese. “So bringing them into a group where they feel safe, rather than sitting at home below the poverty line, is important. They couldn’t call it ‘women’s support service’ as they wouldn’t come – they’re very proud people. So they said, let’s call it a café. And all the women came.” Locating the Parents Cafe in a school was also a deliberate move: while refugees wouldn’t necessarily trust other organisations “they know what a school is,” says Jaju. “There is a familiarity.” And while children find it easier to assimilate, their parents are often left behind. No-nonsense Iraqi immigrant Layla Naji, who will play the role of narrator during Little Baghdad: Cafes and Gardens and works in disability employment, insists that the Parents Café is “a way of life, a way of work, a way of income. People are traumatised from war: it’s a way of getting away from your depression, your anxiety. We are trying to change people’s lives.” Alkmamees still feels far away from her family. But: “I am so thankful to God and to Australia because now I am here.” Fairfield may not be Iraq, and the Parents Café garden may not be filled with the pomegranate trees of her home in Baghdad. Yet at least “I have activities to fill my days with”. As she says: “I love the garden as if it is my temple.” • Little Baghdad: Cafes and Gardens is at the Parents Café at at Fairfield High School, Sydney, from 16 to 24 March"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/mar/17/england-ireland-six-nations-match-report","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-17T16:50:39Z","webTitle":"Ireland seal grand slam with storming win over England in Six Nations finale","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/mar/17/england-ireland-six-nations-match-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/mar/17/england-ireland-six-nations-match-report","fields":{"headline":"Ireland seal grand slam with storming win over England in Six Nations finale","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Beware the slides of March. England’s descent continued with a third successive defeat in the sleet as Ireland achieved a third grand slam and their third title in five years. It was the home side’s first defeat here since the 2015 World Cup and their first at home in the Six Nations for six years. They were a distinct second in every aspect of the game. A hat-trick of defeats on the day of St Patrick beckoned at half-time for an England side that was changed in personnel rather than tempo. Ireland led 21-5 and were on course to trump their biggest win here, by 13 points in 1964. Only France, in 1981, had won the grand slam at the home of English rugby but the champions played as if they were the home side, on the front foot from the off. They had the benefit of the reviews for their first and third tries. Rob Kearney appeared to knock the ball on five minutes in in a challenge with Anthony Watson before Garry Ringrose grounded it. Jacob Stockdale completed the opening period by taking Conor Murray’s slick pass, kicking into England’s 22 and overtaking Mike Brown before kneeing the ball over the line and touching it down just before it went dead to set a new record of seven tries in a Six Nations campaign. There was a suggestion the ball had brushed his hand but the try was allowed. England had the benefit of reviews in their victories over Australia and Wales this season and the tries were a reflection of the superiority of Ireland, who were clinically accurate. Much had been made in the build-up about England’s indiscipline at the breakdown this tournament: they only conceded one penalty after a tackle in the opening period, when Kyle Sinckler failed to support his body weight, but their problems had largely been when they were in possession and Ireland had most of the ball. So much so that the Ireland No 8 CJ Stander carried the ball for the same distance as England’s eight forwards combined in the first half: 32m. Some of them were made for Ireland’s second try after 23 minutes when they worked a move from a line-out, the hands of the prop Tadhg Furlong freeing Bundee Aki who feinted to pass outside him before freeing Stander who took two tacklers with him to the line before touching the ball down on a post. A year ago, Ireland were motivated by denying England the grand slam in Dublin, which they did for the third time in the Six Nations, but a team defending a six-year unbeaten ground record in the tournament against the side that had seized its championship crown was unable to match the intensity or precision of a side that throughout the tournament has played to its strengths. Ireland’s first try summed them up. They won a penalty in their own 22 when Owen Farrell tackled Rob Kearney marginally late, kicked to touch, won the line-out and established a position from where Jonathan Sexton tested Watson at full-back with an angled high-kick towards England’s line. As the full-back tracked the ball’s descent, he ended up facing the wrong way and missed the ball under Kearney’s challenge. He could only watch as it bobbled over the line and Ringrose reacted quicker than anyone else. Ireland were a step ahead throughout. England found a foothold in the game after Peter O’Mahony was sent to the sin-bin for collapsing a maul, Elliot Daly the first to reach Farrell’s chip, and Bundee Aki was fortunate to avoid a yellow card for a high challenge on Daly, but as soon as Ireland were back to their full complement they scored their third try through Stockdale after Murray held the defence and freed the wing with a disguised pass. The former Ireland coach Matt Williams last week dismissed his former side as boring, but that said more about him than the champions. England have not suddenly become an awful side, but they were made to look not so much ordinary here as peripheral. The home side saw more of the ball in the second period and Daly’s second try on 24 minutes, which followed Conor Murray’s penalty, saw a narrow defence exploited through Mike Brown’s pass out of the back of his left hand. Brown was on the field for Watson, who rolled his left ankle in the opening half, and Danny Care provided a brief uplift from the bench, but the more England attacked, the more they highlighted how they lacked the accuracy of their opponents and the collective understanding. They finally scored a third try through Jonny May with the final move of the match to deny Ireland a record victory here, but the men in green were already celebrating something far more significant."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/2018/mar/18/daniel-ricciardo-f1-title-red-bull-lewis-hamilton-sebastian-vettel","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-18T08:01:25Z","webTitle":"Daniel Ricciardo: ‘Being in the F1 title fight is the minimum I would ask’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/mar/18/daniel-ricciardo-f1-title-red-bull-lewis-hamilton-sebastian-vettel","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/mar/18/daniel-ricciardo-f1-title-red-bull-lewis-hamilton-sebastian-vettel","fields":{"headline":"Daniel Ricciardo: ‘Being in the F1 title fight is the minimum I would ask’","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Always suffused with conjecture and supposition, Formula One’s phoney war will end with the firing of engines in earnest at the Australian Grand Prix next Sunday. Expectations are it will herald another battle between Lewis Hamilton and Sebastian Vettel. Daniel Ricciardo, however, has other ideas – this is a fight the local boy desperately wants to join. The Australian has a point to prove and a combative hunger coupled with confidence he is reaching his peak. If Red Bull can give him the competitive car he desires, Ricciardo will be gunning for both world champions. Hamilton and Vettel are the headline acts after their close scrap last season and both look to be in shape to repeat the struggle. Mercedes are ominously strong and Ferrari have carried their well-balanced car into 2018. But Red Bull, out of contention last season, have taken a major step. Testing suggested they may even have the edge on the Scuderia and Ricciardo is looking to enter a title contest for the first time. Given the chance to do so, the decisive and sometimes breathtaking overtaker is unequivocal his approach on track will stand him in good stead. “In the end you have to just pull the trigger,” he says. “Trust the car, trust the brakes, just go. It is a calculated but fearless approach – I am going to try and if it doesn’t work, it doesn’t work. I will be happier if I crash by trying than not trying and running around behind the same guy for 70 laps.” It is an attitude Ricciardo has displayed before, proving he has no fear of Hamilton or Vettel. His attempted pass on the German at Mexico in 2016 was extraordinary and he was relentless in not giving up when the two fought at China last year. He was ruthless passing Hamilton at Hungary in 2014. Another world champion, Fernando Alonso, fell to his decisive style in the same race. Last season at Baku, a gutsy and audacious late-braking manoeuvre on the Williams of Lance Stroll and Felipe Massa and the Renault of Nico Hülkenberg saw him move up three places and was named overtake of the year. It was matched, however, by a similar lunge on the anchors from eight-tenths back at Monza to claim Kimi Räikkönen’s scalp at turn one. That he has the chops is not in doubt and he has consequently proved to be one of the most entertaining drivers. Yet Ricciardo has yet to enjoy a shot at the title. Now 28, he joined Red Bull in 2014, the start of the turbo-hybrid era and Mercedes dominance. With their Renault engine lacking the power of the Mercedes, Red Bull have been unable to put themselves in contention. It does not sit well with Ricciardo. The image may be that of the beaming Aussie but behind the grin there is steel, driven by ambition. “I still want to fight for that title,” he says. “Wanting it is one thing but just being in the fight is the minimum I would ask.” The team principal, Christian Horner, recognises that desire and that his driver is ready. “He is in that period of his career where he is in the purple sector,” Horner said. “Hopefully we can provide the car to realise his potential.” Now in his eighth season in F1, Ricciardo, too, believes his time has come. “I am in a window now where I still feel young enough to have the fearless approach, but old enough in terms of experience so that over a championship if I had the car, I could win when I could and take points when I could. In a fight I believe I have the tools to win. I believe I can get it done with the right material.” Should Red Bull deliver, he will also have to contend with the formidable talent of his team-mate Max Verstappen, who will offer as stern a challenge as Hamilton and Vettel. Horner says they have a genuine friendship but Ricciardo knows he can give no quarter to the young Dutchman. After Verstappen put him out in Budapest last year he was furious. “I wanted to wait until Max came round so I could give him the bird,” he says. “I wanted to do more. I wanted to throw my helmet at him.” It is indicative of a side of Ricciardo overshadowed by the boyish enthusiasm on show when drinking champagne from his boot on the podium. But he believes there is no sense he can be a pushover and that his contemporaries recognise this. “The reality is it was always in me,” he says. “The intensity and the fight I have shown was always in me.” When the new season begins, nothing would be better than if Melbourne raises the curtain on a three-team title fight. Hamilton, Vettel and Verstappen would revel in it and Ricciardo, who has been waiting some time for his chance to pull the trigger in that battle, has all three in his sights. “I know what I can do in the car,” he says, still beaming with optimism. “And even if there is a 10% possibility then I am going to do it.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/mar/16/gina-haspel-cia-torture-vincent-warren","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-16T22:41:13Z","webTitle":"Gina Haspel should be arrested – not put in charge of the CIA | Vincent Warren","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/16/gina-haspel-cia-torture-vincent-warren","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/16/gina-haspel-cia-torture-vincent-warren","fields":{"headline":"Gina Haspel should be arrested – not put in charge of the CIA","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"We’re on the brink of a full-throttled return to officially sanctioned US torture. Our impulsive president has said he wants to bring back waterboarding “and a hell of a lot worse” and has now named Gina Haspel as the new CIA chief. Haspel personally oversaw torture at a CIA black site in Thailand, and she even seemed to relish the role. Haspel also oversaw George W Bush’s rendition to torture program and, unsurprisingly, many in the intelligence community that are connected to the US torture program are now leaping to her defense, saying that she shouldn’t be penalized now for just following orders back then. Former CIA Director John Brennan, who supported rendition to torture and famously said, “we do have to take the gloves off in some areas,” this week vouched for Haspel’s “integrity” and told an interviewer, “don’t forget that the detention-interrogation program was authorized by the president of the United States and deemed lawful by the Department of Justice.” Former CIA chief General Michael Hayden said in defense of Haspel, that she did “simply everything that the agency, the agency’s directors and the nation asked her to do.” While it is certainly not unusual for people who’ve overseen and participated in crimes against humanity like torture and genocide to be recast by their supporters as dutiful public servants, there are, in addition, two deeply disturbing trends – one old, one new – embedded both in the naming of Haspel to the position and her defenders’ characterizations of her. Torture is illegal under US and international law in all circumstances, and human rights organizations like mine have been strongly pushing for those who ordered or committed torture after 9/11 – including the president – to be held accountable in US and international courts. Yet Haspel’s defenders are loathe to admit that the practice she participated in was concerning, much less illegal. So defending Haspel as a duty-bound functionary when it comes to torture but a vibrant leader with great integrity when it comes to everything else seeks to erase the illegality and the depravity of the practice of torture as well as the well-deserved disgrace that must always travel with those who have practiced it. But beyond that, there is another, more current problem, and that is the president himself. Trump, who is lining up with authoritarian rulers and tin-pot dictators around the world, has no use for the rule of law. He is impulsive, reckless, and astonishingly self-focused. A very healthy subset of high-level White House staff have been running for the exits when he’s not looking, precisely because they recognize that he demands fealty to whim rather than to the national good. He is known for firing people because they contradict his social media exhortations. Given that our nation is being run by Donald J Trump, at least for the time being, the very last thing we need is a CIA chief who dutifully implements everything that this president authorizes. In fact, we need the exact opposite. Someone who opposes torture, doesn’t have running a torture program on their resume, and who will say no to the president when, as seems to be the case daily, he gets an urge to make his mark on the news cycle. It is true that people who say no to Donald Trump don’t stay in their jobs for long regardless of whether they’re seen as enablers or stabilizing forces in his administration. But when it comes to dutiful public servants in the Trump administration, history will look kindly upon those who said no and were fired and those who said no and left under their own steam. The unsung heroes of the age will be those who said no to a Trump administration job offer in the first place. But Gina Haspel will not be in that number because of her horrific record. The Center for Constitutional Rights recently submitted a filing with the International Criminal Court that brought Haspel to their attention. We wanted to highlight her impunity for torture and the heightened risk for a return to torture given her position as deputy CIA director. Impunity breeds repetition. We will be following up with The Hague. Meanwhile, the European Center for Constitutional and Human Rights has called for her arrest in connection with a German investigation into US torture under Bush. For those who were tortured in the CIA program she oversaw, that harm is remains present today. They are still at Guantanamo and have had no justice, no care, and no redress. Gina Haspel should be arrested, not promoted, and the Senate, if it has a single shred of respect left for the law, should not confirm her.

Senior UK and EU officials are due to meet this weekend in Brussels, ahead of an EU27 Brexit summit on Friday, when Theresa May hopes to bag the transition deal that British business demands. But firms will be denied certainty on the transition deal, as EU sources stress the best the UK can get in March is a political text, not a legally binding treaty giving cast-iron security for companies across Europe. EU negotiators “will make it crystal clear that this agreement on transition is only a political agreement”, a senior source told the Guardian. But even that is on a knife edge. While optimism has risen in recent days, British negotiators will be told they need to move closer to the EU’s insurance option for avoiding a hard border on the island of Ireland - a proposal that is anathema to the Democratic Unionist party, which is propping up Theresa May’s government. “The whole agreement on the withdrawal will be contingent on a solution on Ireland,” the source said. “And it is politically unthinkable that we would wrap up everything and that you wouldn’t have a solution on the Irish border. The Irish would never accept it, but also the rest of the union will not accept it, because it would be toying with the integrity of the single market.” A second diplomat said he was “cautiously optimistic” that EU leaders would sign off the transition, but warned the deal could unravel in the autumn without agreement on Ireland and the rest of the UK divorce treaty. “You could agree on transition parts, but it is still not the withdrawal agreement.” The EU has outlined three options for avoiding a hard border: a deep free-trade agreement with the UK; “specific solutions” that depend heavily on technology; or, failing both of those, Northern Ireland remaining in “full regulatory alignment” with the EU. That third option would put the EU-Irish border in the Irish Sea and is toxic for the DUP, while May has said no British prime minister could ever agree to it. Ireland, backed by some of the EU’s most senior leaders, is insisting the UK spells out its commitment to the insurance plan sooner rather than later, while stressing the first two options remain on the table as part of a future trade deal. Sources close to the talks say it is too early to predict how the timing will work, ahead of a flurry of meetings next week. The Brexit secretary, David Davis, is expected to meet the EU’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, in Brussels on Monday. EU ministers - without the UK - will assess British progress on Tuesday before handing the baton to leaders at the end of the week. The president of the European council, Donald Tusk, said last week that London could not assume negotiations would move on to other issues without solving the issue. If that happened, “my response would be Ireland first”. In Brussels, that is being interpreted as a clear political message and has created varying levels of optimism about a transition deal. Germany’s Brexit envoy, Peter Ptassek, tweeted this week that “a lot of progress” was being made on the UK’s withdrawal agreement. “Stay tuned.” Other sources stress there is still a long way to go, with the Irish parts of the text still coloured red on an EU internal traffic light grid, rather than amber, which may allow talks to progress. The content of the transition is less fraught for negotiators. EU diplomats expect the UK to accept the transition on the EU’s terms, meaning Britain would obey all EU rules with little or minimal say in the institutions. Separately, a committee of MPs is set to warn in a report in Sunday that Britain is so unprepared for Brexit that it should consider postponing the UK’s leaving date. The Commons Brexit select committee is set to recommend that May should request an extension to the EU’s article 50 process beyond next March, the HuffPost reported. Any extension of Brexit talks would have to be agreed unanimously by all 27 EU countries. Diplomats have indicated they would be open to rolling over negotiations for a few weeks, but a longer extension could run into problems. Several member states, especially France, and the European parliament, which will approve the final withdrawal agreement, have stressed that the UK should be out of the EU before the next European elections, due in May 2019."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2018/mar/18/billion-dollar-polar-geoengineering-to-slow-melting-glaciers-global-flooding","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-18T00:05:37Z","webTitle":"Billion-dollar polar engineering ‘needed to slow melting glaciers’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/mar/18/billion-dollar-polar-geoengineering-to-slow-melting-glaciers-global-flooding","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/mar/18/billion-dollar-polar-geoengineering-to-slow-melting-glaciers-global-flooding","fields":{"headline":"Billion-dollar polar engineering ‘needed to slow melting glaciers’","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Scientists have outlined plans to build a series of mammoth engineering projects in Greenland and Antarctica to help slow down the disintegration of the planet’s main glaciers. The controversial proposals include underwater walls, artificial islands and huge pumping stations that would channel cold water into the bases of glaciers to stop them from melting and sliding into the sea. The researchers say the work – costing tens of billions of dollars a time – is urgently needed to prevent polar glaciers melting and raising sea levels. That would lead to major inundations of low-lying, densely populated areas, such as parts of Bangladesh, Japan and the Netherlands. Flooding in these areas is likely to cost tens of trillions of dollars a year if global warming continues at its present rate, and vast sea-wall defences will need to be built to limit the devastation. Such costs make glacier engineering in polar regions a competitive alternative, according to the team, which is led by John Moore, professor of climate change at the University of Lapland. “We think that geoengineering of glaciers could delay much of Greenland and Antarctica’s grounded ice from reaching the sea for centuries, buying time to address global warming,” the scientists write in the current issue of Nature. “Geoengineering of glaciers has received little attention in journals. Most people assume that it is unfeasible and environmentally undesirable. We disagree.” Ideas put forward by the group specifically target the ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctic because these will contribute more to sea rise this century than any other source, they say. Their proposals include: • Building a 100-metre high wall on the seabed across a 5km wide fjord at the end of the Jakobshavn glacier in western Greenland. This would reduce influxes of warming sea water which are eroding the glacier’s base; • Constructing artificial islands in front of glaciers in Antarctica in order to buttress them and limit their collapse as their ice melts due to global warming; • Circulating cooled brine underneath glaciers such as the Pine Island glacier in Antarctica – in order to prevent their bases from melting and sliding towards the sea. In each case, the team – which includes scientists in Finland and the US – acknowledges that costs would be in the billions. Construction is also likely to cause considerable disruption. For example, building a dam across the Jakobshavn fjord could affect ecology, fisheries and tourism, and large numbers of workers would have to be shipped in to complete the project. Similarly, building artificial islands in front of glaciers would mean importing about six cubic kilometres of material, a task that would be immensely difficult in stormy Antarctic waters. And drilling through ice that is kilometres thick to pump down cooled water would also stretch the capabilities of engineers. However, the team insists that such projects should be carefully assessed now as the likely costs appear to be compatible with those of other large energy and civil engineering works being planned across the globe. The issue is simple, they state: should we spend vast sums to wall off all the world’s coasts, or can we address the problem at its source? “Potential risks, especially to local ecosystems, need careful analysis,” they conclude. “In our view, however, the greatest risk is doing nothing.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/mar/18/football-politics-commerce-reflects-our-society","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-18T06:00:09Z","webTitle":"The beautiful game is beginning to reflect all that is ugly in society | David Goldblatt","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/18/football-politics-commerce-reflects-our-society","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/18/football-politics-commerce-reflects-our-society","fields":{"headline":"A glorious distraction no more, the beautiful game is turning ugly","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"On 27 June 2016, four days after the EU referendum, England were beaten 2-1 by Iceland in the knockout stages of the European football championships. It was a remarkable display of collective paralysis and the corrosive consequences of fear. Nearly two years later, the country does not appear dissimilar: less than the sum of its parts, bereft of a guiding collective philosophy, close to humiliation and going out of Europe. Fortunate as we are to have such an accurate avatar of our lives, it makes me wonder whether football’s uncanny capacity to reflect our social identities and collective moods is also a curse. Many of us, myself included, still look to football as an entertainment, a glorious illusion, a soap opera of distraction. Even though we all know that the spectacle is deformed by the worlds of commerce and politics, we still want to disappear into the zone of play, pleasure and irrelevance: at the game, on the screen, lost in our noisy Twitter feeds. But this season, reality just keeps on intruding, and I don’t want to look. Sometimes, it’s just the parallels that strike one. The domination by Manchester City (owner: Abu Dhabi’s Sheikh Mansour) of the Premier League displays the same brazen invulnerability of the global super-rich; we keep watching, as with poverty-porn shows, to see who among the poor and vulnerable will be dispatched. More seriously, the exposure of football’s appalling record on safeguarding and the widespread incidence of sexual abuse in the game, is just one gruesome version of the same tale told across innumerable institutions. As the legal cases resulting from the Hillsborough inquiry drag on, almost 29 years since the tragedy, one wonders how the victims of the Grenfell Tower disaster must rate their chances of truth and justice. In the last couple of weeks, the real world has been more tangibly present. Consider just these three incidents. The foreign secretary, in response to the nerve agent attacks in Salisbury, has declared a dignitary boycott of the World Cup and others have followed his lead by calling for a sporting boycott. Martin Glenn, chief executive of the FA, in a wearily familiar cycle of unreflective discriminatory statements followed by clumsy apologies, equated the swastika with the Star of David before rushing off to clarify things. The owners of West Ham United, in the middle of the team’s thrashing by Burnley, were forced to leave their seats at the Olympic stadium when faced with a very angry fan protest on and off the pitch. One could read the foreign secretary’s seeming enthusiasm for a World Cup boycott as a welcome recognition of the intertwining of sport, politics and human rights; a backhanded apology by the Conservatives to the sporting politics of the anti-apartheid movement, which they so venomously opposed. It is, in fact, just an expression of Britain’s international weakness, an indicator of how few diplomatic and political options we have. The sporting equivalent of our schoolboy secretary of defence telling the Russian state to “shut up!” and “go away!” It also highlights our hypocrisy. We may not be sending the House of Windsor to Russia but we will, no doubt, continue to welcome the Russian money that has come into our football (at Chelsea, Bournemouth and Arsenal for example) and that we have laundered through the City. Glenn has been here before. Last October, he received a four-hour grilling from the digital, culture, media and sport committee reviewing his and the FA’s pathetic handling of a discrimination case against Eni Aluko, a striker for the England women’s team. The interrogation revealed deep and institutionalised forms of sexism and racism in the FA. In government and in football, as in so many areas of our lives, we continue to allocate power from this narrow stratum of the mediocre and the over-promoted, and let them degenerate into bullies. Meanwhile, the situation at West Ham is just one of dozens of conflicts between fans and owners. However, what gives it real edge and momentum is that the move from the club’s old East End stadium – sold off for high-end housing – to the Olympic stadium (a £200m subsidy to West Ham Plc) has been an emotional and experiential disaster: soulless, fragmented, deracinated and anodyne. In the absence of any kind of real voice, and with the option of exit blocked by emotional loyalties, a part of the fan base has turned to intimidation and riot. There are other options, but in such a rigged system as English football, there are no guarantees of success. Dulwich Hamlet, in south London, is an exemplar of a modern, rejuvenated community club – open, super-diverse and a lot of fun. Yet it has been forced from its home by developers. Last year, Millwall almost lost its stadium to an insidious and socially destructive development plan hatched by the local Labour council. Blackpool’s organised fans have had to conduct an arduous long-term boycott of the club to remove the Oyston family who took the club to the Premier League, only to asset-strip it back down to the bottom as they enriched themselves and insulted the supporters. Today, as they do every Sunday, Fans Supporting Foodbanks and the Wirral Deen Muslim centre will be the only people feeding the homeless on the entire Wirral peninsula. Fans Supporting Foodbanks was founded as a joint venture by the Everton and Liverpool supporters trusts. They collect donations at every home game in the city. The idea has spread to more than a dozen other clubs. Their work reminds us of the game’s amazing capacity to mobilise empathy, solidarity and love. Yet the fact that they have to be responsible for a quarter of the city’s food bank supplies is shattering. I can accept the strange melancholy of watching the best and most exhilarating Spurs team of my life, knowing that they can’t win the league. I have processed the fact that I have paid to watch, in the freezing cold, a reliably disappointing Bristol Rovers, now the plaything of Jordanian carpetbaggers. These require illusions I can sustain. However, the idea that I have tried to hold on to, that the best of English football and the society it so closely tracks, outweigh the worst of both, is unlikely to make it to the end of the season.
